DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Or, is it Tierney?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Galena. Tierney is perfectly fine, thank you.
DOCTOR: Right, Tierney. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, to be quite frank, I requested a test for HIV. It’s… a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I wanted to get it checked. I’d rather know, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. There’s no embarrassment at all. It’s very responsible of you to get tested, and many people request it for the same reasons. It’s better to know, as you said. Now, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: It’s… a long story. My husband and I, we’ve been married for a very long time, over forty years now. And recently… well, recently he confessed to something that happened quite a while back, before we were married. Something that puts me at risk, potentially. I don’t want to go into too much detail, if you don't mind. It’s just… it’s been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Tierney. You don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Knowing the potential exposure is helpful, though. And it’s good you’re taking this seriously. Just to be clear, and for my records, this happened before your marriage?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Quite a long time before our marriage. He was… young, and made a mistake. He’s deeply regretful, and only told me recently because he felt so guilty about it. I just want to be sure, for both our sakes.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we’re talking about a potential exposure many years ago. Do you recall roughly when this happened, even a ballpark estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's the difficult part, isn't it? He wasn't very specific. He said it was… sometime in the early 1980s, I believe. Perhaps 1982 or 1983. He was traveling for work, and… well, that’s all he would say. It was a long time ago, and he didn't want to relive it, I suppose. It's a bit hazy for both of us, honestly. Would knowing the exact date change anything significantly?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to have a timeframe, and early 1980s is a start. It does help with understanding the risk, as testing has evolved significantly over the years. Now, have you had any symptoms that have concerned you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s what’s so strange. I feel perfectly fine. No fever, no unusual tiredness, no weight loss… nothing at all. That’s why I’m almost embarrassed to be here. It seems silly to worry about something when I feel completely healthy. But I keep thinking about it, and I’d rather be safe than sorry, you understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tierney. Feeling healthy doesn't rule anything out. Many people with HIV don't experience symptoms for a long time, especially early on. It's very responsible of you to get tested, even without symptoms. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you ever had a blood transfusion or shared needles with anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. I've never needed a transfusion, and I certainly wouldn't share needles with anyone. I’ve always been very careful about things like that. My husband and I… we both lead very quiet lives. We don’t take many risks.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we proceed with the test, I want to explain a bit about HIV testing. There are different types of tests, and sometimes a preliminary test needs to be confirmed with a more accurate one. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've had a few vaccinations over the years, but nothing caused any reaction. And please, do explain the different tests. I don't mind a preliminary test, as long as I understand what’s happening. I’m not very good with medical jargon, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Tierney. I'll keep it simple. There are a few different tests we can do. The most common initial test is an antibody test, done with a blood sample. It looks for antibodies your body makes to fight HIV. If that's positive, we'd need to do a confirmation test to be absolutely sure. There's also a test that looks for the virus itself, called a viral load test, but that’s usually done if someone has already tested positive with the antibody test. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that does make sense, thank you. So, the first test looks for the body’s reaction, and if that’s positive, then you look for the virus itself? It sounds… logical. I suppose the antibody test is the best place to start then, if that’s the most common. I’m ready whenever you are. Is it painful? I’m a bit nervous about needles, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, the antibody test is the best place to start. And it's perfectly normal to be nervous about needles. It's a very quick prick, and most people don't feel much pain at all. A small amount of blood will be drawn from your arm. We'll use a sterile needle, of course. If you'll have a seat, I’ll have the nurse come in and do the draw. It should only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Alright. A few minutes, you say? That doesn't sound too bad. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I just hope… I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Tierney. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible. It usually takes a few days. I'll have the nurse come in now, and she will explain the process. Nurse, could you please come in to room two?
PATIENT: .
