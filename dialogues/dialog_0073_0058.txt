DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s becoming…difficult, you know? And I heard about some medicines that might help. I’m Vicent, by the way, if that wasn’t clear from the chart.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the chart is quite clear, Mr. Osumi. Losing weight. Many people have that…concern. But simply wanting to lose weight isn’t quite a medical issue in itself, is it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. It’s more than just wanting, Doctor. It’s affecting…things. I used to enjoy my wood carving, but bending over, reaching…it’s getting harder with the extra weight. And my back…it’s been bothering me. My wife…she passed last year, and I’ve…not been taking care of myself as well as I should, I guess. It’s just…a lot harder now, doing things on my own.
DOCTOR: Right. So, we're looking at…weight gain secondary to lifestyle changes. Grief…yes, a common trigger. Tell me, Mr. Osumi, how long have you noticed this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…it’s been creeping up, really. But after my wife, Maria, passed…maybe six months or so? It felt like…everything just went downhill. I wasn’t hungry, then I was. And comfort food…well, it was comforting. I don’t know how much exactly, but it feels like a good twenty, maybe thirty pounds. More than I’ve ever carried, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thirty pounds. And has this weight gain been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Well, I get a bit winded walking up the stairs now, where I never used to. And my knees ache, especially when it’s cold. I also…I think I’m a little more tired than usual, but being my age…it’s hard to tell what’s normal and what’s not, you know? And I get warm easier, if that makes sense. Sweaty, even when it’s not that hot. Is that…important?
DOCTOR: Windedness, knee pain, fatigue, increased sweating. Alright. Do you have any history of heart or lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. My Maria…she always said I was as strong as an ox, until…well, you know. I always ate pretty well, mostly local fish and vegetables. Nothing fancy, never much processed food. Just…more of it lately, I suppose. And less moving around. I used to walk every morning with Maria, down by the coast. Now…it’s just quiet.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you tried any sort of diet or exercise regimen to address this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, bless your heart, Doctor. I tried. A little. My niece, she gave me one of those…meal replacement shakes. Tasted like chalk. Lasted about a week. And I started walking again, but…my knees. They just wouldn't cooperate. It’s hard to get motivated, you know? Especially on my own. Honestly, that’s why I was hoping…maybe some medicine could give me a little boost.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Maria always handled the medicine, you see. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. We weren’t really the type to take much, unless we were truly sick. Just…a little aspirin for a headache now and then. Are you checking to see if I'm a good candidate for one of those weight loss pills then? Because frankly, I'm a little worried about side effects. Maria always said…be careful what you wish for.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Osumi, we're assessing whether medication might be an appropriate option. And your concern about side effects is perfectly valid. Before we proceed, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not since Maria…passed. She always made sure I went. It’s been…well, I haven’t really been thinking about myself, if I’m honest. I know I should, but it just…slipped my mind. Everything’s been a bit of a blur. Would I need to get one done? I don’t want to waste your time if it’s not necessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Osumi, a recent physical is absolutely necessary before considering any medication. It's basic medical protocol. We need a baseline to assess your cardiovascular health, blood sugar levels, and so forth. We can do one here today. It will be…brief. Let's start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If that’s what needs to be done. I suppose I should have thought of that. Just…try to be quick, alright? I’ve got a bit of carving I was hoping to get back to this afternoon. It’s a small one, a turtle for my grandniece, but…it’s something. It keeps my hands busy.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Not ideal. And your pulse is…irregular. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I always had a strong heart, Maria always said… I hope it still is. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: There's a slight murmur. And your breathing…a little wheezy. I'm going to order an EKG and a chest x-ray, Mr. Osumi. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues before even thinking about weight loss medication. It would be irresponsible of me to do otherwise. We'll get these tests done right away. And I'm referring you to a cardiologist for a full evaluation. This is not something we can simply brush aside.
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? I just wanted to lose a little weight…I didn’t want…all this. Is it…serious, Doctor? Could it be my heart?
DOCTOR: Mr. Osumi, I’m not going to speculate. These tests are simply precautionary. There could be a simple explanation. But we need to be thorough. It’s better to know for certain. Here is the referral to Dr. Ramirez, a very reputable cardiologist. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. And the lab technician will come in shortly to draw blood for the preliminary tests. Until we have the results, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity. And absolutely no weight loss medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No strenuous activity…no medication. Just…tests. It’s a bit much, isn’t it? All because I wanted to lose a few pounds. Well…thank you, Doctor. For…being thorough. I suppose that’s what matters. I’ll…wait for the tests then. When should I expect to hear back?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within 48 hours. Dr. Ramirez's office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Osumi?
