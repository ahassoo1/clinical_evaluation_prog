DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, yes, a pleasure, I suppose. Look, I haven't got all day. My wife insisted I come. Something about my… complexion? And feeling rather tired, always tired these days. Honestly, it’s probably just old age. I’ve been a reinforcing iron worker for… well, a very long time. A very, very long time. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand. While old age certainly plays a role, it's good you're here. It's important to rule out any underlying causes for fatigue and changes in your complexion. “Changes in complexion” is rather vague, Mr. Drahota. Could you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast, let alone the precise shade of my skin last Tuesday. It’s… darker, I suppose. Not sickly, just… less bright. My wife keeps saying I look “washed out.” She worries too much. It’s just the sun, probably. And hard work. Though, I suppose it has been worse lately. Is that sufficient? Really, I haven’t the time for a detailed analysis of my epidermis.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your… directness, Mr. Drahota. "Less bright" is helpful, thank you. And while I understand your reluctance, a little more detail does help me determine the cause. Has this change in skin tone been gradual, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I believe. Though, everything feels gradual at my age, doesn't it? It wasn’t a sudden shock, if that’s what you’re asking. One day I simply… noticed it wasn’t as vibrant. My wife noticed first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. Now, if you don’t mind, Doctor, perhaps we could expedite this process? I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed. You mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It's… tiring. I get tired easily. Even simple things, like walking to the shops. Or… well, sitting, sometimes. It used to be I could work a full day, come home and still have energy. Now? I need a nap. A very long nap. And then another one. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite bothersome. But I’ve always been a strong worker. Perhaps I’m simply… slowing down. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And I assure you, Mr. Drahota, I’m not simply looking for a particular answer. It’s important to understand the full picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and changes in your complexion?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. Not that I require a great deal of food these days. And… now that you mention it, I suppose I’ve been feeling a bit… weak. Not debilitatingly so, just… a general lack of strength. It’s difficult to explain. Everything feels… heavier. And I occasionally get a bit of a… shortness of breath, when I exert myself. Though that could just be the stairs. We live on the third floor, you see. A dreadful mistake, in retrospect. Now, are we getting anywhere, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Drahota, you are being very helpful, even if you don’t think so. This information is quite useful. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t felt particularly warm or cold. Night sweats… my wife would have noticed, she’s very observant. And weight loss? I haven’t been weighing myself, and frankly, I’m not concerned about putting on weight. I’ve always been… solidly built. Perhaps I’ve lost a little, but nothing significant. Really, Doctor, I’m a simple man. I work hard, I eat, I sleep… or I try to sleep. This is becoming rather tedious, don't you think? Are you going to poke and prod me now?
DOCTOR: A brief physical exam is necessary, Mr. Drahota, to gather more information. It will be quite straightforward, I assure you. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your skin. It will only take a few moments. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with. But be quick about it, Doctor. And please, no unnecessary probing. I’ve lived a long life, and I’d rather not spend the remainder of it being examined by strangers. Just… do what you must. And try not to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. If you could please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Breathing sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with mild crackles at the bases. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg. Skin is pale with some areas of bruising, especially on the forearms. Capillary refill is slightly delayed at 3 seconds. Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for your patience. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone level.
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite the ordeal. Is it absolutely necessary? I don’t do well with needles. And all this poking and prodding… it’s undignified. But… fine. If you insist. Just tell me where to go, and how long it will take. And I trust your nurses are… gentle? My wife will be expecting me back soon. She’ll be quite concerned if I’m gone for too long. Really, Doctor, I’ve never been one for hospitals or doctors. It’s all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Drahota. And yes, it is necessary to get a clearer picture. The blood work will provide us with valuable information. The phlebotomist, Mrs. Chen, is very experienced and gentle; she's excellent at making patients comfortable. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. It should only take about fifteen to twenty minutes, including the wait. I will have a nurse escort you. Nurse Li, could you please escort Mr. Drahota to the lab for his blood work?
PATIENT: Very well. Lead the way, then. But please, be quick about it. I have… commitments. And I’d appreciate a chair afterwards. All this standing is… trying. Honestly, Doctor, I've half a mind to just go home and take a nap. But… my wife. She would never let me hear the end of it. This whole experience has been… thoroughly exhausting. Perhaps the blood work will reveal something useful. Though I doubt it. It's probably just old age. That's what it always is. Now, let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. Nurse Li will take good care of you. Once the blood work is complete, you can rest in the waiting room, and I will review the results as soon as they are available. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the procedure. .
PATIENT: .
