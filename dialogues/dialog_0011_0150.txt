DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, well, get on with it, please. I haven’t got all day. I want to be absolutely certain… absolutely certain… that if I decide to… well, try for another one, that it will be… straightforward. No complications. I’m 51, not 25, you know. I don’t want any… issues.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s very prudent to be thorough, especially given your age and desire for a healthy pregnancy. To ensure we have a clear understanding of your situation, let’s discuss your medical history in detail. First, could you tell me if you've been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Of course I have! Don’t insult my intelligence. One. Perfectly healthy boy. Now 32. A very… successful doctor, I might add. He’s a surgeon. But that was… a long time ago. And with his father, a… a very different sort of man. This would be with… someone else. Which is why I need to know I can guarantee a good outcome. It’s not a simple matter, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Shteynberg. Having a previous healthy pregnancy is certainly a positive factor. However, a great deal can change over time, as you rightly point out. To get a comprehensive picture, I’d like to ask some questions about your overall health. Could you please tell me about any medical conditions you currently have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had my gallbladder removed, must be… 15 years ago now. No problems since. And… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. But I take pills for it. A small blue one, every morning. I think that’s all. Nothing major. I’m generally quite… robust. And I keep fit, you know. Cycling, naturally. It’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, gallbladder removal 15 years ago and currently managed hypertension. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned a small blue pill for the blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I just ask the chemist for more when I run out. I don't bother with names. It’s blue, that's all that matters. I can describe the box, if that's any use? It’s… rectangular, with a picture of… I don’t know, a heart, maybe? Look, I’m a bicycle repairer, not a pharmacist.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s alright. We can certainly look that up. In the meantime, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blue pills. And sometimes… a vitamin D tablet in the winter. When it's very grey. My bones ache, you see. That's it. Honestly, doctor, I live a very simple life. I fix bicycles. I don't go in for all these… fads.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, just the blue pill for blood pressure and occasional Vitamin D in the winter. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. I’m Hungarian, you know. We eat… robust food. And I haven’t had a problem with anything, ever. Though… I don't care for olives. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Really, doctor, are we nearly finished? I have a repair to finish.
DOCTOR: We're making good progress, Ms. Shteynberg. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the tedious part. Well, my mother lived to be 88. She had… arthritis, I think. And my father… heart trouble. But he smoked. Like a chimney. Terrible habit. My brother is… perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Though he lives in America and we don’t speak often. Is that enough family history for you?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. So, mother with arthritis, father with heart trouble related to smoking, and brother healthy. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! Do I look like someone who indulges in such… vulgarities? I maintain a strict regimen. Early to bed, early to rise… and a glass of sparkling water with lemon. That’s it. Honestly, doctor, you seem surprised I even came here.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shteynberg. I ask these questions of all my patients to get a complete understanding of their lifestyle. Now, could you tell me about your activity level?
PATIENT: Activity level? I told you! I fix bicycles! All day long. Lifting, bending, adjusting… it’s quite strenuous, actually. And I cycle myself, for… for exercise and… to test the repairs, naturally. I cycle everywhere. It's hardly a sedentary existence.
DOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned that. That is excellent. Now, before we discuss your plans for a potential pregnancy, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright. It will help me assess your overall health and identify any potential concerns. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Look, I haven't got time for a full-blown medical examination. I’ve got a Raleigh in the back that needs a new chain, and Mrs. Higgins is expecting her bike by tomorrow. If you absolutely must, a quick blood pressure check is fine. But no poking and prodding. I am a perfectly healthy woman.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I respect your wishes. A blood pressure check is a good starting point. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, even with the medication. We should discuss optimizing that control. I also notice a slightly increased heart rate. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, if you’ll allow just a brief listen. It’s a quick assessment and may help us understand why your heart rate is elevated.
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I’ve told you, I’m fine. My heart rate is probably just because I cycled here! And I am very busy. Do you need to do this or not? I really haven't got all day to spend in here listening to my heartbeat. And frankly, I’m a bit cold.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your time is valuable, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s true, cycling can elevate your heart rate. However, given your blood pressure reading, and considering your desire to start a family, it’s important we rule out any underlying issues that could potentially complicate a pregnancy. I’m not suggesting a comprehensive exam, but a brief listen to your heart and lungs, along with a simple blood test to check your hormone levels and overall organ function, would provide valuable information and ensure the safest possible outcome. Would you be willing to consider those two things – a quick auscultation and a blood test?
PATIENT: Hormone levels? What for? I’m a woman, I know my hormone levels! And blood tests are a nuisance. Fine. Fine. A quick listen, but no poking. And I absolutely refuse a blood test. I’ve made my position clear. Do the quick listen, get it over with, and tell me what I need to know about the pregnancy. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I will perform a quick auscultation of your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we should document it. Your lungs are clear. Given the murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure, I strongly recommend a more thorough evaluation, including an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm and a complete blood count to rule out any underlying health issues. While you may feel healthy, these tests are important for ensuring a safe pregnancy, especially given your age. Would you reconsider the blood work?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I am not having any of this! A murmur? I've never heard of such a thing! I feel perfectly fine. This is ridiculous. I’ve wasted enough time here already. I am leaving now. You can write whatever you like in your notes, but I’m not subjecting myself to any further… indignities. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, I must emphasize that proceeding with a pregnancy without addressing these potential concerns could pose risks to both you and the baby. I strongly urge you to reconsider and schedule a follow-up appointment for the recommended tests. If you are unwilling to do so, I can provide you with a referral to another physician who may be able to address your concerns. Here is my card with the clinic information. Please contact us if you change your mind. I wish you all the best.
