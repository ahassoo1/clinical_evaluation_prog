DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Uh, well… it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. I don't really remember all the details, but it has something to do with…bariatric surgery? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery. That's good, your wife sounds very supportive. It’s helpful she initiated this. Yes, I see here a referral for weight loss surgery evaluation. To get started, can you tell me a little bit more about why you’re interested in exploring this option?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why… well, it’s just… hard, you know? Everything is hard. Getting around, keeping up with my kids… even just bending over to tie my shoes. It’s been getting worse for a while now. I get tired really easily. My wife says my health is getting bad, and she’s worried. I guess… I want to feel better. I want to be able to do things again without being so… out of breath. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life, and it’s very good you’re addressing it. Okay. And you mentioned difficulty with bending over and shortness of breath. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It didn't just happen one day. It’s been… years, I think. Slowly getting worse, little by little. I remember when I could walk up the stairs without getting winded. Now… not so much. And bending over… I used to be able to help my wife in the garden, but now it hurts my back and I get really tired. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Sorry, my memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not remember specific dates when describing something that’s developed over time. Besides the shortness of breath and difficulty bending, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my knees hurt, especially after I've been standing for a while. And I get… sweaty, really easily. Even when it's not hot. Oh, and sometimes I have trouble sleeping. I wake up a lot during the night. I also feel… just really tired all the time, even after I sleep. Is that… is that normal? I don't know. Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It's important to tell me everything, even if you think it's small. The knee pain, excessive sweating, and trouble sleeping are all useful information. Okay. So, knee pain, sweating, and sleep disturbance, in addition to the shortness of breath and back pain. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes, yeah. Especially at the end of the day. After I've been on my feet for a long time. My wife has pointed it out a few times. She says my feet look puffy. I don’t usually pay much attention, to be honest. Is that… bad? I don't know a lot about this stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad that you don't know, that’s what I’m here for. Swelling in the ankles, especially at the end of the day, is something we'll want to investigate further. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. My wife says I have high cholesterol. The doctor told me a while ago, but I don’t really remember much about it. I don’t take any medicine for it, though. And… I don’t think I have anything else. I've never been really sick, honestly. Just… tired. I’m not sure if that counts. I had a bad flu a few years ago, but that’s about it. Sorry, I’m terrible with this stuff. I don't usually go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s helpful to know you haven’t been regularly seeing a doctor. High cholesterol is important to note. Okay, so high cholesterol, no other diagnosed medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just… a few bad colds over the years. Nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. My wife says I was being silly and climbed a tree. But that's about it. I really haven't been to the doctor much. I don't like hospitals. They make me nervous. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do either of your parents have any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or obesity?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom, she had… heart problems, I think. She passed away a few years ago. She was sick for a long time. My dad, he's still alive, but he has diabetes. He takes medicine for it. And… I think my grandmother had high blood pressure. But honestly, I don't really know much about it. We didn't talk about health much when I was growing up. Sorry. I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Kochubey. Knowing about your mom’s heart problems and your dad’s diabetes is helpful. Okay. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. My wife doesn't allow it. She says it's bad for my health. And… I agree with her. It smells terrible, too. I don't like being around people who smoke. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Kochubey. That’s great that you don’t smoke. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just a beer or a glass of wine with dinner, maybe a few times a week. Nothing heavy. My wife and I will have one with our meals sometimes. It helps us relax. But I don't drink every day. And I don't get drunk, ever. Sorry, I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Kochubey. A few drinks with dinner occasionally is not a concern. Now, last question about your lifestyle. Can you tell me a little bit about your typical diet and activity level?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… not good. I eat a lot of fast food. It’s easy, you know? After work, I don’t feel like cooking. My wife tries to get me to eat healthier, but… I just like the taste of it. Burgers, fries, pizza… things like that. And I don’t exercise much. I used to walk more, but now… I mostly just sit at my desk all day, and then sit on the couch at night. Sorry. I know it’s bad. I just… don’t have the energy. Or the motivation, I guess. It's a bad cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like there’s room for improvement there, but many people struggle with that. It’s good you’re acknowledging it. Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you need to do. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have to get home to my wife eventually. But yeah, go ahead. I’ll try to be helpful. Sorry if I’m not very cooperative. I don't usually get poked and prodded, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll go as quickly as we can. Okay, if you could please step onto the scale for me, we’ll start with your weight and height. And then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. I hope I don't mess it up. I always feel awkward on these things. I’m not very good with numbers, you know? Just tell me when you're ready. And uh… be gentle, please? Sorry. I’m probably being silly.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take our time. Okay, your weight is 139 pounds and your height is 155 centimeters. Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning at the moment. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild crackles in your lower lungs. And now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit. Not really pain, but it’s… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that for a few days, I think. I just figured it was something I ate. My wife said I shouldn’t eat so much junk food. Maybe she was right. Sorry, I’m probably just making things up. I don’t know much about my body, you know? Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me about that tenderness, Mr. Kochubey. It's not necessarily something to be worried about immediately, but it's worth investigating further. It could be something simple like indigestion, or it could be something else. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and test your range of motion. Just relax your arm, please. Your reflexes are normal. And can you try to reach for the ceiling with your right arm?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little… stiff. It doesn't hurt exactly, but it’s not as easy as it used to be. I used to be able to reach much higher. It's been getting harder to move my shoulder lately. My wife says I probably pulled a muscle, but I don’t remember doing anything to hurt it. Sorry, I’m not very coordinated. I’m probably just making things up again. Is it bad? Is something broken?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. You’re not making things up. It’s good you’re telling me about the stiffness in your shoulder. It doesn't sound like anything is broken, but it is worth investigating. Okay. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ankles. I notice some swelling, as your wife mentioned. Yes, there is some mild pitting edema in both ankles. That means when I press on them, it leaves a small indent. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing some symptoms related to your weight and overall health. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you’re experiencing shortness of breath, fatigue, and some tenderness in your abdomen. We also found some mild crackles in your lungs and some swelling in your ankles. Now, I want to order some lab work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Lab work… is it gonna hurt? I don’t like needles. But if it helps, I guess I’ll do it. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. I trust you. Sorry, I'm just a little nervous. And uh... what kind of lab work are we talking about? Will it take long? I have to get home to my wife.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be nervous, Mr. Kochubey. Many people don't like needles. It will be a quick blood draw, and I'll make sure the nurse is gentle. We'll just need a basic blood panel – to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and liver function. We'll also check your complete blood count to see if you have any signs of infection or anemia. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes total, including the wait. And the nurse will take care of you. We'll also need a chest x-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. That will take a few minutes, but it's painless. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. Chest x-ray… is it like the airport? I don’t like those machines. But if it helps… I'll do it. Whatever you need. Just… tell me what to expect. And uh… will it show anything bad? I'm just a little scared, Doctor. Sorry, I'm probably being silly. My wife is gonna be mad if I get home and I'm all upset.
DOCTOR: You’re not being silly at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly normal to be scared. The chest x-ray is similar to the airport scanner, but you'll be able to lie down comfortably. You won't be going through a revolving machine. A technician will position you in front of a plate and take a few images. It’s quick and painless. As for what it will show… it will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs that’s causing the crackles I heard. It could be anything from a simple infection to something more serious, but we won't know until we see the results. We're just gathering information right now, and we'll discuss everything thoroughly once we have the results. I'll be with you every step of the way. Would you like me to order the lab work and x-ray now?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. Order it. Whatever you think is best. Just… tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle, please? And uh… can my wife come with me to the x-ray? I think I’d feel better if she was there. Sorry, I’m being a baby, probably. Just… I’m a little scared. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a baby at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly alright to be scared, and it’s a good idea to have your wife with you for support. Okay, I've ordered the lab work and x-ray. I’ll let the nurse know to be gentle with the needle, and she’ll be happy to have your wife accompany you to the x-ray. I’ll also have her explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I want to discuss some potential next steps, depending on the results of the tests. We’ll talk about lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise. We may also consider medication to help manage your blood pressure and cholesterol. And, as we initially discussed, we can evaluate whether you are a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds okay. Lifestyle modifications… diet and exercise… I know, I know. My wife keeps telling me. But it’s so hard. Medication… I don’t like taking pills. But if it helps… I’ll try. And bariatric surgery… I don’t know. It sounds scary. But I want to feel better. I really do. So… what happens now? Do I go to the lab first? And uh… how long will it take to get the results? Sorry, I'm asking a lot of questions. I just… I want to know what to expect. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's good to be informed. Yes, you'll go to the lab first. The nurse will escort you there and explain everything. It will likely take about 30 minutes to an hour, including the wait. Then, you'll go to the x-ray department. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the lab work to come back. The x-ray results will be available sooner, likely within a few hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss everything in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, difficulty breathing, or severe fatigue, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now before you go to the lab?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind and patient with me. I really appreciate it. I… I’m still a little scared, but I feel a little better knowing what to expect. Okay. Lab work first, then x-ray. And… call you when the results are back. Chest pain, difficulty breathing… go to the emergency room. Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I think… I think I’m ready to go. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Let's get you started with the lab work. The nurse is just outside the door. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon.
