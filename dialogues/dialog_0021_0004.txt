DOCTOR: Alright, so you're here today... tell me what brings you in. Don't worry about trying to be precise, just tell me what's been going on. I've got time. Though, honestly, most people just come in for things they've read about on the internet. Just start at the beginning.
PATIENT: Oh, hi! Well, it’s not anything scary. Just a check-up, really. My husband, Frank, and I were talking, and he reminded me it's probably time for a few shots. You know, the usual ones to keep us from getting too sick when everyone else is coughing and sneezing. I don’t even remember the last time I had a proper check-up, to be honest. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Right, "shots." People always say that. It's... good you're thinking about it. Though honestly, preventative care is usually wasted on those who don't feel sick. Still. A check-up...okay. Let's see. Have you had any particular symptoms lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel pretty good, all things considered. A little achy sometimes, you know, just getting older. But nothing I'd bother a doctor with, usually. Frank worries a bit more than I do, that’s probably why we're here. He’s always reading articles about… everything. Honestly, I think he gets more anxious from the articles than anything. But, no, no real symptoms. Just trying to stay on top of things, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Achiness." Vague, but alright. And Frank reads articles...yes, that's... common. Okay. Let's just go through some basics, then. To satisfy someone. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And a bad case of pneumonia when I was in my twenties, but that was… well, a long time ago too. Nothing since then, really. Just the usual colds and flu. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder while helping Frank with the roof. But it healed up just fine. That was a bit scary at the time, though.
DOCTOR: Tonsils, pneumonia, broken wrist... okay. And family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history... that's a tough one. My mom had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains when she got older. Arthritis, I think. And my dad… he had heart trouble. But, honestly, a lot of my family didn’t go to the doctor much. We’re Tlingit, you know, and things were different back then. A lot of relying on traditional medicine and just… toughing things out. I don’t know a whole lot about specifics. Sorry, I’m not very helpful on that front.
DOCTOR: Right. "Traditional medicine." Look, I understand respecting your heritage, but it doesn’t change the fact that genetics matter. Okay. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies... not really. I mean, I sneeze a bit in the spring, like everyone else. But nothing severe. No bee stings, no rashes, nothing like that. I can eat pretty much anything. Frank’s the one with the allergies, he’s always complaining about something. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. He’s a walking pharmacy! But me? I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… ibuprofen sometimes, for a headache. Or if my joints are bothering me. But nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Frank keeps telling me I should take something for my blood pressure, but I feel fine. And I don’t really like going to the doctor, so… He worries too much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we should at least do a basic physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is important, even if you feel fine. Let’s start with your weight and height. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Standard procedure. Can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure. Sounds good. I haven't weighed myself in ages, actually. Frank has one at home, but I try not to look. Numbers just make me anxious, you know?
DOCTOR: 114 pounds and 169 centimeters. Okay. And let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Okay, I am relaxed. Frank always says I tense up at the doctor’s office. He says it messes with the reading. It’s just… I don’t like feeling poked and prodded, you know? It reminds me of when I was a little kid getting shots. Not a fun memory. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt. It's just a bit of pressure. 148 over 92. Hmm. That's a little elevated. Which is not entirely surprising, considering your family history and, well, your current state of… denial about preventative care. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated? That doesn't sound good. Frank’s going to be so worried. Is it… really bad? I mean, what does that even mean, elevated? He always talks about numbers, but I never understand what they actually mean. I feel perfectly fine, you know? A little achy, maybe, but that’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately life-threatening, but it's high enough that we need to address it. 148 over 92 means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your arteries. It’s…concerning, given your family history. Your lungs sound clear, at least. We'll need to discuss some options, including lifestyle changes and potentially medication. Before we get to that, though, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medication... I was hoping to avoid that. Lifestyle changes… well, I try to stay active. I garden a lot, and Frank and I go for walks sometimes. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a glass of wine with dinner, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy. Frank likes his beer, but… he’s always been healthy. He’s the one who worries about my health! It just seems… strange that I would have high blood pressure. I feel perfectly good.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly good” is subjective, Teah. And a couple of glasses of wine a week can still contribute. Look, high blood pressure often has no symptoms. That's why it's called the "silent killer". It's… frustrating when patients ignore the numbers because they "feel fine". It doesn’t make it go away. We need to get this under control. We can start with some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes, and then discuss a plan. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, I see… silent killer, you say? That doesn’t sound good at all. Frank’s going to be right. He always says I should listen to the doctors more. I guess I should have come in sooner. No, I don’t think I have any allergies to medications. Like I said, I don't take many, but I've never had a reaction to ibuprofen. Does it matter what kind of blood work? I don’t like needles, you know. Always have been a bit squeamish.
DOCTOR: It's standard blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, cholesterol levels… things to get a baseline and see if there's anything obvious going on. And yes, there will be a needle. It's unavoidable. The phlebotomist is very good, though. They'll make it as quick and painless as possible. I’m going to order those tests for you now. The lab is down the hall. And then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. A whole lot of tests, you say? Honestly, this is a bit overwhelming. I was just hoping for a quick check-up and a few shots. But, I guess if it’s important for my health… okay. Will the results take long? And… will they be explained to me in plain English? I don't understand all those medical terms. Frank always has to explain them to me.
DOCTOR: The results usually take about a week. And yes, I will explain them to you in plain English. I understand medical jargon can be confusing. Though frankly, it's frustrating having to repeat everything to patients who don't bother to learn basic terminology. I'll write everything down for you, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you have. The lab technician will draw your blood, and then you can schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not getting too upset about me not knowing all the medical terms. I guess I’ll go get my blood drawn then. Hopefully, it won’t be too bad. Frank will be so relieved that I finally came in. He’s always looking out for me. Thank you again, Doctor Havird.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab is just down the hall to your left. And try not to worry. It’s a routine procedure. And Teah?
PATIENT: Yes?
DOCTOR: Try to be more proactive about your health in the future. It's your responsibility, not just your husband’s. You can go now.
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am.
