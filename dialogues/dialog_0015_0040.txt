DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly. It comes and goes, you see. And… and I seem to be getting those water infections rather frequently now. It’s been bothering me for a while.
DOCTOR: "Frequently" is rather vague, Mr. Espinueva. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Perhaps… three times in the last six months? Maybe four. It's hard to keep track, to be honest. They're unpleasant, of course, and they do seem to be getting closer together. Is that… is that a problem? I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Three to four times in six months is a bit much, yes. We need to understand why this is happening. Alright. Let's start with this side pain. Where exactly is it?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it's on my right side, lower down. Kind of in my back, wrapping around a bit. Sometimes it's a dull ache, and sometimes it's… sharp, like a pulling feeling. It doesn't go away completely, you see? It just varies in how bad it is. And it seems to flare up when I drink a lot of water. That sounds odd, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Odd, yes, it does sound odd. Pain worsening with increased fluid intake isn't typical. We’ll need to investigate that. Now, tell me about these water infections, as you call them. What symptoms do you experience when you have one?
PATIENT: Well, it's a burning feeling when I… when I go to the toilet, you see? And a bit of discomfort, lower down. And I feel… tired, generally. Not very energetic, at all. And sometimes, a bit of a fever, but not a high one, thankfully. I do try to drink plenty of water, even though it sometimes makes the pain worse. It's… confusing.
DOCTOR: "Tired" is also rather nonspecific, Mr. Espinueva. Can you rate your fatigue on a scale of one to ten, with one being hardly noticeable and ten being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A scale… Hmm. Well, when it's bad, I’d say… perhaps a six or seven? I can still get about, you see. I still do my gardening and little chores. But I do find myself needing to rest more often. And I just don’t feel… like doing things, sometimes. It’s a bit like a weight on me, generally. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Moderately helpful. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, kidney issues – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, a few years back, a doctor told me I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something? He said I have lots of little bubbles on them. I can't quite remember all the details, to be honest. He said it wouldn't cause too many problems, but I should keep an eye on things. It’s why I come here, generally, I suppose. I do take some medication for it, but I can’t recall the name right now. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease. Right. And you’re on tolvaptan, as needed. Now, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your urination patterns – increased frequency, decreased output, blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no blood. That hasn’t happened. I don’t feel sick, either, no vomiting or anything like that. My… my waterworks are pretty much normal, I think. Though sometimes I feel like I need to go a bit more often, but that could be the drinking, generally. I’m not sure. It’s… difficult to say, Doctor. It’s all a bit muddled, to be honest. I apologize for not being very clear.
DOCTOR: "Muddled" is not particularly helpful for making a diagnosis, Mr. Espinueva. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss possible causes and some tests to run. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and check your flanks for tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. I'm happy to do whatever you need, Doctor. I’ll just… lie down, shall I? Just let me know if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen is mildly tender in the right flank. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90 – a little elevated, but not concerning in and of itself. I’m going to check your urine sample now. Please collect a sample for me. There’s a cup in the bathroom.
PATIENT: Oh, right. A water sample. Yes, of course. I’ll just go and collect one, then, shall I? I’ll be right back. Hopefully, it won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Espinueva. I’ll be right here when you're ready.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I tried to get a good one for you. It wasn’t the most pleasant task, I must admit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your urine analysis shows elevated white blood cells, consistent with a urinary tract infection. Given your history of recurrent UTIs and the tenderness in your flank, and the polycystic kidney disease, I suspect there may be more going on. It's possible you have a kidney infection, or pyelonephritis, in addition to the UTI. We need to rule that out. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a better picture of what’s happening with your kidneys and rule out any other potential causes for your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A CT scan… that sounds… serious. A kidney infection… that doesn’t sound good. Yes, alright, Doctor. If that’s what’s needed to find out what’s going on, then yes, please. But… will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I do worry about these things, you see.
DOCTOR: The CT scan itself is not painful, Mr. Espinueva. You will lie on a table, and a scanner will take images of your abdomen and pelvis. It will take about 30-40 minutes. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to treat the UTI. It’s important you complete the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. We’ll discuss the CT scan results and a long-term management plan once they're available. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. Antibiotics… yes, I’ve taken them before. 24-48 hours… alright. I’ll just have to wait, then. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods I should avoid? Or anything I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: Drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate your bladder. If you experience a high fever – over 101°F – chills, nausea, vomiting, or worsening back or flank pain, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, just rest and take the antibiotics as prescribed. I’ll have the nurse print out these instructions for you, along with the antibiotic prescription. Do you need a work note for any time off?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A handout would be most helpful. And… yes, please. A work note would be wonderful. I do some gardening, you see, but perhaps I should take a few days off. It might be best. Thank you again for everything. I feel a bit better now, knowing what’s going on, or at least what you’re trying to find out.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to discuss the medication instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment to review the CT scan results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's the number. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help very much. .
