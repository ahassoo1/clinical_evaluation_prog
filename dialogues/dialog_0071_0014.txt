DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Or… Ronnald, please, if you prefer. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Ronnald is fine, yes. Hmm… what brings me in… It has to do with… paperwork, I think. My wife mentioned something about needing forms filled out? Something for… time off, maybe? It's all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I’m hoping you can help me with it.
DOCTOR: Right, paperwork… yes, yes. We do quite a bit of that, don't we?
PATIENT: Tell me about it! It feels like all anyone does these days is deal with paperwork. Is it… is it something to do with my work? I work with the church, you see… religious education and activities. It’s… it’s been a while now, a good many years. I can’t quite remember what triggered needing the forms, though. Perhaps a leave of absence? Or something for… benefits? It's a bit of a jumble in my head.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly something work-related with the church. A leave of absence or benefits… that narrows things down a bit. Do you recall why you might need a leave of absence?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part, isn’t it? I… I think it might be something to do with my back. It’s been acting up lately. A bit of pain, mostly when I'm… standing for too long, or bending. But honestly, Doctor, it comes and goes. It's hard to pinpoint anything specific. I've been trying to manage it with… well, with just taking it easy, mostly. Is that enough to need those forms, do you think? I really don’t want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain… that’s helpful. Even if it comes and goes, it’s still worth looking into. And yes, that could be what the forms are for – medical leave. Let’s just get a better understanding of the pain. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It’s lower back, mostly on the… left side, I think. Sometimes it radiates down my leg a little bit, but not always. And like I said, it gets worse after I've been on my feet for a while, or if I try to lift something. Nothing too heavy, mind you. Just… everyday things. I’ve been trying to avoid bending over too much. It doesn’t keep me up at night, thankfully. But it’s just… annoying, you know? It makes it hard to focus on things sometimes. I’m probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily about getting old, Ronnald. Back pain is quite common, and it's good you're paying attention to it. “Radiating down the leg,” you said. Does it go all the way down to your foot?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not usually all the way to my foot, no. It stops somewhere around my calf, I think. Sometimes I get a bit of tingling in my foot, but not constant. It’s… hard to explain. It comes and goes so much. One day it’s barely noticeable, the next it’s a bit of an ache. My wife says I should get it checked out properly, that's why we thought about those forms. She worries, you see. A good woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it could be sciatica, Ronnald – irritation of the sciatic nerve. The tingling and the pain radiating down your leg fit that pattern. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you, just to get a better sense of things. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength. Nothing too uncomfortable, I promise.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, yes. Sciatica, you say? I’ve heard of that. As long as it’s not too… strenuous, I suppose I can manage. I’m not very good with… poking and prodding, to be honest. But if it helps figure things out, then please, go ahead. My wife will be very pleased you're taking a look. Just… be gentle, if you would?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ronnald. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with just standing up straight for me. And then I’d like you to bend forward slowly, as far as you comfortably can. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright… here goes. Oh… there’s a little twinge there, yes. Mostly on the left side. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. It feels a bit tighter when I bend. There we go… that’s a bit better now. I do hope I'm not being a bother, Doctor. It's hard to explain what it feels like.
DOCTOR: No bother at all, Ronnald. It's my job to figure it out, and you're doing fine. I notice some tenderness there on the left side, as you mentioned. Now, let's check your reflexes. Just relax your legs for me. And then I'll just ask you to lift each leg straight up, one at a time. Again, just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Alright… here we go. That’s… alright. A bit of a strain, but manageable. Ooh… that’s a bit more difficult on this side. Not a lot of pain, just… a bit tight. Feels like it’s pulling something. There we go… I haven’t been doing much exercise lately, I must admit. Getting old, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, one last thing. Just push your heel against my hand like this. And then pull back against my resistance. Okay?
PATIENT: There we go… that’s alright. Oh… a little bit of a twinge there, yes. Mostly in the back of my leg. It’s not a lot of pain, just… noticeable. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a sharp, shooting pain. More of a dull ache that gets a bit worse when I push against something. Are we almost done, Doctor? I do hope I'm not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ronnald, we're almost done. Thank you for your patience. From what I've gathered – the pain radiating down your leg, the tenderness on the left side, the limited range of motion, and the muscle weakness – it's looking like a mild case of sciatica, likely caused by some irritation of the sciatic nerve. It's good you're not experiencing any numbness or significant weakness, which would be more concerning. It sounds like it is not severe. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: Sciatica… yes, that sounds about right. My wife mentioned something similar. Hmm… questions? Let me see… Will it… go away on its own? Or will I need… something for it? I really don't want to take a lot of medication, if I can avoid it. And… will it affect my work? I have commitments with the church, you see… important activities. Will I be able to continue with those?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Ronnald. Most cases of mild sciatica do improve with conservative treatment – things like gentle stretching, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. We can start with that. I’m not a big fan of unnecessary medications either. As for your work, it depends. If bending, lifting, or prolonged standing worsen the pain, you might need to modify your activities temporarily. We'll need to figure out what triggers your pain. I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back just to rule out any other potential causes, like arthritis or a bone issue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps figure things out, then please do. Gentle stretching… I can probably manage that. My wife is quite good with those things, she’ll likely have me doing all sorts of exercises! Avoiding bending and lifting… that might be a bit tricky with my work, but I can try. Are those forms… for the leave of absence? Or for the X-ray? I’m getting a bit confused with all of it, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ronnald. It's easy to get confused. Those forms you mentioned earlier were likely for a medical leave of absence, should you need one to accommodate the potential limitations from your sciatica. We can discuss that further after the X-ray results come back. I'll have the receptionist schedule you for an X-ray, and we’ll get those results back within a few days. In the meantime, try the over-the-counter pain relievers if you need them, and let’s focus on gentle stretching and avoiding activities that aggravate the pain. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Gentle stretching, over-the-counter pain relievers… yes, that sounds manageable. And the X-ray… alright. So, if I feel worse, or if the pain doesn’t get better, I should call the receptionist? And then we’ll talk about the forms for the leave of absence? Is that right? I do appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me, Doctor. It’s a bit of a relief, to be honest. .
DOCTOR: Exactly right, Ronnald. If the pain worsens, or doesn't improve after a week or so, please call the receptionist and we'll discuss the next steps, including potentially completing those leave of absence forms. And you're very welcome. It's my job to help, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Let’s get those X-rays scheduled, and we'll go from there.
