DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. BuoniconTI. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here that you’re 35 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, to be honest, it's a little difficult to recall exactly why I scheduled this appointment. Something about… planning for the future? I believe a friend suggested I look into some forms, just in case. It had to do with… what I would want if I wasn’t able to make decisions for myself. Is that… right? I apologize for the vagueness. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. It’s common to feel a bit unsure when proactively addressing these types of concerns. It sounds as though you're interested in advance care planning – specifically, discussing a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. These documents outline your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself, and who you would designate to make those decisions on your behalf. To best understand your needs, could you tell me a little more about what prompted you to consider this now?
PATIENT: Oh, “advance care planning,” yes, that sounds right. It’s… good to have a name for it. As for what prompted this… honestly, it was a conversation with a friend, Lena. She recently had a… a family situation, a health scare with her father, and it made her realize how important it was to have these things in order. She was quite insistent, actually. She said it would give me peace of mind, and… well, I trust her judgment. I don’t recall the specifics of her situation, unfortunately. Just that it was… stressful. Does that make any sense? It’s all rather hazy.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. BuoniconTI. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider this, and it’s admirable that you’re taking proactive steps based on a friend’s experience. It's quite common for life events to prompt these conversations. To begin, let’s talk about your general health. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything you’re being treated for, or have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. Let me think. I… I believe I’ve always been generally healthy. I haven't seen a doctor regularly in… quite some time, actually. I do recall having some… minor back pain on occasion, from my work, I think. It’s etching, you see. It requires a lot of… precision, and long hours leaning over a workbench. Nothing serious, though. I manage it with stretching and… occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. I don’t recall any major diagnoses. No heart conditions, no diabetes, nothing like that. I'm quite sure. Though… I suppose it’s possible I’ve forgotten something. I apologize again for the… gaps.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. We can work through everything. Occasional back pain from your work as an etcher is good to know. And it's perfectly acceptable to not recall every detail. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hm… surgeries… let me see. I… I don’t think so. No, I’m fairly certain I haven’t had any surgeries. As for hospitalizations… there was… a brief stay when I was quite young, perhaps eight or nine years old? I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia, I believe. But that was… decades ago. Nothing since then. I’m reasonably certain. It’s just… difficult to be certain about things that happened so long ago, you understand. I really haven't been unwell enough to require hospitalization since then, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely, Ms. BuoniconTI. Childhood illnesses don’t typically factor into these discussions, but it’s good to have a complete picture. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family… well, we weren't very close. My parents passed away when I was quite young, and I didn't have much contact with other relatives. I know my mother… she had some sort of… arthritis, I believe. Something in her joints. It made it difficult for her to… to move around easily. But beyond that… I honestly don’t know. I don’t recall anyone else having any… significant illnesses. It’s not something that was ever discussed, frankly. We were… a rather private family. I apologize. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s frustrating to not remember these things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. Family medical history can be challenging to gather, and it's understandable that you wouldn't have this information. It's not a requirement to proceed, and we can focus on your own health and wishes. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I’ve never been one for… those sorts of things. I find I need a clear head for my work, you see. Precision is paramount. Smoking would be… detrimental, to say the least. And alcohol… well, I simply don’t enjoy it. It impairs judgment, and I prefer to be… fully present. Recreational drugs are… entirely out of the question. I lead a rather quiet life, actually. Mostly focused on my etching. Does that answer your question? It feels rather… personal, to be honest, but I understand you need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that answers the question perfectly, Ms. BuoniconTI. And you are right to feel it is personal; I only ask to get a comprehensive view of your overall health. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I've never knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. I’ve occasionally broken out in a minor rash with certain soaps or lotions, but nothing severe. I've never had trouble with food, medications… nothing that springs to mind. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, given my work, but it’s more of an irritation than a true allergy. I’m reasonably certain I don't have any life-threatening allergies, thankfully. Is that… sufficient? I'm doing my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. BuoniconTI, that is very helpful. Thank you for being so thorough. It sounds as though you're in good general health, despite a few minor sensitivities. Now that I have a better understanding of your medical background, we can begin discussing advance care planning in more detail. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or vitamins regularly?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a good question. Let me see. I occasionally take ibuprofen for my back pain, as I mentioned before. Just when it’s particularly… troublesome. Nothing regular, though. And… sometimes a multivitamin, if I remember. But it’s not a consistent habit. Honestly, I try to maintain a healthy diet, so I don't rely on vitamins too much. No prescription medications at all. I haven’t needed anything beyond that, thankfully. Does that answer your question? I apologize if I’m being… disorganized. It’s all rather a blur sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. Intermittent ibuprofen for back pain and occasional multivitamins is good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? Oh. Yes, I suppose so. It’s been… quite some time since my last one, actually. I’m not particularly fond of examinations, if I’m being honest. But… if it’s necessary, then yes. Please be gentle, if you don’t mind. My back can be… sensitive. And… please do explain what you’re doing as you go along? It helps to alleviate my… anxieties. It’s rather silly, I know. But I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. BuoniconTI. I completely understand. We will take things at your pace and I will explain everything as we go along. I will also be as gentle as possible with your back. Let’s start with your vital signs. I’ll take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature and respiratory rate. Blood pressure is 128/78 mmHg, pulse is 72 bpm and regular, temperature is 98.6°F, and respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Please be quick, if you could. My… anxieties are rather easily triggered, you see. I tend to… fixate on things. I'll try to breathe deeply, as you instructed. Just… please let me know if you notice anything… concerning. I have a rather active imagination, and I tend to… catastrophize. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles or rhonchi. That's excellent. Now, I’d like to briefly examine your abdomen. I’ll gently palpate to check for any tenderness or masses. It’s just a routine check. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: My abdomen…? Oh. I… I'm not particularly fond of having my abdomen touched. It’s… rather sensitive, actually. I have a rather… delicate constitution, you see. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I haven't been experiencing any… abdominal pain or discomfort. Perhaps we could skip that part? I'm starting to feel a little… overwhelmed. It's a silly request, I know. But it would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. BuoniconTI. Your comfort is my priority. We can absolutely skip the abdominal exam. It was just a routine part of the assessment, but it's not essential given your lack of symptoms. Let’s move on to a neurological exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It’s a quick and simple assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurological exam…? Yes, that sounds… less intrusive. Reflexes and strength… that's alright. I do try to maintain a… certain level of physical activity, you see. Etching requires a… steady hand and good coordination. As long as it’s not too… strenuous, then yes. Please do explain what you’re doing as you go along? It helps to alleviate my… anxieties. I tend to… overthink things, you see. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. BuoniconTI. I will explain everything as we go. We’ll start with your reflexes. I’ll gently tap certain points on your arms and legs with this little hammer, and you can just relax. It’s completely painless. Excellent. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I’d like to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this…? Is that… adequate? I don't want to… strain myself. I have a rather… delicate constitution, you see. And my hands are rather important for my work. I need them to be… precise and steady. I'm afraid I'm not particularly strong. I spend most of my time… hunched over a workbench, you see. It's not exactly a strength-building activity. I apologize for the… weakness. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. BuoniconTI. You are providing adequate strength for the assessment. It's not about being strong, it’s just to ensure your nerves are functioning properly. I can see you have good dexterity and coordination. Now, let’s check your coordination. I’ll ask you to touch your finger to my finger, and then to touch your nose. Simple enough?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… clumsy. I apologize. My coordination is not always… optimal. I tend to… overthink things, you see. It disrupts my… fine motor skills. And my hands are slightly… shaky. I've been working for quite some time, you see. It takes a toll on my… precision. I apologize for the… inadequacy. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. BuoniconTI. There’s no need to apologize. A slight tremor is not uncommon, especially after prolonged work. Your coordination is within normal limits, and it’s likely just fatigue. Now that we’ve completed the physical exam, I'd like to discuss your advance care planning in more detail. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds good. Advance care planning. That's… why I'm here, isn't it? I suppose I should… try to focus. It's difficult, you see. I tend to… overthink things. But yes. Let's discuss it. What exactly does that… entail? Is it complicated? I'm afraid I'm not particularly… adept at legal matters. It's a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control.
DOCTOR: It’s not complicated at all, Ms. BuoniconTI. We can take things at your pace. Advance care planning involves two main documents: a living will and a durable power of attorney for healthcare. A living will outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself, such as whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment like a ventilator or feeding tube. A durable power of attorney for healthcare designates someone you trust – your healthcare proxy – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. Essentially, it's about ensuring your wishes are respected and that someone you trust can advocate for you if you're ever unable to speak for yourself. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A living will… and a durable power of attorney. So, the living will states what I want, and the power of attorney designates who makes the decisions. Is that… correct? It sounds… rather daunting, actually. To think about… those sorts of scenarios. It’s unpleasant. But I suppose it’s… responsible. Do I need to be very specific? What if I… change my mind later? It’s a silly question, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it exactly right, Ms. BuoniconTI. The living will outlines your wishes, and the durable power of attorney designates who will make those decisions for you. It can be daunting to think about those scenarios, and that’s perfectly normal. You don’t need to have every detail figured out right away. We can start with general principles, and then get more specific as you become more comfortable. And yes, you absolutely can change your mind later. These documents are not set in stone. You can revise or revoke them at any time, as long as you’re mentally competent. It’s about ensuring your wishes are always respected. Do you have someone in mind that you would trust to be your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… That’s… a difficult question. I don't have many… close relationships, you see. My family… well, it’s complicated. I haven’t spoken to them in years. And I tend to… keep to myself. I have a… rather solitary life. I suppose… Lena might be a good choice. She was the one who… prompted me to do this, after all. She’s… reliable, and she’s quite intelligent. But I’m hesitant to… burden her. It's a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Is she… suitable? I don't want to impose on her.
DOCTOR: Lena sounds like a very suitable choice, Ms. BuoniconTI. The fact that she prompted you to consider this and that you trust her judgment is a very good sign. It’s not a burden to designate someone you trust to advocate for you – it’s a sign of respect and confidence. She would need to be willing to carry out your wishes, even if they disagree with her own. Do you think she would be comfortable with that responsibility?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe she would be. Lena is… quite strong-willed, actually. And she’s very… principled. She has a… strong sense of morality. She would… honor my wishes, even if she didn’t agree with them. She’s quite… devoted, actually. And she’s… very intelligent. She would… understand the implications. Yes, I believe she would be… suitable. She’s… reliable. And she’s quite… devoted. I trust her. She's quite… devoted. Is there… a form I need to fill out? I'm afraid I'm not particularly… adept at legal matters. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s wonderful to hear. Yes, there is a form to designate your healthcare proxy. It's fairly straightforward, but we can go through it together, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. It requires your signature and Lena’s, as well as a witness. Here you go. We can start with the first section, which is your personal information. Do you have a copy of your ID with you?
PATIENT: Yes, here it is. I do have my driver's license. I suppose it's… necessary? I tend to… misplace things. I'm afraid I'm not particularly… organized. I have a… rather chaotic life. I suppose it's… necessary? I'm afraid I'm not particularly… organized. But yes, here it is. I do have my driver’s license. I suppose it’s… necessary? It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is necessary to verify your identity, Ms. BuoniconTI. No need to apologize, we all have our quirks. Okay, let's start with your full name. Can you just fill that in for me?
PATIENT: Evann BuoniconTI. Is that… correct? I tend to… misspell things. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Is that… correct? I tend to… misspell things. I apologize for the… shakiness. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Ms. BuoniconTI. Evann BuoniconTI is spelled correctly. Don’t worry about the shakiness, it’s perfectly normal. Now, let's move on to the next section, which is where you designate your healthcare proxy. Can you write Lena's full name and contact information here?
PATIENT: Lena Petrova. Her phone number is… 555-123-4567. Her address is… 123 Main Street, Anytown. Is that… correct? I tend to… misremember things. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Is that… correct? I apologize for the… shakiness. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Is that… correct? I really hope I wrote that down correctly. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Oh dear. I hope I haven't made a mistake. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Everything looks perfect, Ms. BuoniconTI. Lena’s information is all correct. You’re doing a wonderful job. Now, the next section asks you to think about your wishes for medical treatment. This is where you can outline what types of care you want – or don’t want – if you’re unable to communicate your decisions. We can take our time with this section, and I can provide you with some examples to get you started. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… sounds daunting. To think about… those sorts of things. I suppose… it’s necessary. But I’m not sure… what to write. I haven’t really… thought about it. I tend to… avoid those sorts of topics. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Examples… yes, please. That would be… helpful. Very helpful. I'm afraid I'm not particularly… adept at legal matters. It's a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. I really hope I don’t make a mistake. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. BuoniconTI. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Many people find it difficult to think about these topics. Here are some common examples. You can check boxes indicating whether you want life-sustaining treatment, such as mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, CPR, or dialysis. You can also write your own wishes, specifying what types of care you want – or don’t want – in specific situations. For example, you can state whether you want pain medication, even if it shortens your life. Or you can specify whether you want to be kept alive at all costs, or whether you prefer comfort care, even if it means a shorter lifespan. We can go through each section together, and I can help you understand the implications of each choice. There's no right or wrong answer, it's about ensuring your wishes are respected. Do you want to start with life-sustaining treatment?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot of information. Life-sustaining treatment… That sounds… frightening. To think about… being kept alive by machines. I suppose… it’s necessary. But I’m not sure… what I want. I tend to… avoid those sorts of topics. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary… to keep me alive… then yes. But I don’t want… to be kept alive indefinitely. That sounds… terrible. To be kept alive by machines… with no quality of life. I suppose… if there’s no hope of recovery… then no. I don’t want… to be a burden. I tend to… avoid those sorts of topics. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it’s difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. Oh dear. I'm getting anxious. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. This is overwhelming. It’s a silly habit, I know. But it's difficult to control. I tend to… overthink things. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. BuoniconTI. It sounds like you’re saying that you want life-sustaining treatment if it’s absolutely necessary to keep you alive, but you don’t want it prolonged indefinitely if there’s no hope of recovery. Is that correct?
