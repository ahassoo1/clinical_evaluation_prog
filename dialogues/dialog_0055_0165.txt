DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. Look, I ain’t one for long stories. Been gettin’ fevers. Come and go, y’know? Happens a couple times a week now for, oh, maybe a month? It’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: Very well, Clide. Fevers, you say. And they occur intermittently, a few times a week for approximately a month. I see. Could you describe the fevers to me?
PATIENT: Well, they just…come on. I start feelin’ kinda cold, shiverin’ a little, then real quick I get hot. Not like burnin’ hot, but warm, you know? Like I got a blanket on me. Lasts a few hours, then I sweat it out and feel okay for a bit. Happens mostly in the evenin’, if that means anythin’. I don't really know why it's happenin'.
DOCTOR: I see. So, chills followed by a feeling of warmth – not excessively high fever, but noticeable. Primarily in the evening. Do you measure your temperature when you feel these fevers coming on, Clide?
PATIENT: Nah. Don't bother with thermometers. Old school, I guess. Just know I feel warm. My wife, Elena, she keeps sayin' I should, but... I just don't. I’m tellin’ you how I feel, right? That should be enough. It’s not like I’m fallin’ apart here. Just a little bug, probably.
DOCTOR: While your subjective experience is certainly valuable, Clide, an objective temperature reading is helpful in assessing the situation. However, we can proceed without it for now. Aside from the fevers, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside them?
PATIENT: Hmm... lemme think. Not really. No cough, no sniffles, no aches. Maybe a little tired, but I’m 65, Doc. I am gonna be a little tired! Appetite’s okay, I guess. Elena makes good food, so I always eat. No stomach problems, nothin’ like that. Just the fevers. That’s it. Really.
DOCTOR: Very well. No accompanying cough, congestion, body aches, or gastrointestinal disturbances. Appetite remains normal. Let's move on to your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ major. Doc told me years ago my cholesterol was a little high, but I changed my diet, it went down. Elena makes sure I eat right, see? I had my prostate checked a while back, all good. Other than that... just the usual old man stuff. Creaky knees, that sort of thing. No pills, no nothin’. I try to stay healthy. It’s important. Especially when you get older.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a history of slightly elevated cholesterol which was managed with dietary changes, and a normal prostate exam. And you are currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: That's right. No pills. Elena worries enough as it is, so I try to avoid the docs as much as possible. Now, can we get this over with? I got things to do, you know? Gardenin’ waits for no man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Clide. We will be as efficient as possible. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Lucky, I guess. Always tried to stay out of trouble. Still do, mostly. Broke my arm when I was a kid, fallin' out of a tree, but that's it. No big operations or anythin'. Just the arm, years ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. No previous surgeries. Now, regarding your family… Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything you are aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, I think. She was older when she got it, though. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble, towards the end. But he smoked like a chimney, so it’s no surprise. Other than that… not really. Lots of folks lived to be old. Good genes, I guess. Elena’s family is healthy too. Pretty much a healthy bunch. .
DOCTOR: I see. Family history of diabetes in your mother, and heart trouble in your father, likely related to his smoking habits. Now, Clide, could you tell me about your social habits?
