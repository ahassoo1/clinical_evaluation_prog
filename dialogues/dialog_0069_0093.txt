DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, honestly, it’s a bit of a blur what exactly led me to book this. Something about… not sleeping well? And getting… fitter, I guess. My wife, bless her, she was always on about my fitness. She’d have a list, probably. I can’t really recall the specifics, though. It’s been… a while. Is this where you poke and prod? Because I’m not a fan of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so trouble sleeping and wanting to improve your fitness… and it sounds like this has been on your mind for a bit, even if the details are fuzzy right now. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely sort through things. And yes, sometimes a little poking and prodding is helpful, but we'll take it slow. Before we get to any physical exam, could you tell me a bit more about the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Right, slow is good. Much better. Honestly, I just… wake up a lot. And then I stare at the ceiling. For hours, sometimes. It's not like I’m restless, exactly. Just… there. Thinking. Usually about… well, things. Old things. It’s not a nightmare or anything, just… awareness. And then the morning comes and I’m knackered. I drink tea. Lots of tea. Does that make a difference? I don’t know. I’m terrible at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so waking up frequently, difficulty falling back asleep, and feeling tired in the morning. And you mentioned you drink a lot of tea. Tea can definitely have an impact on sleep, as it contains caffeine. How much tea would you say you drink in a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A lot. Probably… five or six cups? Maybe more on bad days. It’s just… comforting, you know? My wife used to make it for me. Earl Grey, mostly. I’ve tried switching to herbal stuff, chamomile and whatnot, but it’s not the same. Doesn’t… hit the spot. It just tastes like warm water with a hint of disappointment, if I’m honest. Does that sound silly? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound silly at all. It’s perfectly normal to have preferences and find comfort in certain things. And it’s helpful to know you’ve tried switching to herbal teas. Five or six cups of Earl Grey is a fair amount of caffeine, and could certainly be contributing to the sleep issues. Let's step back a bit. Aside from the sleep and wanting to get fitter – which we can talk about later – are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. I get… achey. Sometimes. In my back, mostly. I’m a bit of a slouch, I suppose. And I’m always a bit… cold. Even when it’s warm. My wife used to say I was a human ice block. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to it. Just… old age, I figure. And a bit of grumpiness, probably. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain, feeling cold frequently, and a bit of grumpiness. We can definitely explore those. The back pain – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. It's not like a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. After I've been sitting for a while, usually. Or if I lift something heavy, though I try not to these days. I used to be quite strong, you know. Worked with my hands a lot. Musical instruments. Repairing them, tuning them… But that was a long time ago. Now it’s more… remembering how to do it than actually doing it. Does that make sense? It's frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the back pain is more of a dull ache that comes on after sitting for prolonged periods or with exertion. And it sounds like you've had a physically active past. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, dear. That’s… blurry, too. I remember having the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… the standard stuff. Nothing major. And I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree when I was a boy. But that was ages ago. My wife handled all the doctor appointments and kept track of everything. Honestly, I just… went when she told me to. She was very organised. I… I think I had high blood pressure at one point? Or maybe that was my father? I'm really not sure. It's all a bit of a fog, I'm afraid. .
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common for details to be fuzzy, especially if someone else managed those things for a long time. We can try to piece things together. Do you happen to know if you have any allergies to medications?
