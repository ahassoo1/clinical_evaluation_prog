DOCTOR: Right. Velda Squiers, 45. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Well, I'm planning a cruise, you see. A lovely one to the Mediterranean. And the cruise line, they require a bit of medical information before I can go. Just to be sure I'm fit enough for it all, I suppose. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, quite some time, actually.
DOCTOR: A cruise, right. Yes, well, they’re being cautious, which is… something. “Fit enough.” Hmm. Okay. Let’s just get through this quickly. You said you haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time?
PATIENT: That's right. Not for anything major, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups when I was younger. My husband, bless him, he always handled all that. He kept everything organised. It’s been… a few years since then, naturally. I'm quite healthy, I believe. But the form… it asks about all sorts of things. And I thought it best to be accurate, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “healthy” is subjective. A few years is… significant. Let's start with the basics. Any significant medical problems at all that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but I recovered fully. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a pony when I was a girl. But that healed up nicely, too. I've never been hospitalised for anything serious. Just the normal scrapes and bumps, really. Nothing that would stop me from enjoying a cruise, I hope.
DOCTOR: Childhood illnesses, broken wrist… okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so. My husband always remembered those things, but I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, not that I recall. I eat most things, though I'm not overly fond of oysters. But that's a preference, not an allergy. Is that the sort of thing you mean?
DOCTOR: No, oysters don't count. I need to know if you've ever had a rash, trouble breathing, anything like that after taking a medication or eating something. Anything at all. Think carefully.
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I really can’t think of anything. Truly. I once had a bit of indigestion after eating a particularly spicy curry, but that wasn’t an allergy. And my husband, he gave me penicillin once, for a sore throat, and I was fine. I’m trying to think… We lived in a very rural area for many years, and I didn't come across many things I couldn't tolerate. Is it alright if I say I don’t think I have any allergies, then?
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I don’t take anything regularly. Not even vitamins, if you can believe it. I always thought if you eat a good diet, you shouldn’t need anything extra. My husband used to tease me about that, said I was too stubborn to take a pill if I could help it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no medications. Family history then. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… now there’s a tricky one. My mother, she had high blood pressure when she got older, I believe. And my father, he had a weak heart, but he lived to a good age, all things considered. My brother, he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my sister… she has arthritis, in her hands. Nothing too serious, but it bothers her sometimes. Is that what you’re looking for? Just the big things, I suppose?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis… okay. And what about you?
PATIENT: What about me? Well, as I said, I feel quite well. I’ve always been quite active, even now. I do a bit of gardening, and I enjoy walking. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. I haven’t had any major illnesses, no chest pain, no trouble breathing… I sleep alright, though I sometimes wake up a bit stiff in the mornings. Is that… worrying?
DOCTOR: Stiffness in the mornings… it's vague. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. Just to get a baseline. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam. That sounds sensible, I suppose. I haven’t been on one of those in a very long time. Is it going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: Just routine. Breathe normally. Heart sounds… regular, a bit fast, but not alarming. Lungs clear. Any recent cough or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, none at all. As I said, I've been perfectly well. Not a cough, not a sniffle. I did feel a bit breathless climbing the stairs last month, but I put that down to being out of practice. I haven't been doing as much walking lately, with the weather being so changeable. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not significantly. You're a bit overweight, but otherwise seem generally healthy. We need to talk about your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh. My blood pressure? Is it… bad? I don’t understand. I thought I felt quite well. And I wouldn’t say I’m overweight. Perhaps a little… pleasantly plump? My husband always said I had a good figure. But if you think it’s something to worry about… what should I do? Is it because of the cruise? Will I not be able to go?
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated. It doesn't necessarily mean you can't go on the cruise, but it does mean we need to address it. Being “pleasantly plump” doesn't change the numbers. We’ll need to monitor it and possibly start some medication. Let’s get some blood work done, just to be on the safe side. And I’ll write a referral to a cardiologist. It's better to be cautious.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medication? And a cardiologist? That sounds… rather serious. I thought I just needed a form signed for the cruise. I wasn’t expecting all this. Is it definitely necessary? I don’t like the sound of medication at all. And a cardiologist… Are you sure I’m that unwell? Perhaps… perhaps it was just a temporary blip? I was a little stressed filling out the form, thinking about all the arrangements for the cruise.
DOCTOR: Stress doesn't explain the blood pressure reading. And yes, it is necessary. Elevated blood pressure left untreated can lead to serious complications. I understand you’re hesitant, but I’m recommending it for your health. I’ll write the referrals. The lab is down the hall. And I'll write a prescription for a low dose blood pressure medication, just to start. It’s far better to address this now than to have a medical emergency on your cruise.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If you think it’s best… I suppose I should do what you recommend. Though I still don’t like the sound of it. I’ll go to the lab, then. And I’ll… I’ll pick up the prescription. But please, could you explain what the medication does, exactly? And what side effects I should look out for? I’m not very good with medical things, you see.
