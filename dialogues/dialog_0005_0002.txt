DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It’s…it’s my waterworks, I think. Not working so good, you see. It’s hard to… push it out, like. Old age, probably. I don’t remember exactly when it started, just… feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," right. Okay. So you're having difficulty… urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Urinating. That’s the fancy word, isn’t it? Yes, hard to get it going. And it…it doesn’t all come out, sometimes. Just… a little bit, then I have to wait. It’s a bother, really. Not painful, just… weak. Do you understand? I don’t want to be a trouble.
DOCTOR: Weak stream, difficulty initiating… alright. And this has been going on for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s the hard part. A while. A good long while. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? I get mixed up, you see. My husband, he notices things more. He probably knows better when it started. But he couldn’t come with me today. Something with the garden… tomatoes, I think. Big red ones. Sorry, I’m rambling. I just… I don't keep track of dates very well anymore.
DOCTOR: Six months… approximately. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color…? Hmm. Let me think. It looks like pee, dear. You know, the usual yellow. Maybe a little darker sometimes? I don't really pay attention, to be honest. I just go when I need to go, and hope for the best. Is it important what color it is? I drink plenty of water, I think. It’s hard to remember everything…especially what color my… water is. Sorry, I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It can be important. Darker urine can indicate dehydration, or other issues. Alright. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever…? No, no fever. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather. It’s been hot, hasn’t it? This summer is a scorcher. No chills, no shivering. Just…old. Feeling old, mostly. And this trouble with my…waterworks. It's just annoying, you know? I don’t want to have to keep going back and forth to the bathroom all the time. It’s tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That’s good, right? Not painful at all. Just…weak. And doesn’t all come out. Like a little trickle, then stops. Then I have to wait. It's not a sharp pain or anything, just… uncomfortable. And makes me feel like I haven't finished. Does that make sense? I wish I could explain it better. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. It's like… a sieve. Everything just slips through.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. Let me see… Well, there’s a little pill for my blood pressure. A small white one. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I think it is? A blue one. That’s all I can think of right now. My husband, he helps me keep track of those things. He’s very good at remembering. I just take what he gives me, when he gives it to me. I don't like taking too many pills, if I can help it. They make me feel funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that wasn’t a medicine, was it? Just a bee. My husband says I have tough skin. He always jokes about it. I don't think I’m allergic to anything, no. But I don’t really pay attention to those things. He handles all the doctor stuff, usually. Sorry, I’m not very good at this. I just want my waterworks to work right again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check, to get a better idea of what’s going on. It’ll be quick, and nothing to worry about. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Well, alright, dear. If you think it’s necessary. I haven’t had one of those in… a long time. My husband usually tells me if anything’s wrong, you see. But if you think it will help my waterworks… yes, I can lie down. Just tell me what to do. I'm a bit shaky on my feet these days, so please be careful. Where is this table, exactly?
DOCTOR: Right over there. Just take your time. I'll be right back to assist you. I need to wash my hands first. Don’t worry, it won’t be unpleasant. Just a quick look.
PATIENT: Alright… It’s a bit high, isn't it? My husband, he’s very strong, he would help me up there in a jiffy. Oh well. I’ll just… try to climb up. Slow and steady…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Stoffregen. Let’s just get you comfortable. I’m going to help you lie flat. Just relax. I’m going to palpate your abdomen, and then perform a quick neurological exam. Try not to tense up. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it? Is everything alright, dear? You're poking around quite a bit… My husband, he always tells me what he’s doing before he touches me. It makes me feel… safer. Is there something wrong? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Everything is fine, Mrs. Stoffregen. Just a routine check. We're just gathering information. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Bowel sounds present. Now, let’s talk about some possible causes. Given your age and symptoms, it could be a number of things, including an overactive bladder, or a weakened bladder muscle. We’ll need to run some tests to be sure. I’m going to order a urinalysis, and a post-void residual volume test. That just means we'll check how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Tests? Urinalysis… post-void… what was that again? My head is spinning. I don’t understand all those fancy words, dear. I just want my waterworks to work right. Is it going to hurt? Will I have to… be poked again? My husband always explains everything so clearly. He knows all the medical terms. I just get confused… and scared. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt, Mrs. Stoffregen. The urinalysis is just a simple urine sample. You’ll just need to provide a small amount of urine in a cup. And the post-void residual volume test is also painless. A technician will use a small device to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It’s very quick and straightforward. Really, nothing to worry about. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have a nurse escort you. After that, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A nurse…? Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. A nurse will help me with the… cup? I hope it’s not too difficult. I don't have very good balance these days, you see. And what if I can’t… go? I had a bit of trouble earlier. And the follow-up… How long will that be? I don’t want to take up too much of your time, dear. You have other patients, I’m sure. It’s just… all so confusing. And scary. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home. My husband… he could help me with all this.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Stoffregen, it's important that we investigate this issue. I understand you're anxious, but delaying testing won't make things better. I can certainly have a social worker speak with you about resources and support. And yes, a nurse will assist you with the urine sample. She’s very gentle and patient. I’m going to have her come in now. Please just try to relax, and follow her instructions. If you truly feel unwell, you can tell me immediately. But I believe we can get this sorted out, and get you feeling more comfortable.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. If you think so. A nurse… Please… tell her to be gentle. And… and explain everything slowly. I just want my waterworks to work right. And… and I miss my husband. He always knew what to do. .
