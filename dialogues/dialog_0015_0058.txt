DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Osumi. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I'm hoping to talk about losing some weight. It's... become a bit of a struggle lately, and I was wondering if there might be something – a medication, perhaps – that could help. It’s getting harder to do the things I enjoy.
DOCTOR: I see. Weight loss can be… challenging, certainly. And it’s good you’re addressing it. Before we discuss medications – which, frankly, are rarely a simple solution – I need to get a full picture of your health. Let’s start with the basics. When did you first notice this becoming a problem – the difficulty with activities, and the weight gain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I suppose it started… maybe six months ago? After my wife, Elena, passed. I wasn’t eating well, not much appetite, and then… well, then I started eating too much, comfort food mostly. It just kind of snowballed, I guess. I wasn’t as active either, naturally. It’s hard to motivate yourself sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. A significant life event like that can certainly disrupt routines. Six months ago…and the change in appetite and activity level coincided with your wife’s passing. Alright. And what sort of “comfort foods” are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… mostly things Elena used to make. Red rice, definitely. And pancit. And… lots of sweets. She was a fantastic baker. I wasn't much of a baker myself, so I’d just… enjoy what she made. Now, I try to make them myself, but they just don’t taste the same, and I end up eating more, trying to recapture… never mind. It's just food. But it’s been hard to stop.
DOCTOR: So, increased consumption of red rice, pancit, and sweets, specifically foods associated with your wife. And you've noticed that attempting to recreate those dishes isn't as satisfying, leading to further consumption. Do you find yourself craving these foods at specific times, or is it more general?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly evenings, I think. After dinner. I’ll be sitting in my chair, watching television, and just… feel this urge. It's not a hunger hunger, you know? It’s more like a… a wanting. A need for comfort, I suppose. And Elena always had something sweet to offer after dinner. It's a bad habit, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: A craving, particularly in the evenings, triggered by…emotional association. Right. And outside of these cravings, what does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually just toast and coffee. Not much of an appetite in the mornings. Lunch… sometimes a sandwich, sometimes leftovers from dinner. Nothing fancy. But dinner… dinner is usually a good-sized portion. I try to have rice with some fish or chicken, something healthy. It's just… after dinner is the problem, as we’ve said. I don’t usually eat much during the day, so I think my body’s trying to catch up at night.
DOCTOR: So, limited appetite at breakfast, moderate intake at lunch, and a substantial dinner followed by these evening cravings. Hmm. Now, let’s move beyond diet for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let’s see… the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a small pill for it. I take it every day. Otherwise, no. No diabetes, no heart trouble. Just the blood pressure. And… My knees are a bit creaky, but that’s just old age, I suppose. I get around alright. I don't think that's something the doctor ever worried about. Medicare covers the blood pressure pill, thankfully.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication. And some knee discomfort. Alright. And do you know the name of that medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I always forget these things. Let me see… It’s a small white pill. I pick it up every month from the pharmacy. The doctor just tells me to take one every day. I… I don't think I know the name of it, no. I just ask the pharmacist to refill it. Would my pharmacy have that information? Perhaps they can tell you?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know the specific medication, but we can obtain that information from your pharmacy records. That’s fine. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. I've been lucky, thankfully. Just the usual colds and flu over the years, but nothing serious enough to need a hospital. I try to take care of myself, you know? Mostly.
DOCTOR: No hospitalizations. Good. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. That was… oh, goodness, must have been forty years ago now. Other than that, no. No other surgeries. It wasn’t a big deal, really. Everything healed up fine.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy forty years ago. Alright. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a difficult question. My mother, she had… I think it was high blood pressure, like me. And she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he was a healthy man, mostly. Lived a long life. But my sister, she had… cancer, I believe. Breast cancer. But that was a long time ago. It's hard to remember everything now. It was a long time ago and we didn't talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: History of high blood pressure and heart trouble in mother, breast cancer in sister. Alright. Now, do you currently use any other medications besides the blood pressure pill, or any supplements, vitamins, herbal remedies?
PATIENT: No, no. Just the blood pressure pill. I don’t really believe in all those vitamins and supplements. I figure a good diet is better than any pill. Though, as we’ve established, that’s not always easy. I haven’t taken anything else in years. Unless you count the occasional ibuprofen for my knees, but that’s not very often.
DOCTOR: Only medication is the blood pressure pill, occasional ibuprofen. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me about your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be very active. I enjoyed fishing, gardening… walking. But since Elena passed… it's been harder to motivate myself. I mostly stay around the house. I walk to the store sometimes, a short walk, but that’s about it. I sit a lot, I’m afraid. I try to help around the house, but it's not the same without Elena.
DOCTOR: Reduced activity level since wife’s passing. Primarily sedentary. Alright. And do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Never smoked a day in my life. Elena didn’t approve, and I didn’t want to upset her. It's a bad habit, and I always thought it was foolish. I’ve always been careful about my health, even if I’m not doing a very good job of it now.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little. Sometimes, on the weekends, I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner. Just one. It helps me relax. But that’s it. Not every weekend, mind you. Just… sometimes. Elena enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner too. It’s hard to… never mind.
DOCTOR: Occasional light alcohol consumption. Alright. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been very lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. Though, I don't eat much these days. I think that about covers everything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi. That's a very thorough overview. Thank you. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then we’ll discuss some possible options. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no visible inflammation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Pulses are present and equal in all extremities. Your weight is 80 kilograms, and your height is 170 centimeters. That gives you a BMI of 27.7, which is considered overweight. All right. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it appears you are dealing with a combination of factors contributing to weight gain - emotional eating following your wife’s passing, decreased activity level, and potentially a family predisposition. Let’s discuss some options. Before we get to potential medications, which I’m hesitant to prescribe immediately, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weight gain, such as thyroid problems or diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work sounds good. I want to make sure we're covering all the bases. I trust your judgment. I just... I want to feel better, you know? And I don't want to rely on pills if I don't have to. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your A1C to get a better sense of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results – which typically take a few days – we can discuss them and create a more tailored plan. In the meantime, I’d recommend starting a food diary to help us identify triggers for your emotional eating. And even a small increase in activity, like a 15-minute walk each day, can make a difference. Do you think you can manage that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can certainly manage that. A food diary and a short walk… that doesn’t seem too difficult. I’ll start that today. It’s… it’s good to have a plan, you know? It gives me something to focus on. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate it very much. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment now?
DOCTOR: Yes, let's schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, once your lab results are available. That will give us plenty of time to review everything and discuss the next steps. We’ll meet here, same time. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfect. Two weeks from today is fine. Thank you again. I feel much better having spoken with you. I’ll be sure to start the food diary and the walking today. I won’t keep you any longer. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you once more. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Osumi. I’ll see you in two weeks. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day as well.
