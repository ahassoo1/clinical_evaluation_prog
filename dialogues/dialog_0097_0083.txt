DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Georgiou, you say? That’s… a name. Not like the names I’m used to, but that’s neither here nor there. I’m here because… well, I just thought a little encouragement from a doctor might be nice. You know, a card. A “Get Well” card. It’s not… serious, nothing like that. Just feeling a little low, that's all. My ex-wife, she always liked those little things. Made her feel better, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It's perfectly alright to want a little check-in, and wanting to feel supported is important. It's good you're thinking of your well-being. And you're right, a little encouragement can go a long way. While I can't exactly prescribe a get-well card, I’m happy to talk things over and see if there's anything contributing to you feeling low. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about what "feeling low" means for you?
PATIENT: Well, it's… hard to explain. It's not like a pain, you understand? Just… everything feels a little… gray. Not happy, not sad, just… there. I used to be a very active man, very busy with work, you see. Stationary Engineer, that's what I am. Boilers, pressure, all that. Very important work. But now… well, things are slower. Retired, mostly. Not much to get excited about these days. My son, he tries to get me out, but… it’s just not the same. And my ex-wife… she always knew how to cheer me up. Now… it’s just me. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. A big change like retirement can definitely bring about feelings like that – a loss of purpose, a shift in routine. It sounds like you miss the structure and engagement of your work, and the connection with your ex-wife. It’s completely normal to feel a little… gray, as you put it, when things change. Have you noticed this feeling come on gradually, or was there a particular event that seemed to trigger it?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t one thing. Just… time. After the divorce, it was rough, of course. But I kept busy with work. Work was my life, you see? Then… slowly, things at the plant started changing. Newer equipment, less need for… well, for someone like me. They let a few of us go. Said we were… redundant. Not a nice word, that. And then… the silence. Too much time to think, you understand? That’s when things started feeling… off. It’s hard to explain. It's not sadness, exactly. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. "Empty" is a good word for it. It sounds like the loss of your work, and the routine it provided, has been a significant shift. And it's not uncommon for those kinds of changes to impact how we feel. Now, sometimes these feelings can be related to other things too. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite lately?
PATIENT: Sleep… not so good. I toss and turn a lot. Wake up in the middle of the night thinking about… things. Old times, mostly. Things I should have done different. And appetite… not much of one, to be honest. My son, he worries about me. Keeps trying to get me to eat more. But food… it just doesn't taste the same anymore. Everything feels… bland. Like the color is gone. Does that make sense, Doctor? I used to enjoy a good meal, a nice roast chicken… now it’s just… something I have to do.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Kammer. Those changes in sleep and appetite, along with the feelings of emptiness and loss of enjoyment, are all things we often see when someone is experiencing what we call low mood. It sounds like you’re describing symptoms of what might be mild depression. Now, I want to be clear, I'm not making a definitive diagnosis right now. But it’s good we're talking about this. To get a better picture, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Depression? Now hold on a minute. That sounds… serious. I’m not sick, Doctor. Just a little… down. My ex-wife, she used to get a little… blue sometimes. But she always bounced back. I’m not like that. Other symptoms? Let me think… I get tired easily. Very easily. Even just walking to the store feels like a big effort. And… well, sometimes I just don't want to get out of bed. It's hard to explain. Everything feels… pointless. And… I used to enjoy fixing things around the house. Now… I look at a leaky faucet and just… sigh. It feels like too much effort. Is that what you mean? It’s just… everything feels like a chore. A big, pointless chore.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kammer. And you’re right to question it. It’s not about being “sick,” it’s about recognizing when your feelings are impacting your quality of life. And it sounds like they are. The fatigue, the loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, the feeling of things being pointless… those are all things we look at. It’s a spectrum, and it doesn't necessarily mean it’s anything severe. But it is something we should address. To help me get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been feeling hopeless or having any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on now! Harm myself? Doctor, are you serious? What kind of question is that? I’m a practical man! A Stationary Engineer! We fix things, we don’t… well, you know. No! Absolutely not! I would never… That’s a terrible question, Doctor. I’m just… feeling a little low. A little sad. A little empty. That’s all. I just wanted a "Get Well" card. Is that so much to ask? It’s not like I’m… broken. Just… needing a little encouragement. This is starting to feel very… serious. And frankly, I’m not sure I like it.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be concerned, Mr. Kammer, and I sincerely apologize if my previous question was upsetting or made you feel uncomfortable. It's a standard part of assessing someone’s overall well-being, but I should have phrased it more carefully and been more sensitive to your feelings. It was not my intention to imply anything about you. You're right, you came in here hoping for a little encouragement, and you deserve to feel heard and respected. It sounds like what you're experiencing is causing you distress, and we’re going to address that. Would you be open to discussing some options that might help you feel more like yourself again?
PATIENT: Well… that’s… better. I appreciate you apologizing, Doctor. I just… I don’t like feeling like I’m being… interrogated. I’m a simple man. I just want to feel a little better. Options? What kind of options? I’m not one for… pills, you understand? I’ve always been a practical man. I fix things myself. I don’t need… medication. Maybe… maybe talking about it is enough? A little advice? That's all I really want. And maybe… maybe that "Get Well" card wouldn’t be such a bad idea after all. If it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. No pills at all unless you decide that's something you want to explore. We can definitely start with talking things through, and I’m happy to offer advice. And getting you a "Get Well" card is absolutely no trouble at all. Consider it done. Often, simple things like setting small goals, reconnecting with hobbies, or even just making a conscious effort to socialize can make a big difference. Before we delve into those, and to make sure I haven't missed anything, would you mind if I quickly review your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s fine, I suppose. It's not much, to be honest. High blood pressure, a little arthritis in my knees, nothing serious. I see the doctor every year for a check-up. Medicare covers everything, thankfully. My son takes care of all the paperwork. He’s a good boy. Always looking out for me. Go ahead, Doctor. Review whatever you need to. Just… please don't ask me about harming myself again. It’s… upsetting. I came here for a "Get Well" card, not a… a mental health evaluation.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. No further questions about that. And thank you for letting me know. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension about ten years ago, currently managed with a low dose of Lisinopril. And some osteoarthritis, primarily in the knees, which you manage with over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed. No recent surgeries. Family history shows your father had heart disease and your mother had type 2 diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. Lucky, I guess. My son always tells me I should be more careful, but I've always been a tough old bird. My father… yes, he had a bad heart. Worked too hard, I think. Never took time for himself. My mother… she loved to bake. Too many sweets, I suppose. But she was a good woman. Always made me feel loved. Is that… is that all you need to know? Can we… can we get back to talking about how I’m feeling? And maybe… maybe that "Get Well" card? I’d really appreciate it. It’s just a little something to… brighten my day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. That’s plenty for now. And yes, let’s definitely focus on how you’re feeling. The “Get Well” card is already on my list, consider it a done deal. It sounds like you've experienced some loss and change recently – the loss of your work, a shift in your routine, and maybe some sadness about your parents. And that can be really tough, even for a “tough old bird” like you. What do you think would be the most helpful thing for you right now?
PATIENT: Well… if I’m being honest, Doctor… just feeling like someone… cares. My ex-wife, she always knew how to make me feel important. My son, he tries, but he’s busy with his own life, you see? Just… talking. Maybe a little advice. And that “Get Well” card… it sounds silly, I know, but it would… mean something. It would show someone… cares. I’m not asking for a miracle, Doctor. Just a little encouragement. Just a little something to… brighten my day. And… maybe you could recommend a good book? Something to take my mind off things. I used to enjoy a good detective novel. Something with a little… mystery. It would keep me busy. Keep my mind sharp. Does that make sense? It's just… boredom. It's eating me alive.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. Feeling cared for and having something to occupy your mind are incredibly important. It’s not silly at all. And I absolutely can recommend a good book. How about “The Thursday Murder Club” by Richard Osman?
PATIENT: “The Thursday Murder Club”? Never heard of it. But… a murder mystery, you say? That sounds… interesting. Maybe it would take my mind off things. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. For not… judging. And for the card. It means… more than you know. So… what happens now? Do I need to come back for more… appointments? I don’t want to waste your time. I’m just an old man with a little… sadness. It's not like I'm… sick. But… maybe talking to someone is helping. Just a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. You're not wasting my time at all. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can. And you’re absolutely right, sometimes talking things through is the biggest help. As for follow-up, I’d like to see you back in a month, just to check in and see how you’re doing. We can discuss how the book is going, if the talking is still helping, and see if there’s anything else we can do to support you. No pressure at all, just a routine check-up. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for the book and a note to the front desk for that "Get Well" card. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: A prescription for a book? Now that’s… something. You’re a very… unusual doctor, Doctor Georgiou. But a good unusual, I think. No, I don’t think I have any other questions. Just… thank you. For everything. And… could you maybe write “Get Well Soon” on the card? It sounds… friendly. And… thank you again. For not judging. For listening. And for the book. And the card. I think… I think I'm starting to feel a little better. Just a little. It’s good to talk. It really is. It’s good to know someone… cares. I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad I could help, even a little. And you're right, sometimes just talking is enough. I’ll have the front desk get that card and the “prescription” ready for you. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes or if you need anything at all. And I look forward to seeing you next month. Take care of yourself, Mr. Kammer. And enjoy the book!
