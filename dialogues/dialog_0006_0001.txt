DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Johney Knoch. Thank you for seeing me, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about the smoking, you see. I’ve been at it a long time.
DOCTOR: Long time… alright. And what exactly brings you in today regarding the smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I want to stop, precisely. It's more… my daughter, she's been quite insistent. And truthfully, getting older… it’s becoming a bit more difficult to breathe, especially when I’m doing things around the house. It’s not a pleasant feeling. She worries, you see, and I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Okay, so breathlessness is the main concern, and your daughter’s encouragement is… a factor. How long have you been noticing this breathlessness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s crept up on me, really. Maybe… the last year or so? It started with just getting winded climbing the stairs, you know? Now, even a simple walk to the mailbox leaves me a little… shaky. It’s not constant, mind you. But it’s definitely noticeable. And getting worse, I fear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much do you smoke, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Ah, that’s… a difficult question. It varies, I suppose. But on average? Perhaps a pack and a half a day. I’ve been smoking since I was a young man, you see. Lithuanian cigarettes, mostly, when I can get them. Otherwise, whatever is available. I don’t like the American brands as much. It’s a bad habit, I know.
DOCTOR: A pack and a half a day for… how many years would you say, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… I started when I was fifteen. That would be… sixty years, give or take. Sixty years of smoking. It’s a long time. A very long time. I’ve tried to cut back a few times, but… it’s difficult. Very difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, sixty years… And have you experienced any other symptoms along with the breathlessness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Well, I do cough a bit in the mornings, nothing too severe. And sometimes, a little… wheezing. Not every day, but often enough to be bothersome. I also tire more easily than I used to, even without the smoking, to be honest. Perhaps that's just age, though. It's hard to say. My gums bleed sometimes when I brush, too. Is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing, wheezing, fatigue, and bleeding gums. We'll need to investigate all of that. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, thankfully. A little ache in my joints sometimes, like many older men, I suppose, but nothing I would call pain. Not chest pain, or anything like that. Just the usual aches and creaks of getting older. Is bleeding gums something to be worried about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be, Mr. Knoch. It's often related to gum disease, which can be worse with smoking. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then we can talk about some options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. Please, proceed whenever you are ready. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for me… I'll start with your lungs. Just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I hear some wheezing in your lungs. Your oxygen saturation is… lower than I’d like to see, 92%. I'd like to check your heart rate. Heart sounds are a bit irregular. Okay. Now, if you wouldn't mind opening your mouth, I'm just going to take a quick look at your gums and throat.
PATIENT: Very well. A little irregular, you say? That doesn't sound good. I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, I confess. I usually just… try to ignore things. Hopefully, it's not too serious. Is it the smoking, do you think? Everything seems to lead back to that dreadful habit.
DOCTOR: Yes, your gums are quite inflamed, and there’s some bleeding. It’s consistent with gum disease, exacerbated by smoking. Your heart rhythm is slightly irregular – we’ll need to investigate that further. And the lower oxygen levels are also concerning. Okay, Mr. Knoch, based on what I’m seeing, and your history, we have a few things to address. You have clear signs of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, likely caused by smoking. Your gum disease needs treatment. And the irregular heartbeat requires further investigation. We'll need to get some blood work done, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I'm also going to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Do you have any allergies to medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. COPD… that sounds… serious. And an EKG? Chest X-ray? I suppose that’s to be expected, given everything. No allergies, no. None that I know of, anyway. My wife, God rest her soul, always handled the medications. I just… took what she gave me. I haven’t had to worry about such things in years. Will these tests… will they be painful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Knoch. The blood work is just a simple prick of the finger or arm. And the EKG is completely painless. They just put some sticky pads on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray is also painless – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The most important thing right now is to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Then we can discuss a treatment plan. Now, I know you've been smoking for a very long time, and quitting is difficult. But it's the single most important thing you can do for your health. We can explore options like nicotine replacement therapy, or even medication to help reduce your cravings. Are you… at all interested in talking about quitting?
PATIENT: Interested… yes. Willing… that is another matter entirely. Sixty years, Doctor. Sixty years of smoking. It's… a part of me, I suppose. But… if it is truly the best thing for my health, then I suppose I have to try. My daughter would be so relieved. Nicotine replacement… I’ve heard of patches. Would those really help? I’m afraid of the withdrawal… the shaking, the irritability. It sounds… unpleasant. But perhaps… perhaps it’s a price worth paying. Tell me about the patches, Doctor. And the medication, if you think it’s appropriate.
DOCTOR: It is difficult, Mr. Knoch, and withdrawal symptoms are common. But there are ways to manage them. Nicotine patches deliver a controlled dose of nicotine to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. We can start with a low dose and gradually reduce it over time. There are also medications like bupropion and varenicline that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. They work differently, and we can discuss which one might be best for you, considering your medical history. I’m going to write you a referral to a smoking cessation program. They have counselors who can provide support and guidance. I’ll also order the blood work, EKG, and chest X-ray. And I’ll give you a prescription for some initial nicotine patches to get you started. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done and starting the smoking cessation program. It's going to be a process, but I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. A program, medication, patches… better than trying to do it alone, certainly. I suppose I was hoping for a… quick fix, if such a thing exists. But I understand it’s a process. The program… is it expensive? And how long does it usually last? I’m… not wealthy, Doctor. And I don’t have insurance, unfortunately. I'm also a bit worried about side effects from the medication. What are the most common ones? I don’t want to trade one problem for another.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Knoch. The cost of the program varies, but I know of a few programs in the area that offer sliding scale fees based on income. I’ll give you a list with contact information and information about their financial assistance options. As for side effects, bupropion can sometimes cause insomnia or dry mouth. Varenicline can cause nausea or vivid dreams. However, these side effects are usually mild and temporary. We can discuss the risks and benefits of each medication and choose the one that’s right for you. I’ll also write a note to the program explaining your financial situation. They may be able to offer additional assistance. I’m also going to prescribe you some over-the-counter cough drops to help soothe your throat. And I recommend drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. Here’s the list of smoking cessation programs, and here’s a prescription for the cough drops. Please call the program as soon as possible to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: This is… a great deal of information, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your patience. Perhaps I should just call the program and see what they offer. I suppose the best course of action is to gather as much information as possible, then make a decision. No, I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. Just… thank you. For everything. It’s… comforting to know that there are resources available. And that I’m not alone in this. I will call the program tomorrow. And I will try to be… optimistic. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. Remember, it's a journey, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And I look forward to hearing how it goes. Take care of yourself, and please, try to be kind to yourself.
