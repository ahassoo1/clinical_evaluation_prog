DOCTOR: Hi Werner, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, well, let's get this over with. I'm here for a check-up before... well, before I get a little work done. Cosmetic surgery. Don't really see what all the fuss is about needing a doctor's say-so for it, but they insisted.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-operative check-up for cosmetic surgery. That's perfectly reasonable – the surgeon wants to make sure you're healthy enough for the procedure. It's standard practice, really. Let me just pull up your record here… Werner Orwin, 81 years old. Alright. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Honestly, it's…fine. I get by. I used to be strong as an ox, you know, working with terrazzo. Real physical work. Nowadays, not so much. I walk a bit, mostly. And I eat…well, I eat. What do you want to know exactly? This feels like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Werner. It is helpful to get a sense of your activity level and general diet. "Getting by" is a good starting point. Let's try this. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately – anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness. At my age? What doesn't ache? My knees, of course. Always my knees. And sometimes my back acts up, especially if the weather's changing. Can't stand damp weather. Other than that… no, not really. I’m not one to complain. Don’t have the patience for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back pain, worse with damp weather. That's good to know. Do these pains limit your ability to do things – like walking, or getting around the house?
PATIENT: Limit? Well, yes, a bit. I don’t run marathons, if that's what you're asking. I take things slower. I can still get around, but I don't bounce around like a young lad. I need to rest more often, that's for sure. And I definitely don't do heavy lifting anymore. Though, honestly, I haven’t done any lifting in years. Not since… well, never mind. Point is, I manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, “manage” with some limitations due to knee and back pain. Do you notice any stiffness in your joints, especially in the mornings?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Yes, now that you mention it. I'm not exactly a spring chicken, you know. It takes a bit to get going in the mornings. A little creaking and groaning, nothing dramatic. I move around for a bit, and it loosens up. It’s just…old age. Don't need to write a whole report on it.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. Just gathering information. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees or back?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not that I've noticed. I would have mentioned it, wouldn’t I? I’m not completely oblivious. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. It won’t take long, I promise. Have you had any recent falls or injuries?
PATIENT: Falls? No! Absolutely not. I’m careful. I haven’t fallen in… well, a very long time. I'm not clumsy, thank you very much. Look, I’ve been perfectly healthy my whole life, barring the usual aches and pains of getting old. Is there a point to all this? The surgeon should just trust me, honestly. I know my own body.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Werner. The surgeon is simply covering all bases to ensure a safe procedure. It's a standard protocol, and frankly, it's part of my job to ask these questions. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Years ago. They put me on pills for a while, but I stopped taking them. Didn't like the way they made me feel. Been managing it on my own since. Diet, mostly. And avoiding stress. Other than that… no. Nothing serious. Just the usual old man stuff. I’m remarkably resilient, you know. I've always been a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, currently managed with diet. Do you know what your blood pressure readings were approximately when you were diagnosed, or more recently?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was a long time ago. The doctor told me the numbers, of course, but I don’t go around memorizing medical statistics. It was…high-ish, I suppose? That's why he gave me the pills. But like I said, I stopped taking them and it hasn't bothered me since. Are we nearly finished here? This is getting rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Werner. I understand your frustration. Given your history of high blood pressure, and that you are currently managing it without medication, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It's a standard precaution. Then, if everything looks stable, we can proceed with a brief physical exam to assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The quicker we finish, the better. But don't expect miracles, I'm an old man, not a racehorse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is 158/82. That’s a bit elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to quickly check your reflexes and range of motion in your knees and back, if you don’t mind. This will just help me assess how everything is functioning.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly. Look, I told you, I’m old. Things don't work the same way anymore. But fine, get on with it. Just… be gentle. I don’t want to end up flat on my back. I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Knees have limited range of motion, with some crepitus. Reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Back examination reveals some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar region. No neurological deficits noted. Okay, Werner. Based on this brief examination, and your history, it seems you have some expected age-related changes – limited range of motion in your knees, some tenderness in your lower back, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Given your history of high blood pressure that is currently uncontrolled, I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to get it properly managed. It’s important for the safety of any surgical procedure, and for your overall health. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary care physician? Well, I used to. Old Dr. Henderson, retired years ago. Haven’t really bothered with one since. I manage. Honestly, I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself. But fine, if you insist, I’ll… think about it. But I’m not making any promises. So, can I finally get this clearance now? The surgeon is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Werner. Given your insistence, and the fact that you are proceeding with an elective cosmetic surgery, I will provide a limited clearance, contingent on you scheduling an appointment with a primary care physician within two weeks to address your blood pressure. However, I strongly recommend postponing the surgery until your blood pressure is under control. Uncontrolled hypertension increases the risk of complications during and after surgery. I’m going to write a note to your surgeon outlining my concerns and recommendations. Do you understand these conditions?
PATIENT: Conditions? Yes, yes. I understand. Two weeks to see a doctor. Fine. I'll do it. Just to get you off my back. And you're telling the surgeon all this? I suppose that's your job. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a fuss over nothing. I’ve lived a long life, and I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions. But fine. I understand. Now, can I have a piece of paper saying I’m cleared? So I can get this over with?
DOCTOR: Here you go. This outlines my findings and recommendations. It states I have provided limited clearance, contingent upon follow-up with a primary care physician within two weeks. Please, take this to your surgeon. And seriously consider postponing the surgery until your blood pressure is under control. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Finally. Thank you. Or, well, not really. But you know what I mean. Just…goodbye.
