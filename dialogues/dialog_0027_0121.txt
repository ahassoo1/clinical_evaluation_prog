DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a while now, I guess. Don't bother me too much, but… well, figured I should get ‘em looked at.
DOCTOR: Alright, dry eyes. It’s quite common, especially as we get older. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Older, huh? Tell me somethin' I don't know. Feels like sand in ‘em sometimes. And… blurry. Not all the time, just when I'm lookin’ at things far away, I think. I do a lot of work outside, you see. Cement work. Gets dusty. Maybe that’s it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Dust certainly could be a factor. And cement work... yes, that’s… irritating. Okay. Have you noticed any pain, redness, or discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain, no. Not really. Redness… sometimes, maybe? Hard to tell. I ain't lookin' at 'em that close all day. And discharge? Nope. Just dry. Real dry. Like I said. Is this gonna take long? I got a job site to get back to.
DOCTOR: No, we'll try to be quick. Let's just do a quick exam, just to get a better look. I want to check your vision, and then I'll take a look at your eyes. Can you read the letters on that chart over there for me?
PATIENT: Vision chart, huh? Alright. I used to have good eyes. Real good. Cement work… well, it ain’t easy on the body. Let me see… uh… is that an 'E'? Or a 'C'? Hard to tell. They're blurry, Doc. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I see what you mean. It does seem a bit reduced. Alright, let's take a look at your eyes now. If you could just sit back down, I'll use a light to get a closer look. This won't hurt, just a quick shine in each eye.
PATIENT: Shine a light, huh? Alright. As long as it don't take long. My boss, he ain't real patient. Just get it done, Doc. I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright… I see some mild dryness of the conjunctiva, and a few superficial irregularities on the cornea, likely from the dust. It doesn't appear to be anything too severe at this point. Do you wear any glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed ‘em before. Always had good eyes. Like I said, 'til this cement work. Just figured it was the dust. Everything's always dusty. Is there somethin' I can do about it? Some drops, maybe? I don’t wanna have to stop workin’.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. It sounds like you’re experiencing dry eye, likely exacerbated by your work environment. We can certainly try some lubricating eye drops. Over-the-counter artificial tears would be a good first step. I recommend using them four times a day, even when your eyes don't feel particularly dry. We can also discuss options like a thicker gel or ointment for nighttime use to help keep your eyes moisturized while you sleep. Would you like me to write you a prescription for some stronger drops, just in case the over-the-counter ones aren't enough?
PATIENT: Stronger drops… well, I don’t know about prescriptions. Seems like a lot for just dry eyes. I’d rather try the drops first, the regular kind. If those don’t work, then maybe. I just wanna get back to work, Doc. Can I just get the drops, please? The regular kind. And how long should I use ‘em?
DOCTOR: Alright, absolutely. We’ll start with the over-the-counter artificial tears. Use them four times a day, as needed. If you don’t see any improvement after a week or two, or if your symptoms worsen, then come back and we’ll discuss other options. I’ll print you out a little handout with some more information about dry eye and how to manage it. Also, I strongly recommend wearing some safety glasses or goggles while you're working to protect your eyes from the dust. It’s the best way to prevent further irritation. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Safety glasses… yeah, I should probably do that. My old man always told me to, but… I never really listened. Nah, I think that’s it. Just the drops and the glasses. Thanks, Doc. I gotta get back to work now. Hopefully, this’ll fix it. Appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Mr. Pipolo. And please, don't hesitate to come back if you're not seeing any improvement. Have a good day, and be careful out there. .
