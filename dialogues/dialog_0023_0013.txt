DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It feels like there's always some left, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, you say. And you feel like you're not completely emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That's right. Not completely. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… full. Even after I think I’m done. I have to… strain a little sometimes to get the rest out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how often would you say you're urinating throughout the day?
PATIENT: Well, that's a good question. I don't really count, you know? But… probably every couple of hours. Maybe six or seven times a day? It feels… normal for that part, just… doesn't finish emptying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any burning or discomfort while you're urinating?
PATIENT: No, sir. No burning. Like I said, it's not painful while I go. It's just… afterwards, that feeling of not being empty. It doesn’t hurt to go, just… doesn’t feel complete.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Hmm. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. It looks… normal, I think. Yellow, like it always is. I don’t notice any bad smell. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, you know? I don’t really look closely.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: No, sir. No fever, no chills. And my back feels alright. Just… old. You know how it is when you get to be my age. It creaks a little, but no pain. Nothing like a fever or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been alright since then. Other than that… not really. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I don’t think I have diabetes. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and berries.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one, sir. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. For my blood pressure. That’s all. I don’t take anything else. Just that little white pill every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And… well, my wife, she passed away last year and I was in the hospital then, but that wasn’t for anything I had. Just… being sad. Aside from that, no. No surgeries, no hospital stays.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. Never had a reaction to any medicine. I don't have trouble with bee stings or anything like that either.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had some trouble with her kidneys when she got older. And my father… he had a weak heart. But other than that, not much I can think of. We didn't really talk about these things much when I was growing up. It wasn’t something we… shared.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information, Mr. Hilber. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We’ll start with checking your blood pressure, and then I'll listen to your abdomen and do a digital rectal exam. This is to assess your prostate, as that can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms like you’re describing. It's a standard procedure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s… alright. I understand. My prostate, you say? The doctor mentioned that before, a while back. I’d rather know what’s going on, if that makes sense. So yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, if you could lie down on your back for me, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Sounds normal. No unusual noises. Now, for the rectal exam, I need you to bend over at the waist, or lie on your side. It might be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. …Hmm. Prostate is enlarged, and feels slightly firm. Not acutely tender, but definitely enlarged. I’m noting some residual urine as well. Okay. That confirms my suspicion. I believe you’re experiencing symptoms related to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a common condition in men your age. We’ll need to do a urinalysis and possibly a PSA blood test to get a clearer picture and rule out other issues. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Benign… what was that now? Something about my… prostate? It’s enlarged, you say? And that’s causing the trouble with my water? A PSA blood test… I don't know what that is, either. I… understand you said I understand, but… could you explain that a little slower, maybe? Like I’m a… well, like I’m an old man who doesn’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hilber. I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. Let's start with the prostate. It's a small gland, about the size of a walnut, located below your bladder. It produces fluid that’s part of semen. As men get older, it tends to enlarge. We call that Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. “Benign” means it's not cancerous, and “hyperplasia” just means it's grown larger than it should be. When it gets too big, it can press on the urethra – the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. That pressure makes it harder to empty your bladder completely, which explains why you're feeling like you can’t get all the urine out. It also makes you have to go more often. That's what's likely happening with you. Now, a PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of prostate-specific antigen. It's another way of checking your prostate. It can help us rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. It’s very common. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That… that makes a lot more sense. Like a… a squeezed pipe. The prostate is squeezing the pipe. And the PSA test… just another way to check. Alright. Squeezed pipe. I can remember that. So, it’s not… it’s not bad bad, like cancer? Just… old? And you want to check to make sure?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Hilber. You've got it. It's not necessarily "bad bad," like cancer. It's a very common condition as men age. Think of it as the prostate getting bigger, and causing a bit of trouble with the plumbing. We want to run a PSA test, and a urinalysis - that's just a urine sample, to look for any signs of infection - to make sure everything else is okay, and to rule out anything more serious. If those tests come back normal, we can discuss treatment options. These can include lifestyle changes, medication to help relax the prostate, or, in some cases, a small procedure to remove some of the tissue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Tests… and then talk about what to do. I can do that. Lifestyle changes… what does that mean? And medication… I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it. But I understand. You have to check first. So, where do I go for the tests? And when?
DOCTOR: Okay. Lifestyle changes can be simple things like limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles – we call those Kegel exercises. They can help improve bladder control. As for the tests, the lab is just down the hall, to your left. I’ll have Nurse Evelyn draw the blood for the PSA test and give you a cup for the urine sample. She’ll explain everything. She's very good. She's available right now, so you can go ahead and do that. It shouldn't take long. Then, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A week… alright. I can wait a week. And Nurse Evelyn… down the hall, to the left. Simple things… less water, no coffee, and… exercises. I’ll try. Less coffee will be hard. But I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. That… that makes me feel a lot better. Knowing what’s going on, I mean.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. Nurse Evelyn will take good care of you. And don't worry too much about the coffee; we'll work on it. Remember, we're here to help you manage this. Do you have any other questions before you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: No, sir. I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Versace. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I’ll go see Nurse Evelyn now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. You have a good day, and please let me know if anything changes or if you have any concerns. And try not to worry too much.
