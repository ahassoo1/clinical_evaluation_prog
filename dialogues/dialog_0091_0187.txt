DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Sobkowicz. Yes. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes fast sometimes. Blood pressure, you say? Doctor, I don't have time for this. Just fix it. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. We will certainly get to the bottom of what’s going on. “Funny” in the chest and a fast heartbeat are important things to investigate. To help me understand, could you describe what you mean by “funny”?
PATIENT: Describe? What do you mean describe? It… it feels like a bird flapping around in there. A small bird. And sometimes… tight. Like a belt. You understand English, yes? Don’t need a long explanation. Just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. My wife says I complain too much. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand perfectly. A “flapping” sensation and tightness—that’s very helpful. And it’s good you mentioned the tightness. Could you tell me when this started?
PATIENT: When? Hmm. Hard to say. Maybe… a month? Two months? Things get… mixed up, you know? Old age. It comes and goes. Sometimes when I walk the dog. Sometimes just… sitting. Doesn’t seem to matter. Not like I do much walking these days. The dog does most of it. A little poodle. Very energetic. More energetic than me, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s been occurring for roughly a month or two, and it doesn't seem consistently related to activity. Does anything relieve the discomfort, or make it worse besides walking?
PATIENT: Relieve? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I try to ignore it. That’s what I do. Ignore it. Makes it go away faster. Sometimes… if I sit very still. But I can’t sit still all day. My wife would have a fit. And walking… makes it worse, like you said. But I need to walk the dog! It’s… a problem. A small problem. Don't make a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Sobkowicz. It sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, even if you’re trying to manage it on your own. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I get tired, of course. Old man. Always tired. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… woozy. And… I think my ankles are a little swollen. Maybe. My wife noticed. She notices everything. Honestly, just fix the chest thing. That’s what's bothering me. All the rest… just old age. Don't need to write a novel about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to focus on the chest discomfort, Mr. Sobkowicz, but these other symptoms – the fatigue, dizziness, and ankle swelling – are important pieces of the puzzle. They may be related to the chest issue, or they could point to something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I perform a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: Examination? You want to poke and prod an old man? Really? Fine. Get it over with. But don’t take all day. I have things to do. And be gentle! My bones aren't what they used to be. Honestly, all this fuss… My wife told me to come. She worries too much. Just… hurry up. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your ankles. It shouldn’t take long. Your heart rate is a little elevated, around 98 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which is common in individuals your age, but we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 158/82. That's a bit elevated. Finally, let’s take a look at your ankles. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as your wife mentioned. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease?
