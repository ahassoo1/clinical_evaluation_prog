DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up again. Been high for a bit now, and my regular doctor wanted me to get it checked out by someone… a specialist, she called it. I mostly just make pies, don’t really understand all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your regular doctor wanted you to see me for your blood pressure. That's perfectly alright, we can definitely take a look at that. “Specialist” just means I focus on family medicine, so I see a lot of blood pressure issues. Now, when you say “actin’ up,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I get these headaches, mostly in the back of my neck. And sometimes I feel dizzy, kinda lightheaded. It don’t last long, usually just a minute or two, but it’s enough to make me nervous. It’s been happenin’ more often lately, that’s why I came. Mostly just worried, to be honest. I need to keep bakin’ those pies for the market!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Headaches and dizziness can certainly be worrying. So, these headaches are mostly in the back of your neck, and you've been noticing them more frequently recently. About how long would you say this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe a couple of months ago? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda blurs together when you get to be my age. But definitely worse in the last month or so. It weren't botherin' me too bad before, just a little somethin’ now and then. Now it's… well, now it's a nuisance. I don’t like feelin’ off when I’m workin’ in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, worsening over the last month. That gives me a good starting point. And you said it interferes with your work in the kitchen. Besides the headaches and dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Just tired, I guess. But I'm always tired, to be honest. Been bakin’ since I was a little girl, and it takes it outta ya. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I figured that was just my eyes gettin’ old. I got those glasses, you know. But nothin’ major, really. Just the headaches and feelin' a bit wobbly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other significant changes. Tiredness, which you attribute to your work, and occasional blurry vision with your glasses. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other health problems that your regular doctor has diagnosed, like diabetes or heart trouble?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's just from all the kneadin' and rollin' dough. Doctor gave me somethin' for it a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, fallin' out of a tree, but that healed up just fine. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, I reckon. Always been strong, even if I’m a little creaky these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No major medical problems diagnosed. And you had a broken wrist as a child, and some arthritis in your hands. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgery. Always tried to avoid the hospital if I could. My mama used to say, “Only go to the doctor when absolutely necessary,” and I reckon I took that to heart. I just let things heal up on their own, mostly. A little rest and a good poultice, that’s what I always did. Nowadays, they got all sorts of fancy fixin’s, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just that arthritis medicine, the doctor gave me years ago. I don’t take it every day, only when my hands are really botherin' me. And sometimes I take somethin' for my heartburn, when I eat somethin’ spicy. But that’s about it. I try to eat healthy, mostly, even if I do love a good pecan pie.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis medication as needed and something for heartburn. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I've been around all sorts of plants and animals. I grew up in the woods, you know? Mama taught me what was safe and what wasn't. Never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I think I'm pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had problems with high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mama, she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older. Doctor said it was somethin’ to do with her blood pressure, but I don't remember the specifics. And my grandpa, on my daddy’s side, he had a stroke, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t know much about it. Mostly, folks just… got old and passed away. It weren’t like they went to the doctor much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart trouble in your mother and a stroke in your grandfather. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Lord, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama always said they were bad for ya, and I listened to her. Always preferred fresh air, anyway. Been breathin’ good air my whole life, out in the woods and in the kitchen. Much better than smokin’, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. Not every day, mind you. Mostly just on holidays or when I’m visitin’ with friends. I don't really care for it much, to be honest. Prefer a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little alcohol occasionally. Now, let's talk about your social life. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone now. My husband, bless his soul, passed away a few years back. It’s been quiet since then. But I got a daughter and a grandson who come to visit every now and then. And I see my friends at the market, mostly. They're good folks, always happy to chat. Mostly just keep myself busy, bakin’ and gardenin’. It keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, but have a daughter and grandson who visit, and friends at the market. That’s good to hear. Alright, Ms. Steines, I think I have a good understanding of your medical history now. Would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I reckon I'm ready when you are. Just try not to poke too much, old bones ain't as sturdy as they used to be! Let's get this over with, so I can get back to my pies.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Hmm, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160/95. That’s why your regular doctor sent you over. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds a bit fast, but otherwise normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your pulse in your wrists and feet. Pulses are a little weak, but present. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. I'm also going to take a look in your ears and throat. Everything looks normal there. Finally, I’m going to check your vision again, just to confirm what your optometrist told you. Your vision is a bit blurry, as you mentioned. Okay, that's everything. I'll get your daughter and grandson to stay with you in case you feel dizzy afterwards.
PATIENT: Well, that weren't so bad. Thank ya, Doctor. So, what does all that mean? Is my blood pressure really bad? And what am I supposed to do about it? I got a market to run, ya know. Can’t be layin’ around sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Steines. Your blood pressure is a little high, and it does need to be addressed. It's not an emergency right this minute, but consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious problems down the road – things like heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. Now, based on the exam and your history, I suspect we're dealing with a combination of factors. Your age, family history, and possibly some mild dehydration could all be contributing. I'm going to order some blood tests and a urine test just to get a clearer picture of everything. We'll check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any other underlying causes. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home, if you can. I can have a nurse show you how to use a home blood pressure monitor.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… like a lot. Blood tests and urine tests… home monitor… I'll need my daughter to help me with all that. She's good with those fancy machines. And I'll have to get this machine. Okay. So, what about medicine? Do I need to start takin' somethin' right away? I'm worried about side effects, ya know? I need to be sharp for my bakin’.
