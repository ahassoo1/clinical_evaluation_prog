DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're 25 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Gedalya Schaust. Well, it's... it's been a bit worrying, to be honest. I've been noticing my muscles feel weaker, and my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s been getting slowly worse over the past few months.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, you say. And this has been progressive over months... Can you describe the weakness for me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not like I can't do things, but things feel more effortful. Like, carrying groceries is more tiring than it used to be. And I find myself tripping a bit more often, just feeling a bit less steady on my feet. It’s mostly in my legs, I think, but sometimes my arms feel it too. Not constantly, but… frequently enough to notice. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increasing fatigue with exertion, especially in the legs, and some instability. When did you first notice this instability, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I suppose it was… around February, maybe? It was subtle at first – just a little clumsier than usual. I didn’t think much of it. I thought I was just tired from work. But it’s definitely gotten more pronounced since then. I tripped on the stairs a couple of weeks ago, and that’s when I really started to worry. I thought I should probably get it checked out.
DOCTOR: And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: I’m a Facilities Manager. It’s mostly… going around checking on buildings, making sure everything’s running smoothly, dealing with repairs, things like that. So, a fair amount of walking and being on my feet, and sometimes a bit of lifting. Not heavy lifting, usually, but enough, I suppose. It’s a busy job.
DOCTOR: I see. So, physically demanding, requiring both endurance and some strength. Have you noticed any difficulty with your vision, perhaps double vision or blurred vision, at any point?
PATIENT: No, not really. My eyesight is… okay, I think. I wear glasses for reading, but that’s been the same for years. I haven’t noticed any blurring or… seeing double, no. Everything seems pretty clear, as far as I can tell. I did have a bit of trouble focusing one day, but I just thought my glasses needed cleaning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your breathing, shortness of breath, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. Breathing's normal, as far as I can tell. No trouble swallowing either. I haven’t… I haven’t paid much attention, to be honest. I mostly just notice the weakness and the eyelids. It's been a bit distracting, I suppose. I haven't been thinking about swallowing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's go over some more general questions. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, when I was about ten. Nothing major, nothing serious. I'm generally quite healthy, to be honest. I haven't been to the doctor in years, except for routine check-ups. I don't really get sick much.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. Never had anything removed or anything like that. Just the broken arm, which they put in a cast. That was… a long time ago. I don't think that's relevant, is it? It was just a childhood accident.
DOCTOR: Perhaps not. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my family. Well, my mother is… she has high blood pressure, but that’s controlled with medication. My father… he’s fine, as far as I know. He lives in Sweden, I don't see him very often. I don’t really know about any other medical problems in the family, to be honest. We don’t really talk about that sort of thing. Is that… is that helpful? I'm not very good at remembering family medical history.
DOCTOR: Adequate, though limited information. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really take pills. I might take ibuprofen occasionally for a headache, but that’s it. And very rarely. I generally try to avoid taking anything if I can. I prefer just to… rest if I'm feeling unwell. I don’t really like taking medication.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had any allergic reactions, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I’m very lucky, I suppose. It’s one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Schaust, I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. I'll start with your neurological function. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Is this alright? I’m a little worried, to be honest. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’d like you to squeeze your eyes shut tightly. Hmm. And now, open them. There is noticeable ptosis on your right eyelid, more pronounced than the left. Now, I'm going to check your pupillary reflexes. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, though slightly sluggish. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Alright, yes. Is that alright? It feels a bit strange being examined like this. Is it… is it bad? The ptosis? I hadn’t really noticed it until you pointed it out. It just… felt like my eyelids were heavy.
DOCTOR: Fairly symmetrical, but a slight weakness on the right side. Now, I'd like you to stick out your tongue. Hmm. And now, I'm going to assess your strength. Can you please push against my hand with your arms?
PATIENT: Alright. Is that enough pressure? I’m trying to push as hard as I can. It feels… a bit weak, I suppose. But I’m doing my best. I hope I'm not making this difficult.
DOCTOR: Adequate strength in both arms, although slightly diminished on the right. Now, I’m going to assess your leg strength. Please push against my hand with your legs. Hmm. There is some weakness in both legs, more pronounced on the right. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished in both knees and ankles, bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your feet. No significant atrophy or fasciculations noted. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: Okay. It all feels a bit… strange. I hope you're finding something useful. I'm starting to get quite worried, to be honest. Is it something serious? Is there anything I should be particularly concerned about? I'm not very good with medical things, so any explanation would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, the examination reveals some concerning findings. You have bilateral ptosis, weakness in your limbs, diminished reflexes, and some subtle asymmetry in your facial muscles. While not definitive, these findings are suggestive of a neuromuscular disorder. Given your age and symptoms, we need to consider several possibilities, including Myasthenia Gravis, Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome, or, less likely, a more serious condition affecting the nerves or muscles. I'm ordering some blood tests to check for antibodies associated with Myasthenia Gravis and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome. We will also need to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to rule out any structural abnormalities. I'm also referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation and a possible electromyography study to assess your nerve and muscle function. It's important to remember that these are just preliminary tests, and we need to gather more information before making a definitive diagnosis. But it is important to get this evaluated quickly, as some of these conditions can affect your breathing and swallowing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what? And Lambert-Eaton? Breathing and swallowing? That sounds… frightening. I… I think I understand, but it's a lot to take in. Blood tests, MRI, neurologist… it sounds very serious. Will these tests take long? And… what if it is one of those things? What does that mean? I’m not sure I understand what any of this means for… for my life. And… can you spell Myasthenia Gravis, please? I'd like to… look it up later.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is serious, Mr. Schaust, which is why we are proceeding with these tests promptly. The blood tests should be completed within a few days. The MRI will take a bit longer to schedule, likely within a week or two, depending on availability. Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the connection between your nerves and muscles, causing weakness and fatigue. Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome is similar, but caused by antibodies attacking calcium channels. Both are treatable, but require ongoing management. M-Y-A-S-T-H-E-N-I-A G-R-A-V-I-S. I understand this is overwhelming, and you're understandably anxious. The neurologist will be able to explain the specifics of each condition, the treatment options, and the prognosis in more detail. I’m prescribing you a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-regarded neurologist specializing in neuromuscular disorders. I will also have the lab requisition and MRI order ready for you. In the meantime, please avoid strenuous activities and monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any difficulty breathing or swallowing, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any immediate questions for me, or shall I have the paperwork prepared?
PATIENT: Eleanor Vance… okay. No strenuous activities… right. And… emergency room if I can’t breathe. What kind of treatment are we talking about? Pills? Injections? Surgery? And… is there anything I can do now to help, even just a little? Is there a certain diet I should be on? Or exercises I should avoid, besides strenuous ones? I feel… helpless, just waiting for tests. And… Is this something… hereditary? Could my mother… be at risk?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, we haven’t even made a diagnosis yet, so discussing specific treatments at this stage is premature. However, Myasthenia Gravis is often treated with medications that improve nerve transmission, such as cholinesterase inhibitors or immunosuppressants. In some cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland may be considered. As for diet, there is no specific diet recommended for Myasthenia Gravis, but maintaining a healthy weight and avoiding processed foods is always advisable. Regarding exercises, avoid activities that exacerbate your fatigue. Light stretching and range-of-motion exercises are generally acceptable, but listen to your body and stop if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Regarding your mother, Myasthenia Gravis can be hereditary in some cases, but it is not always passed down through families. It is possible she could be at risk, but it is not guaranteed. She should consult with her own physician if she is concerned. I have prepared the referral to Dr. Vance and the lab requisition. Please schedule your appointments as soon as possible. I will also provide you with a printed handout on Myasthenia Gravis for informational purposes. Do you have any further questions at this time, or can we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… the referral and the lab requisition. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll schedule the appointments. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Get it done promptly. .
