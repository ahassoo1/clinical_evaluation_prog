DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse gave me some papers after my blood work, and she said something about my cholesterol being high. That’s why I’m here, I suppose. Never had trouble with that before, not that I recall, anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. High cholesterol. It's… common at your age, unfortunately. Let’s go over some things, shall we?
PATIENT: Common, huh? Everything’s common at my age, I reckon. But alright, Doctor, go ahead. I’m a pretty good listener, most of the time. Just… speak plainly with me, if you wouldn't mind. All those big words… they don’t stick with me too well.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. “Plainly” it is. Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood. Your body needs some, but too much can build up and cause problems… like narrowing of the arteries. Now, the nurse flagged your levels. Have you ever been formally told you have high cholesterol before today?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said, not that I remember. I’ve been to doctors plenty over the years, of course – eighty-eight years gives you a few visits – but nobody ever said anything about my cholesterol specifically. Always just the usual checks, you know? Blood pressure, weight… that sort of thing. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? My wife… she passed a few years back, and I try not to fret too much these days.
DOCTOR: Well, it can be serious, Mr. Bohnett, which is why we're discussing it. It’s not an immediate emergency, but it does increase your risk of heart problems and stroke. We need to determine why your cholesterol is elevated. Are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I try to avoid them if I can. Always figured a little discomfort was better than messing with what’s already working, you know? I take a multivitamin every morning, and that's about it. Used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped a while back. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And, honestly, I don't go to the doctor unless something's really bothering me.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your diet, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, so I mostly cook for myself. I like a good breakfast – eggs and bacon most mornings, sometimes toast. Lunch is usually a sandwich, or soup if it’s cold. And dinner… well, dinner varies. I enjoy a roast now and then, or maybe some fish. I have a sweet tooth, I confess. A bit of pie with my coffee is a nice treat. Nothing too fancy, but it keeps me going. I wouldn’t say I’m a health nut, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, bless her heart, she tried it once when she was younger, but it didn't agree with her. She always said it smelled awful. I always thought it was a silly habit, to be honest. Never saw the appeal. My father smoked a pipe for a time, but he gave it up when I was a boy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Did either of your parents have heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother… she lived to be ninety-two, and she was as healthy as a horse right up until the end. Didn’t have any heart trouble that I know of. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, maybe fifty-something. I think he had high blood pressure, but I don't remember anything about his heart. It was a long time ago, you see. We didn't talk about those things much back then. It wasn't like today, with all the information…
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and feel your pulse. It'll only take a moment. If you’ll just sit up for me.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I haven’t been on one of these tables in a while. Bones ain’t what they used to be, you know. Go ahead then. I'll try and hold still.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds…regular, but a bit distant. Blood pressure is 148/82. Pulse is regular, but a little weak. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Nothing remarkable, Mr. Bohnett. Your weight is 108 pounds, which is… quite low. It’s concerning, given your age.
PATIENT: Concerning? Well, I’ve always been a slim fella. Never had much of an appetite, to be honest. My wife always worried about me, tried to get me to eat more. Said I was too skinny. But I feel alright, most of the time. Just a little tired sometimes. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Is my cholesterol the real problem, or is it something else? And… should I be worried about my weight?
DOCTOR: Your low weight is a concern, Mr. Bohnett, and it could be contributing to your fatigue. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. As for your cholesterol…it's elevated, yes. Total cholesterol is 260, LDL is 175, HDL is 35, and triglycerides are 150. Those numbers are… not ideal. We need to rule out any underlying causes for your weight loss and high cholesterol. I’m going to order some blood tests – a complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a lipid panel. I also want you to schedule a visit with a cardiologist, just to get their opinion. I’ll have the nurse arrange that for you.
PATIENT: Cardiologist, huh? That sounds… serious. Is it something I should be really worried about, Doctor? I don’t like going to specialists. Feels like they always find something wrong. But alright… if you think it’s necessary. What about the blood tests? How many tubes are we talking? I don’t do well with needles. And… will those tests tell us why I’m losing weight? Is it something serious, like… cancer?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, you are asking a great many questions. The blood tests will require a few tubes, yes. And no, they will not definitively rule out everything, but they will help us understand what’s going on. It’s premature to jump to conclusions about cancer. We're simply gathering information. It’s important to remember that you are 88 years old. Some weight loss is normal with aging. However, given your low weight and elevated cholesterol, we need to investigate further to ensure there isn’t a more serious underlying cause. I will have the nurse draw the blood this afternoon. And I'm referring you to Dr. Evans, the cardiologist. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any further questions, or shall we conclude the visit?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s best. It just… feels like a lot. All these tests and specialists… I just want to feel better, you know? No, I don’t suppose I have any more questions right now. Just… try not to poke too many holes in me with those needles, alright? And thank you, Doctor. For… trying to figure things out. I’ll go find the nurse, then. Hopefully, she's gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will assist you. .
