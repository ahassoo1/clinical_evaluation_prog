DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… have something coming from my ear. A little wetness, you understand? It is… discharge, yes? That is what my friend called it. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, discharge from the ear for the past three days. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… yellowish. Not much smell, if any. It does not hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. Like something is… full in my ear. And… I hear a little ringing, sometimes. Not always. It is… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear or yellowish discharge, no significant odor, discomfort and a feeling of fullness, and intermittent ringing. Okay. Have you noticed any fever, dizziness, or any changes in your hearing besides the ringing?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. No dizziness either. My hearing… it is not worse, not that I can tell. Just the ringing. Sometimes quiet, sometimes… more. I have been trying to clean it with… cotton, but it does not help much. Maybe it makes it worse, I do not know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any ear problems before?
PATIENT: Yes, when I was a young man, maybe… twenty years old. I had a bad ear infection. Very painful. I had to take… pills. And something they put in my ear. But this is… different. Not so much pain. More… this wetness. And the ringing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infection a long time ago. Good to know. Do you recall if that infection was in this ear, or the other one?
PATIENT: I… believe it was this ear, Doctor. Yes, I remember. It was very bad. I could not hear for almost a week. They had to… clean it out, then put drops in. It took a long time to get better. I was working at… a factory then. Very noisy place. Perhaps that is why I have this now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you been exposed to a lot of noise recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I am a teacher, you understand? Postsecondary. I teach… history. Mostly talking, not much noise. Though sometimes the students… they can be loud when they are talking amongst themselves. But nothing like the factory. No, not much noise recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other symptoms – any pain in your jaw, face, or neck?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain anywhere. My neck is… normal. And my face… feels fine. I have been a little… tired, perhaps. But that is because of the heat, I think. It has been very hot these past weeks. Not pain, though. Just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just some tiredness. And you mentioned you’re a teacher. Any recent illnesses in your students?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question, Doctor. A few students have had… colds, I think. Nothing serious. Just the usual coughs and sneezes. I do not believe any of them have had… ear problems. But I do not always know, you understand? They do not tell me everything. Just the important things, for their studies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick exam of your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to look inside. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Can you sit forward a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will sit forward. I am ready. This is… like the doctor I saw many years ago? He used something like this, I think. I hope it does not hurt. I do not like things in my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay… I see some discharge in the ear canal, as you described. The ear canal appears slightly inflamed. The eardrum itself looks… a little cloudy, but I can see it moving, which is good. No obvious perforations. Okay. It looks like you have otitis externa, or swimmer's ear, likely. It's an inflammation of the outer ear canal, often caused by bacteria or fungi. The discharge and inflammation are consistent with that. Does that sound like anything the previous doctor ever mentioned?
PATIENT: "Swimmer's ear?" I do not swim, Doctor. Not for many years. I have never heard of this before. The old doctor… he just said I had an "infection." He gave me pills, and drops. He did not say anything about… “externa.” Just infection. It sounds… complicated. Is this serious, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not usually serious if treated promptly. The name can be misleading; you don't have to swim to get it. It just means the infection is in the outer ear canal, not deeper inside. And no, you shouldn’t lose your hearing, as long as we treat it properly. The cloudiness I saw on the eardrum is something we need to address. I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops and a steroid drop to reduce the inflammation. I’ll also give you a prescription for some pain relievers if you need them. It’s important to keep your ear dry – no swimming, no getting water in your ear when you shower, and avoid using cotton swabs, as you mentioned. They can push the infection further in. I’m going to give you some instructions on how to properly administer the drops. Does that sound alright, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… much better. No swimming, no cotton, keep it dry. I can do that. The drops… are they difficult to put in? I have… big hands, sometimes I am clumsy. And… what if the pain gets worse? Is there anything else I should know? I do not want this to… linger. It is difficult to teach with… discomfort.
DOCTOR: No, the drops aren't too difficult. You'll lie on your side with the affected ear facing up, and gently pull your ear up and back to straighten the ear canal. Then, instill the prescribed number of drops. Hold your head still for a few minutes so the drops can reach the eardrum. If the pain gets worse, or if you develop a fever, dizziness, or any changes in your hearing, call the office immediately. We may need to reassess and consider other treatment options. It’s important to finish the entire course of drops, even if your symptoms improve. This helps prevent the infection from coming back. And I want you to follow up with me in one week so I can check your progress. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is everything. The instructions are… very clear. No swimming, keep it dry, finish the drops. One week follow-up. I appreciate your help. I was worried it might be… something serious. Thank you. I will… be careful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. Just follow those instructions, and hopefully, you’ll be feeling much better soon. If anything changes or you have any questions at all before your follow-up, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and get well soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
