DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I've been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time sometimes. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A few weeks… difficulty initiating urination, and a prolonged stream. Alright. And is it… painful when you try to go?
PATIENT: No, not really painful. It's more like… a straining feeling, like I have to push. And sometimes it doesn't feel like I empty everything, either. Does that make sense? I don’t have any burning or anything like that, thankfully. It just… doesn’t want to go easily, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: So, no pain, no burning… just a sensation of incomplete emptying and the need to strain. Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… let me think. No, not really. It looks the usual color, I suppose. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it. I haven't seen any blood or anything worrying like that, thank goodness. I try to drink plenty of water, even with the tea. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven’t noticed anything alarming. Darker urine can indicate dehydration, even with tea intake. But we need to rule other things out. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, lower back pain, or any abdominal discomfort along with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. My back… well, I get a little stiffness sometimes, just from being on my feet all day at the post office, you know? It’s nothing new. And no, no abdominal discomfort. Just… the trouble with going to the bathroom, that’s all. It's just… bothersome, really. I'm worried it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: Well, many things can cause this, Ms. Yadao. It's rarely anything immediately serious, but we need to be thorough. Let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have a list of medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here. Just this one for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, and a multivitamin. And sometimes Tylenol for aches, but that's not every day. I’ve been taking the Lisinopril for maybe five years now, since Dr. Peterson retired. He was a good doctor.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. And I haven't had any surgeries, either. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, all my life, until this started. I’m not normally one to complain, Doctor. That's why I waited so long to come in. I thought it would just… go away.
DOCTOR: No allergies, no surgeries. Good. Now, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, maybe thirty years ago? It wasn’t too bad, I recovered fine. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, goodness, almost twenty years ago now. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Is that gallbladder removal something I need to worry about now? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, gallbladder removal… alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother had diabetes, but she lived to be eighty-seven, so I suppose she managed it okay. My father had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother… he had some heart trouble, but that was many years ago. We weren’t very close, so I don’t know all the details. I don't recall anyone in my family having trouble with their bladder, if that's what you're asking. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Yadao, based on what you've told me, it could be a number of things. A urinary tract infection, although you don't have the typical symptoms. Or possibly an enlarged prostate – although you are a woman, there can be similar issues. Sometimes it's just age-related changes. I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order a urine test, just to rule things out. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine test and an exam… certainly. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again. I worry about needing to get up in the middle of the night, you see. I live alone, and it’s a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with the physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a quick pelvic exam, to assess your bladder and surrounding areas. It won't be comfortable, but it's important. I’ll explain everything as I go along. And please, let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam… I haven’t had one of those in years. Alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then let’s get it over with. Just… please be gentle. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, if you'll lie down on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table.
PATIENT: Alright… I’m ready when you are, Doctor. Just let me know what you’re doing as you go, please. It helps to know… what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Deep breaths… Sounds normal. Now, I’m going to perform a pelvic exam. This will involve inserting a speculum to visualize the vaginal area, and then a quick digital exam to assess your pelvic muscles. You may feel some pressure… just relax as much as possible. Just breathe normally… relax your muscles…
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying… It’s just… uncomfortable. Is it almost over? I’m trying to relax, Doctor, but it’s been a long time since I’ve had this done. It’s… a bit frightening, to be honest. Just let me know when it’s finished, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m feeling your pelvic muscles now. They feel… somewhat weak. The uterus feels normal in size. No obvious masses or abnormalities. The exam is almost finished… just a moment longer. Alright, that’s all. You can sit up when you're ready. No significant findings, aside from the weakened pelvic muscles. Now, we’ll send a urine sample to the lab to rule out an infection. The nurse will give you a cup and instructions.
PATIENT: Weakened pelvic muscles… I see. Is that… serious, Doctor? What does that mean? And what if the urine test does show an infection? What kind of treatment would I need? I just… I’m worried. It’s good to finally have some answers, but now I have even more questions.
DOCTOR: Weakened pelvic muscles are common with age and childbirth, Ms. Yadao. It’s likely contributing to your difficulty with urination. We can discuss some exercises – Kegel exercises – to help strengthen them. As for an infection, if the test is positive, we’ll prescribe antibiotics. It’s usually a simple course of treatment. Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We need the test results first. The nurse will be in shortly with the cup. Try not to worry.
PATIENT: Exercises… antibiotics… Alright. Doctor? Would you mind… explaining those exercises again? Just so I don’t forget. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any diet changes, or… anything to avoid? It’s just… it’s all a bit overwhelming. .
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Yadao, the nurse will give you a pamphlet explaining the Kegel exercises. It's very straightforward – squeeze the muscles you use to stop urination, hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat several times a day. As for diet changes, stay hydrated. And avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. That’s all there is to it. We’ll get the test results back in a couple of days. The nurse will call you with the results and any further instructions. Now, is there anything else?
