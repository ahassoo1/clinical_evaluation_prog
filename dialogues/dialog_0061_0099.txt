DOCTOR: "Bula Denis, and welcome. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received a letter… regarding some tests I had done on my stomach. The results were… not quite what I expected, and my regular doctor suggested I come in for a more thorough discussion. It concerned an endoscopy, I believe it was called.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Denis, that’s good information. An endoscopy… yes, I see that in your chart here. It was done about three weeks ago, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Approximately three weeks ago. It was at St. Jude’s Hospital, with Doctor… Ramirez, I believe. A very kind man. He explained the procedure itself, of course, but the details of why it was necessary, and then the results… those were a little harder to follow, frankly. I apologize if I seem…scattered. I have not been sleeping particularly well.
DOCTOR: “No apology necessary at all, Denis. It’s perfectly understandable to be a bit unsettled after tests like that, especially if the results weren’t straightforward. And not sleeping well can certainly make things harder to process. Let’s take our time and go through it together. Okay, it looks like Dr. Ramirez performed the endoscopy to investigate some symptoms you were experiencing – can you remind me what those symptoms were?
PATIENT: Certainly. It began… oh, perhaps six months ago. A persistent discomfort in my stomach. Not a sharp pain, but a dull ache, mostly after I eat. And… a feeling of fullness, even when I haven't eaten very much. It's difficult to describe. And lately, I've been… rather tired, more so than usual. I attributed it to my age, initially, but it seemed to coincide with the stomach troubles. Also, there has been… a slight change in my appetite. I don’t feel hungry, exactly. More like… not interested in food. It's been… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that gives me a good start. So, a dull ache after eating, feeling full quickly, fatigue, and a decreased appetite. And these symptoms have been gradually worsening over the past six months. Did you notice any other symptoms, Denis?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes. There have been occasions… a sort of… bloating. Especially in the evenings. And… occasionally, a little nausea. Not enough to be sick, just… a queasy feeling. I didn’t think much of it, I have always been a little sensitive to travel, and I thought it was just that acting up. But it wasn’t after travel… it just seemed to come and go. And… oh! I nearly forgot. A change in my… well, my movements. I apologize for being so… blunt. I’ve been… regular, all my life. But lately, it's been… less so. A little… difficult, at times. It has been… embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Denis. It’s important to be thorough, and you’re not being blunt at all. It’s good you're telling me everything, even the things that feel a little difficult to talk about. Bloating, nausea, and a change in your bowel habits – those are all things we need to consider. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have always been… quite healthy, truthfully. I have had the usual… colds, flus, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, almost thirty years ago, but that was…uneventful, really. And I have… mild arthritis in my hands, but it does not bother me too much. I keep active, you see. Gardening is my passion. As for other conditions… no, nothing I can think of. I do not take any regular medications, save for a little ibuprofen occasionally for the arthritis. And no allergies, either. I have a fairly… robust constitution, I suppose. Though, clearly, something is amiss now.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know, Denis. No major health conditions, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, mild arthritis managed with ibuprofen, and no allergies. Let’s talk about family history then. Are there any significant health problems that run in your family – things like stomach cancer, colon cancer, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we are not particularly forthcoming about health matters. It was… considered rather impolite, to discuss such things openly. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, from pneumonia, I believe. My father… he was a strong man, worked very hard. He lived to be quite old, but he always kept his feelings… private. I remember him having… stomach troubles, occasionally, but he never spoke of it. And my siblings… we are not close. I have not seen them in many years. I believe my brother had… high blood pressure, but that is all I recall. It is possible there is a history of digestive issues, but I have no concrete knowledge. It is a frustrating matter, truthfully. I wish I could provide you with more information. I apologize for being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: “You’re not being unhelpful at all, Denis. It’s very common for families to not discuss health issues openly, and you’ve told me what you know. That's perfectly fine. Okay. Let's briefly talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. My late husband… he smoked, briefly, when he was a young man, but he quickly gave it up. I always disapproved, of course. And alcohol… only on very special occasions. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I am a woman of… simple pleasures. Gardening, reading, spending time with my cats. That is all. I have always lived a very… quiet, respectable life. I assure you, Doctor, you have no need to worry about such things.
DOCTOR: “That’s good to know, Denis. A quiet and respectable life sounds lovely. Now, let’s go back to those endoscopy results. According to Dr. Ramirez’s report, the endoscopy revealed some inflammation in your stomach and duodenum – that’s the first part of your small intestine. And biopsies – small tissue samples – were taken. The pathology report shows……evidence of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia. These terms may not mean much to you, but essentially, they indicate changes in the lining of your stomach and duodenum.”
PATIENT: Inflammation… changes in the lining… Atrophic… and… Metaplasia? Those are… quite frightening words, Doctor. I apologize, but I am not a medical professional. I do not understand what those terms mean. Are they… serious? Is that why my regular doctor recommended I see you? I confess, I am beginning to feel quite anxious. Are these changes… easily treated? Or… is this something… more concerning? Please, Doctor, could you explain… in terms a layperson might understand? I trust your judgment, of course, but I would be grateful for a little clarification.
DOCTOR: “You’re right to ask for clarification, Denis, and you’re not alone in not understanding those terms. It’s my job to explain them to you. And please, don't worry. We’ll take this one step at a time. Atrophic gastritis means that the lining of your stomach has become thinner and inflamed. It can happen for various reasons, and it reduces the stomach's ability to produce acid, which is important for digestion. Intestinal metaplasia is when the cells in your stomach lining change to resemble the cells found in your intestine. Now, these changes are often caused by a long-term infection with a bacteria called Helicobacter pylori, or H. pylori. It's very common, and it can cause inflammation and these changes in the stomach lining. Sometimes, it can cause no symptoms at all. In other cases, it can lead to things like ulcers or, in rare instances, an increased risk of stomach cancer. That's why it's important to investigate this further. We need to determine if you have an H. pylori infection. We can do this with a simple blood test, a stool test, or a breath test. We will also need to rule out other potential causes of these changes. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: An infection… Helicobacter pylori… I see. So, these changes in my stomach lining are caused by this bacteria? And it is common, you say? That is… somewhat reassuring, though the thought of an infection is… unsettling, naturally. And a blood test, a stool test, a breath test… those all sound… manageable. You mentioned… stomach cancer. Is that… a likely outcome? I apologize for asking such a blunt question, but I would prefer to be prepared, should… should that be the case. My late husband… he lost his sister to cancer, many years ago. It was… a very difficult time. Is this something I should be greatly concerned about? And if it is caused by this bacteria, can it be treated? Is there a… a remedy?
DOCTOR: “You’re right to ask those tough questions, Denis. It’s important to be informed, and I understand your concern, especially given your husband's experience. Let me reassure you, the presence of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia does not mean you have stomach cancer. It simply means there is an increased risk, and we need to investigate further and monitor the situation. The vast majority of people with these changes do not develop stomach cancer. If we determine you have an H. pylori infection, it is very treatable with a course of antibiotics and acid-reducing medication. The treatment is usually very effective at eliminating the bacteria. Eliminating the infection can stop or even reverse some of the changes in your stomach lining and significantly reduce your risk. We would also likely recommend a follow-up endoscopy in a few years to monitor the situation, even if the treatment is successful. So, the first step is to determine if you have an H. pylori infection. Would you be comfortable with a blood test to start?
PATIENT: That is… very reassuring, Doctor. Thank you. Knowing that it is treatable… and that it does not automatically mean cancer… that alleviates a great deal of my anxiety. Yes, a blood test would be perfectly acceptable. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust your judgment entirely. I would like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible, if you please. And… thank you again. For your patience, and your clear explanations. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Denis. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. Okay, I’ll order a blood test for H. pylori antibodies. The lab results usually take a few days, and we'll contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like severe stomach pain, vomiting blood, or black, tarry stools—please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have answered all of my questions. I am very grateful for your time, and your thorough explanations. You have been most kind and patient. I will await the results of the blood test, and contact you if anything changes. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Denis. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and have a good day. .
