DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter from the lab... something about my cholesterol being high. Hyper... something? It scared me a little, to be honest. I don’t really understand all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. It's a bit of a mouthful, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it really is! So, is that… bad? Should I be worried? I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables.
DOCTOR: “Mostly” is doing a lot of work there, Ms. Geho. It can be concerning, yes. High cholesterol increases your risk for heart disease. We need to get a clearer picture of what's going on before we jump to conclusions. Let's start with a bit more detail about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right. “Mostly” is probably a bad word to use! Let's see… usually for breakfast I have coffee and maybe a piece of toast. Sometimes with jam. Lunch is often a salad, but… sometimes I get a sandwich from the deli. And dinner… well, it varies. My daughter brings over food a couple of times a week, which is lovely, but not always… the healthiest things. I do enjoy a good piece of chocolate after dinner too. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It gives me some idea. Deli sandwiches… and your daughter’s contributions… those are areas we'll likely need to address. Do you know what kinds of meats are in the sandwiches?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t usually ask. I think… usually ham or turkey? Sometimes roast beef. They have a lot of choices. And my daughter… she likes to bake! Cakes, cookies… things like that. I try to limit myself, but… she’s such a good cook!
DOCTOR: Processed meats aren’t ideal, Ms. Geho. And sweets… well, they certainly don’t help. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he takes medication for his cholesterol. So, it seems to run in the family. Does that make it worse?
DOCTOR: It certainly increases your risk, yes. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. The standard one, you know, the kind you get at the drugstore. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they’re acting up. It’s… glucosamine, I think? I can’t remember the full name. It’s not something I take every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm usually pretty good with medications, if I need them. But I don't take many.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 142/88. A little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Not bad. I’d like to order some more detailed blood work. A full lipid panel, to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I'm fine with getting blood drawn. I’ve had it done before. It doesn’t bother me a bit. When will I hear back about the results? And… will I need to change anything about my diet before then? I feel like we’ve already established I enjoy a good piece of chocolate!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, while I appreciate your candor, Ms. Geho, it’s precisely that attitude that likely contributed to these results. It’s not about eliminating everything you enjoy, it’s about moderation. However, let's wait for the full results before we make any drastic recommendations. The lab usually takes about 3-5 business days to return the results to us. My nurse will call you with the findings and we can schedule a follow-up appointment then. In the meantime, try to be mindful of your food choices. Perhaps reduce the portion sizes of those sandwiches and sweets. That's all for now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I can try. Moderation… that sounds reasonable. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. 3-5 business days… I’ll keep an eye out for a call. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any websites or… brochures you recommend?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Geho, I find most of those websites are… overly dramatic and filled with misinformation. Focus on eating a balanced diet, getting some exercise, and managing your stress. That's far more effective than obsessing over numbers online. We’ll discuss specifics once we have your results. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I'll try my best to be more mindful. Thank you again. I suppose I’ll see you in a few days then? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Geho. I expect you will. Goodbye.
