DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Boham. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Um… my… my nose. It feels… not good. Like… full of water, maybe? It's been like this for… a little while now, I think. I don’t remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Nose feels full," and it’s been going on for a little while. Do you mean congested?
PATIENT: Congested? I… I’m sorry, Doctor. I don’t know that word. Full… like when you have a cold, and you can’t breathe good? Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly! That’s congestion. So, you're experiencing congestion in your nose. And it feels like that feeling for a little while now… Do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… other things? Let me think… I feel tired, sometimes. And… maybe a little headache. Not a big one, but… there. It’s hard to remember. I don’t sleep very good either, now that I think about it. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness, a little headache, and difficulty sleeping… and this “fuzzy” feeling. Has this been happening at the same time as the congestion, or did something start before the other?
PATIENT: That is a hard question, Doctor. I think… the nose was first. Then, maybe a week later, I started to feel tired. The headache… that came and went. It’s… it’s all a little mixed up, I’m sorry. I don’t have a good memory these days. My husband says I forget things all the time.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Boham, don’t apologize. It’s common to have trouble remembering exact timelines. Let's not worry about that too much. So, congestion first, then tiredness a week or so later, and the headache comes and goes. Are you having any fever, cough, or sore throat?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. And no cough. My throat… sometimes it feels a little scratchy, but not bad. Not a sore throat, just… dry, maybe. Like I need to drink water all the time. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no cough. A little scratchiness in the throat, dryness… Yes, that's good information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Smell… taste…? I cook for my husband every night, Doctor. I think I can still smell the food, yes. And I taste it, of course! But… maybe it’s not as strong as it used to be? I don’t know. It's hard to say. I haven’t really paid attention.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's useful to know. It sounds like possibly a diminished sense of smell, but you haven’t noticed a complete loss. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like allergies, asthma, or sinus problems?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a hard question, Doctor. I don't think so. I've never really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups, maybe. I don't remember being told about anything. I work with… with the drills, you know? Oil and gas. Not much time for sickness, usually. My husband handles most of the doctor things. I’m sorry I can’t be more help.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Don’t worry about it. It's more common than you think. So, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I've been very lucky, I think. Just… a little tired lately. And this nose… It's not good. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no hospitalizations. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. My husband, he takes some for his blood pressure, but I don’t take anything. Just water. Lots and lots of water.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… um… I don’t think so, Doctor. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband is allergic to shellfish, but I’m not. I can eat anything, I think. I haven’t had any problems. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Ms. Boham. Now, I’m going to do a quick examination. I'll just take a look at your nose, ears, and throat, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's okay. Whatever you need. I just want to feel better. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your nose. Okay, I see some swelling and redness inside your nasal passages. There’s a little bit of clear mucus present as well. Your ears look clear. Your throat is a bit irritated, but no obvious signs of infection. Your lungs sound clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Okay. It sounds like you have some nasal congestion and mild throat irritation. It could be a common cold, or possibly some allergies. Do you know if you've been exposed to any allergens lately?
PATIENT: Allergens…? No, Doctor. I work with the drills, remember? Mostly just dust and oil. We don't have flowers or anything like that. Sometimes the wind blows… maybe some pollen? I don’t know. My husband likes to garden, but I don’t spend much time out there. It could be the dust, maybe? It gets everywhere.
DOCTOR: Possibly. Considering your symptoms and the potential exposure to dust, it could be a mild irritant causing this. To be sure, and to rule out anything else, I’d like to order a simple blood test. It will check for any inflammation and common allergies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test…? Oh, Doctor… I… I don't like needles. And I don’t have insurance, you know? Is it very expensive? I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The blood test is fairly quick, and we can be very gentle with the needle. As for the cost… let me see what the lab charges are, and we can discuss options if it's a concern. There may be some assistance programs available, and we can explore those. It's important to get some clarity, and rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to let me check the cost for you first, and we can decide from there?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be very kind. Please, check the cost. I don’t want to cause any trouble, but I want to feel better, you know? Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll just step out for a moment to check with the lab. I’ll be right back with that information. In the meantime, you can relax.
