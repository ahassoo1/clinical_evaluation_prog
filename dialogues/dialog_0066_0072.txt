DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Condray, nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've been…forgetting things. Not huge things, usually, but enough to worry me. It’s just been happening more and more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Ebony. Memory issues are pretty common, and it's good you're getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about these forgetful moments?
PATIENT: Hmm, where to start? It’s like…I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and lose my train of thought mid-sentence. Little things like that. Sometimes I have trouble remembering names, even people I've met a few times. It’s not constant, it just…happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a better picture. So, walking into a room and not recalling your purpose, losing your thought mid-sentence, difficulty with names… and you said this has been happening more frequently recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It feels like it’s been getting worse over the last six months, maybe a year. Before that, it was just…normal, I guess. Everyone forgets things sometimes, right? But now…it’s a little unsettling. I worry I’m starting to…you know. Like, something serious is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ebony. It’s good you’re paying attention to these changes. To get a clearer idea of what might be going on, let's go through a bit more detail. First, can you tell me if these memory issues are impacting your daily life at all?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… not majorly, I don’t think. I haven’t forgotten appointments or anything huge like that. But it’s annoying. Like, at work, sometimes I have to ask colleagues to remind me of details we discussed earlier that day. Or I’ll get home and realize I completely forgot to pick up something at the grocery store. It’s more frustrating than debilitating, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ebony. Frustrating is a good way to put it. Okay, so not impacting major daily functions, but causing some inconvenience at work and with errands. Now, let's talk about other things. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the memory issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a little more tired lately, maybe? I just figured it was the summer heat. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more clumsy than usual. I tripped over the rug yesterday, which is not like me. Nothing major, but yeah. I haven't really connected those things to the memory stuff though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and some clumsiness in addition to the memory issues. That’s helpful. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Let me see… I had pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully. And I have pretty well-controlled high blood pressure. Other than that… not really. No major illnesses or anything. I take medication for the blood pressure, of course. A small dose.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past and well-controlled hypertension. And you take medication for the blood pressure. Do you remember the name of the medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is embarrassing… I should know this. Let me think… it's a little white pill… I think it starts with an ‘A’? Ar… Amlodipine? Is that right? I hope so. My husband used to remind me, but… well, things have been different lately.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is correct, Ebony. No need to worry about that at all, it’s very common to forget medication names. So, Amlodipine for hypertension. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Yes, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. It was a pretty routine surgery, no complications. Other than that… no, no other surgeries. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, up until recently. It just feels like things are… slipping.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, no complications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you have any family members with memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… some kind of memory issues when she got really old. I don’t know the specifics, honestly. My mother always said it was just "old age," but she did get very confused towards the end. I don’t know if it was anything serious, like Alzheimer’s or anything. No one really talked about it much. My father’s side… I don’t really know much about their medical history. He wasn’t very close to his family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so grandmother had some memory issues later in life, but the specifics are unknown. Limited information about your father’s family history. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never have. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner a few times a year, and definitely no recreational drugs. I try to be pretty healthy, eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise… well, I try to. Things have been a bit harder lately, with everything going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, very healthy lifestyle, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, just a few more questions about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any problems with medications in the past. I double-checked when I started the Amlodipine, just to be sure, and the doctor confirmed I was fine. Honestly, I’m usually very careful about these things. It’s just the remembering part that’s been…difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ebony, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Absolutely. I trust your judgment, Dr. Condray. Let's get it done. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I just want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes and balance. Okay, your reflexes are normal, but I did notice a little bit of unsteadiness when walking heel-to-toe. It's mild, but worth noting. And just a quick memory check… can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Okay, sure. What are the words?
DOCTOR: Okay, the three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. Now, let's move on to some simple cognitive tasks. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: The current date… hmm. Let me think… It’s August… the 2nd? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. It feels… strange, having to consciously think about the date. I usually just know these things.
DOCTOR: That is correct, August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you count backwards from 100 by sevens?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… harder than it sounds. Let me try… 100, 93… 86… 79… Uh… Oh, I’m losing track already. 72? Is that right? This is awful. I’m usually pretty good with numbers. My husband always jokes I’m the family accountant. I’m so embarrassed. I’m messing up already!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ebony. It’s a challenging task, and many people find it difficult. Don't worry about it at all. Now, let’s try one more. Can you name three things that are red?
PATIENT: Three red things… hmm. Okay, let me think… A… a red apple. A fire truck. And… um… a stop sign? Is that good? I'm really struggling now. I feel like my brain is just… foggy. This isn’t like me at all.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent answers, Ebony. Now, do you remember the three words I asked you to recall earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… let me see… apple… and… table… and… uh… oh, I can’t remember the third one! It was something small… something shiny… I just can’t get it. I'm so frustrated! It was right there a few minutes ago. Penny? Was it penny? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, you remembered apple and table, and you were close with penny. It’s alright that you didn't recall all three. Based on the exam and your history, there are a few things that come to mind. You've described recent memory issues, mild unsteadiness, and some difficulty with cognitive tasks. The fogginess you described is also relevant. Given your age and the gradual onset of these symptoms, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to normal age-related cognitive decline, but the progression and your concerns warrant further investigation. Other possibilities include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or early stages of mild cognitive impairment. It's also important to rule out any underlying neurological conditions. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check for vitamin B12, thyroid function, and other relevant markers. I also recommend a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Absolutely. I want to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. I’d rather face it head-on than just worry about it. Blood tests and an MRI… yes, let’s do it. I trust your judgment, Dr. Condray. What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'm glad you feel that way. I'll write the orders for the blood tests and the MRI right now. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic, and we can schedule the MRI at the imaging center across the street. They usually have appointments available within the next few days. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, give you a requisition form for the blood tests and schedule your MRI appointment before you leave. In the meantime, it’s important to stay mentally active. Continue to engage in activities you enjoy, like reading, puzzles, or social events. I also recommend maintaining a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. Once we have the results of the blood tests and the MRI, we can discuss them and develop a plan tailored to your specific needs. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Condray. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously. I’m a little nervous, of course, but I feel better knowing we’re taking steps to figure things out. Just let me know when I can schedule the tests. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I understand your nervousness, but we'll get to the bottom of this together. Sarah will be right in to schedule your tests. She'll also provide you with some informational pamphlets on memory and cognitive health. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
