DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker lately, and my eyelids… they seem to be drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, and it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… hmm. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four months, I’d say. It started gradually, just feeling a little more tired than usual, but now… now it’s noticeable, I think. Especially when I look in the mirror. It’s mostly both eyes, but I feel like one is worse than the other, perhaps. Though it’s hard to tell for sure.
DOCTOR: Right, both eyes, but one possibly more affected. And you mentioned weakness… can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… not like a sudden inability to do things, more like… everything takes more effort. Like, climbing the stairs is harder than it used to be. And holding things, even lighter objects, feels… tiring. It’s in my arms and legs mostly, I think. It's hard to say exactly where, it's just… generally weaker. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A general weakness, more effort needed for everyday tasks, especially in your arms and legs. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’ve specifically noticed, no. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. Though, to be honest, I haven't been paying that much attention. I wear glasses, you see, so I just assume it’s the glasses if anything seems off. But I haven’t needed to get a new prescription recently, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in vision besides what your glasses correct. Good to know. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing serious, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing beyond that. I haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything. I generally consider myself quite healthy, to be honest. This weakness is… unsettling, because it's so unexpected.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history. Childhood illnesses only. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother is still living, she's 82, and quite active, actually. My father passed away about ten years ago, from… I believe it was heart failure. He was a smoker for many years, if that’s relevant. And I have one sister, she’s perfectly healthy as far as I know. We don’t talk that often, so I wouldn’t necessarily know if something was wrong. But, to the best of my knowledge, there aren’t any major hereditary illnesses in the family.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother is healthy, father passed from heart failure related to smoking. No known hereditary illnesses. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any bad experiences with medications. I don't take any regular medications at the moment, either. Just… the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, and nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and no regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and take a look at your eyes more closely. Just routine things. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. I understand it’s necessary. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do. I'm a bit anxious, of course, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. First, let’s check your eyes. Could you please follow my finger with your gaze, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is this alright? I’m trying my best to keep my head still. It’s a little difficult, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're doing great. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to check your pupils with a light. This might be a little bright. ...Alright. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light, which is good. Now, let's check your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that enough? I'm trying to be as strong as possible. It feels… a little tiring, actually. But I’m squeezing as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good, thank you. ...Alright. Your strength is a little diminished, particularly in your arms and legs, as you mentioned. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Your reflexes are… slightly diminished as well. It's subtle, but present. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please go ahead. I’m starting to feel a bit… concerned, to be honest. But I trust your expertise. I’ll just… try to relax.
DOCTOR: ...Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, this constellation of symptoms – weakness, drooping eyelids, diminished reflexes – is suggestive of a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency, but we need to rule out other things. I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for thyroid function. That will give us a better picture of what's going on. We also need to check for creatine kinase, to assess for muscle damage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of this. Blood work sounds perfectly fine. Creatine kinase, whatever that is, if it will help, then please do it. I’m a bit worried, to be honest, but I appreciate you being thorough. Will I need to fast beforehand? Or are there any other preparations I should make?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, just water is fine. We’ll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I’d like to see you back in about a week, once the lab work is complete. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A week sounds fine. I'll make a note of it. No food for eight hours, got it. And… what are the possibilities you mentioned? If you don’t mind me asking, of course. Just to… prepare myself a little. I understand you haven’t seen the results yet, so it’s just speculation, but… if you could give me a general idea?
DOCTOR: Well, as I said, it’s too early to say definitively. But some possibilities include a vitamin deficiency – particularly vitamin D or B12. Hypothyroidism – an underactive thyroid – can also cause similar symptoms. And, less commonly, it could be something neuromuscular – affecting the nerves and muscles. We need the blood work to help narrow down the possibilities. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. Many of these conditions are treatable, and we'll figure out what's going on. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… reasonably clear. Vitamin deficiency, thyroid, neuromuscular… I’ll try not to worry too much before the results come back. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and… patient. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I’ll schedule the blood work and the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Alright, take care, Gedalya. We'll see you next week. .
