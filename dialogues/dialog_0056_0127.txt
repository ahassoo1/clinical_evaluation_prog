DOCTOR: Hi Gedalya, nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, really. I've been feeling weaker, progressively so, over the past few months. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It’s becoming quite noticeable, and frankly, a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… that’s good information to start with. When you say weakness, can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not… a sudden thing, like I injured myself. It’s more like… doing things takes more effort. Climbing stairs, lifting things… even holding my head up for too long feels tiring. It started in my arms and legs, I think, but now it feels… all over, a bit. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset of weakness, affecting arms, legs, and now more generalized… and you mentioned it takes more effort to do things. Has this weakness been interfering with any daily activities – like work, hobbies, or anything else you usually do?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, unfortunately. I work as a facilities manager, so there’s a fair bit of physical work involved – checking buildings, doing small repairs, that sort of thing. It’s… becoming harder to keep up. I find myself needing to take more breaks, and I've had to ask colleagues to help with tasks I used to do easily. As for hobbies… I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. It’s just too strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. And you mentioned the drooping eyelids – has that been happening on one side or both?
PATIENT: It seems to be… both, actually. Not dramatically, at first. I thought it was just tiredness, to be honest. But it’s definitely gotten more noticeable in the last few weeks. People have started asking if I'm alright, if I’m getting enough sleep. It's… a little embarrassing, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be concerning when things change and people start noticing. Okay, both eyelids drooping, gradual onset… That’s helpful. Now, let’s go through some other things quickly. Have you noticed any double vision, blurred vision, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not that I’ve noticed. My vision… it hasn’t been particularly blurry, but sometimes things seem a little… less sharp, perhaps. It's hard to describe. Not double vision, definitely not. It's more like… strain, if I've been reading or working on the computer for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no difficulty swallowing, some eye strain but no double vision. Have you had any fever, weight loss, or changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No fever. And… I think I might have lost a little weight, but I haven’t been paying close attention, to be honest. My appetite hasn’t changed much. I still eat normally, I suppose. It's just… I haven't been feeling very energetic, so perhaps I haven’t wanted to eat as much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, quickly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I don't take any regular medications at the moment either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies or medications. And just to be thorough, any major medical problems in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My father… he had some heart problems later in life, needed a stent, I believe. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… something neurological, I think. Dementia, perhaps? It was quite a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to her, so I don’t know the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, grandmother with possible dementia. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and look at your eyes and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start with your eyes. Okay, pupils are equal and reactive to light. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Look left, look right, look up, look down… Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you go. Is that alright? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as possible. It feels… a little weak, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, your grip strength is slightly diminished bilaterally – on both sides. Now, can you push against my hands?
PATIENT: I’m pushing as hard as I can. It feels… difficult. More difficult than it should be, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's what I suspected. I'm going to check your reflexes now. And… your reflexes are normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, open your mouth and say "Ahhh." Your throat looks normal. Okay, one last thing. I'm going to feel your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are not swollen. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, you're exhibiting symptoms of possible myasthenia gravis, a neurological condition that causes muscle weakness. The drooping eyelids, generalized weakness, and diminished grip strength are all consistent with this. However, this is just a preliminary assessment. We need to do some blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. Would you be willing to proceed with blood work?
PATIENT: Myasthenia gravis…? I… I’ve never heard of it. Muscle weakness… and blood tests… Yes, of course. If that’s what’s needed to find out what’s going on, then yes, please. I’m willing to do whatever it takes. What kind of blood tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Okay. It's understandable to be anxious; it's a lot to take in. Myasthenia gravis essentially means your body's immune system is attacking the connection between your nerves and muscles, leading to weakness. The blood tests we'll do will look for specific antibodies that are often present in people with this condition. We’ll also do a general metabolic panel to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms. I’ll order those right away. The lab is just down the hall; you can go whenever you're ready. It shouldn’t take long. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity to prevent further muscle fatigue. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Avoiding strenuous activity… yes, I can do that. It’s just… what if it is myasthenia gravis? What does that mean? Is it… curable? And what about the symptoms? Will they get worse? I apologize, I know I'm asking a lot of questions. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all; it’s perfectly normal to want to know more when facing something like this. Okay, so, myasthenia gravis isn't typically curable, but it is manageable. Most people live relatively normal lives with treatment. The treatment options include medications to suppress the immune system and improve nerve-muscle communication. Sometimes, in severe cases, surgery to remove the thymus gland is considered. As for the symptoms, they can fluctuate. Periods of remission – where symptoms improve – and exacerbation – where they worsen – are common. With treatment, we aim to minimize those exacerbations and keep you as stable as possible. It’s also important to remember that everyone experiences the condition differently. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of your specific situation. Once we have those results, we can discuss a personalized treatment plan. Do you have any other immediate concerns or questions?
PATIENT: Medications… surgery… fluctuating symptoms… It's a lot. I suppose… I'm a bit worried about the medications. What kind of side effects can they have? And how long will it take to see if they’re working? Also… would this affect my ability to work? I rely on my job, and I’m worried about… well, everything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re right to ask about potential side effects. The medications commonly used to treat myasthenia gravis, like pyridostigmine and immunosuppressants, can have side effects. Pyridostigmine can cause gastrointestinal issues – nausea, diarrhea, cramping – and sometimes muscle weakness if the dosage isn’t right. Immunosuppressants can increase your risk of infection, so we’d need to monitor your blood counts regularly. We start with a low dose and adjust it gradually to minimize side effects. As for how long it takes to see improvement, it can vary. Some people notice a difference within a few weeks of starting treatment, while others may take longer. It’s important to be patient and communicate any changes you’re experiencing. Regarding your ability to work, that depends on the severity of your condition and the demands of your job. If your work involves strenuous physical activity, it might be difficult initially. However, with treatment, many people are able to continue working. We can discuss options like modified duties or a temporary leave of absence if needed. Let's get those blood tests ordered, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan tailored to your specific needs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Getting the blood tests is the next step, I suppose. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so thoroughly. I appreciate it. Where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand it's a lot to process. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The lab technician will likely need to draw a few vials of blood. They’re used to dealing with patients who are anxious, so don’t hesitate to let them know if you’re feeling uncomfortable. They’ll give you instructions on how to care for the injection site afterwards. Once the results are available – usually within 3-5 business days – my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about getting to the lab, or anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go get the tests done now. .
DOCTOR: Okay, take care, Gedalya. And please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
