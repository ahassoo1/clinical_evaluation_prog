DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. It's been over 48 hours now, I think. It’s really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Forty-eight hours of hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. At least. I've lost track a little, to be honest. They come and go, but they haven't completely gone away for more than a few minutes at a time. It’s making it hard to concentrate, and even harder to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Everything people tell you! Holding my breath, drinking water upside down... someone even suggested a spoonful of sugar. Nothing’s worked, Doctor. Not a single thing. It’s driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you experiencing any other symptoms with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... No, not really. I mean, I’m a bit tired, but that’s probably just from not sleeping properly. And maybe a little bit of heartburn now and then, but I get that sometimes anyway. Nothing specifically with the hiccups, no. I don't feel sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and hasn't bothered me since. And high blood pressure, but I take medication for that, and it’s usually well-controlled. Other than that…no, I'm pretty healthy for my age. Well, I was pretty healthy, before these hiccups!
DOCTOR: Right, right. Any family history of, shall we say, unusual conditions?
PATIENT: Unusual conditions? Hmm… That’s a tough one. My mother had really bad indigestion all her life, if that counts. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… something with his nerves, I think. He used to shake a lot. But nothing major, nothing like… genetic or anything, as far as I know. It wasn’t talked about much.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just the lisinopril for the blood pressure, and sometimes I take an antacid if I get heartburn. Usually just over-the-counter stuff, like Tums. And occasionally, a pain reliever for a headache, but that’s very rare. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. That's pretty much it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've had a few vaccinations over the years, but no problems with those either. I'm pretty lucky, really. It's usually just these little annoyances, like hiccups and heartburn. Although, 48 hours of hiccups isn't very little, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a listen to your chest and abdomen, just to rule out anything obvious. And I'll check your reflexes. Then we can discuss possible causes. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. It's just… I really hope we can figure out how to stop these things!
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, Ms. Redeye. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take deep breaths, if you can, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Deep breath… and again… Good. Lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just… feels a bit normal, I guess. Ooh, maybe a little there, on the left side. But it's not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. It’s probably nothing, though. I get indigestion sometimes, like I said. It’s probably just the hiccups messing everything up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's check your reflexes now. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Like this? All right. Go ahead. I'm not very good at these things, though. I always feel a bit silly when someone taps my knees with a little hammer.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems normal physically, which is… frustrating. It's likely a benign case of persistent hiccups, but we should rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. Given the duration, and the fact that nothing seems to be relieving them, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. A complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. A chest X-ray and blood work… okay. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for those? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want these hiccups to stop.
DOCTOR: No special preparation for the blood work, just nothing to eat or drink for eight hours beforehand. The X-ray… well, just wear comfortable clothing. No metal, obviously. As for results, the blood work should be back within 24-48 hours. The X-ray, usually within the same timeframe, but sometimes it can take a little longer depending on the radiologist. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or if the hiccups become intensely painful, you need to go to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, and if they get really bad, emergency room. Got it. I'm just hoping it doesn't come to that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, any home remedies you'd recommend, even though I've tried a few? Or is it best to just wait for the tests?
DOCTOR: Honestly, Ms. Redeye, at this point, most home remedies are unlikely to be effective. You've already tried the common ones. However, small, frequent sips of water might help to soothe the irritation in your esophagus. And try to avoid carbonated beverages or anything that might cause bloating. But mostly, it's best to avoid getting agitated or stressed, as that can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. We'll get these tests done, and then we'll have a better idea of what's going on. I'm sending the orders to the lab now. The receptionist will schedule the X-ray for you. Do you have any questions before I let you get changed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That makes sense. Small sips of water, and try not to get stressed… easier said than done when you're hiccuping constantly! Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at me. I’m glad we’re getting this checked out. I suppose I'll go and see the receptionist then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is quite efficient. Hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. And if anything changes – anything – don't hesitate to call. Don't worry too much, Ms. Redeye. It’s likely nothing serious. Have a good day.
