DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And my daughter, bless her, she thought I should come in. It’s just… sudden things, you know? Hearing goes, and I get so dizzy. And… my husband, he used to have something similar. It’s all a bit of a blur now, honestly.
DOCTOR: I see. Sudden changes in hearing and dizziness can certainly be concerning, and it’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. And it’s helpful to know your husband experienced something similar. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s been happening. When did you first notice these changes in your hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, exactly? It’s… hard to say. A few months, maybe? It comes and goes, you see. Not every day. Sometimes it’s just a whooshing sound, other times… well, it feels like the room is spinning. It’s been worse lately, I think. That's probably why my daughter pushed me to come see you. I wish I could be more specific, but everything feels… mixed up.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s common for these things to develop gradually, and it’s understandable that it’s difficult to pinpoint an exact start date. “Worsening lately” is a good detail to have. When you say the room is spinning, does that happen with any particular movements, like when you turn your head, or stand up quickly?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, sometimes when I turn my head quickly, it gets worse. And standing up… oh yes, definitely standing up. Not every time, mind you, but if I rush it, then whoosh! Everything goes a bit wobbly. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds, but it’s… unsettling, you know? Especially when I'm out shopping.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds like positional changes may be triggering these episodes. Now, besides the dizziness and changes in hearing, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Sometimes, I feel a bit… off-balance, even when I haven’t been spinning. Just a little unsteady on my feet. And… sometimes I get a ringing in my ears. Not constant, just… now and then. It’s a high-pitched sound, I think. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, but I put that down to my age, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have occasional unsteadiness, ringing in the ears – we call that tinnitus – and some fatigue. It's good you're mentioning all of this, even the things you attribute to age. Fatigue can sometimes be a symptom of underlying issues. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, the doctor always said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. He put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't like the way they made me feel. And… my memory isn’t what it used to be, if you haven’t noticed. But other than that… not that I recall. My husband always handled the doctors’ appointments. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s very common for people to stop taking medications if they experience side effects. And it’s perfectly understandable that you’re finding it difficult to recall details. We can work with what you remember, and I can access records from other doctors if needed. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you were taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… it was a little white pill, I think. And… started with a ‘B’, maybe? Or was it an ‘A’? Honestly, Doctor, it’s gone completely. My daughter might know. She was always the one who refilled the prescriptions. I’m really sorry. My mind just doesn’t seem to hold onto these things anymore. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We can certainly check your medication history through the pharmacy records. Don’t worry about it at all. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And… oh, yes! I broke my wrist once, years ago, when I fell off a horse. Had to have a cast on for weeks. Other than that… not that I can recall. Nothing serious, anyway. It's all so long ago, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, my goodness. My mother had a bad heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And… my husband’s father, he had trouble with his balance as he got older. Kept falling down, poor man. He used to get terribly dizzy. And… yes! His sister, she went deaf when she was older. It was very sad. That’s about all I can remember, really. It’s all a bit jumbled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, balance issues, and hearing loss. That's helpful information, Ms. Mayhugh. Given your symptoms and family history, it's important to investigate this further. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just have a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. No reactions to any medications that I can recall. I used to get mosquito bites, of course, but who doesn’t? No, I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, actually. I do take something. Just for my arthritis. It’s… naproxen, I think. Just one a day, to help with the aches and pains. That’s it, really. Nothing else. Unless you count the occasional cup of tea!
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis. Thank you for letting me know. Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing all this dizziness. It's… unsettling, you know? And I'm ready to get this sorted if we can. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Mayhugh. We’ll take things one step at a time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look in your ears. After that, I’ll do a few simple balance tests and check your neurological function. If you could just lean back, please. Take a few deep breaths for me. I’m listening for any unusual sounds… Your breathing sounds clear, but I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm to your heartbeat. I'll make a note of that.
PATIENT: Oh… irregular, you say? Is that… bad? I haven’t been feeling unwell, exactly, just… dizzy. Is that related, do you think? I always get a bit anxious when doctors listen to my heart. My mother had a weak heart, you see…
DOCTOR: It's good you're letting me know about your mother's history. An irregular rhythm doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, Ms. Mayhugh, but it's something we need to investigate further. It could be a simple arrhythmia, or it could be related to other factors. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears to see if there's any wax buildup or signs of infection. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Hmm… I see some cerumen, or earwax, in your ear canal. It's not excessive, but it could be contributing to your hearing changes. And the eardrum itself appears to be slightly… dull. It's hard to say for sure without further testing, but it's possible there's some fluid buildup behind the eardrum.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little strange. Dull, you say? Fluid… This is all a bit worrying, isn't it? My hearing hasn't been completely gone, just… muffled sometimes. And the dizziness… is that connected to the ears, do you think? I'm just getting a bit confused now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Mayhugh. It's perfectly natural to feel worried when you're experiencing these symptoms and hearing unfamiliar medical terms. The dizziness could be related to your ears, specifically the inner ear, which is responsible for balance. However, it could also be caused by other factors, such as your irregular heartbeat, or even a problem with your neurological system. Now, I’m going to check your balance and coordination. Could you please stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Closing my eyes… This is making me a bit dizzy already, Doctor. I hope I don't fall. Be careful, now… I'm not very steady on my feet as it is.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Just take your time. I’m right here. Could you please keep your feet together and try to maintain your balance for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Oh… this is… difficult. I feel like I’m going to fall over. Thirty seconds… is that a long time? I can’t… I don't think I can do this much longer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s enough. It’s perfectly alright. You did your best. Your balance is definitely affected, Ms. Mayhugh. Based on your symptoms, medical history, and the findings of the physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a condition called vestibular neuritis, which is an inflammation of the inner ear that can cause dizziness, hearing loss, and balance problems. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some further tests. I’m going to order a complete blood count to check for infection, an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm, and an audiometry test to evaluate your hearing. I also recommend a referral to an ENT specialist, or ear, nose, and throat doctor, for a more thorough examination of your ears and inner ear. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… vestibular neuritis… It sounds… complicated. And more tests? I suppose… if it will help figure out what’s wrong. And an ENT specialist… yes, alright. My daughter would probably want me to see a specialist, anyway. But… will these tests take long? And will they be painful? I don’t like needles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Mayhugh. The tests are relatively straightforward and shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. The complete blood count involves a simple blood draw. We’ll just need a small sample of your blood, and it will only take a few minutes. The ECG involves attaching a few electrodes to your chest to record your heart rhythm. It’s painless and non-invasive. The audiometry test involves wearing headphones and listening to different sounds to assess your hearing. It’s also painless. The tests can usually be completed within a few days. I'll write you a referral to an ENT specialist and provide you with a list of local specialists. They will be able to perform a more thorough examination of your ears and inner ear and provide you with a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. As for the blood draw, if you're particularly anxious about needles, we can use a numbing cream to help minimize any discomfort. We can also take things very slowly and ensure you're comfortable throughout the process. I want to assure you that we're here to support you every step of the way. We'll work together to figure out what's causing your symptoms and get you back to feeling your best.
PATIENT: Alright… alright, that sounds… manageable. Numbing cream… that would be good, yes. And you’ll explain everything to me before the tests? I don’t like surprises, Doctor. My daughter will be relieved to hear all this, I think. She worries about me so much. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything… and for being patient with me. It’s just… all a bit overwhelming, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. I will explain everything to you in detail before each test, and we will go at your pace. There will be no surprises, I promise. And it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. It’s natural to feel anxious when you’re dealing with these kinds of symptoms. Here’s the referral to the ENT specialist and the test orders. I’ve also included a list of local specialists and the contact information for the lab. I recommend scheduling the tests as soon as possible. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can get a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. I’ll also give you a copy of your chart summary to take home with you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again… for everything. You’ve been very kind. I suppose I should go and call my daughter now… and schedule those tests. I just hope it’s not anything too serious. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Mayhugh. I’m glad I could help. I’m optimistic that we’ll get to the bottom of this. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well, Ms. Mayhugh. And give your daughter my best.
