DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Theriot, have a seat. Twenty-four years old… looking a little thin, if you don't mind my saying. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, thanks. It’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side. A lot of… problems. Heart stuff, mainly. And cancer. It’s just… I want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, you know? I’d rather know if something’s going to happen than just… wait for it.
DOCTOR: “Preventative,” you say. Alright. Family history is… important, I suppose. Though frankly, worrying about what might happen isn't usually the best use of resources. But, we can indulge you. Let’s start with the heart stuff. Your mother – what specifically was wrong with her?
PATIENT: Ugh, “indulge me”? That’s… rude. Anyway. She had… arrhythmia, I think? Something with the beating. And high blood pressure, for years. She was always tired. And then… well, she had a stroke, a few years back. That’s what really got me thinking. My grandfather on that side… same thing, basically. High blood pressure, then a stroke. It just feels… inevitable.
DOCTOR: “Inevitability” is a strong word, Mr. Theriot. And frankly, a bit dramatic. Strokes and arrhythmias have many causes, not just genetics. But alright, so arrhythmia and hypertension on the maternal side. Were these diagnosed by a physician?
PATIENT: Yes, of course they were diagnosed! Do you think my mother just imagined she had a stroke? Honestly. Yes, both my mother and my grandfather were seen by doctors. Regularly, towards the end. They were on… pills, for the blood pressure, I think. I don't know all the details. I wasn't exactly a medical student. I just… know it ran in the family. And I don't want to end up like them. It's stressful enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be… difficult. It’s just, I need specifics. “Pills” isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Theriot. Do you know what medications they were taking?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I really don't know! My mother didn’t exactly share her medical records with me. She was… private. And my grandfather passed away years ago. I just remember seeing them take pills. Little white ones, mostly. And orange ones sometimes. Is that helpful? I’m trying here, but I’m not a doctor, okay? I just want to know if I’m at risk. Is that so much to ask? And honestly, judging me for not knowing the exact names of their medications is… unhelpful. Very unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Well, frankly, “little white pills” and “sometimes orange ones” doesn’t tell me much, Mr. Theriot. It’s like telling me you drove a car – what kind of car?
PATIENT: See? This is what I mean! You're just… making me feel bad. I'm already anxious about this, and you’re… interrogating me about pill colors. It’s ridiculous. Look, can we just… do some tests? Check my blood pressure? My cholesterol? Something concrete, instead of this… pointless questioning? I’m starting to regret coming here. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Calm yourself. Fine. We can do some tests. But don't expect miracles. Tests aren't a magic wand, Mr. Theriot. They just give us information. And frankly, you're a perfectly healthy-looking young man. But if it will ease your mind… Let’s start with the basics. Blood pressure, heart rate, weight – we’ll need to do a physical exam. Roll up your sleeve. And try to relax, it will just make things harder on both of us.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. It’s not like I have a lot of other options, right? Just… try to be a little less condescending, okay? It really doesn’t help.
DOCTOR: 128/82. Not terrible, but not perfect. A little elevated, perhaps. Pulse is 72, regular. Weight is… 60 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes, 60. I told you I was thin. It’s… genetics. I don’t gain weight easily. It's just how I'm built. Is that a problem? Honestly, is everything a problem with you?
DOCTOR: Sixty kilograms for your height is… below average. We'll need to look into that further. And yes, it could be a problem. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No. No shortness of breath. I… I exercise occasionally. I walk to work. It's not like I'm completely sedentary. And I haven't had any chest pain or anything. Look, is this going to take all day? I have things to do, you know. And frankly, all this poking and prodding isn't exactly reassuring. It's just making me more anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I haven't had to take much medication, thankfully. And honestly, I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? It’s not like I’m some sort of… forgetful old man.
DOCTOR: Well, some people don't. But alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I find it disgusting. And unhealthy. Seriously? Do you really need to ask? It’s just… common sense. What kind of doctor asks a patient if they smoke? It's insulting.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No smoking. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. Socially. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. I’m not an alcoholic, if that’s what you’re implying. I’m a professional. I have… responsibilities. Honestly, this feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Alcohol occasionally. And do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? Are you trying to build a case against me? Look, I'm an engineering teacher. Do I look like someone who uses recreational drugs? That's… incredibly offensive. Honestly, I think I'm done here. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Sit down, Mr. Theriot. I’m simply gathering information. It’s my job. And frankly, your defensiveness is… concerning. Now, I need a complete medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: .
