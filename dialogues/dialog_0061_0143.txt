DOCTOR: “Bula! Welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s… a bit of a long story, I think. Something about… getting ready for a baby? My… someone told me I should come talk to someone before… before things happen. I don’t really… remember all the details. It was a suggestion, you see.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very thoughtful of you to come in and get things checked out beforehand – that’s a really good idea. And don’t worry about it being a long story, we have plenty of time. So, just to clarify, you said ‘getting ready for a baby’… are you and your partner planning to start a family?
PATIENT: A partner…? Oh. Yes… yes, that’s right. I… I think so. It's all a bit new, you see. We haven't… talked much about when, exactly. Just… thinking about it. She… she suggested I come. A good woman, she is. Very patient with me and my… forgetfulness.
DOCTOR: “That's wonderful, Mr. Verrall. It’s great you have a supportive partner. And it’s completely normal to have a lot on your mind when you’re considering starting a family. Forgetfulness happens to the best of us! Let’s start with a little bit of background, if you’re comfortable. Have you ever been to a doctor for a check-up before?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, I think so. A long time ago. When I was… working, I suppose. Sales Engineers, you see. Lots of travel. Had to get things signed off sometimes. But… not recently. Not for… this sort of thing. Mostly just… if I broke something. Did I mention I travel a lot? It makes me forget things, I think.
DOCTOR: “Sales Engineering – that sounds like a demanding job! Lots of stress and long hours, I imagine. That could definitely contribute to some memory lapses. No worries, we’ll take things slowly today. Just to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about any past medical conditions you might have had?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. That’s… difficult. I think… I had a bad back once, from lifting things. And… a cough, sometimes. But nothing… serious, I don't think. I haven't been to a hospital in… well, a very long time. I try to stay healthy. Eat… reasonably well. And walk when I can. But my memory… it plays tricks on me, you see. I wish I could remember better.
DOCTOR: “That's perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We'll do our best to piece things together. A bad back and occasional coughs are common enough. It’s good you try to stay active and eat well. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything, even if it was a long time ago?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. I don't think so. Definitely no surgeries. I… I would remember something like that, wouldn't I? Hospital… maybe when I was a child? A broken arm, perhaps? But it was… a very long time ago. I can’t really… picture it clearly. It's all… foggy. No, I’m pretty sure no surgeries. And probably nothing serious in the hospital.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – do you know if anyone has had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. That’s… a tricky one. I haven’t seen my family in a long time. Not since… well, a very long time ago. I think… my mother had… something with her heart, maybe? But I wasn't very close to her, you see. And my father… he was a strong man. Worked very hard. I don't… recall him being sick much. Lots of brothers and sisters, though. Too many to remember, really. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: “That's understandable, Mr. Verrall. It’s common for families to be spread out, and memories can fade over time. Knowing a little about family history can be helpful, but it’s not essential. Let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Definitely not recreational drugs. Never touched them. Smoke? No, I stopped smoking years ago. Bad for you, you see. And… I drink a little wine sometimes. With dinner. Just a glass or two. Nothing… excessive. It helps me relax. But not every night. Mostly on… special occasions. Not much alcohol, really. A very social drinker, if you can call it that.
DOCTOR: “That's good to know, Mr. Verrall. And it’s great you made the decision to stop smoking. Now, just to finish up with the background information, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, that I recall. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle with pollen sometimes, but nothing serious. No… no bad reactions to foods, or… or anything like that. I’m pretty sure. My partner makes me try all sorts of things. Exotic foods, she likes. But I haven’t had any… trouble with them.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s helpful. Now, Mr. Verrall, you mentioned earlier that you came in because your partner suggested you get a check-up before starting a family. Can you tell me a little more about what concerns you specifically, or what she said that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Oh, right. She… she worries about my age, you see. I’m not… getting any younger. And she said… something about… risks. Things that could go wrong. She read it online, I think. Something about… older fathers having… problems. She's very informed, my partner. Wants to make sure everything is… okay. She just wants a healthy baby, you see. And she worries I… might not be as healthy as I think. It's sweet, really. But it makes me… a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: “That's very thoughtful of her, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly normal to have concerns about age and potential risks when considering starting a family. And she’s right to be proactive. There are some things that become more common with increasing age, but many older fathers have perfectly healthy babies. We can definitely address those concerns today. To get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a general assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that sounds… fine. A physical exam. Okay. As long as it’s… not too strenuous. I haven’t had one in… well, a very long time. But if you think it’s necessary, then… yes. Go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Verrall. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… here you go. It's been a while since I've had anyone look at my arm like this. Everything feels a bit… strange.
DOCTOR: “Alright, just relax your arm for me. Breathe normally… 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. “Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me… in and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. “Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. Everything seems normal here as well. “Your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon with age. Overall, your physical exam is fairly unremarkable. However, given your age and the potential concerns about starting a family, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a more detailed picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Blood tests… yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it's necessary, then… yes. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. I trust your judgment. What… what sort of things will they be looking for? Just… so I know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Mr. Verrall. We’ll be looking at a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a hormone panel to check your testosterone levels. We’ll also check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential risks before starting a family. It's a standard set of tests for someone in your situation. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. Once we have them, we can discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds… thorough. A good idea. A few days… alright. I can wait. Thank you, Doctor. You've… put my mind at ease a little. I was worried it would be… something serious. What do I need to do for the blood tests? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could reassure you a little. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We’ll give you a form with specific instructions when you leave. The lab is just down the hall here. You can go any time tomorrow morning. Once you’ve had the tests done, you can give the lab a copy of the form and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… perfect. A week… alright. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been very… patient with me and my… forgetfulness. I appreciate it. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I’ll make sure to fast and go to the lab tomorrow. Is there anything else I need to do or remember?
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t worry about your memory – we all have our moments. Just focus on fasting for the blood tests tomorrow, and we’ll take it from there. I’ll also give you a handout with information on healthy lifestyle choices for potential fathers, including diet, exercise, and avoiding harmful substances. It’s good to be prepared. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm. You’ve been wonderful. I’ll see you next week. .
DOCTOR: “You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you next week. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then.” .
