DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines, good to meet you. Ninety years young, that’s impressive. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, dear. It feels older some days, I won't lie. The doctor back home... he retired, and my daughter thought I should get checked out by someone new. My blood pressure's been a little high, she says. I mostly just feel tired, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A little high,” huh?
PATIENT: Well, that's what she told me. She's always fussin' over numbers. I don't rightly know what the number is, just that he wanted me to keep an eye on it and now she wants me here. Does it matter? Is it bad? I mostly just bake, you know. Pies and breads, that's all.
DOCTOR: It can matter. High blood pressure, if left unchecked, can lead to…well, let’s just say it puts strain on your heart. And we don’t want that, especially at your age. Now, your daughter mentioned this was a recent concern?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. Maybe a few months now? It ain’t been sudden, but she got a new machine to check it herself and that's when she started worryin'. Before that, I felt just fine. A little slower movin', but that's just gettin' old, right?
DOCTOR: Well, slowing down can be part of aging, yes. But we still need to rule things out. Let's get some baseline information. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or is this all new?
PATIENT: No, never diagnosed. Like I said, the doctor I had for years… he just said I was gettin’ on in years and to take it easy. He didn't mention anythin' about numbers or diagnosin’ nothin'. He just knew me, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's helpful to know. Alright, Ms. Steines, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure myself to get an accurate reading. Then we can talk about some possible next steps.
PATIENT: Sounds good, dear. Whatever you think is best. My bones are a little creaky, so try not to jostle me too much.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be gentle. Just lie back on the table. And try to relax. Okay. Blood pressure is… 162 over 94. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds… a bit of a murmur, but not acutely concerning for your age. Lungs are clear. Well, your daughter was right to be concerned. That blood pressure is elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that…bad? I don't understand all this doctor talk. I just make pies, remember? Is it gonna make me…sick?
DOCTOR: It means your heart is working harder than it should be to pump blood through your body. And yes, if left untreated, it can lead to serious problems like heart attack, stroke, kidney problems…but let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It's manageable. We'll start with some lifestyle changes and see if we can get it under control. Do you watch your salt intake?
PATIENT: Salt? I… I use salt when I bake, of course! And a little on my potatoes at dinner. I don’t know about watching it. I've always just cooked how my mama taught me. Is salt bad now? Goodness. I need salt for my pies! They won't taste right without it.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Steines, I’m not saying you can’t enjoy your pies. But excessive salt contributes to high blood pressure. We'll need to make some adjustments. And frankly, your diet is probably contributing to this. Do you eat a lot of processed foods?
PATIENT: Processed foods? Like… from a can? I mostly just bake with flour and sugar and fruit. I get my potatoes and such from the farmer's market. I don’t eat a lot of… things in boxes, if that’s what you mean. I eat pretty healthy, for an old woman. My husband… he liked his bacon, though. I used to make him a lot of bacon. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay. Look, Ms. Steines, I understand you've lived a long life and have your own routines. But we need to address this blood pressure. And frankly, your weight is also a concern. 85 pounds for someone almost six feet tall… that’s significantly underweight. It's not just about salt. It’s about overall health. Have you been losing weight recently?
PATIENT: Goodness. You're makin' me feel awful, dear. I am thin, always have been. My mama was thin, and her mama before her. I don't try to be thin, it’s just…how I am built. And yes, I've lost a little weight since my husband passed. Food just doesn't taste the same without him. It's hard to explain. I eat when I'm hungry. I just don’t have a big appetite anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Ms. Steines, I'm going to be blunt. Your weight, combined with the elevated blood pressure, is… concerning. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions causing this weight loss. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a CBC. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. I’ll also give you a referral to a nutritionist. They can help you with meal planning, if you’re willing.
PATIENT: Tests? More appointments? Oh dear. This is a lot. I just wanted someone to tell me why I'm tired. I didn't want all this…fuss. A nutritionist? I make pies, dear. I know how to eat. Is it gonna hurt? All these tests? I'm a bit scared of needles.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Steines, I understand you're apprehensive, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate care. The blood draw is quick, and the discomfort is minimal. It’s a small prick, honestly. Here. Take these to the lab and schedule an appointment with the nutritionist. They’re located at… . We'll discuss the results in two weeks. If you experience any sudden dizziness, weakness, or chest pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
