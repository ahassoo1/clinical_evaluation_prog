DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think they call it. And I keep getting water infections, you see. It’s been happening for a while now. The doctor back home… he said something about my kidneys, but I don’t quite remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Flank pain and recurrent water infections. That’s good information to start with. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. When did this flank pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. It wasn’t all at once, you see. It started… maybe six months ago? A little ache, now and then. I didn’t think much of it at first, just put it down to getting older, you know? But it’s been getting more frequent, and… sharper. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, I think. Sometimes it feels like it goes through to my tummy.
DOCTOR: Right, so starting about six months ago, intermittent ache on your right side, now becoming more frequent and sharper, sometimes radiating to your abdomen. Is there anything that makes the pain worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well… lying down seems to help a little. If I’m moving around a lot, or lifting things, it gets worse, definitely. Drinking water… doesn’t seem to make much difference, to be honest. And I haven’t noticed anything that completely gets rid of it, just resting. It's a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aggravated by movement and lifting, and not really relieved by anything specific except rest. You mentioned recurrent water infections. How often would you say you’re getting those?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… let me think. It used to be every few months, maybe. But lately… it feels like every six to eight weeks. Sometimes sooner. I have to go to the toilet a lot, and it burns when I go. It's not nice, I tell you. My doctor did give me some tablets for it each time, and they help for a bit, but then it comes back again.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urinary tract infections, approximately every six to eight weeks, with symptoms of frequent urination and burning. And the antibiotics are providing temporary relief. Now, let’s talk about other things. Do you have any other symptoms – nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, any blood in your urine, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, thankfully. I haven’t been sick at all, no vomiting. And… no blood in my urine that I’ve noticed. My bowel movements are… well, normal, I suppose. A little bit slower sometimes, but nothing major. I do feel a bit tired, now that you mention it. More tired than usual, but I put that down to getting older, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or blood in urine, bowel movements generally normal, but some increased fatigue. Let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take tablets for that, every day. And… I think he said something about my kidneys being a bit… enlarged? Or maybe it was something about lots of little bubbles on them? It was a while ago, and I don't remember all the medical words, you see. He sent me to a specialist for a scan, but I never really understood what they said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous finding on a kidney scan suggesting some enlargement or cysts – that’s very helpful information. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a white tablet… small, round. I think it starts with an ‘A’… Amlodi… something like that? Amlodipine, is it? Yes, I think that’s it! Amlodipine. Five milligrams, I believe. I take one every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily for high blood pressure. That's good. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. Never had anything like that. And I haven't been in the hospital, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups with the doctor, you see. A bit of a sore throat sometimes, but nothing serious. I try to stay healthy, you know? Mostly just this kidney trouble and the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure too, I think. And my brother… he had trouble with his kidneys when he was older. I don’t remember exactly what was wrong, but he had to go to the hospital for it a few times. He lived overseas, so I didn't see him much. And my father… he was mostly healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a family history of high blood pressure and kidney problems. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no smoking for me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never really liked the taste of it. And definitely no recreational drugs! I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Just like my tea and a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can take most medicines without any problems. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. Just this kidney trouble to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I’m going to gently feel your abdomen and tap on your back to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'll do whatever you need me to do. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Finally, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: A little bit on my right side, Doctor. When you press… just here. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And a little bit higher up, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not terrible, but I do feel something there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness to palpation in your right flank. And I'm also noting some tenderness when I tap here, on your right kidney area. This, combined with your history of recurrent UTIs and the family history, is concerning for a possible kidney infection or kidney stones. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some tests. I’d like a urine sample to check for infection, and some blood work to assess your kidney function and look for any signs of inflammation. We'll also need a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to rule out kidney stones or any other structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A scan sounds good, if it will help find out what's wrong. And the blood tests and urine sample… yes, go ahead. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain, you see. It's been worrying me for a while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I’ll get the orders for those tests sent to the lab. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. For the CT scan, we'll schedule that for you. The imaging center is located just down the street, and they’ll give you specific instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you an antibiotic to start treating a possible infection, just to be on the safe side. It’s called Nitrofurantoin, and you’ll take it twice a day for seven days. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. About the antibiotic… will that make me feel sick? Sometimes those tablets upset my stomach, you see. And the scan… will it hurt? I’ve never had a scan before.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Espinueva. Nitrofurantoin can sometimes cause nausea or stomach upset in some people, but it’s usually mild. Taking it with food can help minimize that. If you do experience significant nausea or any other concerning side effects, stop taking it and call the office. As for the CT scan, it’s a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The machine takes images of your abdomen and pelvis using X-rays. You might be asked to hold your breath for a few seconds at a time during the scan. There is some radiation involved, but the amount is very small and not generally harmful. The technician will explain everything to you in detail before the scan, and you can ask them any questions you have. I’m also going to give you a prescription for some pain relief, just to help manage the discomfort until we get the results of the tests. It’s a mild pain reliever called Paracetamol. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that does, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. So, just take the antibiotic with food, and the pain relief when I need it. And then go for the scan… and wait for the results. I think I understand. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and figure out what's wrong. It's a bit worrying, but I feel much better knowing we're doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly with the prescriptions and to draw your blood. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll review the test results as soon as they become available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any other questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I’ll see you when the test results are back.
