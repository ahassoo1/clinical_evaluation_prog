DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pain. In my back. It’s been… troublesome. I would like to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll try to be as efficient as we can. “Troublesome” is a good way to put it. Can you tell me a bit more about this back pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… three weeks ago, I think. Maybe a little longer. I was putting up fence – my work, you see – and I bent over, and then… a sharp pain. Not a fall, just… a bend. It hasn’t gone away properly since. It’s…constant, mostly, but gets worse when I move. Especially bending.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it came on acutely while you were working, putting up a fence, and has been present for about three weeks now. It’s constant, but aggravated by movement, particularly bending. Is the pain in a specific spot, or is it more widespread?
PATIENT: It's…lower back. Right in the middle. Not on the sides, not high up. Just… the small of my back. It feels…deep. Like a muscle, maybe, but…deeper.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, right in the middle, a deep ache. And you feel it’s maybe muscular, but deeper than a typical muscle pain. Has the pain radiated anywhere – down your legs, into your buttocks, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. It goes down my left leg. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. Just… the back of my thigh. And sometimes a little tingling. Not numbness, just… a funny feeling. It doesn’t happen every time I move, though. Mostly when I’ve been standing a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the pain radiates down the back of your left thigh, with some tingling, and is more noticeable after prolonged standing. Has anything made it better?
PATIENT: Sitting helps. Not perfect, but… better than standing or moving. And… warm water. A warm bath. It eases it for a little while. I take some over-the-counter pain pills, too, but they don’t really do much.
DOCTOR: Sitting and warm water provide some relief, and over-the-counter pain medication hasn’t been very effective. I see. Before we do a quick exam, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Not much to tell. I’ve always been healthy, mostly. Had the usual childhood things. No serious illnesses. My husband… he had heart trouble. Passed away five years ago. I have Medicare, if that’s important. And I don’t have a regular doctor, not anymore. He retired.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been difficult. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare and lack of a primary care physician; that’s helpful. Just to be thorough, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not to anything I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’m Lakota, you see. We… ate what we could get. No sensitivities, no rashes, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And thank you for sharing that with me. Okay, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to do a brief physical examination of your back, if you're comfortable with that. We'll start with just looking at your posture, feeling for tenderness, and checking your range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. I would like to be finished as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, we’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, if you can just point to where you feel the most pain right now… and then I’ll gently feel along your spine and muscles. I'm going to start with your posture. I notice a slight flattening of the normal lumbar curve. Now, tell me if this is tender... "Okay, that does seem a bit tender right there, and a little bit on either side." "And bending forward seems to reproduce the pain, and it limits your range of motion somewhat. I also want to check your reflexes and sensation in your legs..." "Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact bilaterally."
