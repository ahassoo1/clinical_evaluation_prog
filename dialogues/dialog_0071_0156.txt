DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. It's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Galena. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it's my stomach, mostly. I’ve been… having a lot of trouble with diarrhea, and it just won’t stop. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's pretty disruptive, to be honest. I… honestly can’t really remember when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. That is disruptive. And you said diarrhea… is it frequent?
PATIENT: Frequent… yeah, pretty much all the time. Not constantly, but… a lot. Like, several times a day, every day. It’s… watery, if that makes sense? And sometimes there’s… well, you know. It's embarrassing to talk about. I… I don’t really know what else to say about it. I just feel really tired all the time because of it.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to talk about. Don’t worry, this is a safe space. Watery… and several times a day for a few weeks. Okay. And have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… um… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s… hard to tell sometimes, honestly. And mucus… maybe? I’m not really sure what mucus looks like, to be fair. Sorry, I'm not very good at describing things. I just know it’s… not normal. Does that make sense? I… I do feel a bit bloated sometimes too. Like, really uncomfortable after I eat.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense. Bloating is good to know. And don’t apologize—you’re doing fine. Okay, so watery diarrhea, several times a day for a few weeks, some bloating… have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside this?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. I might have felt a little warm sometimes, but nothing that I thought was a fever. No vomiting, thankfully. Nausea… sometimes, yeah. Just a little bit queasy, especially before… well, you know. Before everything happens. It's not bad nausea, just… unsettled. It comes and goes. And I’m really tired all the time, like I said. More tired than usual, anyway. I just feel… drained.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see here you’ve had a couple of Medicare visits recently. Anything related to this?
PATIENT: Oh, um… maybe? I forget things easily, you know? I think I went to the doctor a while ago about stomach problems… something about it being hard to digest things? And they mentioned something about… IBD? Or celiac? One of those. They did some tests, but I don't remember what they found. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don't remember much. I’ve just been trying to manage it on my own, mostly. My husband has been really helpful, though.
DOCTOR: IBD or celiac… Alright, let me pull up those records. Ah, yes. You were seen six months ago, some initial testing for possible Inflammatory Bowel Disease. The results were inconclusive, but they recommended a follow-up. Do you recall if they gave you any dietary recommendations at the time?
PATIENT: Dietary… oh! I think they said to try and avoid gluten? And… something about dairy? I tried for a bit, but it was hard to keep track of everything. My husband helped me a lot with it, but it just felt… overwhelming. I guess I didn't stick with it consistently. I'm sorry. I just… I don't have a very good memory, and it's hard to change everything at once. Does it matter? Is that why I’m still having problems?
DOCTOR: It doesn't matter. And it's perfectly alright. These things are often tricky to pinpoint. The inconclusive results six months ago, and the inconsistent dietary changes… it all adds up. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Then we can discuss some further testing options. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. A physical exam sounds good. I… I trust your judgement, Dr. Galena. I just want to figure out what’s going on and hopefully feel better soon. I’m just… tired of feeling like this all the time. Lead the way, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get started. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… is there anything specific I need to do? Or just… lie here? I’m a bit clumsy sometimes, so sorry if I bump into anything.
DOCTOR: Just lie comfortably. Don't worry about a thing. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on it to feel for any tenderness. Just relax. I’m hearing… normal bowel sounds, thankfully. A little bit of activity, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently press here… does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit. Right there… on the lower left side. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… a little bit when you press here, too. Not as bad, but… yeah. It's hard to explain. Like a pressure, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left and right quadrants. Dull ache, with some pressure. I'm also noting some mild bloating. No rebound tenderness, which is good. It doesn't sound like anything acutely concerning, but we need to investigate further. Given your history and these findings, I'd like to order a stool sample test, a complete blood count, and a C-reactive protein test. These tests will help us rule out infection and inflammation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly okay. Stool sample, blood count, and… C-reactive protein? Okay. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Galena. I just want to get to the bottom of this. How do I… do the stool sample? Is it hard? I always worry about doing things wrong. And… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: It's not hard at all! We'll give you a kit with instructions, and it’s pretty straightforward. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample in a container and bring it to the lab. We’ll provide everything you need, and the lab technicians are very helpful if you have any questions. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them, and we can discuss the findings and next steps then. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… a lot less scary than I thought, actually. Three to five days. A follow-up appointment. Okay, that's good. Thank you, Dr. Galena. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not making me feel like I'm crazy. It’s hard to explain sometimes, and I get worried that people won’t believe me. So, just get the kit and bring the sample to the lab… is there anything else I need to do? Or prepare?
DOCTOR: No, nothing else for now. Just follow the instructions in the kit carefully. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. One thing I do want to advise is to stay hydrated - drink plenty of fluids, especially since you've been experiencing diarrhea. And if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Stay hydrated, call if I have questions, and go to the ER if things get worse. Got it. Thank you so much, Dr. Galena. I feel a lot better just knowing we have a plan. Is there anything you need from me right now, or are we all set? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up too much of my time at all. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. The nurse will bring you the kit and schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And honestly, you're very easy to talk to, Jase. Just focus on staying hydrated, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I think we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Is there anything else at all before I let you get changed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Galena. Really. You’ve been wonderful. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’m going to go get changed, and I’ll see the nurse when she’s ready. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Jase. Take care. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
