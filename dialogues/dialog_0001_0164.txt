DOCTOR: Alright, so… you're Mande Haggart, 51 years old. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Pehrson. It’s… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak lately, and I’ve got this yellowing of my skin… my eyes too. It started after I ate some fava beans. I know it sounds odd, but that seems to be the only thing that changed.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. I had them with dinner a couple of times last week. I haven’t eaten them in years, to be honest, but I was craving them. Is that… is that something that could cause this? I feel a little silly even mentioning it, it just… happened after. I'm not sure if it's related at all.
DOCTOR: Look, people come in here with all sorts of… eccentric theories. It could be something, I suppose. We'll need to run some tests. But don't go diagnosing yourself based on a bean. Alright. Let’s start with a basic history. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. You’re right to check properly. Um… well, besides the weakness and the yellowing, I've been feeling quite tired, more tired than usual. And… a little short of breath sometimes, just with normal activity. Nothing too dramatic, but enough to notice. Oh, and my urine has been… darker than normal, I think. It’s hard to tell, maybe I’m just noticing things more now that I’m worried.
DOCTOR: Dark urine, fatigue, shortness of breath… right. Any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no nausea or vomiting. And no abdominal pain. It’s mostly just the weakness and feeling… drained. And the colour, of course. It's a bit frightening to look at, honestly. I haven’t had this happen before. Is it serious, Doctor? I’m a little scared, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Look, everything's "serious" to somebody. Let’s just get some bloodwork done. We’ll check your liver function, complete blood count, all the usual things. And… just to be thorough, we’ll do a urinalysis. It'll take a few minutes. Go ahead and step onto the scale, and then we can take a look at your eyes, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. Bloodwork and a urine sample. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. And, yes, the scale. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. It’s just… the fava beans thing keeps going through my head. Is that… a known thing, Doctor? Do some people react badly to them?
DOCTOR: Alright, 132 pounds. Look, there’s a rare genetic condition… G6PD deficiency. Some people can't properly process certain things in fava beans. It can cause a… reaction. But it’s not common. Let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll get the tests back, and then we’ll talk. Now, if you’ll just look straight ahead, I’m going to take a quick look at your eyes.
PATIENT: Okay, G6PD deficiency… I’ll try to remember that. Thank you for telling me. It’s… reassuring to know it has a name, even if it's rare. Yes, I’m looking straight ahead. Please just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m a little nervous, to be honest, but I trust your judgement, Doctor. It’s good to have some idea of what might be happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. There's some mild jaundice visible in the sclera, as you can see. Not… alarming, but present. Now, let’s get that urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom. Make sure you collect a midstream sample, if you could. I’ll be right here when you’re done. Don’t take too long.
PATIENT: Okay, midstream sample. Yes, I remember that. I'll be right back with it. Thank you, Doctor. It's… helpful to have some explanation, even if it's just possibilities at this point. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Jaundice… G6PD… honestly, people and their exotic diets. Waste of my time.
PATIENT: .
