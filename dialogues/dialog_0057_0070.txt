DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Sieh, you say? Hmm. Yes. Well, I… moved here. New place. Doctor said I should… check in, you know? Social thing. Medicare wants it. Not sure why, really. Old doctor was fine. Everything was fine.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s common to establish care with a new physician when you relocate, and Medicare often encourages preventative check-ups. It's a good way to ensure continuity of care and identify any potential health concerns early on. So, even though you were feeling well with your previous doctor, this visit is a great opportunity for me to get a good understanding of your overall health history. To start, could you tell me a little bit about why you saw your old doctor, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: History… Makeup, mostly. I do faces. Theatrical things. Plays, you know? Sometimes… sometimes people want a little help looking… better. Not that anyone needs help, of course. It’s just… appearances. Old doctor just checked… things. Regular stuff. Blood pressure, I think. Never had much trouble with anything.
DOCTOR: I see, so you’re a makeup artist for theatrical productions. That’s very interesting! And you’re here for a general check-up to establish care. It sounds like you’ve been relatively healthy, which is wonderful. Just to be thorough, can you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… blood? Maybe. Old doctor said something about numbers. Not bad numbers, I think. Everything felt okay. I don’t… I don’t really do problems. I fix problems. On other people's faces! Not… inside myself. Don't remember anything serious, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like your previous doctor may have mentioned slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing that caused major concern at the time. We can certainly check that today and get a more accurate reading. To get a better picture of your health, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh. Sometimes… sometimes a little something for the… the nerves. Before a big show. Just a tiny thing. My ex-wife… she had a lot of pills. But I don't really… take anything regularly. Maybe some vitamins. The orange chewable ones. Can't remember the name. Old lady at the store recommended them.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasionally something for anxiety before performances, and a multivitamin. Do you know the dosage of the anxiety medication you take, even approximately?
PATIENT: Dosage? Doctor… the old one… he just… gave it to me. Little white pills. I take one, maybe two, if it's a really big show. I don’t measure. I don’t… do measurements. It’s a feeling thing. When my hands shake too much, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you use it on an as-needed basis, and don't have a specific dosage you regularly take. That's alright; we can try to figure out more about it if you're comfortable. To continue with your health history, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? No! Absolutely not. I fix faces, I don't need fixing. A little cut here, a little bruise there… that's it. Theatrical things. People fall down sometimes. I clean it up, put a little makeup on… they're fine. Never been inside a hospital for me. Too… sterile.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she always complained about her stomach. Something… something bad. But she was always dramatic. Everything was a tragedy with her. My father… he smoked. A lot. Coughing all the time. Died young, I think. But it was a long time ago. I don’t really… keep up with family things. It’s complicated.
DOCTOR: I see. History of stomach complaints with your mother and smoking with your father. Okay. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I mean… sometimes my eyes get itchy when I use cheap makeup. But that’s the makeup’s fault, not my fault. And dust… always dust. Makes me sneeze. But everyone sneezes, don’t they? Nothing serious. I’m a professional. I know what I can and can’t use.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known drug or food allergies, just a mild sensitivity to dust. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, are you experiencing any symptoms currently – anything like pain, fatigue, fever, cough, or anything else that's bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? A little tired, maybe. But I’m always tired. It’s the shows. Long hours, you know? And my back… sometimes aches. From bending over, fixing faces. But it’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing to worry about. I’m fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild fatigue and occasional back pain. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. That includes checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh, alright. If you must. But don't poke too much. I’m a delicate artist, you know. And don’t tell me I need to lose weight. I am… perfectly proportioned for my profession.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be as gentle as possible. And I assure you, I won't mention anything about weight. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated. We'll want to monitor that. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your back muscles are a little tense, but I don't feel any areas of significant pain or tenderness. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: 142? A little? Everything was fine with the old doctor. Probably just the excitement of moving. New place, you know? And… and you poking around. Makes me nervous! Ouch! Yes, that’s… that’s where it aches. But it’s just old age. And stress! A lot of stress. Fixing faces is a very serious business.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for blood pressure to fluctuate with stress or a change in environment. The back pain does seem musculoskeletal, likely related to the physical demands of your profession. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some routine blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, check your cholesterol levels, and rule out any other potential causes for your fatigue and back pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, alright. If you insist. But I don’t like needles. And don’t tell me I need to eat healthier. I eat perfectly well! Lots of… of biscuits with my tea. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: We’ll get through it, Mr. Szmyd. I understand your concerns about needles. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. And no, I won't tell you to change your diet. Biscuits with tea sound lovely! The blood work is just a routine precaution to get a more complete picture of your health. It will include a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, and a lipid panel. We’ll also check your thyroid function, just to be thorough. I'll write you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to see you right away. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… get it over with. And tell them to be gentle. Very gentle. I have a show next week, you know. Can’t have a bruise on my hand. It would be a disaster!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I'll make a note to let the lab know about your show and to be extra careful. Here's the order. Just take this to the front desk and they’ll direct you to the lab. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results once they're available. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No. I think… I think that’s enough poking and prodding for one day. Just… don’t expect me to be cheerful at the show if I have a big bruise. It ruins my concentration, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I understand. We'll do our best to ensure you don't have any unnecessary bruising. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and best of luck with your show!
