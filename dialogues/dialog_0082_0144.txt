DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilly. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Izz-o-lee-no, is it? That’s… a name. Honestly, I’m not even sure why I’m here. My daughter just… insisted. Said I should get “checked out.” Old age, I suppose. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Just… curious, I guess. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Izz-o-lee-no, yes, that’s right. And it is alright, Lilly. Perfectly alright. It's good to be proactive, even if you’re feeling well. Sometimes a check-up can catch things before they become… troublesome. Your daughter sounds like a thoughtful woman. So, even though you feel fine, let’s just talk a little bit about your overall health, shall we?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Thoughtful, she is… when she thinks I need something. Always fussing. Alright, alright. Talk is cheap, I suppose. What do you want to know? Don't go asking me about what I had for breakfast, though. I barely remember yesterday, let alone what I ate. Honestly, these things just… slip my mind. It's frustrating, really. I used to have a wonderful memory. Used to be a surgical tech, you know. Needed to remember everything.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lilly. Memory can be… fickle as we get older. It's common, and frustrating, as you say. And being a surgical tech—that does require a sharp mind! That’s quite a background. No, I won’t ask about breakfast. Let’s start with this: have you noticed any significant changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Significant… well, now that you mention it… my knees. They ache something awful, especially when it rains. Used to be able to garden all day, now I can barely bend down to pull a weed. Is that… significant? And I get tired. Just… tired all the time. Not like a bad tired, just… a heavy tired. Does that make any sense? Honestly, I don't know what's normal anymore. It all just… blurs together.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Lilly. Knee pain and fatigue are things we should definitely talk about. Especially the knee pain – worse with the rain, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Rain or cold weather, really. It's like they're predicting a storm inside my joints. My mother used to say it was the humidity, but I don’t know… it just feels… worse. And it’s not just getting up from a chair, it's walking. I used to walk everywhere! Now… now I mostly sit. It’s dreadful. And it’s not like a sudden pain, it’s just… a constant ache. Like someone’s twisting screws in my bones. Is that… graphic? I didn’t mean to be gruesome. I just… it’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that's not gruesome at all, Lilly. You’re describing it perfectly. “Twisting screws” is… a very vivid image, and a helpful one for me to understand. It sounds like this has been affecting your daily life for a while now. To get a better picture, could you tell me if this pain radiates anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiates? Oh, dear. Now you're using big words again. Does that mean… does it spread? Hmm… let me think. Not really spread, no. It stays mostly in the knees themselves, but sometimes… sometimes I feel it in my hips, a little bit. Just a dull ache, like the knees are… pulling on them. It’s hard to tell if it’s the hips or just… leftover tiredness. Honestly, everything aches after a while. It’s just… old age, I suppose. I shouldn’t be complaining. There are people with real problems.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like you're complaining, Lilly. You're helping me understand what you're experiencing, and that's very important. And no, it’s perfectly alright to talk about what’s bothering you. So, the pain is primarily in your knees, with some occasional dull ache in your hips. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Especially after I’ve been sitting for a long time. They feel… puffy. Not terribly puffy, mind you, but definitely bigger than usual. And… and sometimes a little bit warm to the touch. Not hot, just… a little warmer. Redness… not usually. Unless I bump them, then they get a little red, of course. But not normally. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to these things unless they're really bothering me. Is that bad? I probably should be more observant, shouldn't I? My daughter would say so.
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Lilly. We're just gathering information. Your daughter sounds like she cares a lot about you. And it's good you're sharing these details. Now, let's talk about other parts of your body. Have you been experiencing any pain in your other joints—your hands, wrists, ankles, feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My hands, yes. My hands are always aching. I used to knit, you know. Beautiful things. But now… now my fingers are just stiff and sore. Especially in the morning. Makes it very difficult to… well, to do anything, really. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like they’ve been working all night. Wrists… not so much. Ankles and feet… sometimes, a little bit. Especially after I’ve been standing for too long, which isn’t very often these days. It’s just… old age, Doctor. Everything creaks and groans. Honestly, I’m probably just a fussy old woman. Don’t tell my daughter I said that.
DOCTOR: You're not fussy at all, Lilly. And I won't tell your daughter. Now, let's move on. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I recall. I haven't felt hot or shivery. And weight loss… well, maybe a little bit? I haven't been eating as much lately. Just… haven't had much of an appetite. But I wouldn't say it's significant. I mean, I'm not wasting away or anything. Just… not as hungry as I used to be. Honestly, cooking for one is… tiresome. It feels silly to make a big meal just for myself. And sometimes… sometimes I just forget to eat. Is that bad? My mind wanders, you see. It's dreadful. Everything just… slips away.
DOCTOR: It's not bad, Lilly. It’s helpful to know. It sounds like you've been dealing with quite a few things. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder control recently?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that's a personal question! Well… um… everything’s a little… slower, I suppose. Not terribly slow, just… not as regular as it used to be. And… and I have to get up more often at night, you see. Which is… inconvenient. Honestly, I don’t like talking about these things. It’s embarrassing. And frankly, I’m not sure why you need to know. Is it something serious? My daughter always says I should drink more water… is that it? She worries about everything. Honestly, I just want to know if my knees are going to fall off.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Lilly, and I apologize if I’ve been too intrusive. I just need to gather all the information to get a better picture of what’s going on. It’s all part of the process, and it’s all confidential. Now, about your knees falling off… we'll certainly investigate that! Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as arthritis, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about the past? My memory… it’s just dreadful. I had… something with my gallbladder, I think. Years ago. They took it out. And… um… high blood pressure, maybe? I took pills for it for a while. But honestly, I can’t remember the details. My doctor at the time… he retired, you see. And all the paperwork… it’s probably lost somewhere. I used to be very organized, but now… it’s just a mess. Honestly, I don’t even remember what color my living room is anymore. Is that bad? My daughter would say it’s terrible. She’s always telling me I need to be more aware of my health. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book. But I can't even focus long enough to do that anymore. Is this helping you at all, Doctor? I feel like I’m just rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Lilly. And you are helping me. It’s perfectly understandable that you don’t remember all the details—memory can be very unreliable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a terrible reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was years ago. And… um… sometimes I get a little itchy after I eat shellfish, but it’s not serious. Just a little bit of a rash. My daughter always tells me I should be careful, but I like shellfish. It’s delicious. Honestly, I probably shouldn’t be eating it, but… what’s the harm? I’m an old woman, you see. I’ve lived a long life. I’m not going to let a little bit of shellfish ruin it. Is that bad? My daughter would say it’s terrible. She worries about everything. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. Is this helping you at all, Doctor? I feel like I’m just going in circles.
DOCTOR: You’re not going in circles at all, Lilly. And no, it’s not bad. You’re doing just fine. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take… this one for my blood pressure, I think. And this little white pill… Doctor gave it to me for my knees, maybe? I can't remember the name of it. It doesn't seem to be doing much good, honestly. And… um… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my headaches, but not very often. Honestly, I don't even know what half of these pills are for anymore. My daughter refills them for me, you see. She keeps track of everything. I just take what she gives me. Is that bad? My daughter would say it's terrible. She worries about everything. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. Is this helping you at all, Doctor? I feel like I'm just going in circles. And I'm probably boring you to tears.
DOCTOR: You're not boring me at all, Lilly. It's perfectly alright to be unsure about your medications. It’s common, especially with a busy schedule and many prescriptions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, and a look at your knees and hands. It will help me get a better picture of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. But please be gentle. My bones are old and brittle, you see. And honestly, I don't like being poked and prodded. But if it will help my knees… I suppose it's worth it. Just… be careful, Doctor. And please don't tell me anything terrible. I'm an old woman, you see. I don't want to hear bad news. Just tell me if my knees are going to fall off, and then let me sit in my chair and read a book. Is that too much to ask? My daughter would say I'm being unreasonable. She always says I need to be more proactive. Honestly, I just want to be left alone. But I suppose a quick exam is better than nothing. Just… be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilly. Very gentle. I promise. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Everything sounds clear. Hmm… there is some mild swelling on both knees, and a little warmth. And it is tender when I press here… and here. Your hands have some mild swelling in the knuckles, and your range of motion is a little limited. Alright, that’s all for the exam. Nothing too terrible, as promised. We will need some bloodwork to check for inflammation and other possible causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding? Honestly, I feel like a pin cushion already. But… if it will help my knees… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a book to finish, you see. And I don't like being stuck in waiting rooms. They're always so cold and drafty. And honestly, I'm afraid they'll lose my book. It's a first edition, you see. Very valuable. But… if it will help my knees… I suppose so. Just… be quick, Doctor. And please don't tell me anything terrible. Is that too much to ask? My daughter would say I'm being unreasonable. She always says I need to be more proactive. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. Will I need a ride? I don’t drive anymore, you see. My eyesight isn't what it used to be. And honestly, I'm afraid I'll get lost. Is this helping you at all, Doctor? I feel like I'm just going in circles.
DOCTOR: You’re not going in circles at all, Lilly. And no, it won't take too long. We'll get you in and out as quickly as possible. I'll write you a requisition for the bloodwork, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And yes, you will need a ride. Do you have someone who can bring you?
PATIENT: Oh. A ride… Here. This is my daughter’s number. She usually takes me to my appointments. But she’s very busy, you see. Always working. Honestly, I feel like a burden sometimes. But… she’s a good daughter. She worries about everything. Just… call her, Doctor. She’ll figure it out. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. Will I need to fast? I haven’t eaten breakfast yet, you see. And honestly, I’m not very hungry. Is this helping you at all, Doctor? I feel like I’m just going in circles. And I’m probably boring you to tears. But… if it will help my knees… well, you know. Is it okay if I sit here for a little while longer? I need to gather my strength. My bones are old and brittle, you see. And honestly, I’m afraid I’ll fall.
DOCTOR: You’re not boring me at all, Lilly. And no, you don't need to fast for this particular bloodwork. It's perfectly alright to eat as you normally would. And yes, you can certainly sit here for as long as you need. Take your time. I'll call your daughter to arrange the transportation. Is there anything else I can get for you while I’m on the phone?
PATIENT: Oh… well… Could I have a glass of water, please? My mouth is a little dry, you see. And honestly, I'm afraid I'll faint. But… don't worry about it, Doctor. I'm probably just being dramatic. But… a glass of water would be nice. And… could you tell me again what we're looking for in the bloodwork? I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch it. But… don’t worry about it, Doctor. I’m probably just being a nuisance. But… a glass of water and a little explanation would be nice. And… could you promise me you won’t tell my daughter I’m being dramatic? She worries about everything, you see. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilly. It’s not too much to ask. Here you are. We're looking for signs of inflammation in your blood, which can be a sign of arthritis. We'll also check your vitamin levels and rule out any other possible causes for your joint pain. It's just a routine test to get a better understanding of what’s going on. And don’t worry, I won’t tell your daughter you're being dramatic. I promise. Now, do you have any questions for me before I call your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh… inflammation, you say? That sounds… unpleasant. Is it… serious? But… honestly, I don’t want to know if it’s serious. Just tell me if my knees are going to fall off. That’s all I want to know. But… if it’s inflammation, can it be… fixed? Or is it just… something I have to live with? But… honestly, I’m afraid I’ll be stuck in bed for the rest of my life. But… could you recommend a good book to read while I’m stuck in bed? Something… light and cheerful. But… honestly, I’m probably being a nuisance again. But… could you just tell me if my knees are going to fall off? That’s all I want to know. And… could you promise me you won’t tell my daughter I asked? She worries about everything, you see. Honestly, I just want to sit in my chair and read a book, but… well, you know. And… could you bring me a blanket? I’m feeling a little cold. My bones are old and brittle, you see. And honestly, I’m afraid I’ll faint. .
DOCTOR: Lilly, your knees are not going to fall off. It’s very unlikely. We'll get the bloodwork done, and then we'll talk about the results and come up with a plan to help you feel better. We'll explore all your options. Now, let me call your daughter and get everything arranged. And don't worry, I won't tell her you asked about your knees falling off.
