DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dr. Gegan, right? Well, it’s about my head. Been… off, lately. My wife, she’s the one who really pushed me to come in. She says I’ve been forgetting things, asking the same questions… though I don't see the problem, frankly. Just a little… distracted, maybe.
DOCTOR: I see. It's good that your wife is looking out for you, and it’s common for family members to notice changes before we do ourselves. “Distracted” is a good way to put it. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by “off”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it's not like I can’t think. I set tile, you know? Stone, marble… very precise work. Requires a good memory for measurements, patterns… I haven't messed that up. But… simple things. Like where I put my glasses. Or what I had for breakfast. Yesterday I asked my wife three times if the grandson was visiting. Three times! And she'd just told me. It's… irritating, more than anything. It's not like I’m losing my skills, you understand. It's just… these little gaps.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Lason. It sounds frustrating, especially when it doesn't interfere with your work. Those kinds of memory lapses can be concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. When did you first start noticing these “gaps”, as you call them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It started gradually. At first, I just thought I was getting older, you know? A little more forgetful than usual. We all do, right? But it's been happening more frequently lately. Last month was… worse. I almost put salt in my coffee instead of sugar. My wife nearly had a fit! It’s these kinds of things, the silly mistakes, that are bothering her more than anything. She worries.
DOCTOR: That is concerning, Mr. Lason, and it's understandable your wife is worried. Six months of gradually worsening memory lapses, especially with instances like the salt in the coffee… it’s good we’re talking about this. Besides the memory issues and the occasional mistake, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. I… I’ve been a little more tired, I suppose. Not exhausted, just… sluggish. And my wife says I’ve been more… irritable. Snappish, she calls it. I don’t mean to be, it just… things bother me more easily. Little things that wouldn’t have bothered me before. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. Not all the time, but enough to make me stumble mid-sentence. It’s not a stroke, is it? Because my brother-in-law… well, he had a stroke a few years back. It wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about a stroke, especially with your brother-in-law’s experience. Those are all important things to mention, Mr. Lason – the fatigue, irritability, and difficulty finding words. It doesn't sound like a stroke at this point, but we definitely need to investigate. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… I think so. The doctor told me years ago I was borderline, but I haven't been back regularly. I don't take any pills for it. Cholesterol… never been checked, I don’t think. And diabetes? No, not that I know of. I enjoy a sweet treat now and again, but nothing excessive. My wife tries to keep me on a healthy diet, mostly. She worries about my sugar. She worries about everything, really. She's a good woman. But she fusses too much.
DOCTOR: It's good that your wife is mindful of your health, even if it feels like fussing at times. The history of borderline high blood pressure is important, and we'll need to check that. It’s also good to know you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes or high cholesterol. Before we move on, have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, weakness on one side of your body, or any difficulty with walking or balance?
PATIENT: No headaches. Not recently, anyway. My vision is… well, it’s getting older, like everything else. I need reading glasses now, but that’s just age. No weakness, and my walking is fine. I still climb on roofs to check tilework, though my wife complains about that constantly. Balance is good too. I haven’t fallen or anything. I’m still a steady hand, even if my memory isn't what it used to be. Frankly, I think she's making a bigger deal out of this than it is. But she insisted I come see you, so here I am.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Mr. Lason. It’s helpful to hear everything, even your feeling that your wife might be overconcerned. It’s good that you haven't experienced weakness or balance issues. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a simple neurological exam – check your reflexes, coordination, and memory again in a more structured way. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. As long as it doesn't take all day. I have work to get back to. Tile doesn't lay itself, you know. And I told my foreman I’d be back by lunchtime. But go ahead. Just… try to be quick, please. My wife will have my hide if I'm late. She's very particular about schedules.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let’s just take your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I’ll get a reading. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 152 over 88. We’ll need to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in… and out… good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and do a quick memory test. I’ll ask you a few questions and have you repeat a short list of words. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A list of words, huh? Like a schoolboy. Very well. Get it over with. My brain still works, you know. Just a little… slow sometimes. Don’t expect miracles. And please, keep it brief. This is precious work time you’re wasting. Though I suppose my wife would disagree. She thinks anything is more important than tile.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s just a quick assessment. Okay, I’m going to say three words, and I’d like you to repeat them back to me, and then again in about five minutes. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. There. Happy now? I remembered them. See? My brain isn't completely gone. Though I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time, these tests. I could be laying tile right now. Perfect tile. Not just… words. Though my wife will be pleased, I suppose. She always likes it when I pass tests. It validates her worrying.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Lason. You remembered them perfectly. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, just to get a more complete picture. First, do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Year? Honestly, do I look like I keep track of the year? It’s… two thousand and… something. Two thousand and twenty-five, I think. Is that right? My wife keeps the calendar. I just know what day it is if I have a job. Or don't. Though I think it's twenty-five. It feels like time is moving faster these days. Faster and faster, like a runaway tile saw. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to dates. Just jobs and tile. And occasionally, my wife's scolding.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's fine. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Can you try that for me?
PATIENT: Backwards… backwards… D-L-R-O-W. Is that right? World backwards? Honestly, who needs to spell things backwards? It's a ridiculous test. Though I did get it, didn't I? Even if it’s a pointless exercise. My wife will be insufferable if I fail. She always said I should have paid more attention in school. But tile is more important than spelling, I always say. More practical. Though I suppose she doesn't agree.
DOCTOR: That’s correct, Mr. Lason. Very good. Now, let’s just do one more quick test. I'm going to show you four objects, and I’d like you to name them. Can you tell me what these are?
PATIENT: Honestly. This is… a pen. A key. A watch. And… a comb. Are we finished yet? This is wasting my time. I could be estimating jobs, planning layouts… something useful. I mean, it’s not rocket science, is it? A pen, a key, a watch, a comb. Though I suspect my wife would find some fault with my answers even if I'm right. She always does. It’s her hobby, really. Finding things wrong. Though, to be fair, I did name them all correctly. Didn't I?
DOCTOR: You did very well, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your patience. Based on this brief assessment, and your history, there are some areas of concern, specifically with your recent memory lapses, elevated blood pressure, and a slight difficulty with recall. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on without further testing. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a cognitive screening test, which is a more detailed assessment of your memory and thinking skills. And we need to get your blood pressure under control. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work… a screening test… Honestly. It’s always something, isn’t it? First my wife frets, then you want to poke and prod. Very well. Fine. Do what you need to do. But don’t expect miracles. I’m a tile setter, not a laboratory specimen. And I don't like needles. But if it keeps my wife happy… and gets me back to work sooner… then yes. Do the tests. Just… make it quick, please. And don’t tell me everything that could be wrong. I don’t need more worries. I have enough already. Especially about tile. It’s a delicate business, tile. Very delicate.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. I won’t overwhelm you with details, but it's important to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. I’ll write up the orders for the blood work and the cognitive screening. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the cognitive screening for later this week. In the meantime, I recommend starting to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can give you a list of reliable home blood pressure monitors. And I'd also suggest making some small lifestyle changes, like reducing your salt intake and getting regular exercise, if you're able. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Salt intake… regular exercise… Honestly. You doctors always say the same things. It’s… common sense, isn't it? Though I suspect my wife will be thrilled. She'll probably put me on a diet and make me walk around the block. Very well. A list of monitors, fine. But don’t expect me to become a fitness fanatic. Tile work is exercise enough, thank you very much. One question. Will these tests… interfere with my work? Can I still lay tile? Because that’s the most important thing. Everything else is secondary. If I can’t lay tile, what’s the point of anything? Honestly. It's not just a job, you understand. It's… a calling. And I have a big job next week. A very big job. So will these tests mess that up? That's what I want to know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Lason. And the answer is no, these tests shouldn’t interfere with your ability to lay tile. The blood work is a simple procedure, and the cognitive screening is just a series of mental exercises. It might take an hour or so, but it shouldn’t leave you feeling tired or unable to work. We'll schedule it for a time that’s convenient for you, and if you do feel any fatigue after the screening, just let us know. Your work is important, and we want to make sure these tests don’t disrupt it. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. You’ve covered everything. Blood work, screening test, don’t mess up the job… Very well. Just… try to be quick, please. And don't tell my wife all the details. She’ll worry too much. She always does. Honestly, she’s a good woman, but sometimes… sometimes she fusses too much. Alright. Let’s get this over with. Where do I go for the blood work? And when can we schedule this… screening test? The sooner the better, honestly. I have tile to lay. Very important tile. Don't forget that.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. The lab is just down the hall to your left, and you can go anytime today. Here are a few times for the cognitive screening – Wednesday morning at 9:00 AM or Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Just let the receptionist know you're here for the screening. I'll have the nurse give you a list of instructions for preparing for the blood work. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Lason. And we'll do our best to make sure it doesn't interfere with your work. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s… everything, I think. Honestly, I'm ready to get back to work now. Tile doesn't lay itself, you know. Wednesday morning… fine. 9:00 AM. Just… don’t keep me waiting. I have a schedule to keep. And don't tell my wife all the results, please. She'll drive me crazy. Alright. Thank you… I suppose. Though I still think this is all a waste of time. But my wife insisted. Very well. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. Have a good day, and we’ll see you on Wednesday. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
