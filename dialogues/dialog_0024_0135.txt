DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have… problem with my ear. Discharge, you see? Been happening for… maybe one week now. Not good.
DOCTOR: One week, you say. And what exactly is this discharge, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: It is… fluid. From ear. Sometimes clear, sometimes… a little bit yellow. Not much smell, thankfully. And sometimes… little bit of pain, when I press. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Fluid. Clear, sometimes yellow. Pain on palpation. Is this unilateral – meaning one ear – or bilateral?
PATIENT: Unilateral, Doctor. Only the left ear. The right ear is… fine. No problem at all with the right ear, thank you. I always keep them clean. Very important, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, cleanliness is… advisable. Have you noticed any hearing loss with this ear?
PATIENT: A little bit, yes. Not much, but… sounds are not so clear. Like… muffled. Especially when I speak quickly. Or when there is noise. I must ask people to repeat sometimes. It is… annoying.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any fever, dizziness, or nausea accompanying this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No dizziness. And no… nausea. I eat very well, thank you. Strong man, still! Just this ear… bothering me. It is… concerning. I do not like this at all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s have a look. Please recline back, Mr. Radillo. I need to examine your ear.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will recline. Please be gentle, yes? My ears are… sensitive. I hope it is not serious problem. I need my hearing for teaching. Very important.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Erythema of the tympanic membrane… some cerumen present, obstructing the view somewhat… Moderate cerumen impaction, with mild erythema. No obvious signs of perforation. Your tympanic membrane appears intact, but there’s significant cerumen buildup. This could be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Cerumen? Is that… wax? So the wax is causing the problem? I clean them regularly, I assure you! Perhaps… not well enough? What do you propose, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will I need… strong medicine?
DOCTOR: It is wax, Mr. Radillo. And sometimes, despite one’s best efforts, it accumulates. It's not necessarily a sign of… poor hygiene. However, in your case, it is obstructing the ear canal and likely causing your muffled hearing and discomfort. It's not a serious problem, thankfully. We can attempt cerumen removal. I can irrigate the ear, or, if that fails, we can consider manual removal. I prefer irrigation initially. Do you have any history of a perforated eardrum, or any previous ear surgery?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No history of perforated eardrum. And no… surgery. Never had surgery. My mother… always told me to avoid surgery if possible. Very wise woman, my mother. Irrigation… is that… water in the ear? Is it… safe? I worry about infection, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, irrigation involves gently flushing the ear canal with warm water. It’s a standard procedure, and generally quite safe, provided there is no perforation. That is why I asked. We will use a ceruminolytic beforehand to soften the wax, which further minimizes any risk. I'll need you to sign a consent form, of course. And please, try not to overthink it. It’s a simple procedure, Mr. Radillo. If you are agreeable, we can proceed. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I eat everything. Fish, meat, vegetables… everything. No problems. I will sign the… consent form. Is it long? I have another appointment this afternoon, you see. And… will this procedure hurt? I do not like pain, Doctor. Not at all. Perhaps… a little warning if it will be uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard form. Briefly explains the procedure and potential risks. It’s quite short. As for pain… it’s generally not painful, Mr. Radillo. You may feel some pressure or slight discomfort, but it should be tolerable. I will, of course, proceed slowly and cautiously. Please, have a seat and complete this. I’ll be right back to prepare the irrigation solution. Don't take too long. My schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will complete the form. Quickly, I promise. And thank you for explaining. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I see you've completed the form. Excellent. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table, we can begin. Remember to remain still during the procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I am lying back. Still, I will be very still. Please… be gentle. I hope everything is alright. I am… a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I’m just going to flush your ear with some warm water now. You may feel some pressure. If you experience any pain, or dizziness, let me know immediately. Hmm. There. I believe I’ve removed the bulk of the cerumen. Let me take a look… Much improved. The tympanic membrane is now clearly visible. Now, can you tell me if your hearing has improved at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor! Yes, it is… much better. Sounds are… clearer. Not muffled anymore. I can hear your voice… much better. Still a little bit soft, perhaps, but… a great improvement. Thank you, Doctor! It is… wonderful. I am very grateful. You are a good doctor!
DOCTOR: Good. That’s what I like to hear. Now, I'll prescribe some otic drops to prevent any further cerumen buildup. Use them as directed. If your hearing doesn't fully return within a few days, or if you experience any pain, discharge, or dizziness, return immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No more questions. I think… that is everything. Thank you again for your help. You saved my teaching! I will follow your instructions carefully. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Good day to you too, Mr. Radillo. Next!
