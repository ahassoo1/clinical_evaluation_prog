DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the flushing. I get very red, you see. Mostly in my face, but sometimes my chest too. It just… happens. Been happening a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Flushing, you say. And it’s been going on for a few weeks, possibly longer. Can you describe what it feels like when this happens, besides the redness?
PATIENT: It doesn’t hurt, exactly. More like… warm. Very warm. Like I’ve been running, but I haven’t been. And… sometimes a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light-headed. Like the room is spinning a little bit. It goes away after a while, maybe ten, fifteen minutes. But it's… worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm sensation and lightheadedness accompanying the flushing. Do you notice anything that triggers these episodes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I haven’t really noticed anything specific. It just comes and goes. I’ve been eating the same things, doing the same things. Maybe when I get a little… upset? But not always. I don’t know. It's hard to say. I try to think, but… nothing comes to mind. My wife, she would always know these things… but she’s gone now. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s difficult to pinpoint things when you’re dealing with a lot, Mr. Withycombe. So, it may be associated with stress or emotional upset, but not consistently. Let's try to be systematic. Have you noticed any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my heart beats a little fast. Not racing, just… faster than usual. And I get a little sweaty. Palms, mostly. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a little… shaky. Like I need a cup of tea. Not always, but sometimes. Is that… is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations, diaphoresis – sweating – and tremor accompanying the flushing. We're building a picture here. Now, let’s go back a bit. Have you had any changes in your medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications… no. I don’t take any medications, Doctor. Never have. I try to stay healthy. My wife, she always said I was too stubborn to go to the doctor. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, but that's it. And I stopped that last month. No changes. Really. Just… this flushing. It’s been getting… more frequent, I think. That's why I came.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications. And you’ve stopped the vitamin D. And the frequency is increasing. Now, tell me about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And a bad back once, years ago. But nothing… serious. The doctor, he always said I was healthy as a horse. Just a little… thin. He used to tell me to eat more. Nothing major. Never been in the hospital, never had any surgeries. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she had… arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don’t remember exactly. Lots of cousins, but I didn't see them much. No one that I know of had… anything like this. Flushing, I mean. Or heart problems. Mostly just… old age things. Nothing to worry about, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history of similar symptoms or heart conditions. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My wife, she didn’t like it. And I didn’t want to make her upset. I drink… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Not every night. And I don't use… anything else. Never have. A quiet life, Doctor. Mostly just watching television and… remembering.
DOCTOR: Okay. Occasional alcohol use. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. I haven't had a reaction to anything. Dust sometimes makes me sneeze, but that's all. No rashes, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. My wife, she was allergic to cats, but I’m fine. I love cats.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. No allergies, no medications, occasional alcohol, quiet lifestyle… Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My skin is… sensitive. But yes, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please have a seat here, and I’ll begin. Blood pressure is 145 over 90. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are regular, but I detect a mild murmur. It’s not particularly concerning at this stage, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Skin appears normal overall, but there is some mild erythema – redness – on your cheeks and chest. No rashes or lesions are present. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little high, and I heard a mild heart murmur, but otherwise, the physical exam is unremarkable. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be related to something relatively benign like rosacea, which causes facial flushing. However, the dizziness and palpitations raise some concern for a possible cardiac issue or an autonomic dysfunction – something affecting the nerves that control your heart rate and blood pressure. To be thorough, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. I’d also like to order an electrocardiogram – EKG – to assess your heart rhythm. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: That sounds… complicated, Doctor. Blood work and… a thing for my heart. Is it… serious? I don’t want to worry. I just want to know why I’m getting red. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. But yes… if you think it’s necessary, I’ll do it. I trust your judgement. But please… explain it to me slowly? I don’t understand all the words.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Withycombe. I apologize if I used too much medical jargon. Let me explain it more simply. The blood work is just to get a general picture of your overall health, checking things like your blood count, kidney function, and thyroid levels. These can sometimes contribute to flushing or cause similar symptoms. The EKG – electrocardiogram – is a painless test where we put some stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity. It helps us to see if there are any irregularities in your heart rhythm or any signs of heart disease. I understand your concern about the cost. Without insurance, these tests can be expensive. I will do my best to minimize the cost by ordering only the necessary tests. I can also connect you with resources in the area that may offer financial assistance or reduced rates for uninsured patients. We are not necessarily assuming anything serious, Mr. Withycombe. But because of the palpitations and dizziness, it’s important to rule out any potential cardiac issues. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Would you like me to proceed with the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. If you think it's necessary, I'll do it. I just want to know what's wrong. And… if you can help me with the cost, that would be very kind. I don’t have much money, you see. I’m… I’m a bit worried, but I trust you, Doctor. When can we do these tests?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Withycombe. I’ll write the orders for the blood work and EKG right now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can draw the blood immediately. The EKG technician will be available after that, likely within the hour. I'll also have my assistant, Sarah, speak with you about potential financial assistance programs and payment options. She’s very knowledgeable and can help you navigate the process. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. Just… a little worried, that’s all. I’ll go to the lab now. And I’ll talk to Sarah about the cost. Thank you again. And… is it okay if I ask questions later, when we have the results?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Withycombe. Absolutely. That’s what I’m here for. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions you may have once we have the results. I'll do my best to explain everything clearly and answer your concerns. Please, go ahead and head to the lab now. Sarah will be with you shortly. And remember, if anything changes or you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. .
