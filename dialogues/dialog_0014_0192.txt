DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Well, it’s for the… the army thing. The exam. Gotta get it done, you know? Before they change their minds about letting someone like me in. Not that I need it, but my boy wants to go, so… gotta show ‘em I’m still fit.
DOCTOR: Right. The army… a physical for enlistment, is that correct?
PATIENT: No, no, I’m not enlisting! My son is. I just… gotta prove I can still… handle myself. For the paperwork, mostly. They want a check-up before they let him sign anything, make sure the old man won’t fall apart if something happens. It's ridiculous, really. But his mother… she insisted.
DOCTOR: I see. So this is a medical evaluation required for your son's enlistment, and they want confirmation of your health as a… contingency?
PATIENT: Contingency… yeah, that’s a fancy word for it. They want to know if I’m gonna be a burden if… well, you know. If something bad happens. Honestly, I’m perfectly healthy. I work with engines all day, it keeps a man strong. But they got forms, and rules, and… doctors. It's a waste of my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, while it may feel like a waste of time, it’s standard procedure. And frankly, a good idea. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, a quick check-up can reveal things you wouldn’t know on your own. We’ll run through a few things, alright?
PATIENT: Look, I appreciate the… concern, I guess. But I haven't been sick a day in my life. Well, not a real sick day. Just a little cold here and there. I eat good, I sleep good, I work hard. What more do you want from a man? You got your fancy machines and your questions, but I’m telling you, I'm fine. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your frustration. But even strong individuals can have underlying conditions. It’s my job to ensure a comprehensive assessment, regardless of how you feel. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious illnesses – heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses? No. Never. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. My blood pressure is probably better than yours, working with engines keeps you… focused. And diabetes? I eat meat and potatoes, not sugar and fluff. Look, I haven’t been inside a hospital for anything more than a broken finger when I was a kid. And that was my own fault, messing around with a wrench. Just skip the questions, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. No known medical conditions. And no surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Not a single one. I fix the machines, I don’t become one. Look, is this gonna take long? I got a carburetor to rebuild before tomorrow. It’s a classic, you wouldn't understand. Needs a proper hand, not… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? You think I need medications? I eat right, sleep good, work hard, I told you! I haven’t taken a pill in my life. Not even an aspirin. I fix things, I don’t need fixing. Honestly, this is… ridiculous. Are you always this thorough with everyone? It feels like you’re looking for something that isn’t there.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Hartness, I ask these questions of every patient. It’s standard protocol. Now, allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? What kind of question is that? I live in Sweden! It’s cold half the year. You get allergies from… cold? No, I don’t have allergies. Never have. Dust, maybe, if I’m under a car all day, but that’s just common sense, you know? A little sniffle, a little cough. Everyone gets that. Not an allergy. Look, are we done yet? I can feel my carburetor calling my name.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, you seem determined to dismiss any potential health concerns. But I need to gather a complete history. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoked? Are you serious? Look at me! Do I look like a smoker? I work with engines! Breathing fumes all day is enough, thank you very much. Never touched a cigarette in my life. It’s a waste of money, a waste of time, and a waste of lungs. My lungs are perfectly good, thank you for asking. Now, are we done with the interrogations? I'm starting to think you're just trying to find something wrong with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A beer with dinner, sometimes. Maybe a glass of wine on a special occasion. Nothing excessive. I need a steady hand for my work, you know? Can’t be rebuilding carburetors with a head full of… whatever it is people get from drinking too much. It’s common sense! Are you questioning my ability to work? Because I’ll tell you right now, I’m the best engine mechanic in this county. And I don't need a doctor telling me I have a problem. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Fine. We’ll proceed with a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. It will be quick, and then we can be done. Please sit back and relax… as much as you can.
PATIENT: Relax? With you poking and prodding at me? Honestly. Fine, whatever. Just… be quick about it. I got work to do, and I’m wasting valuable time here. And don’t tell me I have a problem if I don’t. I already know I’m perfectly healthy. This is all just… a formality, right? A waste of my afternoon? Go on, then. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Good. Heart sounds are… regular. A little fast, perhaps, but within normal limits for someone who’s… agitated. Lungs are clear… though I do detect a slight residue of… oil. Not surprising, given your profession. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Reflexes are… normal. Now, let’s just check your range of motion. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Above my head? Of course I can raise my arms above my head. I’m not some… broken-down old man. There. Perfectly fine. See? What did I tell you? This is all just… unnecessary. Honestly, you’re wasting my time. Now can we please be done? I got a carburetor that’s calling my name, and a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you bend over and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Touch my toes? Really? Look, I’m a mechanic, not a gymnast. My back is perfectly fine, thank you very much. There. Happy? It’s a little stiff, maybe, but that’s from crawling under cars all day. It doesn't mean anything. Honestly, you’re looking for problems where there aren’t any. I told you, I’m perfectly healthy. And this bending over is just… ridiculous. Now can we please be done? I'm starting to feel… something pull.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you stand on one leg for at least ten seconds?
PATIENT: Stand on one leg? Are you serious? I'm not a bird! Look, this is getting ridiculous. I’m a mechanic, not an acrobat. I need both legs to work, to hold tools, to crawl under cars, to… There! Five seconds. Good enough, right? Perfectly balanced! It’s just… a little unstable. After all that bending and prodding. Honestly, you’re deliberately trying to make me look bad. This whole thing is a waste of time. Now, are we finally done? I've got a carburetor that’s counting on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’ve completed the physical exam. Your heart and lungs sound reasonably healthy, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your range of motion is limited, and your balance is… compromised. Given your age and your occupation, some of these findings are not entirely unexpected. However, I do recommend that you schedule a follow-up appointment with a specialist – a physical therapist – to address the limitations in your range of motion and improve your balance. It would be… prudent. And I strongly advise you to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I will also provide a basic health questionnaire to take home. It’s just to have a more detailed understanding of your overall wellbeing. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? A specialist? Look, I’m perfectly fine. I don’t need questionnaires, I don’t need specialists, and I certainly don’t need to waste any more of my time on this… nonsense. I told you, I work with engines all day, that keeps me fit. I’m strong, I’m healthy, and I don’t need a doctor telling me otherwise. And frankly, the idea of a physical therapist… you think I'm some fragile old man who needs coddling? No. I fix things, I don’t need fixing. Just give me the paperwork for the army thing, so my son can sign it, and I can get back to work. That's all I need. Stop trying to find problems where there aren't any. It's insulting, honestly. This whole visit has been a complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Here is the form required for your son’s enlistment. I have noted your… overall health status. It is up to the army to determine if you meet their requirements. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider my recommendations. Ignoring potential health concerns is never a good idea, regardless of how you feel. I will have my receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for blood pressure monitoring, just in case. Have a good day, Mr. Hartness. And please, take care of yourself.
