DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Andraca. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it, an endoscopy. And the results were… not quite what I expected, so my regular doctor suggested I come speak with you. It was regarding some abnormalities they found.
DOCTOR: Okay, Denis. An endoscopy, alright. And your regular doctor thought it best to have me take a look at those results and discuss them with you. That’s perfectly reasonable. Before we dive into the specifics, can you tell me a little more about why you had the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For some time now – perhaps six months or so – I’ve been experiencing some discomfort. It’s difficult to describe precisely… a sort of ache in my stomach, really. And sometimes, a rather unpleasant feeling of fullness, even after not eating very much. It wasn’t constant, mind you, but frequent enough to become worrisome. My doctor initially thought it might be something simple, perhaps just indigestion, but then suggested the endoscopy to be certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so abdominal discomfort and early satiety – feeling full quickly – for about six months. That makes sense. And it prompted the endoscopy to rule out anything more serious. Did you notice any other symptoms alongside the discomfort and fullness?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… there has been a change in my bowel habits. Not severe, but… less regular than usual. And occasionally, a bit of… well, I suppose the only way to describe it is a dark color to my stool. Not every time, but enough to be concerning. And, truthfully, I’ve been feeling rather tired lately, more so than usual for my age, but I attributed that to simply getting older. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is relevant, Denis. Changes in bowel habits and dark stools certainly warrant further investigation, and the fatigue could be related as well. Can you describe the dark stools a bit more?
PATIENT: Of course. They aren't black, precisely. More of a very, very dark brown… almost like coffee grounds, I suppose. And they aren’t every bowel movement, perhaps one or two times a week. It's been happening for maybe a month now. I did try to dismiss it as something I ate, but it kept recurring, so I mentioned it to my doctor. It’s rather unsettling, I must admit. I apologize if this is unpleasant to discuss, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. It’s important that we discuss everything, even if it is unpleasant. That description – very dark brown, like coffee grounds, occurring intermittently – is helpful. It suggests there might be some bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Let me pull up the specifics of the endoscopy findings. Just one moment… Ah, here we are. The report indicates some inflammation and a few polyps were found in the stomach and duodenum. It also mentions a small ulcer. Have you ever been told you have ulcers before?
PATIENT: An ulcer? No, never. I’ve never been told I had an ulcer. I've had stomach troubles on and off throughout my life, but nothing so serious as an ulcer, I believe. Inflammation and polyps I can understand, perhaps. But an ulcer… that sounds rather concerning, Doctor. What does that mean, exactly? And the polyps… are they dangerous? I am rather anxious, I confess. I do try to remain calm, but this is… worrying news.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Denis. It is concerning news, but let's break it down. The ulcer is a sore in the lining of your stomach, and while they can be painful, many are treatable. The polyps are growths in the lining of the stomach, and the concern with those is whether they are precancerous. The report will specify the size and type of polyps, which will help determine the next steps. Okay, it looks like the ulcer is relatively small, and the polyps are also small in number – three of them, and described as ‘adenomatous’. That type of polyp can have the potential to become cancerous over time, which is why further investigation is important. Do you have any history of H. pylori infection?
PATIENT: H. pylori? I… I don’t believe so. My regular doctor has run many tests over the years, for various ailments, but I don't recall ever being tested for anything called H. pylori. I have had a few bouts of stomach upset over the years, attributed to… well, various things, but nothing serious. Would that be something they would have tested for routinely? And what is H. pylori, precisely? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I am not a medical professional, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Denis. It's my job to answer your questions. H. pylori is a bacteria that can infect the stomach lining and often causes ulcers. It's very common, and we can test for it easily with a blood test, a stool test, or a breath test. It's often the cause of ulcers, so knowing if you have it is important for treatment. We’ll want to do a test for H. pylori. In the meantime, given the findings, I’d like to recommend a follow-up endoscopy to get a closer look at the ulcer and polyps, and to take biopsies – small tissue samples – for further examination under a microscope. This will help us determine the exact nature of the polyps and whether they need to be removed. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: A follow-up endoscopy… and biopsies. Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If it will give us more information, I am willing to do whatever is necessary. I trust your judgment. And the biopsies… will they be painful? I am… not particularly fond of procedures, if I am honest. But I understand they are necessary for a proper diagnosis. And if we do find the H. pylori… what is the treatment for that? I am trying to prepare myself for all possibilities, if you don't mind my saying so.
DOCTOR: You're doing exactly the right thing by preparing yourself, Denis. The follow-up endoscopy is the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. The procedure itself is generally not painful. You’ll be given sedation to help you relax, and a local anesthetic spray will be used to numb your throat. Most patients sleep through the whole thing and don't feel a thing. Afterward, you might have a slight sore throat for a day or two, but it’s usually manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. If we find H. pylori, the treatment is a course of antibiotics, usually combined with a medication to reduce stomach acid. It’s a fairly straightforward treatment, and very effective. I'm going to order the H. pylori test for you today. And I’ll also get the referral paperwork started for the follow-up endoscopy. Would you like me to recommend a specific gastroenterologist, or do you have a preference?
PATIENT: That sounds… much more manageable than I anticipated, Doctor. Sedation and a local anesthetic… yes, that is reassuring. And the treatment for the H. pylori sounds relatively simple as well. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. No, I do not have a preference for a gastroenterologist. If you have a recommendation, I would be most grateful. Someone you trust, and who is experienced with procedures such as this. I am… not a fan of having to explain my medical history to multiple doctors, if I can avoid it. I trust your judgment, Doctor Andraca.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Denis. I have a colleague, Dr. Ramirez, who is an excellent gastroenterologist. She’s very thorough, compassionate, and I trust her implicitly. I’ll include her contact information and referral details in the paperwork I’ll prepare for you. She is located about an hour from here, but she is well worth the drive. I’m also going to order a complete blood count to check your overall health and rule out any signs of anemia, which can sometimes occur with bleeding in the stomach. Before we finish, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: That is most kind of you, Doctor. Dr. Ramirez sounds excellent, and I appreciate your recommendation. An hour's drive is not a hardship, if she is as skilled as you say. And the blood count… yes, that sounds sensible as well. As for medications… not regularly, no. I take a low-dose aspirin every other day for my knees, as the arthritis sometimes flares up. And I occasionally take Tylenol for headaches, but that is infrequent. Otherwise, I try to manage with diet and exercise, as much as my age allows. Nothing else, Doctor. No other prescriptions, and no supplements. I do have allergies, however… to penicillin, and a mild reaction to sulfa drugs. I always inform my doctors about those.
DOCTOR: Okay, aspirin every other day for arthritis, Tylenol as needed, and allergies to penicillin and sulfa drugs. That’s very important information, thank you for letting me know. We will, of course, ensure that Dr. Ramirez is aware of those allergies before proceeding with any procedures or medications. Alright, Denis. To recap, we’ve ordered a test for H. pylori, and I’m referring you to Dr. Ramirez for a follow-up endoscopy with biopsies. I’ve also ordered a CBC. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Andraca, I believe you have addressed all of my concerns. You have been most thorough and reassuring, and I appreciate your patience with my many questions. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for your excellent care. I suppose… there is nothing more to do but wait for the test results, and contact Dr. Ramirez. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns while you’re waiting for the results. We’re here to support you. Wishing you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you after your appointment with Dr. Ramirez. Have a good day, Denis.
