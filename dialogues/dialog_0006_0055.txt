DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Ellan, right?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Gorga, is it? Yes, Ellan Rannells. Though, honestly, I still don't understand why I need a certification for something so… commonplace. My niece uses it for her arthritis, you know. Perfectly reasonable.
DOCTOR: Right, yes…certification. Hmm. Well, let’s not get bogged down in paperwork right now. Just tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my sleep, Doctor. Simply dreadful. I wake up… repeatedly. And when I am asleep, it's hardly restful. I toss and turn, and then I feel utterly exhausted all day. It’s… disrupting my routine, to say the least. And frankly, a woman my age deserves a good night’s rest, don’t you think? My husband says I’m… particular about my sleep arrangements, but I assure you, it’s a legitimate problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, sleep disturbance… yes. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… gradually worsening, really. But I’d say, properly dreadful for… at least six months, perhaps longer. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? It wasn’t sudden. Just… a slow decline into… unrest. And the television doesn’t help, of course. Too many dreadful programs on these days.
DOCTOR: Six months… Alright. And is this waking up during the night… is it happening every night?
PATIENT: Not every night, Doctor. Though it feels like it! Perhaps four or five times a week. And it's not just waking up. It's… struggling to fall asleep to begin with, then waking up, then struggling again. It's quite… draining. My husband gets quite cross, you know. Says I disturb his sleep. Men.
DOCTOR: Four or five times a week… and trouble falling asleep as well. Alright. Are you having any… other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I feel a bit… listless, I suppose. Not energetic, certainly. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Though, to be fair, the cooking these days… it's all so bland! I used to be quite the cook myself, you know. Dominican cuisine, the real stuff. Not this… watered-down nonsense. But, no, nothing… serious. Just… tired. And a bit… out of sorts.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not particularly. A little ache in my knees now and then, but that’s just age, Doctor. I’m seventy-four, after all. I'm not expecting to be leaping about like a spring chicken. It's not pain that's the problem; it’s the exhaustion. And this constant… restlessness. It's very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant pain. Alright. Have you noticed any snoring, or… do you ever stop breathing while you sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, my husband says I snore. Quite loudly, apparently! Though, I haven't any recollection of it myself, naturally. And stop breathing? I… I haven’t the slightest idea, Doctor. I’m asleep! How would I know? He’s never mentioned anything like that specifically. He just complains about the noise, mostly. Men and their… sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just my blood pressure pills, Doctor. A small dose, nothing… significant. And a little something for my arthritis when it flares up, but that's only occasionally. Nothing that would keep me awake, I assure you. I’m a very… moderate woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been quite robust, constitutionally. I remember my grandmother… she lived to be ninety-eight, and never took a pill in her life! Though, times were different then, of course. Still, I've never had any adverse reactions to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well… let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though, I must say, I don't see what a physical examination has to do with getting a bit of… relief for my sleep. But, if you insist. Do let me know if it’s going to be… undignified. I do have a certain… decorum, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Rannells. Nothing undignified, I assure you. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes...standard procedure. If you could just lie down on the examination table, please. Let’s start with your heart. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I'm not particularly flexible. And please be gentle, I have sensitive skin. A deep breath… yes, yes, I'm doing it. My heart's always been strong, you know. Though it's felt a bit… fluttery lately, now that you mention it. Probably just the stress of not sleeping.
DOCTOR: Hmm…Heart sounds are regular, rate is a bit elevated, but not drastically so. Some mild crackles in the bases of the lungs…could be from a bit of congestion. Blood pressure is 140/90…slightly elevated. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, can you tell me if you have any pain anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh! A bit tender, yes. Not pain, precisely, just… a little uncomfortable. And pressing… well, that's a bit awkward, isn't it? My ribs are rather… prominent, you know. Perhaps from losing weight. It's all very unsettling. And the congestion… I do have a bit of a cough sometimes, a dry, tickly one. Nothing serious, I assure you. Just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, abdomen is soft. A little tenderness in the upper quadrants, but nothing alarming. Okay, Mrs. Rannells. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like your sleep problems could be related to a number of factors – age-related changes, possibly some mild congestion, and stress. Your blood pressure is a little elevated as well, which could be contributing. I want to order a few tests just to rule things out – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, goodness. I was hoping for a more… straightforward solution, Doctor. A little something to help me sleep, perhaps. All these tests… it seems a bit excessive, don't you think? My niece just got a prescription from her doctor, you know. No tests, no fuss. But, if you insist. Will it take long? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon. And I do hope it won’t be too… invasive. I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Rannells. It's not ideal, I agree. But I prefer to be thorough. It’s to rule out anything serious. The blood draw is pretty quick, just a few vials. And the X-ray is painless, non-invasive. It should take about 20-30 minutes total. The results will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I can prescribe something to help you sleep, a low dose of a sedative, just to get you through. But we need to find the underlying cause. And, frankly, your blood pressure needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: A sedative… Well, that’s something, at least. Though I do worry about becoming… dependent. My husband wouldn’t approve. He believes in natural remedies, you know. Warm milk, lavender… all that nonsense. And addressing the underlying cause… yes, yes, of course. But in the meantime, can I at least get a good night’s sleep? And what about the marijuana certification? Is that still an option? My niece says it works wonders for her arthritis, and she sleeps like a baby. It seems… logical, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Rannells, we’re focusing on your sleep right now. And frankly, a marijuana certification is… not standard medical practice for insomnia. I can’t prescribe something that hasn’t been properly vetted and isn't evidence-based. I understand your niece has had success, but everyone is different. And, I’m not comfortable with that course of action. The sedative is a short-term solution. We’ll monitor you closely. We'll also discuss lifestyle changes– better sleep hygiene, regular exercise, stress reduction techniques. And, once we have the test results, we can develop a more comprehensive plan. Now, I’ll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… Honestly, Doctor. I’ve lived a very full life, thank you very much. I hardly need a lecture on sleep hygiene. And my niece swears by it! It’s hardly reckless, and it's certainly more appealing than another pill. But… very well. If you insist. But I’m not promising anything. And if I’m still tossing and turning after all this fuss, I’m going to have to reconsider my options. I have a very strong will, you know. Now, let’s get this blood draw over with. But be gentle, please. And tell the nurse I dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Rannells. I’ll have the nurse come in right away. We'll do our best to make you comfortable. We're going to get to the bottom of this, okay?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Let’s hope so. Now, please hurry. I have a luncheon appointment, you know. And I do hope the nurse is… competent.
