DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Not fun, you know? I just want to get this sorted if we can.
DOCTOR: "Real dry," you say. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… a few weeks, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away when you get older. It’s not a sharp pain, just… gritty. Like sand. And they get tired easy. I work outside, you see. Cement work. Dust. Lots of dust.
DOCTOR: Cement work, alright. So, several weeks of dryness and a gritty sensation, worse with dust exposure. Do you experience any burning, redness, or blurry vision alongside the dryness and grittiness?
PATIENT: Burning… not really. Maybe a little when the wind’s up. Redness… I dunno, haven’t looked close. Blurry vision? Sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly when I’m tired, I think. It’s hard to tell with my glasses, you know? They aren’t new.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently using any eye drops or other treatments for this dryness?
PATIENT: Nope. Never used nothin’. Just… try to blink more, I guess. Doesn’t really help much, though. I thought it might go away on its own. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Old age, maybe! I get a little tired easy, but that's just gettin' old, right? No heart trouble, no… sugar sickness, or anything like that. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Only come when somethin' really bothers me.
DOCTOR: I see. Have you ever had any eye injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I always wore safety glasses at work, thankfully. Got a bit of dust in ‘em a few times, but never nothin’ serious. Nothing ever in my eye, if that makes sense. Just… on the glasses.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well… my brother, he had bad eyesight. Wore thick glasses his whole life. Mom… she just got old, like I said. Didn't really talk about health much. I don't know nothin' about family eye trouble, if there was any. It wasn’t a thing we talked about.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t believe in takin’ a lot of pills if I can help it. Just… try to stay healthy, eat good, that kinda thing. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that's it. And I stopped that last month.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to perform a quick eye exam now. I’ll check your vision, look at the surface of your eyes, and assess your tear production. It shouldn’t take long. Could you please sit up straight and look forward?
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Just get it over with, if you don’t mind. I got things to do. But… what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without the examination, Mr. Pipolo. It could be something simple like dry eye, which is very common, or it could be something else. That's why we need to take a look. Now, if you’ll just focus on the “E” chart… Can you read me the top letter?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Let’s get this done. … That’s… is that an F? No, wait… it’s a P! A P. Definitely a P.
DOCTOR: Okay, a P. Now the next line, please.
PATIENT: … Uh… J… L… B? No… it’s… I think it’s a V. V… is that right? It’s kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, V. Now, let's move on to the next line. And try to relax, Mr. Pipolo. Don't strain your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, this is tough. It’s all fuzzy. Uh… is that an N? No… an R? I can’t make it out. This is… I don’t know, Doctor. I can’t read it. It's all just a blur. My glasses are getting old, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears your vision is significantly reduced. Now, I’m going to use a light to examine the surface of your eyes. This won’t hurt, but please let me know if it’s uncomfortable. I’m looking for any signs of irritation, dryness, or other abnormalities. Hmm. I do see some dryness and mild inflammation on the surface of both eyes. Your tear film appears to be somewhat unstable. I'll also check your peripheral vision now.
PATIENT: Okay… just get it over with. This light’s bright. Inflammation, huh? Is that bad? I told you I work outside. Lots of dust… Can’t be good for your eyes, can it? Hurry up, please. I got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: The inflammation is mild at this point, but it’s consistent with chronic dry eye and environmental exposure. We need to address it to prevent further complications. Now, I’m going to test your tear production. I’ll gently place a small strip of paper inside your lower eyelid to measure how much fluid your eyes are producing. It feels a little strange, but it's quick. Just relax, and don’t blink. Okay, that’s enough. Your tear production is somewhat reduced, which confirms the diagnosis of dry eye.
PATIENT: Dry eye, huh? That’s it? After all that? Just dry eye? What do I do about it? Do I need pills? Surgery? I really don't want either of those. Just tell me what I gotta do, Doctor. Quick. And can I get a new prescription for my glasses while I’m here? They’re useless.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Pipolo, you do not need pills or surgery. The vast majority of dry eye cases are manageable with conservative treatment. We'll start with artificial tears – lubricating eye drops – to supplement your natural tear film. I recommend using them four times a day, even if your eyes don't feel dry. I’m going to write you a prescription for a preservative-free brand, as those are gentler on the eyes. We can also consider a warm compress applied to your eyelids for 5-10 minutes twice a day to help stimulate tear production. As for your glasses, your vision has changed significantly. I'll write you a new prescription, but you'll need to take it to an optician to get new lenses fitted. Given your reduced tear production, I recommend discussing anti-inflammatory drops with an ophthalmologist. I'm going to give you a referral. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Drops… four times a day… Warm compress… This is a lot to remember. And an ophthalmologist… another doctor? Look, can’t I just get something to make it stop? Just one thing? I don’t have time for all this. Preservative-free drops… okay. Write it down, I guess. And the referral… I'll… I'll think about it. I just want to see clearly, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? And how long before these drops work? I got a lot to do, you know.
DOCTOR: The drops won't provide immediate relief, Mr. Pipolo. It usually takes several weeks of consistent use to see a noticeable improvement. We're trying to manage a chronic condition, not cure it overnight. It requires patience and adherence to the treatment plan. I understand your frustration, but these steps are necessary to protect your vision and improve your comfort. Here's the prescription for the preservative-free artificial tears. And here’s the referral to the ophthalmologist. They can assess your condition more thoroughly and determine if additional treatment options are needed. I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment with them as soon as possible. Do you have any questions about using the drops or making the appointment?
PATIENT: Fine. Drops four times a day… Ophthalmologist… I'll… look into it. I got everything I need, Doctor. Thank you. I really gotta go now. Lunch appointment. It was nice meeting you. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Pipolo. Please follow up with the ophthalmologist and remember to use the drops as directed. Have a good day. .
