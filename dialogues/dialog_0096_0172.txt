DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, it's just… a formality, really. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires these… visits. I haven't a clue what you expect me to tell you. Everything feels perfectly alright to me.
DOCTOR: Well, even a formality requires some information, dear. It’s good to be thorough, even when things feel alright. Let's start simple. Have you been experiencing any aches, pains, or discomfort anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Discomfort? At my age? Really. A few creaks and groans, naturally. It's called getting older, Doctor. I don’t need a diagnosis for existing. Is this what you do all day? Ask perfectly sensible people about perfectly sensible aches? Honestly.
DOCTOR: It's my job to determine if those "creaks and groans" are simply a part of aging, or if there's something more going on. It’s quite important, actually. Now, are these aches constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. They come and go. Like… like the tide. Sometimes I notice them, sometimes I don’t. It depends. On the weather, probably. And my mood. Really, I haven't kept a detailed log, if that's what you're expecting. Do you need me to start keeping a log now? Because that sounds terribly tedious.
DOCTOR: No, no log is necessary. Just trying to get a sense of things. And where specifically do you feel these aches?
PATIENT: Everywhere, dear. Honestly. My back, my knees, my… well, everything. It's an old body. You wouldn't expect it to be pristine, would you? Is there a quicker way to do this? I have bridge club this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. But pinpointing the areas that bother you most will help me understand what might be going on. Let’s start with your back. Is the pain sharp, dull, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dull, I suppose. Like… a heavy weight. Or a general… ache. It’s not excruciating, Doctor. I can still manage. I still do my own gardening, you know. Though my husband keeps offering to hire someone. Honestly, the man worries too much. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your knees?
PATIENT: My knees… Honestly, they’re just… old. They creak when I stand up. And sometimes feel a bit stiff in the mornings. It’s not constant, Doctor. Just… old knees. It's not a medical mystery, is it? Really. I suspect it's the weather, again. Dampness makes them worse. Is that…sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any trouble walking, or going up stairs?
PATIENT: Trouble? Well, I wouldn't say trouble. I'm not sprightly, if that's what you mean. I take my time, certainly. And sometimes I use the railing. But I manage. I wouldn’t be doing my gardening if I couldn’t. Honestly, Doctor, it's all very… normal for someone my age. Are we nearly done? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, then. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Not that I’ve noticed. Honestly, I don’t spend all day staring at my ankles. My husband might mention it, he does fuss, but he also notices when the curtains aren't quite straight. He has a keen eye for detail, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything. Is this…mandatory? Asking about my ankles? I fail to see the relevance. I'm a perfectly functional person. Really.
DOCTOR: It’s important to rule things out, Candice. Even if it seems unlikely. Now, have you had any recent falls, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: Falls? Absolutely not. I am a very steady person. Perhaps a little slower these days, but not unsteady. My husband keeps offering to install grab bars in the bathroom, can you imagine? It’s quite insulting, really. I have no need of grab bars. Honestly, I think he just likes to meddle. Yes, I’ve had a good life, I haven’t had any recent falls. Are we finished? I really have no time for this. It’s a lovely clinic, but…
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing typical age-related aches and pains, and you’re still quite functional. However, since I haven’t had the chance to do a physical exam, I'd like to just quickly check your range of motion and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. No poking and prodding, thank you very much. I came here for a formality, Doctor, not a… a medical examination. I’ve told you everything you need to know. I have bridge club, you see. And I don't have time for this. I think I’ve wasted enough of my afternoon already. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider. Without a proper examination, it’s difficult to rule out other potential issues. If you experience any worsening pain, any sudden swelling, or any difficulties with your balance, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. .
