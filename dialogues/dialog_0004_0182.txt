DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Deschane, you say? Right. Well, look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get this over with. It's about this… procedure. My daughter signed me up for it. Says I need a “clearance.” Honestly, a waste of time, but she insisted.
DOCTOR: A “clearance,” alright. And what exactly is this procedure, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s to tighten up this neck. You know, the loose skin. Getting old is dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Not that you would understand. It's just... sagging. My daughter says it’ll make me look "fresher." Honestly, I don't see the point, but she's paying for it. It's a… a face lift, I suppose. Though I don't like the sound of that. Sounds rather… extreme.
DOCTOR: A facelift. And your daughter scheduled a pre-operative clearance with us. I see. So, you're concerned about being cleared for surgery. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Concerned? No. Irritated is more like it. Look, I’ve lived eighty-one years. I’ve worked hard my whole life, laying terrazzo. Not sitting around worrying about wrinkles! I'm perfectly healthy. Strong as an ox, or I was until I twisted my back last year. But that’s healed up nicely. This whole thing is just a fuss. Do I look sick?
DOCTOR: You don’t appear acutely ill, no. However, a pre-operative clearance isn't about whether you look sick, Mr. Orwin. It’s standard procedure to assess your overall health before undergoing any elective surgery, even a cosmetic one. We need to be certain you're a suitable candidate. Now, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – heart problems, lung issues, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. This is ridiculous. Look, I had a bit of a cough last winter, but everyone has a cough. And my back, like I said. Terrazzo work… it's rough on the body. No heart trouble. No… “diabetes” or whatever that is. Just… old age, that’s all. I eat sensible. Mostly. And I don’t drink much anymore. Used to, of course, when I was younger. But that was a lifetime ago. Honestly, is this really necessary? Do you need a list of every sniffle I’ve had since 1950?
DOCTOR: While a comprehensive history isn't quite to 1950, Mr. Orwin, it's helpful to know what conditions you’ve been treated for. The cough – did a doctor ever evaluate that?
PATIENT: A doctor? Well, the nurse practitioner at the clinic down the street. She listened to my chest and said it was just a “winter bug.” Gave me something for it. Can’t remember what. Little orange pill. Point is, it cleared up. I haven’t been seriously ill in… decades. Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t waste time with doctors unless absolutely necessary. And this… this is just vanity. My daughter's vanity, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my arthritis in my hands now and then. Ibuprofen, I think. When it flares up. It doesn’t happen often. Mostly just after a cold snap. And maybe a vitamin pill. You know, a general one. My daughter buys them. She’s always trying to get me to take something. Honestly, I can barely keep track of what I’ve had for breakfast, let alone a list of pills. This is all rather… demeaning.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. However, it's crucial to have a clear understanding of your medical status before proceeding with any surgery. Even a seemingly simple procedure carries risks. Now, have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And I had a hernia operation maybe twenty years ago. Small thing. A local doctor did it. I don’t remember his name. He's probably retired by now. Nothing else. A few broken bones when I was younger, working with stone, but those healed up fine. Is that enough for you? I'm not a complicated case, you know. Just an old man who wants to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty hardy. Maybe a little hay fever in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. My daughter says I’m allergic to “stress,” but I don’t believe in that nonsense. Is this really necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, it's standard protocol to inquire about allergies to ensure we don't administer anything that could cause a reaction. Now, let’s move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. My mother lived to be ninety-two, perfectly healthy until the very end. My father… he worked with stone like me, strong as an ox, but he died in a work accident. Fell from a scaffold. Nothing to do with sickness. My brother… he had high blood pressure, I think. And a bit of a drinking problem. But that’s just… family history. Not exactly relevant, is it? Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Can we just get this clearance done?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, while seemingly unrelated, family history can indicate potential predispositions. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked a pipe, a little one, after dinner. But I always thought it was a foolish habit. A waste of good money. I preferred a good strong coffee. And a piece of cake, now and then. Is that relevant? Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather insulted. Are you implying something?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Orwin, I'm not implying anything. I’m simply gathering information to ensure your safety. One final question, and then we can move on to the physical exam. How much alcohol do you typically consume in a week?
PATIENT: Honestly! I told you, I don’t drink much anymore. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on a Saturday. Occasionally. Used to be more, of course, when I was younger, celebrating a good job. But now? Hardly ever. A small glass. It helps me sleep. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Are you trying to catch me out on something? I'm a respectable man. This whole thing is… humiliating. Can we please just get on with it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Very well. Let's proceed with a physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt. I need to assess your overall condition before I can determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery. I want to be absolutely certain that you are healthy enough to undergo this procedure safely.
PATIENT: Honestly. All this fuss for a little tightening up. Fine. Hurry it up, will you? I haven't got all day. And be gentle, I bruise easily. Old age, you know. It's a terrible thing. Absolutely terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Take a few deep breaths for me. In… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll need to document it. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though there’s some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Any history of shortness of breath, even with exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Never. I laid stone for fifty years, lugging heavy blocks up hills. If that didn't give me shortness of breath, I don’t know what would. I get a little winded climbing the stairs these days, but that’s just… old age. And the back, like I said. Not that you’re listening. Honestly, I'm not as frail as I look. Just a bit stiff. That's all. Still got some muscle, you know. It’s just hidden under a bit of… padding. Can we get on with this? I’m starting to feel cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Slight hepatomegaly noted. Any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Hepat… what? What did you say? Pain? No, not exactly pain. Just… a bit of discomfort sometimes, after a heavy meal. A bit of bloating, maybe. My daughter keeps telling me to watch my diet. Honestly, I eat perfectly fine. Mostly. A bit of cake now and then. Is that what this is about? Are you going to tell me I can’t have cake? This is ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Pulses are present bilaterally, though slightly diminished in the lower extremities. Range of motion is limited in the shoulders and elbows, consistent with age and likely arthritis. Some edema noted in the ankles. Any history of swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Yes, sometimes. Especially after a long day. Or after it rains. My daughter says it's the circulation. She buys me those… support stockings. Horrible things. Make my legs itch. And the circulation isn't what it used to be, I suppose. Never bothered me much. Just a bit of puffiness, that's all. Honestly, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'm an old man. Things ache. Things swell. It’s what happens when you live eighty-one years. Can we please be done now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. That will be all for the physical exam. I need to review these findings and your history before I can determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure. Given your slightly diminished breath sounds, mild murmur, hepatomegaly, and edema, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a BNP to assess your heart function. We’ll also need an EKG to rule out any cardiac abnormalities. These tests will help us determine if you have any underlying health issues that could pose a risk during surgery. I’ll also recommend a cardiology consultation, just to be on the safe side. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Cardiology consultation? Honestly, this is getting out of hand! A waste of time and money, if you ask me. But… Fine. Do whatever you have to do. Just get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. And tell your assistant to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily. Absolutely easily. Just… get it done. And tell my daughter it’s all your fault.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood samples now, and I’ll schedule a cardiology consultation for you. The lab results typically take 24-48 hours. I’ll contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity. And I will need your insurance information for the lab work and consultation. Do you have any questions for me before I proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… when can I expect to hear back? And can we please hurry this along? My daughter's expecting me for dinner. Honestly, this whole thing is a complete… inconvenience. Just get it done. Insurance information? It’s… private. I have it here somewhere. Honestly, I don't understand why everything has to be so complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I have your insurance details. The lab requisition and cardiology referral will be sent electronically to the appropriate facilities. You should receive a call within 24 hours to schedule the appointment. I anticipate having the lab results by the end of the week. Once I have all the information, I'll contact you to discuss the risks and benefits of proceeding with the facelift, and we can determine whether it’s a suitable option for you. Please let me know if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. You can reach my office at 555-1212. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this whole thing is a… Waste of time. Tell my daughter… tell her I said thank you, but I’m too old for all this fuss. Good day.
