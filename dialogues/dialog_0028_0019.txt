DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Carlotta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Carlotta. Manuel Carlotta. It’s… a good name, I think. My wife, she likes it too. Long time, long time… things are… fuzzy, you know? But yes, that is me.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s try to focus on now, shall we?
PATIENT: Now is good. Now is… okay. What we talking about now? Something about… planning? I forget so easy these days. My wife, she told me to come… something important, she said.
DOCTOR: She sent you, did she?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. A good woman, my wife. Very… organized. She said something about… a baby? Maybe? We are… older now. She thinks… it would be nice. But I… I don’t remember the details. It was a long talk. A very long talk.
DOCTOR: A… baby?
PATIENT: Yes. A little one. She wants… a grandchild, maybe? Or… another baby. It’s been a long time since babies. Very long. I… do I look okay for a baby? Old man like me? Just joking. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Carlotta, let's clarify a few things. You’re 70 years old. And your wife sent you in… concerning potential… family planning?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Seventy… yes, that is about right. And my wife… she is very hopeful. She wants… to make a family bigger. I just… I don't know where to start. It's been so long. And I… what does “planning” mean? Is it… hard?
DOCTOR: Let's start with why you're here today. Are you experiencing any… difficulties?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Not… physical difficulties, no. I feel… old, but not sick. My wife says… maybe it is harder to make a baby now. Is that what you mean? Like… something not working right? I don't know. I just… want to understand what she is asking me to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, let's review your medical history. Have you had children previously?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Children. Yes, we did. Two. A boy and a girl. Both grown now. Living far away. It was… a long time ago. Very long. I remember… holding them when they were small. But the… details, they are fuzzy. I’m sorry. My memory… it isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I broke my arm, a long time ago, when I was a young man. Football, it was. They fixed it. And… I had my appendix out, I think. Years ago. Maybe. I don't remember much about it. Just… pain, and then… not pain. Nothing… serious, I don’t think. My wife would know better. She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. The record shows an appendectomy in 1982, and a fracture of the left radius in 1978. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! You have it written down? That’s… good. That’s very good. No… I don’t think so. Nothing else that I remember. I’ve mostly… just been working. Making things. Metal and plastic. Not much… excitement. No hospitals, no surgeries. Just… old age creeping up. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No… not really. A little painkiller sometimes, for my knees. The old age, you see. But nothing… regular. Just when they bother me. And… sometimes a vitamin, my wife buys. For the bones, she says. But I forget to take it, mostly. I’m not very good at remembering pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. My wife always checks… when she cooks. She’s very careful. I… I’ve eaten everything, I think. Never had a problem. Maybe a little… upset stomach sometimes, but nothing serious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But ask my wife. She will know for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just standard procedure.
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need to do. My heart… it feels okay. Sometimes a little… fluttery, maybe. But mostly okay. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. Old bones, you know. And… tell me if everything is alright. My wife will want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. Slightly elevated, but not alarming for your age. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… a slight murmur, but consistent with age. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall… physical exam is within normal limits for your age. However, the blood pressure warrants monitoring.
PATIENT: Monitoring… yes, that sounds good. My wife always says I should watch what I eat. Salt, she says. Too much salt. She’s always right. And the… murmur? Is that bad? Is it going to stop me from… well, from what we were talking about? It's just… I want to make my wife happy. She really wants this.
DOCTOR: The murmur is common with age, Mr. Carlotta, and not necessarily a concern. However, given your age and potential… plans, I recommend a cardiology consult to assess your cardiac health. It’s a standard precaution. We don’t want to take any unnecessary risks. It's best to have a specialist opinion before proceeding with anything.
PATIENT: A… specialist? Cardiology? That sounds… serious. Does that mean… it’s not a good idea? That I’m too old? My wife… she will be very disappointed. She’s already talking about names… I just want to understand. Is it dangerous to… try? Is that what the specialist will tell me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I’m not saying it’s impossible. I’m saying it’s prudent to get a specialist’s opinion. Your cardiac health needs to be thoroughly assessed before we can even consider such plans. A cardiology consult will provide the necessary information. It doesn’t mean it’s a definite ‘no’, it simply means we need to be informed. I will write a referral order now.
PATIENT: Informed… yes. That sounds… sensible. My wife always says I should listen to the doctors. But… will it take long? She gets very excited, you see. And… what if they say ‘no’? Will that break her heart? Just… tell me honestly. Is there… a good chance they will say ‘no’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, I cannot predict the outcome of the cardiology consult. It depends on your individual health. It’s best not to speculate. I will provide you with the referral order and the contact information for a reputable cardiologist. They will conduct the necessary tests and provide you with a professional opinion. Focus on getting the consult scheduled. That’s the most important thing right now. I have other patients waiting. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you. Tell my wife… to be patient. That’s what I’ll tell her. I think… I think that’s all.
