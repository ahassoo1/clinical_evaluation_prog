DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Glowka, was it? Yes, well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much, you see. Just too much. It’s a bother, really. Especially when I’m… doing things around the farm. Can’t be running off all the time. It wasn’t always like this, mind you. Though, to be honest, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive, especially with your activities on the farm. It’s good you’re addressing this. And it’s perfectly normal for things to change as we get older, including our memory. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this increase in bathroom trips?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe… last fall? Or was it the spring before? Honestly, Doctor, it all blurs together. I just remember having to get up more at night, and then… just more often during the day too. My wife, bless her heart, keeps track of these things, but she’s at the market right now. She'd probably have a better answer. It's just...annoying, is what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating, and it's alright that you're not certain of the exact timing. We can piece things together. So, it sounds like it’s been gradually increasing over several months, and it’s impacting your sleep as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Sleep… can’t always get a full night’s rest. Have to… get up, you know? Sometimes twice, sometimes more. It wasn’t like that before. I used to sleep like a log. Now it’s just… interrupted. And then, during the day, I find myself… always thinking about where the nearest… facilities are. Not very dignified for a man who’s spent his life working the land, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how disruptive that must be, and it's not dignified at all. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your quality of life. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Besides getting up at night, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me think. Well, sometimes… a little burning when I go. Not always, mind you. And sometimes… I don’t empty completely. Just feels like there’s a little left, you know? It’s not… a lot. But it’s there. And I’ve noticed… well, I’m a bit thirstier than usual, maybe? Though, it’s been hot lately, so that could just be the weather. It's hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Burning with urination, a sensation of incomplete emptying, and increased thirst. Those are important details. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell… now you’re asking things I don’t usually pay attention to, Doctor. It’s… usually just yellow. Sometimes darker, sometimes lighter, depending on how much water I drink, I suppose. And as for smell… well, it smells like… urine. I haven’t noticed anything… unusual. My wife might notice, she has a good nose, but she's not here. Honestly, I'm just an old farmer, not a… a urine expert!
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. You're not expected to be a urine expert! I just ask to rule out certain possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a long story. Let’s see… I had my blood pressure checked a few years back, and the doctor said it was a little high, but he put me on some pills. I think I still take those. And my wife says I snore something awful, so she makes me sleep on my side sometimes. As for anything else… I broke my arm when I was a boy, fell out of a tree. And I had a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. Never been a sickly man, really. Just getting old, I suppose. I don't remember specific names of anything, Doctor, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Segretto. So, you have a history of high blood pressure, for which you take medication, and you occasionally get the flu. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… now that’s a tricky one. It's a little white pill. Small. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My wife handles the refills, so she’d know the exact name. She’s very organized. I think… it starts with an ‘A’? Or maybe a ‘B’? Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just not what it used to be. I can remember things from sixty years ago, but yesterday’s news… forget about it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Segretto. We can often find the information in your medical records. Do you recall ever having any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the broken arm as a child?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Never had much need for them, thankfully. I've always been a practical man, good at fixing things myself. I’ve had a few stitches over the years – a cut here, a scrape there – farm life, you know? But no major surgeries. Hospitalizations… well, I was in the hospital for a few days when my wife had our daughter, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just routine. And I had my appendix out when I was very young, but I barely remember it. It’s all a bit fuzzy, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No major surgeries or hospitalizations besides the appendectomy as a child and when your wife had your daughter. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there any history of diabetes, kidney problems, or prostate issues in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… now that’s a tough one. My father… he was a strong man, worked the land his whole life. I don’t recall him having any specific illnesses, but he died young, heart attack, I think. My mother… she lived to be a good age, but she had… aches and pains, old age mostly. As for my siblings… my brother, he had some trouble with his… digestion, I think. And my sister… she had some issues with her… well, I can’t quite recall. It was a long time ago. None of them had any major problems with kidneys or the… prostate, as far as I know. We weren’t ones for talking about these things, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Segretto. It’s common for families not to discuss these things openly. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. My father always said it was a foolish habit, and I never took to it. Always preferred fresh air, especially when working the land. And I certainly don't drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but nothing regular. I like to keep a clear head, you see. Important for managing the farm.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Besides the blood pressure pill… I take something for my joints, sometimes. They ache, you see, especially when the weather changes. It’s a little orange pill, I think. And I take a vitamin D supplement, my wife says it’s good for my bones. And sometimes, when I have trouble sleeping, I take something to help me relax. But I don't take it every night. It's a little blue pill. Small. Honestly, Doctor, I have so many pills now, it’s hard to keep track. My wife is very good at keeping me organized.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. We’ll also need to do a urine sample to check for infection and other issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, not as spry as I used to be. And I might need a moment to get up and down, my joints aren't what they used to be, you see. But I’m happy to cooperate. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll take things at your pace. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There we go. Be gentle, now. This old arm doesn't bend like it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. This won't take long. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150 over 85. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, a deep breath. Like this? Is that alright? I used to have very strong lungs, you know. From all the work on the farm. But they aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your lungs sound clear, but there’s some slight wheezing on exhale. That could be due to age or mild irritation. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does this cause any pain or discomfort, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… a little pressure. It's alright. I've had a few bumps and bruises in my time, you know. From working the land. I'm a tough old farmer, don't you worry. But if you feel anything, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen. It’s not concerning at the moment, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, if you could please provide me with a urine sample, that would be helpful. There’s a collection cup in the bathroom. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy. Just let me know when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A urine sample. Right. The bathroom is that way, I presume? I'll be right back. It might take me a moment, you understand. Old age, you see.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be right here when you return.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. All done. Hopefully that's enough. It wasn’t easy, you know. Getting old is not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. That's perfect. I'll send this off to the lab for analysis. While we wait for the results, based on your symptoms and the preliminary physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing a combination of factors contributing to your frequent urination. These include age-related changes in bladder function, possible mild prostate enlargement, and perhaps a mild urinary tract irritation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a prostate-specific antigen test, and a urine analysis with culture. This will help us rule out any underlying infections or other problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. Tests… so many tests. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I trust your judgment. I just hope they don’t take too long. I have things to do, you know. Farm doesn’t run itself. But if it’s for my health… then alright. Tests it is. Just let me know when I need to come back.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes a few days to return the results. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss the findings. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, but limiting caffeine and alcohol. Also, try to urinate regularly, even if you don’t feel a strong urge. And if you experience any fever, chills, pain in your back or side, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions. Well, I suppose… will these tests be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. And will they make me feel sick? I don’t like feeling sick. Otherwise… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Just get me back to the farm as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Segretto. Let's address those. Regarding cost, we will submit the tests to Medicare, and your out-of-pocket expenses should be minimal. Our billing department will contact you if there are any unexpected charges. As for feeling sick, the blood draw is usually quick and painless, although you may experience a slight bruise at the injection site. The urine test is non-invasive and shouldn’t cause any discomfort. There are no significant side effects associated with these tests. I understand your desire to get back to the farm as quickly as possible, and we will do everything we can to expedite the process. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to an old man’s worries. I suppose I’ll see you next week then. Just let me know when and where. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Segretto. It was my pleasure. My nurse will contact you with the appointment details. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Get home safely, and I’ll see you next week.
