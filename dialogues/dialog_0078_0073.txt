DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's my stomach. Been... well, it's been awful. Just constantly running to the bathroom. It’s been going on for weeks, and nothing seems to help. I've tried everything the drugstore sells, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weeks is a long time to deal with that. It’s good you’ve tried to manage it, but it sounds like we need to figure out what’s going on. When you say “constantly,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail do you want? I go, like, six, seven times a day. Sometimes more. It’s… watery. And it doesn’t matter what I eat. Toast, rice, even just plain crackers. Doesn’t make a difference. It’s embarrassing, frankly. I haven’t left the house much lately because of it. Is that detail enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, that is very helpful, thank you. Six to seven times a day, watery stools, and not improving with diet... that is concerning, and I understand why it's impacting your life. Has there been any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. I would notice blood. And no fever, no throwing up, just… this. It’s just relentless diarrhea. Look, I don’t need a lecture on hydration. I know I need to drink water. I’m just trying to figure out what’s causing it, and why nothing is working. I’m a painter, you know. I can’t be running to the bathroom all day when I have jobs to do. It's costing me money.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and I’m not here to lecture you. It’s good you're staying hydrated. Being a painter certainly makes being able to predict your bathroom breaks important. To get a better picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, I'm just tired. Really tired. And a little crampy sometimes, but that comes and goes. I've just been feeling run down, like I have the flu but without the… you know, the actual flu part. It’s hard to explain. Is this going somewhere, or are you just going to keep asking questions? I have a job site to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Ms. Woodring. Fatigue and intermittent cramping are helpful pieces of information. It sounds like this has been a persistent issue and is understandably impacting your daily life. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, but nothing serious. My husband… well, my late husband, had diabetes, but I didn’t. And I've never been hospitalized for anything. I'm generally a healthy person. Except for this, obviously. I don't really go to doctors unless I absolutely have to. Is this necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate you sharing that. Knowing you’ve been generally healthy is good information. And no, I won’t keep you longer than necessary. Just trying to rule things out. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I told you, I don't like doctors. Or hospitals. It all just feels… unnecessary. I mean, people get sick, that's life. You just deal with it. Honestly, this whole thing is probably just a bug going around. I'll be fine. I just need it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, that’s helpful to know. And I respect that you prefer to avoid medical intervention when possible. Given this has been going on for weeks, and isn't resolving on its own, I think it's worth investigating a bit further to rule out anything more serious, even if it is just a prolonged bug. Could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I told you I've tried everything at the drugstore. I’ve taken Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, those little things with the bismuth… you know, all of it. And a multivitamin, that’s it. I don’t take any prescriptions. I don’t like taking pills. Is this going to take all day? I really need to get going. I have a quote to deliver and then a wall to prep.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the continued questioning, Ms. Woodring. I understand your time is valuable. Just confirming, so no regular prescription medications, and just the over-the-counter remedies you mentioned. Now, one last quick set of questions, if you don't mind. Are there any allergies I should be aware of – medications, foods, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I eat pretty much everything. I’m Tlingit, we eat a lot of fish. And I've never had a reaction to anything. Look, can we just be done here? I appreciate you trying to help, but I'm starting to feel like you're just trying to find something wrong with me. I just want this diarrhea to stop! Is there a test you can give me, or something?
DOCTOR: No allergies, that's good to know. And I assure you, I'm not trying to find something wrong, but we need to rule things out to get you feeling better. You are right, the best course of action is a test. I'd like to collect a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites. Would you be able to do that?
PATIENT: A… stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… take a bucket to the bathroom? Look, I’m a painter, not a… a scientist! I already told you, it’s probably just a bug. I don't have time for this. I'm going to go. I'll just… tough it out. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, given the duration of your symptoms and the lack of improvement, I strongly recommend reconsidering the stool sample. It would help rule out some potentially serious causes. If you change your mind, please don't hesitate to call the clinic to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
