DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s… my family. Lots of… trouble with heart, you know? My mother, she… gone young. And my brother, he always got chest pain. I feel okay now, but… I just want to make sure I’m okay. For peace of mind. I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history is important, certainly. "Peace of mind" is a valid reason to come in, Mr. Schwer. Though, with a history like that, it’s good you’re being proactive. Let’s get some details. When you say “trouble with heart,” can you be a little more specific about what happened with your mother?
PATIENT: Um… she… just got sick. Very quick. Doctor said… something about her heart not strong enough. I was young, maybe ten? Didn’t really understand. She just… stopped breathing, one night. And my brother, he gets… tightness in his chest. He takes pills. Lots of pills. He sees a different doctor, in the city.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden cardiac event in your mother, and your brother has angina managed with medication. And you mentioned you feel okay now. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel… normal. No pain. No… shortness of breath. I can walk okay. I like to walk my dog, little terrier. Sometimes a little tired, but I’m… old. 73, you know? Maybe just old-people tired. It’s just… worry. I keep thinking… will it happen to me?
DOCTOR: Worry is understandable, given the history. "Old-people tired" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Schwer. We need to rule things out. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything previously – high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No, no diagnosis. I… go to the doctor sometimes. For check-ups. They always say I’m… okay. Blood pressure… maybe a little high once or twice, but they didn’t say anything serious. Nothing I had to take pills for, you know? Just… watch salt. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally healthy, with occasional slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I had some… rash once, when I was a kid. But I don’t remember what caused it. No doctor ever asked, and I never… told them. It was just a little rash.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Makes me feel… funny. I try to eat good. Lots of vegetables. And walk the dog, like I said. That’s my medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good, a healthy lifestyle is a strong start. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That’s… fine. Sounds good. I hope everything is okay. My wife… she always told me to get check-ups. But she’s… gone now.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated – 142/88. Pulse is regular, but a bit on the faster side – 82. Heart sounds… I’m hearing a slight murmur. It's not particularly loud, but it's there. Lungs are clear. Mr. Schwer, the murmur is something we’ll want to investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s best to rule things out. I want to order an EKG, and a basic blood panel, including cholesterol. Also, given your family history, I think a referral to a cardiologist for an echocardiogram would be prudent. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Uh… EKG? Blood panel? Echo… what was that? Sounds… complicated. Is something wrong? I feel okay, Doctor. You said it didn't necessarily mean anything serious?
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does sound complicated. Let me explain. An EKG – electrocardiogram – is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless. A blood panel will give us a better look at your cholesterol levels, and check for other things that could impact your heart health. An echocardiogram – the “echo” – is an ultrasound of your heart. It shows us the structure of your heart, and how well it’s pumping. It's important to remember that finding a murmur doesn’t mean you’re immediately in trouble. It simply means we need to get more information. It could be nothing, or it could be something minor that needs to be monitored. But given your family history, I want to be thorough. I'm ordering these tests to rule things out and give us peace of mind. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I think so. Tests. To… check. And… make sure. I don’t like tests, but… if you think it’s important, I guess. My wife… she always said I worry too much. But she’s gone now. Will these tests… take long? And… will they be expensive? Medicare… will they cover them?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable to ask, Mr. Schwer. The EKG will only take a few minutes, we can do it right here in the office. The blood panel will require a small blood draw, also done here. We'll send that off to the lab and results usually come back within a few days. As for the echocardiogram, that will require a visit to a specialist – a cardiologist. I have a good recommendation nearby. As for cost, Medicare should cover these tests, especially given your age and family history. Our billing department will verify coverage before you go for the echo, so you won’t have any unexpected bills. We’ll make sure of that. I'll have my nurse draw your blood now, and schedule you an appointment with the cardiologist. In the meantime, try not to worry. We’re just being proactive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… proactive. That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very… thorough. I appreciate it. I guess… I guess I’ll let your nurse draw my blood then. And… schedule the appointment. Okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. That's what I'm here for. My nurse, Sarah, will be right in. She’ll explain everything. And I’ll follow up with you once we have the results. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness… emergency room. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. I feel a little better now, knowing we’re… checking things.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to hear, Mr. Schwer. Sarah will be with you shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
