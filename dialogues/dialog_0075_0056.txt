DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's good to meet you. Now, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have all day for pleasantries. Workplace… issues. Burnout, I believe the young people are calling it. It’s quite simple, really. Students these days… no respect for knowledge. It’s exhausting trying to instill… never mind. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. You're feeling overwhelmed and exhausted due to issues at work, specifically with students. It sounds very frustrating. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's happening so we can find a solution. To start, could you tell me a bit more about your workplace?
PATIENT: It's a library, Doctor. A library. I teach… taught… postsecondary students about research, proper citation, the Dewey Decimal System… things they clearly have no interest in learning anymore. It's a respectable institution, or was, before everyone decided information on the internet was… sufficient. Is that really necessary to explain?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly clear, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize for asking what seemed like an obvious question. It's important for me to have a complete picture. You've been a teacher at the library for some time, and you’re feeling burned out due to a change in student attitudes and reliance on online sources. When did you start noticing these changes and feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, Doctor. Years. It wasn't sudden. A slow… erosion. Perhaps… ten years ago? It's difficult to say precisely. Things blend together after a while. It began with… questioning my methods. Then, outright ignoring them. Now… they simply look everything up on their “Google,” as they call it, and expect a passing grade. It's… demoralizing. I don't have time for a detailed timeline, Doctor. I just want to feel… capable again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this has been a gradual but significant shift over the last ten years. It's completely understandable that it's led to you feeling demoralized. To help me understand how this is affecting you personally, can you describe what this feeling of being "incapable" is like?
PATIENT: It’s… a lack of purpose, Doctor. I dedicated my life to preserving knowledge, to teaching people how to access it properly. Now, it feels… pointless. I prepare lectures, meticulously research materials, and they simply… skim articles online. It's not that I object to technology, mind you. But they don't learn. They copy and paste. They don't understand the why behind the information. And when I try to correct them… well, it’s met with… resistance. It’s… deflating. I find myself dreading each class. It’s exhausting trying to convince them of something they already believe they know. Is that clear enough? I don't enjoy dwelling on… failings.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this situation has led to a significant loss of motivation and a feeling of being undervalued. You're experiencing a loss of purpose and a sense of dread associated with your work, and it sounds like it's impacting your overall wellbeing. Have you noticed any other changes, such as difficulty sleeping, changes in appetite, or increased irritability?
PATIENT: Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. Of course I have difficulty sleeping. And my appetite… well, it’s not what it used to be. But that's simply age, isn't it? I’m not a child needing coddling. As for irritability… perhaps. I do find myself… less tolerant of foolishness than I once was. But that’s hardly a revelation. It's the work that's the problem, not some… personal failing. Are we getting anywhere, or are we simply cataloging the inevitable decline of old age? I have an appointment with my book club later, you know. Quite a good discussion of Tolstoy planned. I’d prefer not to be late.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s important to differentiate between age-related changes and what's stemming from the workplace stress. I appreciate your honesty. To be thorough, let's briefly cover your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I have the usual aches and pains of a long life, Doctor. A touch of arthritis. My vision isn't what it once was, hence the glasses. High blood pressure, managed with medication. And a… regrettable incident with a bad oyster some years ago, but that’s long resolved. Nothing that concerns us here, I assure you. This isn’t a medical issue, Doctor. It’s a matter of… professional disillusionment. Really, I don’t see why we're delving into my digestive history. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Schlatterer. It's helpful to have a complete picture. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a history of a gastrointestinal issue - all noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, or any other reason?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes. Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams daily. And occasionally, ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing else. I prefer to avoid unnecessary medications, if you don't mind my saying so. Too many chemicals, in my opinion. Really, Doctor, are you a pharmacist now, or a physician? I came here for a solution to a work problem, not a medical inventory.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It's important to me that we’re focused on your concerns, and I apologize if I've seemed to be diverting from that. Knowing your current medications is just part of the overall picture. Before we discuss possible solutions, I would like to ask one last question. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Are you suggesting I’m… unstable? I may be disillusioned with the current state of education, and somewhat fatigued, but I am perfectly capable of rational thought! Hopelessness? Self-harm? That’s… preposterous! I have a book club meeting to attend! I’m engaged in intellectual pursuits! I find solace in Tolstoy! Honestly, the implication is… insulting. I think I've answered enough personal questions for one day. Let’s discuss… solutions, as you put it. And quickly, if you please. I have a schedule to maintain. .
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be upset, Mr. Schlatterer. I apologize profusely. That was a completely inappropriate question and I shouldn't have asked it. It was a standard part of my assessment, but it was insensitive and misguided in this context. I deeply regret causing you any offense. Now, let's focus on what's brought you in today. You're feeling burned out and demoralized due to changes at work, specifically with student attitudes. To start, have you considered any strategies to manage this situation, such as adjusting your teaching methods, seeking support from colleagues, or perhaps reducing your workload?
