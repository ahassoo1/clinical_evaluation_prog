DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um… my sinuses. They… they feel bad. Like, pressure, you know? It’s been… a little while now. I don’t remember exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A little while.” Right. Well, we need to be a bit more specific than that if we’re going to figure out what’s going on. A few weeks is… vague. Is it constant pressure, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, sorry. It comes and goes. More when I… lie down, I think. And maybe when it’s cold? It’s hard to say for sure. My husband, he says I sniffle a lot at night, but I don’t always notice. I don’t sleep very well. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It could be. Sniffling and trouble sleeping… Alright. And is there any pain associated with this pressure?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, exactly. More… a dull ache. Sometimes. Mostly just… fullness. Like my head is stuffed with cotton. And it feels worse on this side… <points to the right side of her face> But it’s not sharp pain, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull ache, fullness, worse when lying down, potentially with cold weather, and mostly on the right side. Any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Congestion… oh! Yes. Sometimes. Not all the time, though. It feels… blocked. I have to… breathe through my mouth when it’s bad. And sometimes… I get a little bit of a headache with it. But not a bad headache. Just… annoying. Is this… normal? I don't usually go to the doctor.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is… relative. It sounds like you could be dealing with sinusitis - an inflammation of your sinuses. But we need to rule other things out. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or any discharge from your nose?
PATIENT: Fever… I don’t think so. I haven’t taken my temperature. Chills… no, not really. Discharge… yes. Sometimes. Clear, mostly. Or… maybe a little bit yellow? I don’t pay much attention, to be honest. My husband usually gets me tissues. Is yellow bad? I’m sorry, I don’t know much about this.
DOCTOR: Okay. Clear or slightly yellow discharge… that's potentially indicative of a viral or bacterial infection, respectively. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a better picture. I'm going to listen to your lungs, check your ears, and take a look inside your nose. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. It’s just… I don’t like things in my ears. But if you need to, you can look. I just… I don’t like it. But go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. Now the ears. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. <examines ears quickly> Hmm. Some slight redness in the right ear canal. And now the nose. <briefly examines nose> There is some swelling in the nasal passages on the right side, and the discharge appears to be a yellowish color. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the brief exam, it does appear to be sinusitis, likely a bacterial infection given the color of the discharge. But we'll need to rule out other possibilities. Have you had any recent changes in your vision or sense of smell?
PATIENT: Vision… no, I don't think so. Everything looks the same as always. And smell… <pauses, sniffing the air> Well, my husband says I don't smell things as well anymore. He says I didn't notice he was cooking fish last night, and he said it smelled very strong. But I didn’t notice anything. I thought maybe he was just teasing me. Is that… connected? I don’t know why my smell would be different.
DOCTOR: It could be. Loss of smell is sometimes associated with sinusitis, especially if it's affecting the ethmoid sinuses. We need to be thorough. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t know. I mean, I sometimes sneeze when there’s dust. And I get itchy eyes in the spring. But everyone does, right? I don't take anything for it. My mother used to say just to stay inside when the pollen is bad. I don't know if that's an allergy, or just… the season. I've never been tested for allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's possible you have mild seasonal allergies contributing to this. And the lack of allergy testing makes it difficult to say for sure. Given your symptoms, and the yellowish discharge, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics to treat the likely bacterial sinusitis. It's important to finish the entire course, even if you start feeling better before it's done. Do you have any known allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… I don’t think so. I haven’t taken anything in… a long time. Not since I was a little girl, maybe? My husband, he’s usually the one who handles the medicine. I just… take it. I don’t remember anything about allergies. He always asks me if I’m feeling okay, and I tell him yes, or no. I don't think I’ve ever reacted badly to medicine. But I don’t remember specifically. Is there something I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes! Look for a rash, hives, swelling of the face or tongue, difficulty breathing – any new or unusual symptoms. If you experience any of those, stop taking the antibiotics immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. I’m prescribing Amoxicillin, 500mg three times a day for ten days. I'll also recommend a saline nasal rinse twice a day to help clear the congestion. I also recommend over-the-counter decongestant and pain relievers as needed. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Amoxicillin… three times a day for ten days. Saline rinse… twice a day. And… look for rash, swelling, trouble breathing. And pain relievers. Yes, I think I understand. It’s a lot to remember, but I'll ask my husband to help me. He's very good with medicine. <pauses> So… is this going to make me feel better? I just want to be able to sleep through the night.
DOCTOR: The antibiotics should clear up the infection. It may take a few days to start feeling better, so be patient. The saline rinse will help with the congestion. And if you don’t see any improvement after five days, or if your symptoms worsen, you’ll need to come back in. I’m going to print out these instructions, and a prescription for the antibiotics. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And I’m sorry for being… vague. I just don’t remember things very well. My husband will make sure I follow everything. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just… try to be more specific next time. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day. .
