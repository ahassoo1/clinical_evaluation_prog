DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s about the cancer. I was told to come speak with someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. You were told to come speak with me regarding a cancer diagnosis. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was… a few months ago now. They found something during a regular check-up. I don’t… I don’t really remember all the details. It was a shock, you see. They used a lot of words I didn’t understand. It’s in my… my chest, I believe.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very common to feel overwhelmed after receiving news like that, and it's perfectly normal not to remember all the details. We’ll go through everything at your pace. Do you recall who told you about this – was it a primary care physician, a specialist, or someone else?
PATIENT: Um… it was Doctor Ramirez. He’s my regular doctor. He sent me to… to a cancer doctor. I don’t recall his name. He did some tests… scans, I think. And then he told me about it. He’s the one who said I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Doctor Ramirez. That’s helpful. Let me just pull up his records here… Ah, yes. It says here you were diagnosed with… a mediastinal mass. Do you mind if I ask you to clarify – when you say “in your chest”, where exactly were you feeling discomfort or any symptoms, if any?
PATIENT: “Mediastinal mass?” I… I don’t know what that means. Discomfort… well, sometimes my chest feels… tight. Like someone is sitting on it. And I get tired very easily now. Much more easily than before. I haven’t been feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Mediastinal mass” simply means there’s an abnormal growth in the space in your chest between your lungs. It doesn't necessarily mean cancer, but it requires investigation. Tightness in your chest and fatigue are certainly things we need to explore further. Now, to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Okay… between my lungs. I see. Well, the tiredness… it’s just… all the time. Even after I sleep. I used to be able to do things all day, you know? Work, chores… now I have to sit down after just a little bit. It’s very frustrating. And it doesn’t seem to be getting better, even with rest. It's affecting my work, too. I have to call in sick more and more.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly draining and disruptive to your life, and I apologize that you’re experiencing this. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. Let’s talk about your work for a moment. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I am an Occupational Therapist. I help people recover from injuries and illnesses, so they can do everyday things again. It’s… it’s very rewarding work, usually. But it requires a lot of energy, and… well, I’m just not able to do as much lately. I'm worried about losing my job.
DOCTOR: That’s a very demanding profession, and I can see how the fatigue would be particularly challenging. It's good you’re aware of the impact this is having. Now, let's go back to the mass itself. Do you recall if Doctor Ramirez mentioned how large this mass was, or if he discussed any potential causes besides cancer?
PATIENT: No, he didn’t say how large it was. He just said it was… concerning. He said it could be cancer, but he wanted me to get a second opinion. He didn’t really talk about other causes. He mostly focused on the possibility of cancer treatment. He said there were different options, but I was too upset to really listen closely. I think he mentioned… chemotherapy? I don’t know. It all felt very scary.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable that you were overwhelmed and didn't absorb everything. It is scary. Okay, so he didn’t mention any specific size or other potential causes. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any other serious illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a child, but that’s about it. My husband… my late husband… he had some health problems, but that was years ago. I don't think it's relevant. I haven’t had any problems myself until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And I appreciate you clarifying about your husband. No major health issues for you personally, that’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies. I can take most medications without any problems. I haven’t needed to take many, thankfully. Just… over-the-counter things for headaches or colds. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches. And I take a multivitamin, just to be healthy. That’s it. Really. I try to stay away from medications as much as possible. I prefer natural remedies when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your lymph nodes, and just do a general assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. I’d like to get this sorted out. Please, go ahead. I’ll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Chellsea. I appreciate that. If you could sit up here for me, please. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. I'm listening to your breathing now. Everything sounds relatively clear, though I do notice some mild decreased breath sounds on the left side, which could be related to the mass. Your heart rate and rhythm are normal. Now, I'm checking your lymph nodes. They feel normal – no significant swelling. Overall, your general appearance is good, but I do note you appear slightly fatigued. Your range of motion is normal. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. It’s not conclusive, but it gives me a better starting point.
PATIENT: Okay. I understand. So, you didn't find anything… alarming? What happens next, Doctor? I'm still very worried about this cancer. I’m afraid of what it might mean.
DOCTOR: No, I didn't find anything overtly alarming during the exam, which is good. However, that doesn’t rule anything out. Your fatigue is concerning, and the decreased breath sounds on the left side warrant further investigation. Now, about the next steps. I have access to Doctor Ramirez's notes and the initial scan reports here. I’m going to review those in detail. Based on those results, we'll likely need to order some additional imaging - probably a CT scan of your chest, with contrast, to get a clearer picture of the mass and its surrounding structures. It may also be necessary to perform a biopsy to determine the exact nature of the mass. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a biopsy? A biopsy… that sounds… scary. Does it hurt? What if it is cancer? What are my options if it is? I… I don’t know if I can handle this. I'm still grieving my husband, and this… this is just too much. I don't know what to do. I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down. Take a deep breath. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It is a lot to process, and you’re understandably frightened. It’s also perfectly normal to be feeling this way, especially with your recent loss. Let’s take this one step at a time. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test – you’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take pictures of your chest. It doesn’t usually cause any discomfort. As for the biopsy, there are different types, and we would discuss the least invasive option. Local anesthesia is used to numb the area, so you shouldn’t feel much pain. As for what if it is cancer... we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If it is cancer, there are many treatment options available, depending on the type and stage. We have excellent oncologists here who specialize in treating these types of conditions. We would discuss all your options thoroughly, and you would be involved in every decision. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need more information first. I want to assure you that you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you want to call someone - a friend or family member - to be with you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very kind of you. No, I don’t have anyone. My husband… he was everything. I don’t want to bother anyone else with my problems. But… maybe… maybe I could think about it. The CT scan… alright. I’ll do the CT scan. And the biopsy… if you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment. But please… please tell me everything, step by step. I don’t want any surprises. And I’m very afraid of the cost. I'm on Medicare, but I don't want to end up with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. We will absolutely take things step-by-step, and I will explain everything thoroughly before we proceed. No surprises, I promise. And regarding the cost, that’s a very valid concern. We have a dedicated financial counselor here at the clinic who can help you navigate the billing process and understand your Medicare coverage. We can schedule a consultation with her after the scan, so you can have peace of mind. Okay, so let’s start with the CT scan. I’m going to write an order for it now. It usually takes a few days to get an appointment. I’ll have my nurse call you to schedule it. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a scan before. No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I haven’t reacted badly to anything. But… what does the dye do? Will it make me sick? I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to ask. It’s good you’re asking questions. The contrast dye helps to make the images clearer, so we can see the mass more easily. It's usually administered intravenously, through a small needle in your arm. Some people experience a mild, temporary reaction, like a warm sensation or a metallic taste in their mouth. Serious reactions are rare, but we'll monitor you closely during the scan. We'll have you sign a consent form before the procedure, and we'll explain all the potential risks and benefits. I will put a note in your chart about your nervousness, and the radiology team will be aware of it. They are very experienced in helping patients who are anxious. Do you have any questions about the scan itself, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Just… please hurry. I want to know what’s going on. The waiting is the worst part. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I’m just… very scared. I really don’t like hospitals. Or doctors. But you've made me feel… a little bit better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. I understand your fear, and I assure you, we will move as quickly as possible. My nurse, Sarah, will call you within the next couple of days to schedule the CT scan. She is excellent and can answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you think of anything at all, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to support you every step of the way. And remember, taking things one step at a time is perfectly okay. Is there anything I can do for you before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m alright. I just want to go home and… think. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I guess… I’ll wait for the nurse to call.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I’ll see you soon. .
