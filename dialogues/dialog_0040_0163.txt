DOCTOR: Right, yes. Jarvis Vantine, 85. Goodness. Okay, well, Mr. Vantine, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, quite right. A bit of a…well, a rather foolish experiment, I’m afraid. I’ve been attempting a new diet, you see. A rather extreme one, and I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I…continue. It's all rather silly when I think about it, really. I've lived this long without needing fads, but one gets easily led astray these days.
DOCTOR: An extreme diet, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. A friend – a younger fellow, terribly enthusiastic – suggested it. It involves…well, only consuming liquids. Fruit juices, mostly. And some vegetable broths. He calls it a “reset.” A complete…internal cleanse, he put it. It’s been three weeks now, and while I haven’t felt ill, I find myself…remarkably weak. And rather peckish, if I’m honest. It's not a sustainable lifestyle, I suspect.
DOCTOR: A liquid diet for three weeks… Honestly, people will try anything. Right. And you're feeling weak, and hungry. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… yes, now that you mention it. My energy levels are quite low, as I said. But also, I’ve found myself a bit…dizzy. Not constantly, but when I stand up rather quickly. And, if I'm being perfectly frank, my…digestive system isn't functioning as reliably as it once was. A delicate matter, I assure you. It's simply…not moving things along, shall we say. I apologise for the bluntness.
DOCTOR: Weakness, dizziness on standing, and constipation. Right. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – colour, frequency, anything like that?
PATIENT: Goodness, no, I haven’t been paying that much attention to my…output, if you don’t mind me putting it that way. I suppose it looks normal. Perhaps a little…darker than usual, now that I think about it. But I attribute that to the juices, perhaps. All that fruit. It’s difficult to say, truly. I’m not accustomed to scrutinizing such things. Is that…relevant? Should I be? I apologise for my ignorance.
DOCTOR: It is relevant. Darker urine can indicate dehydration. Alright. Let’s just do a quick check of your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse…and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can talk about what’s going on. If you'll just have a seat.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Quite alright. Dehydration, you say? That doesn’t sound promising. One does drink plenty of the juices, but…perhaps they aren’t sufficient. Lead on, then. I trust it won't be too…invasive? I'm a rather old model, you understand. A few creaks and groans are to be expected.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little low, 108/70. Pulse is regular, but a bit slow at 62. Lungs sound clear. And your abdomen is…soft, but I can feel some distension. No tenderness, thankfully. Right. It’s not surprising you’re feeling unwell. This diet is simply not providing you with enough nutrients and fluids. Your body is shutting down a bit.
PATIENT: Shutting down, you say? Goodness. That sounds rather…dramatic. I rather thought it was just a bit of a silly experiment. I must confess, I've always prided myself on my constitution. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? A return to…solid food, I presume? Perhaps a nice bit of roast lamb? Though, I suppose something a little less…indulgent might be preferable at this juncture. Is there anything specific I should avoid? And is there any lasting damage likely to have been done? I apologise for the deluge of questions.
DOCTOR: Right. First, stop the diet. Immediately. Roast lamb is not the answer, frankly. We need to reintroduce food gradually. Start with small, easily digestible portions – things like plain toast, crackers, rice. Avoid anything high in fat or sugar. As for lasting damage…at your age, prolonged malnutrition can weaken your heart and muscles. It's unlikely there's severe damage at this point, but we'll need to monitor you. I'm going to order a blood test – just to check your electrolytes and kidney function. And I want you to drink plenty of water – at least eight glasses a day. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly, Doctor. Gradual reintroduction, plain foods, eight glasses of water. No more silly experiments, I assure you. Electrolytes…and kidney function. Yes, quite sensible. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for? Extreme fatigue, perhaps? Or… dizziness that doesn’t subside? I like to be prepared, you see. One gets a bit anxious in one’s dotage, I’m afraid. And, if you don't mind me asking, how long will it be before the blood test results are available? .
DOCTOR: Yes, dizziness that doesn't subside, extreme fatigue, and if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. And we should have the blood test results back in 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Stop the diet, drink plenty of water, and I'll see you back if you’re not feeling better. Really, Mr. Vantine, listen to your body. And perhaps stick to a sensible diet. And no more experiments! .
