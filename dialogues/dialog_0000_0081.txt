DOCTOR: Well, hello there. Jailia, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Jailia Chakka. And please, Doctor... Batara, was it? I trust this establishment maintains a certain standard of... cleanliness? One doesn't expect less, particularly when discussing delicate matters of health.
DOCTOR: Doctor Batara, yes. And I assure you, our clinic meets all required standards. Though I find your initial… concern a bit unnecessary. Now, let’s focus on why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: It is not merely a "concern," Doctor. It is a reasonable expectation. However, never mind that. I have been experiencing… a decline in my physical well-being. Specifically, I am losing weight despite maintaining what I believe to be a perfectly adequate diet. And, quite frankly, it’s exhausting. Furthermore, I’ve been… perspiring rather profusely at night. It’s most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Losing weight despite an adequate diet, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. It's… perplexing. I assure you, I am quite diligent about my caloric intake. I find it rather insulting to imply otherwise. I maintain a very structured lifestyle, Doctor. It is not as if I simply… forget to eat. Though, I suppose some people are rather careless with their health.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this weight loss been occurring?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. It began subtly, a mere fluctuation in my measurements. But it has been progressively worsening. And the night sweats… those started about a month ago. They are quite disruptive to my sleep schedule, as you can imagine. A restful night is essential for maintaining one’s… composure.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I've been feeling… unusually fatigued. Not merely tired, Doctor, but deeply, inexplicably exhausted. It requires a significant effort simply to complete routine tasks. And, if I may be candid, my appetite has diminished somewhat, despite my best efforts to maintain it. It is a rather vicious cycle, as you can appreciate.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and decreased appetite. Alright. Any fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath. I assure you, my respiratory system is perfectly functional. I do not partake in strenuous activity that would necessitate such complaints. I maintain a very controlled environment, minimizing exposure to… germs, as it were. It's simply the persistent fatigue and the unwelcome weight loss that are concerning. And, of course, the night sweats. They are most… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? Doctor, with all due respect, that feels a rather… indelicate question. However, if you must know, they have been… regular. Perhaps slightly less voluminous than usual, coinciding with the diminished appetite, naturally. I find the entire line of questioning rather unnecessary. Is this standard procedure, Doctor? Because frankly, it feels… intrusive.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Miss Chakka. We need to rule out various possibilities. Now, have you noticed any lumps or bumps anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: Lumps or bumps? Good heavens, no. I maintain a strict grooming regime, Doctor. I am meticulously clean and self-aware. Any such… anomalies would be immediately apparent. I find your implication… rather insulting. It suggests a certain lack of personal hygiene, which is simply unacceptable. Are you quite sure you are a qualified physician? This feels less like a medical consultation and more like… an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Miss Chakka, I am a fully qualified Internal Medicine physician with eleven years of experience. I am asking these questions because your symptoms require a thorough investigation. Dismissing them as a matter of personal hygiene is… unhelpful. Now, let’s move on. Any family history of cancer, tuberculosis, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Finally, a sensible question! My maternal grandmother… she passed away some years ago from what the doctors called “consumption.” I believe it was tuberculosis, though it was many years ago, and the diagnosis was not as precise then as it is now, I presume. My mother's side of the family… there has been a history of what they termed “rheumatic complaints,” though I believe that was simply a vague diagnosis for general aches and pains. On my father’s side, nothing of note. We are a rather… robust lineage, generally. Though, obviously, exceptions exist.
DOCTOR: <stage>Types rapidly into the EHR: "Family history: Maternal grandmother – consumption (Tuberculosis?
PATIENT: Rheumatic complaints on mother’s side." She pauses, looking at Jailia with a considering expression.</stage> Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
DOCTOR: No, Doctor. I prefer a natural approach to wellness. I do not burden my system with unnecessary pharmaceuticals. A balanced diet and a disciplined lifestyle are sufficient. I believe in strengthening the body's natural defenses, not artificially propping them up with… concoctions.
PATIENT: No medications, vitamins or supplements. And what about alcohol or tobacco use?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Doctor. I maintain a completely abstemious lifestyle. Alcohol and tobacco are… detrimental to one's health, and I have no interest in compromising my well-being. It's rather shocking that you would even ask.
PATIENT: Miss Chakka, I understand you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. However, your weight loss and night sweats are concerning. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying infections or medical conditions. Would that be acceptable?
DOCTOR: Blood tests?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose… it is a necessary inconvenience, if you insist. However, I expect a detailed explanation of each test and the rationale behind it. I do not consent to any unnecessary procedures. And I trust the laboratory adheres to the highest standards of hygiene and accuracy. One cannot be too careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've ordered a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an ESR and CRP to check for inflammation, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we'll schedule the X-ray for later this week. Now, while we await the results, is there anything else you haven't told me?
PATIENT: Anything else? Doctor, I assure you, I have been entirely forthcoming. I have nothing to hide. I live a perfectly regimented life. I maintain a strict diet, a disciplined exercise routine, and I abstain from any unhealthy habits. I simply wish to understand the cause of this… unwelcome decline in my health. I find your continued… skepticism rather insulting, frankly. Perhaps if you spent less time interrogating me and more time considering the possibilities, we would be making progress.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available. If anything concerning arises, we will discuss it further. For now, please try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity.
PATIENT: Very well. I shall endeavour to do so. And Doctor… please do be thorough. I expect a comprehensive analysis of the results, not a cursory glance. Some doctors these days…
