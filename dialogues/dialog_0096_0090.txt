DOCTOR: Right, Mackenzi Brightful. 29 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Burlingham, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s about a surgery I’m… considering. It’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’m here for a check-up before, you know, if I decide to go through with it. It’s… cosmetic. I believe that’s what my scheduler said.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while. Honestly, my memory isn’t the best these days, so it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when I started considering it. It feels like a long time, though. It has to do with… changes to my appearance. But I understand if you have questions, Doctor. I'm happy to try and explain as best as I can.
DOCTOR: Changes to your appearance… Right. Well, let's start with what changes, exactly. And perhaps a little about why you're seeking to alter them. It’s important for me to understand your motivations, you know. People don’t just… decide these things on a whim. And as for your memory… that’s something we can address later. Let’s focus on this surgery first.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. You're absolutely right. It wasn’t a whim. It’s… difficult. It has to do with an accident. A… a car accident. A few years back, now. It affected the… the left side of my face, mostly. There's some scarring, and… things aren’t quite symmetrical anymore. It’s… upsetting, honestly. I suppose I want to feel… more like myself again, if that makes sense? My husband… he always said I had a lovely face. It feels silly saying that now, but… it’s true. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: A car accident. Scarring, asymmetry. I see. And you're seeking cosmetic surgery to… restore symmetry, to feel more like yourself. It’s not… silly to want that, dear. Though I must say, sometimes people have unrealistic expectations. Now, has this asymmetry caused you any… functional problems?
PATIENT: Functional problems? Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not… physically, no. I can still smile, and talk, and… everything works as it should, thankfully. But… it makes me avoid people, I think. I don’t go out much anymore. I used to love dancing, and going to parties, but… I feel self-conscious. It’s mostly… emotional, I suppose. Does that make sense? It makes it hard to… be me. It’s a little silly, perhaps. I don't want to sound vain.
DOCTOR: Emotional distress… yes, I understand. Avoiding social situations. Well, it's not "silly" to be affected by your appearance, dear. It's perfectly natural. Though, frankly, sometimes I think people dwell too much on these things. Now, have you seen any specialists regarding this scarring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specialists… That’s a good question. My memory is so… patchy. I think I saw a dermatologist, right after the accident, to make sure the wounds healed properly. And I had a lot of physical therapy, for my neck and back. But… I don't think I saw anyone specifically about the cosmetic aspect of the scarring. It was all… a blur, honestly. So many doctors and appointments. It all happened so fast, and I was… well, I was grieving, too. My husband… he passed away shortly after the accident. It was a very difficult time. I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Yes, a very difficult time, indeed. Grieving and recovering from an accident. It’s understandable your memory is… fragmented. So, no formal consultation with a plastic surgeon, then?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. Not a plastic surgeon, specifically. I mostly focused on… getting better, physically. And then… things just sort of… stopped. It's been a few years now. I suppose I should have looked into it sooner, but I… I just didn’t have the energy. And honestly, I wasn’t sure if it was even possible to… fix it. I just know it bothers me. A lot. I'm hoping a surgery could help, but I also don’t want to… get my hopes up. It feels… risky.
DOCTOR: Risky, yes. Surgery always carries risks. And I must be frank with you, dear, chasing perfection is often a fool’s errand. Now, before we even consider a surgical option, I'd like to get a complete medical history. Past medical conditions, allergies, any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Let me think… I don’t really have any major medical conditions, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. No allergies that I’m aware of. And… let me see. I take a low dose of something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And… that’s it, I believe. Though, I do take a daily multivitamin. Is that important? I tend to forget things easily, so I hope I’m not leaving anything out. My insurance should have all of this on file, shouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your insurance records are rarely comprehensive, dear. Always best to be thorough. Lisinopril for blood pressure… good. Now, any family history of… unusual scarring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a tricky one. I wasn't very close to my family, truthfully. My parents passed away when I was young, and I don’t have any siblings. I remember my grandmother having some… skin issues, maybe eczema? But I don't recall anything about… bad scarring. She mostly used creams and lotions. I don’t think anyone in my family ever had… surgery. Is that helpful, Doctor? I feel terrible about not remembering more. It's just… a blur, as always.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to the physical examination. I'll need to assess the scarring directly. If you'll just excuse me for a moment…
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. That’s perfectly fine. I understand. Please, take your time. I’m ready when you are. I hope it’s not too… upsetting to look at. It's been a source of… anxiety for a long time, you see.
DOCTOR: The scarring is… significant, as expected. Hypertrophic, with some areas of hypopigmentation. Asymmetry is pronounced, particularly along the jawline and cheekbone. There’s also some nerve damage evident – slight weakness in the left facial muscles. Range of motion is… acceptable, though there is some discomfort upon palpation. Overall, the scarring is quite extensive and will require… considerable intervention.
PATIENT: Oh. Considerable intervention… That sounds… daunting, Doctor. I was hoping… well, I wasn't sure what to expect, honestly. Is it… fixable, then? I mean, is surgery even an option with all of that? I’m trying not to get my hopes up, but… it’s difficult. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: "Fixable" is a… subjective term, dear. Complete restoration to your pre-accident appearance is… unlikely, frankly. However, surgical intervention could improve the symmetry and reduce the prominence of the scarring. It would require a multi-stage procedure, likely involving skin grafts, nerve reconstruction, and possibly even fat transfer. And there's no guarantee of complete success, of course. Nerve damage is always… unpredictable. Now, before we even discuss the logistics, I need to order some imaging – a CT scan to assess the underlying bone structure and a nerve conduction study to determine the extent of the damage. And, I must advise you, this would be a complex and costly undertaking. Are you prepared for that?
PATIENT: Oh. Multi-stage… complex… costly. That sounds… overwhelming, Doctor. I hadn’t really considered… all of that. I just thought… a little surgery, and it would be better. I’m not sure I am prepared for all of that, honestly. I’ll have to… think about it. And discuss it with my financial advisor, I suppose. Is there… a less invasive option, perhaps? Something smaller? I understand nerve damage is… tricky. Is it possible to improve the appearance without getting into… nerve reconstruction?
DOCTOR: "Less invasive" options would yield… minimal results, dear. We’re dealing with significant tissue damage and nerve compromise here. Skin resurfacing, perhaps, but that would only address the superficial appearance of the scarring, not the underlying asymmetry. And frankly, given the extent of the damage, I wouldn’t recommend it. It would be a waste of your time and money. Now, before you make a rash decision, I suggest you schedule a consultation with a plastic surgeon specializing in facial reconstruction. I can provide you with a referral. They will be able to assess your case more thoroughly and provide you with a realistic prognosis. However, I must reiterate – this will be a lengthy and expensive process. Are you certain this is something you truly want to pursue?
PATIENT: Oh. A lengthy and expensive process… Yes, I understand. Perhaps… perhaps I should talk to a specialist, as you suggested. A plastic surgeon. Someone who… specializes in this sort of thing. A referral would be… helpful, thank you. I suppose I wasn't fully prepared for… all of this. I just… wanted to feel better. But maybe it's… not realistic. Yes, a referral would be wonderful, Doctor. And thank you for your honesty. It's… appreciated. I think I need some time to think, before making any decisions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the contact information for Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s quite reputable, specializing in facial reconstruction. She will provide you with a more detailed assessment and discuss your options. I've also included a list of resources regarding post-surgical care and potential complications. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with myself in one month, just to discuss your findings and address any concerns. And please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. One month… Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thank you again for your time and honesty. I appreciate your help. Have a good day, Doctor.
