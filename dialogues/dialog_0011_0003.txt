DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I am Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doc, it's this… shaking. It's in my hands, mostly. Been happenin’ for a bit now. Honestly, I don't have time for this, but my daughter insisted. She worries too much, that one. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It's good your daughter encourages you to seek medical attention, even if it feels inconvenient. We’ll do our best to be efficient. So, this shaking in your hands… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I couldn't tell ya. A while ago. Months, maybe? Everything blurs together after a certain point, ya know? I just… noticed it was gettin’ harder to hold a glass steady. That's when it really bothered me. I used to have a very steady hand, very important for my line of work, let me tell ya. Directing, you need precision. Not like these youngsters these days. They don't appreciate craftsmanship. Anyway, the shaking... it just appeared one day.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like it has been a gradual onset. And it’s impacting your ability to perform tasks requiring fine motor skill, like holding a glass. You mentioned directing – are you currently working, or is this affecting your ability to do so?
PATIENT: Working? Heavens no. Retired for… well, a long time. Too long to remember exactly. Used to be a big shot, though. Real films, not this… digital nonsense. This shaking just makes it harder to do… things. Even eating is a pain. I drop things. It's embarrassing. Though, frankly, I haven't had much reason to do much lately. My wife… she took care of everything. It’s just me now. So, I mostly just… sit. Which is probably why I didn't notice it right away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this has been a subtle change over time, and perhaps more noticeable now that you're less actively engaged in activities that would have highlighted it earlier. To help me understand the nature of the shaking, could you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to describe? It… shakes. It's in my hands. It’s not a big, violent tremble, it's more like… a quiver. A constant little… flutter. Sometimes it’s worse when I try to do something, like write or… pour a drink. Other times, it's just there, even when I'm not doin’ anything. Look, doc, I’m not a doctor, I direct people! You’re the one who’s supposed to know what all this means. Just tell me if it's serious.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I'll certainly do my best to provide you with some answers. It is helpful to understand the details, as different types of tremor have different causes. You said it’s a quiver, a constant little flutter, and it's worse with action. Is it present when your hands are resting in your lap, or only when you try to do something?
PATIENT: Ugh, alright, alright. When I’m just sitting… yeah, it’s still there, but fainter. Much less noticeable. It's mostly when I try to do something. Like, if I reach for something, or try to button my shirt. That's when it really gets going. It's frustrating! I used to have such control. Now I feel like an old fool. Just tell me, is it… is it something terrible? My daughter’s been talking about Parkinson’s and all sorts of things… I don’t even want to hear about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Baide. It’s natural to worry when you notice changes in your body, especially when family members raise concerns. It’s good you’re addressing this now. We'll need to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of the tremor. I’ll be checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination, as well as observing the tremor itself. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. The quicker we're done, the better. Honestly, poking and prodding isn’t going to tell you anything you can’t figure out by lookin’ at me. I'm an old man, I’m probably fallin’ apart. Just… be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. I hate messes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. I see a slight tremor present even at rest, but it does seem to increase with extension. Now, could you please tap your fingers on your lap with each hand?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? See? Not exactly a symphony, is it? Used to be able to conduct an orchestra with these hands. Now look at ‘em. It’s… humiliating. Just get on with it. What’s the verdict? Am I… doomed?
DOCTOR: The tremor is present and increases with intentional movement, as you’ve described. It’s also somewhat asymmetric – slightly more pronounced on your right hand. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please relax your legs. And now the other side. Your reflexes appear normal. Finally, I’d like you to briefly perform a few simple movements – like touching your nose with your index finger, then touching my finger.
PATIENT: There. And now… Honestly, doc, I feel like I'm in a circus act. What does this all mean? Don't tell me it's one of those things… the one my daughter mentioned. Parkinson's, was it? Because I swear, if that's what you're going to tell me…
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Baide. Based on this brief examination, the findings are suggestive of an essential tremor. Essential tremor is a relatively common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, most often in the hands. It's generally not life-threatening, though it can be bothersome and interfere with daily activities. It's important to note that it is not Parkinson's disease, which has different characteristics and typically presents with other symptoms. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a few simple blood tests. Also, an MRI of the brain would be helpful. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, doc, this is getting ridiculous. Is this absolutely necessary? I already told you, it’s just a tremor. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A pill, maybe? I don’t want to spend my last years in and out of hospitals. It’s a waste of time. And frankly, it's undignified. Just… tell me if there's a pill. If there is, I'll take it. If there isn't... well, I guess I'll just live with it. But I'm not doing any MRIs. Do you understand? No MRIs.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Baide. Your comfort is my priority. While medication can help manage the symptoms of essential tremor, a proper diagnosis is crucial to ensure we are treating the correct condition and that the medication is appropriate for you. Skipping the diagnostic tests could lead to misdiagnosis or ineffective treatment. However, I respect your wishes. We can proceed with a trial of medication commonly used for essential tremor – propranolol – if you prefer. It’s a beta-blocker that can help reduce the severity of the shaking. It’s important to understand that this means we won’t have a definitive diagnosis at this time, and it may take some time to determine if the medication is effective and well-tolerated. We will need to monitor you closely for any side effects, and if the medication isn’t helpful, we may need to revisit the possibility of further testing. Would you like to proceed with a trial of propranolol?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Get me the pill. Anything is better than more tests and poking and prodding. Just… keep it simple. I don't want any fuss. And if it doesn't work, don't bother me about more tests. I've made myself clear. Just give me the pill and let me get on with my life. Whatever's left of it. Now, can I go? I have better things to do, even if I can't remember what they are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I will write you a prescription for propranolol, starting with a low dose. It’s important to take it as directed and to be aware of potential side effects, such as fatigue, dizziness, or low blood pressure. I’ll provide you with a handout detailing these side effects. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can assess your response to the medication and make any necessary adjustments. If you experience any concerning side effects, please contact the office immediately. Here is your prescription. Please let the nurse know you're ready to leave, and she will provide you with instructions regarding the medication and scheduling your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… let me go. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Take care of yourself, and please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
