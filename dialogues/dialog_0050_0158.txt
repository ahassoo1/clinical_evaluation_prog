DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re forty-four years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, forty-four, that’s right. Though honestly, time just…flies, doesn’t it? I’m here about a letter. A letter for…well, for my dog. A pet ownership letter, I think they called it. Something about needing proof or something? I can’t quite recall all the details, honestly. It’s for where I live, you see. They’re being rather…particular these days.
DOCTOR: A letter regarding pet ownership… yes, I see a note here from the housing authority. Rather unusual to require a physician’s involvement, frankly. Still, we aim to be thorough. To clarify, Ms. Wrye, is this related to any specific concerns about your dog’s temperament, or is it simply a formality for documentation purposes?
PATIENT: Temperament? Oh, goodness no! He’s a perfectly lovely dog. A little…enthusiastic sometimes, maybe, but who isn’t? Honestly, it’s probably just some nonsense from the new landlord. He seems to have a problem with…well, people generally, if you ask me. All these rules, and forms...It's ridiculous, really. I just need the letter so they’ll stop bothering me, that’s all. I don’t understand why I have to jump through hoops for his issues.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Bureaucracy, as they say. Now, to fulfill this request appropriately, I do need some information. While it sounds as though your dog is well-behaved, the housing authority likely requires confirmation of his suitability as a companion animal. To begin, could you tell me the breed and age of your dog?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Breed and age... honestly, I've never been very good with those details. He's…a big one. A really big one. Brown, mostly. And fluffy. Very fluffy. I got him from a…a friend of a friend, you see. So I didn't get a lot of paperwork or anything. I think he’s…maybe five? Six? Somewhere around there. He was already grown when I got him. A rescue, really. A lovely rescue. Honestly, the important thing is he’s a good boy. He doesn’t cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Right. A large, brown, fluffy dog, approximately five to six years of age, acquired from a personal connection. While I appreciate your description, Ms. Wrye, for the purposes of this letter, and potentially for your own peace of mind, it would be beneficial to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could contribute to behavioral issues. It’s not to suggest there are any, simply a matter of due diligence. Would you be opposed to a brief physical examination of your dog?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Of him? Honestly, Doctor, that seems a bit…extreme, don’t you think? He’s perfectly healthy. He eats, he sleeps, he barks at squirrels. What more do you need to know? I really don’t see the point of poking and prodding him. He doesn't like the vet, you see. It’ll just stress him out. And me, frankly. It all just seems rather unnecessary. I just need a letter saying he’s fine. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Wrye. However, certain medical conditions – thyroid imbalances, neurological issues, even chronic pain – can manifest as behavioral changes. To provide a responsible and defensible letter, it is my professional opinion that a basic assessment is warranted. I assure you, this would be a minimal examination. I can check his vital signs, palpate his abdomen, and visually assess his neurological function. It’s a matter of ruling out easily identifiable causes. If we can’t establish a reasonable degree of health, I may be forced to recommend a consultation with a veterinary specialist. Would you prefer that course of action?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're talking about a specialist? Absolutely not! That sounds terribly expensive and…over the top. Look, I'm telling you, he's fine. He's a dog! They bark, they shed, they chase their tails. It’s what they do. I don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. Fine, fine. You can…look at him. Quickly. But I’m telling you now, don’t expect to find anything. And please be gentle. He’s a bit sensitive. Honestly, this is just a waste of everyone’s time. But if it gets them off my back… sighs dramatically Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. Let us proceed with the examination, then. Please, follow me. We’ll keep it as brief and non-invasive as possible. I'll need to gather some basic information as I proceed. If you could just keep him reasonably still, that would be greatly appreciated. And, if you happen to know his weight, that would be helpful as well. Though, given the circumstances, an approximation will suffice.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight…I honestly have no idea. He's…substantial. A big boy, as I said. Maybe…seventy pounds? Eighty? Somewhere around there. He’s…well, he enjoys his food. That’s probably a good starting point. Honestly, I just hope this doesn't take too long. He’s not particularly fond of strangers, you see. And I really don’t want him getting agitated. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Seventy to eighty pounds… noted. Alright, Ms. Wrye, if you could just keep him on the floor, preferably lying down, that would be ideal. I’ll start with auscultation – listening to his heart and lungs. It’s a completely non-invasive procedure. Now, is there anything specific about his behavior that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Oh, behavior… well, he barks at the mailman. Every single day. And squirrels. He loves squirrels. And sometimes, when he’s really excited, he…well, he jumps. A lot. But he’s never actually hurt anyone. Just enthusiastic, that’s all. He gets a bit anxious when I leave the house, but who doesn’t? Honestly, he’s a perfectly normal dog. A big, fluffy, squirrel-obsessed, slightly jumpy dog. Is that what you needed to know? Please be careful. He doesn’t bite, but he does have a rather boisterous tail.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is slightly elevated, likely due to the current situation. Lung sounds are clear. Tail wagging is…vigorous, as you mentioned. Abdomen is soft, no apparent masses or tenderness. Now, let’s quickly check his neurological reflexes. Patellar reflexes are normal. Now, could you please allow me to examine his eyes and ears?
PATIENT: Eyes and ears… honestly, it all seems rather excessive. They look…normal. He blinks. He wags his tail. He’s a dog! Is this really necessary? He’s not a show dog, you know. He's just a companion. And frankly, he's starting to get restless. I can feel him tensing up. Please hurry. I really don’t want him getting upset. I just want the letter. That's all.
DOCTOR: Eyes appear clear, no signs of cataracts or glaucoma. Ears are clean, no evidence of infection or excessive wax buildup. Very well. Based on this limited examination, and given your report of normal behavior, I can state that he appears to be in relatively good health. However, it’s important to understand that this is not a comprehensive veterinary assessment. Now, for the letter itself… I will draft a statement confirming his apparent good health and reasonable temperament, with the caveat that a more thorough examination by a qualified veterinarian would be recommended for definitive assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A caveat? Honestly, Doctor, really? Fine, fine, whatever. Just…get the letter done. I don’t care about caveats. As long as it satisfies the landlord, I’m happy. A qualified veterinarian… honestly, the thought. Just…type it up. Quickly, please. And try to make it sound…official. I just want this over with. It's been a completely ridiculous waste of my time. Honestly. A perfectly good dog, causing perfectly good trouble, and a landlord making a perfectly good fuss. The world is going mad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here you are. This statement confirms his apparent good health and reasonable temperament, as assessed during this brief examination. As noted, a comprehensive veterinary assessment is recommended for definitive evaluation. I’ve also included a disclaimer stating the limitations of this assessment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Wrye?
PATIENT: “Limitations of this assessment…” Honestly. No. No, that’s quite enough. Just…thank you. I suppose. And please, don't expect me back. Honestly, the whole experience has been…utterly exhausting. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Wrye. .
