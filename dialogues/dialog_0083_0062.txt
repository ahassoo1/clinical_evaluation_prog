DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Alanes. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today regarding a matter at my workplace. It concerns the requirement to wear masks, and… well, I am hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption. It’s been… difficult, to put it mildly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re seeking a medical exemption from the mask requirement at your workplace. That's perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a bit more about why it’s been difficult for you?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t… a discomfort, precisely. It’s more… a feeling. A weight, almost, on my chest when I have it on for too long. And a… a sense of being… disconnected. I know that sounds strange. I work with people, helping folks, and it feels wrong to not be fully… present, to not be able to see their faces clearly when I am trying to offer support. It’s hard to explain, but it feels like it hinders my ability to do my job properly. I’ve been a Protective Service Worker for quite some time, and I rely on reading people.
DOCTOR: I understand. It doesn’t sound strange at all. It’s very helpful for me to hear that it impacts your ability to perform your job as a Protective Service Worker, especially regarding reading people and offering support. It sounds like there’s a significant emotional component to this, which is important. To clarify, is this feeling new since the mask requirement, or have you experienced something similar before?
PATIENT: It is definitely new since the mask requirement. I have never felt this way before. Prior to this, I had no issues with close contact, no trouble seeing folks clearly, or… feeling connected when I was assisting someone. It started almost immediately when we were told masks were mandatory. At first, I thought it was just something I’d get used to. But it hasn’t gotten any easier, if anything it's… more pronounced now. It makes me worry about the quality of care I’m providing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And physically, besides the sensation of weight on your chest, are you experiencing any other symptoms when wearing the mask?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath, no headaches, no dizziness. Nothing like that. It is purely… this feeling. The weight, and the sense of disconnection. I am otherwise healthy, as far as I know. I have Medicare, and I keep up with my checkups. It’s not a physical ailment, I don’t believe. It’s… something else. Perhaps a reaction to feeling restricted? I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like we’re dealing with something more than a simple physical discomfort, then. You mentioned it feels like a reaction to feeling restricted, and that's a very helpful observation. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries, thankfully. I did have pneumonia when I was a young man, but that was decades ago, and I recovered fully. No asthma, no heart conditions, no allergies that require medication. I’ve always been a strong, healthy person. I’ve been very fortunate in that regard. I try to stay active, walk when I can, eat well… typical things. As for mental health, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I’ve experienced sadness, like anyone, but nothing that required professional help. I am a fairly private person, and I tend to handle things myself. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you have a good baseline of health, which is positive. Given that you haven’t had any prior respiratory issues or mental health diagnoses, and this started with the mask requirement, we should explore this further. To help me rule out any underlying causes, and to better understand what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and just do a general assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this thoroughly. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. A physical exam is fine. I would appreciate knowing if there is a medical reason why I am experiencing this. It is… unsettling to feel this way, and I would like to understand it. Please proceed as you see fit.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s begin then. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I am ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your heart now… rate is regular, no murmurs detected. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally… no wheezing, no crackles. Good, lungs sound clear. Now I’m just going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, which is excellent. Blood pressure is 130/80, also within normal limits. Everything is looking good physically. It doesn’t appear to be a respiratory or cardiovascular issue. Which, as you mentioned, is consistent with your medical history. Now, just to complete the assessment, can you tell me if you have any history of anxiety, panic attacks, or claustrophobia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never been diagnosed with any of those conditions. I wouldn't say I am particularly prone to worry, and I certainly haven’t ever experienced a panic attack. Claustrophobia… well, I don't enjoy small spaces, but I wouldn’t describe it as a phobia. I can tolerate them if I have to. It’s just a mild discomfort. This feeling with the mask is… different. It’s not a fear of suffocation or being trapped. It’s more… a sense of being disconnected, as I mentioned before. A barrier between myself and the people I am trying to help. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like we’re dealing with something more nuanced than a typical anxiety response. Given your history, your physical exam findings, and the specific nature of your symptoms, it’s possible this is related to a sensory processing sensitivity, or a difficulty adapting to changes in your environment that impact your ability to connect with others. Now, I want to be upfront with you. I am a Family Medicine physician, and while I can offer some guidance, a comprehensive assessment of sensory processing sensitivity or other psychological factors would require a referral to a specialist – a psychologist or psychiatrist. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: That is… a reasonable suggestion, Doctor. A specialist would certainly have more expertise in that area. I hadn’t even considered that possibility. If you think it would be helpful, I am happy to schedule an appointment with a psychologist or psychiatrist. I just want to understand what is going on, and to find a way to continue doing my job effectively. To be honest, it’s… disheartening to feel like something is hindering my ability to help people. I’ve always taken pride in being present and supportive. Yes, please. A referral would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. It's commendable that you’re seeking to address this so you can continue providing the care your patients deserve. I’ll go ahead and prepare a referral for you to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a clinical psychologist specializing in sensory processing and emotional wellbeing. She has a good reputation in the area. I'll also include a brief summary of our conversation and your exam findings for her. In the meantime, until you see Dr. Reed, would you be comfortable trying some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation?
PATIENT: That sounds… helpful, Doctor. I am willing to try anything that might alleviate this feeling. Relaxation techniques… I have heard of those, but I have never actually practiced them. Perhaps Dr. Reed can provide me with some guidance. In the meantime, I will see if I can find some resources online. Deep breathing… I suppose that’s a good starting point. Thank you for the referral and the suggestion. I appreciate your help, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Here's the referral form, along with a list of resources for relaxation techniques and mindfulness meditation. Dr. Reed's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. I am grateful for your time and attention. You have been very helpful and understanding. I appreciate your willingness to investigate this matter, and for referring me to Dr. Reed. I will schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I wish you all the best in getting to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
