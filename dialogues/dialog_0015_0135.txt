DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have... something coming from my ear. A liquid. It is not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. A liquid discharge from your ear, and it's not comfortable. Can you tell me a little more about this liquid?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, sometimes a little bit yellow. Not much, but I notice it when I wipe my ear. It started maybe two weeks ago. Not after swimming, or anything like that. Just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Clear to slightly yellow discharge for about two weeks, and it wasn’t associated with swimming or a recent injury. Is there any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. A little… pressure, sometimes. Like when I push on it. But not pain. And… my hearing is okay. I can hear you very well, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. No pain, just some pressure when touched, and your hearing is currently normal. Have you experienced any dizziness or ringing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: No dizziness. No… ringing. Everything sounds normal. I did have a bad cold last month, maybe six weeks ago. Could it be from that?
DOCTOR: Possibly. A cold could be related. Have you noticed any fever, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And my vision is good. I had my eyes checked last year. Everything is fine. Just… this ear. It bothers me when I lay down on that side, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, discharge for two weeks, pressure but no pain, normal hearing and vision, no dizziness, and it's bothersome when you lie on that side. Have you tried anything to treat it so far – any over-the-counter drops or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I… I do not know what drops to use. That is why I came to see you. I did not want to put something in my ear that would make it worse.
DOCTOR: That was a wise decision. We’ll take a look. Let me have you sit up, and I'll need to examine your ear with an otoscope. This will allow me to visualize your ear canal and eardrum. It won’t take long, but please remain still while I’m looking.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will stay very still. Please, be gentle. I… I do not like things in my ear.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some cerumen—that's earwax—and a slight amount of fluid in the ear canal. Your eardrum appears to be intact, though it’s a bit… cloudy. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection at this point, but the cloudiness is concerning. I’m going to document my findings. "Tympanic membrane slightly cloudy, mild cerumen present, small amount of clear fluid in external auditory canal." Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I take a pill for my blood pressure, that is all. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. I have been taking it for five years. My previous doctor prescribed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure for five years, and no known allergies. This cloudiness on your eardrum could indicate fluid buildup, potentially from the cold you had, or possibly a mild inner ear infection, though there aren’t clear signs of one at this time. I want to be cautious. I'm going to order a tympanometry test, which measures the movement of your eardrum. This will help us determine if there’s fluid behind the eardrum and how well it’s moving. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A test sounds alright. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I have an appointment later today, I do not want to be late.
DOCTOR: No, the tympanometry test shouldn’t hurt at all. It’s completely non-invasive. A small probe is placed in your ear canal, and it measures how well your eardrum moves when air pressure is changed. It only takes a few minutes. We can get it done right away here in the clinic. While we're waiting for the results, are you experiencing any other symptoms, like a sore throat, cough, or congestion?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No sore throat, no cough. The cold was… a long time ago. I felt very tired, and my nose was running, but that is all. It is completely gone now. And thank you for explaining the test, it makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Okay, the results are back. The test does show reduced mobility of your left eardrum, which indicates some fluid buildup in the middle ear. This supports my initial assessment. It’s likely fluid remaining from your previous cold. I'm going to prescribe a course of oral decongestants and a nasal steroid spray to help clear the fluid. This should resolve the issue within a week or two. However, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any pain, fever, or drainage from your ear, please come back immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is clear. Decongestants and spray. One week or two. And come back if pain, fever, or… drainage. Thank you very much. Will you… write down the instructions? I worry I will forget.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the instructions and information about the medications I’m prescribing. Take the decongestant as directed on the label. And use the nasal spray twice a day for ten days. Avoid getting water in your ear while you're being treated. I’ve also included information on potential side effects. Do you have any questions about the medications or the instructions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The instructions are very clear, thank you. Everything seems… understandable. You have been very helpful. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so well. I will follow the instructions carefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to monitor your symptoms, and don't hesitate to come back if anything changes. Do you need a work note for any time off, or a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: No, thank you Doctor. No work note, and I do not think I need a specialist. I trust your judgement. I will see how the medicine works. .
DOCTOR: Alright. That sounds good. Have a good day, Mr. Radillo, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns.
