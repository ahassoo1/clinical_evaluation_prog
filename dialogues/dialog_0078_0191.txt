DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be quite frank, I came in to request an HIV test. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It’s something I’ve been thinking about for a while now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very responsible decision. Getting tested is a good way to take care of your health. Before we proceed with the test, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to get tested now?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s not…a specific event, if that makes sense. Just a general feeling of wanting to know where I stand, really. My husband and I…well, we haven’t been as careful as we should lately, and with my age, I thought it was best to be proactive. It's better to know, isn’t it? And truthfully, I haven’t been tested in…quite some time. Perhaps ever. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that.
DOCTOR: There's absolutely no need to be embarrassed, Ms. Shaub. Many people haven't been regularly tested, and it's wonderful that you're taking this step now. It is always better to know. And you're right, proactive is a good way to be. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your and your husband’s sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well…it’s been a while since we’ve had new partners, if that’s what you mean. Just the two of us. It’s…been a long marriage. We’ve been together for forty-two years, you see. And…well, things change, don’t they? We’ve…become more relaxed, let’s say, about protection. I suppose I should have thought of this sooner, but we were always so careful in the beginning. I just…didn’t want to worry needlessly. But now…now I think it’s important to be certain. Is that…enough information? I don’t like talking about these things, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Shaub. You've given me enough information to start with. It’s very common for couples who have been together for a long time to become less focused on protection, and you're right to want to be certain now. It’s responsible and thoughtful of you. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections, or had any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. A few aches and pains, as one gets older, but nothing serious. I had a bout of malaria when I visited Nigeria a few years ago, but that was quickly treated. And the usual – high blood pressure, which I manage with medication. But as for sexually transmitted infections…no, never. I’ve always been very careful, as I said. We both have been. It’s…difficult to believe this could be a concern, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Shaub. The malaria was treated, and you manage your blood pressure – that’s positive. It’s completely understandable to feel that this might be a concern, especially given your history. It’s always best to be thorough. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, and if so, could you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Amlodipine, 10 milligrams, once daily. I’ve been on it for about five years now. The doctor said it’s important to keep my blood pressure under control, and thankfully, it seems to be working quite well. I have it right here, if you’d like to see the bottle.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Shaub. Amlodipine 10mg daily – that’s helpful. And you haven’t experienced any side effects from the medication, have you?
PATIENT: No, not really. Perhaps a little bit of swelling in my ankles sometimes, but it's not too bad. It comes and goes. I mention it to my doctor at my regular check-ups, and she says it’s a common side effect and not to worry unless it gets much worse. It’s easily managed by elevating my feet. Honestly, it’s a small price to pay for keeping my blood pressure in check.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Mild ankle swelling is a common side effect of Amlodipine, and it sounds like you’re managing it appropriately. Now, before we proceed with the HIV test, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Are you aware of any family members who have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a difficult question. To be honest…no. Not that I know of. My family is…rather large and scattered, and we don’t always keep in close contact. My mother passed away many years ago, and she never spoke of anything like that. And my siblings…well, we’ve drifted apart somewhat. It’s possible someone has it, but I’m not aware of it. It wasn’t something people talked about openly when I was growing up, you understand. It was…a shame, a secret.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Shaub. It wasn't openly discussed for many years, and it’s not uncommon to be unaware of family health history. Before we move on to the test itself, I want to ensure you understand the procedure and what the results mean. The test we’ll be doing today is a blood test. It looks for antibodies your body creates to fight the HIV virus. It can take a few weeks for your body to develop these antibodies after exposure, so a negative result doesn’t necessarily mean you haven't been infected if you were recently exposed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes sense. A few weeks, you say? Well, it’s been…a while, thankfully. So, if it comes back negative, that’s…a good sign, isn’t it? And if it's positive…what happens then? I don't mean to be morbid, but I'd like to know. I've seen things on the television, but I'm sure that's not the full picture. Is it…a death sentence?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid question, Ms. Shaub, and you're right to ask. A negative result after a few weeks would be a good indication, yes. However, if you've had any potential exposures within the last three months, we may need to repeat the test to be certain. And no, HIV is not a death sentence anymore. Thanks to advancements in medication, people living with HIV can live long, healthy lives. There are medications called antiretroviral therapy, or ART, that can control the virus and prevent it from damaging the body. They can even reduce the viral load to undetectable levels, which means they can’t transmit the virus to others. If the test were to come back positive, we would refer you to an HIV specialist who can discuss treatment options with you. We would also provide support and resources to help you manage your health. Does that help to ease your concerns a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that…that does help, thank you, Doctor. It's good to know there's…something to be done about it. It’s just…it’s a frightening thought, isn’t it? I haven't thought about this in years, and suddenly…here I am. Alright. Let’s just get it over with, shall we? What do I need to do? I'm ready for the test, if you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I understand it can be frightening, but you’re taking a very positive step. Alright. I’ll just need to take a small sample of blood from your arm. I'll clean the area first, and you may feel a quick pinch. It shouldn’t take long at all. If you'll just have a seat here, and we’ll get started. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to tolerate those sorts of things. Alright then…let's proceed. I hope I don’t faint. I've never been good with needles.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Shaub. Just try to relax, and take a few deep breaths. I'll be as quick as possible. Okay, all done. Just a little bit of pressure here for a moment to stop the bleeding. Excellent. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: No…no, it wasn’t as bad as I thought. Just a little prick. Thank you, Doctor. That was very…efficient. How long before we get the results? And will you…will you tell me as soon as they’re available, or do I need to schedule another appointment?
DOCTOR: You were very brave, Ms. Shaub. It's done now. The results typically take about a week to come back from the lab. I will personally call you as soon as they are available. I won’t leave you waiting unnecessarily. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the results, when you have them. I appreciate your kindness and patience, Doctor. This has been…a relief, in a way, even though it’s a little frightening. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help, and I’m here if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I will be in touch as soon as the results are available.
