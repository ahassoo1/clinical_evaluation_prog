DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Auelua, you say? Yes. Hmm. I… just moved here. New place. Doctor things, you know? Medicare said I should come. Social visit, they called it. Everything feels… new. Not remembering much why I had to come, really. Just…here.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Moving can be very disruptive, and it's not uncommon to feel a bit disoriented. We'll figure things out together. So, a “social visit” as Medicare put it... that's a bit vague. Let's try to get a clearer picture. To start, are you experiencing any specific health problems at the moment?
PATIENT: Health problems? Not that I notice. Old. I'm old, that's a problem. Everything aches a little, always. Is that a problem? Used to work with… faces. A lot of faces. Makeup. Stage. That was… a long time ago. Not sure what you want to know exactly. It's just… being old. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not nearly enough, and it’s good you're telling me this. “Being old” doesn’t automatically mean there’s nothing to investigate. Aches and pains are common, certainly, but we need to understand where the aches are, how long they've been happening, and if anything makes them better or worse. Let's start with the aches. Could you tell me where you're feeling the pain most?
PATIENT: Hmm. Everywhere, I think. But… my back, maybe? Lower back. Always a little… stiff. And my knees. Knees are bad. Used to kneel a lot. For the… faces. The makeup, yes. It's been years. Not a sharp pain, just… there. Always. Worse when the weather is… damp. Like today, probably. Is that helpful? You are asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing it’s worse with damp weather is a good clue. And it’s alright, I am asking a lot of questions - it helps me build a picture of what’s going on. So, lower back and knees, consistently aching, worse with damp weather. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your back pain is on a typical day?
PATIENT: Zero to ten? What is… typical? Some days it is… not so bad. Other days… I have to sit down. Maybe a… four? When it's good. When it’s damp like this, maybe a six or seven. I don't like numbers. It’s just… pain. Old man pain. Is that good enough? You are making my head hurt with these numbers.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Szmyd. We can skip the numbers if they’re frustrating. “Old man pain” is a perfectly valid description, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Knowing it fluctuates and is worse on damp days is important. So, back pain, worse with the weather. And you mentioned your knees as well. What about your knees – how would you describe the pain there?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees. Always… creaky. Like old doors. Not sharp, just… stiff. Makes it hard to… bend. To get up from a chair. To… walk far. It’s worse in the mornings, I think. And… like the back, damp weather. Everything feels… tighter. I used to be able to… kneel for hours. Now? Forget it. A few minutes and I am done. Old. Everything is old.
DOCTOR: Okay, creaky, stiff knees, worse in the mornings and with damp weather, making it difficult to bend, kneel, and walk. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, besides the pain in your back and knees, have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. I… get tired easier. Always tired, really. But… more so lately, maybe? And… I forget things. You were just asking me about things! I already told you, didn’t I? This is… frustrating. Everything feels… fuzzy. I used to have a very good memory. Faces, colors… now? Not so much. Oh, and my hands… they shake a little sometimes. Not a lot, but… noticeable. Is that what you mean? Changes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean, Mr. Szmyd. Changes like that are important to know about. Fatigue, forgetfulness, and shaking hands – these are all things we need to consider. You mentioned forgetfulness. Could you give me an example of something you’ve been forgetting lately?
PATIENT: Oh… examples. That’s… difficult. Everything is an example! I… I went to the store yesterday. For… milk, I think. Or was it bread? I don't remember. I had a list. I know I did. But I left it at home. And… I was talking to the neighbor. Nice woman. What did we talk about? I can't recall. It's… little things, mostly. But it’s… unsettling. It’s not like this used to be. I used to remember everything! Faces… names… colors… now… This is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Szmyd. It’s certainly concerning to experience changes in memory. We’ll try to figure out what’s going on. Now, let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I eat. When I remember to. Sometimes I don’t feel hungry. Not a big eater, never was. Weight? I don’t know. I haven’t… weighed myself. Not for years, probably. Clothes fit… loosely, maybe? I don’t pay much attention. It’s not like I’m doing anything to gain weight. Just… old. Everything is… shrinking, I suppose. Myself included. Is that helpful? You ask so many questions about… everything.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing you haven’t noticed a significant change in appetite and clothes feel loose is good information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That was… a long time ago. I went to doctors, of course. When I was working. Stage doctors, mostly. For… cuts and bruises. Things like that. I don't remember… serious things. The Russian doctors… they told me I had… something. High… something? Pressure, maybe? They gave me pills. For years. I stopped taking them… a long time ago. Didn’t seem to make much difference. And… I had my appendix out, when I was young. That’s about all I can recall, really. Everything is… fuzzy. This is… frustrating. I don’t remember things like that! Did I tell you about the faces? I used to remember every face…
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed as a young man, and you were previously diagnosed with high blood pressure, for which you took medication for a while but stopped. It’s alright that you don't remember all the details. We can try to get more information from your medical records, if that’s okay with you. Do you happen to know the names of any of the medications you used to take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No! No, absolutely not. Names… pills… all the same. Little white things, mostly. Or maybe blue? I don’t remember the names. I just took them. The doctor said to. Years ago. Everything is… a blur. I don’t remember names, numbers, faces… it’s all… gone. This is… unsettling. I used to have a very good memory. Now… now I can barely remember what I had for breakfast. If I even had breakfast. You are making my head hurt with all these questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. It's alright. Don't worry about remembering details you can't recall. We can work around that. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That was… a long time ago. Russia. Very different then. My mother… she was… sick. For a long time. Something with her… breathing, I think? She was always tired. My father… he was strong. A farmer. He lived a long life. No… nothing that I recall. Heart disease… cancer… stroke… no. They didn't talk about things like that. Everything was… different. We didn't have doctors… not like here. Everything is… a blur. This is… frustrating. Why do you need to know about… family? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Szmyd. Knowing that your mother was often tired is helpful. Family history can sometimes give us clues, but it's not essential if you don't have much information. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Drink? Drugs? No! Absolutely not. Never. I was a… professional. I had to be… clean. Stage, you understand? Makeup, faces… you can't do that with… that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. A little wine, maybe… with dinner, occasionally. But nothing… serious. And drugs? Never. Never. This is… insulting, even.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was insensitive, Mr. Szmyd. It was merely a routine part of the assessment. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so. Never had any problems. They gave me… something, once. A shot. For… the flu, maybe? I felt a little… dizzy afterwards. But that was all. No… nothing serious. Nothing that I recall. I don't have allergies like… peanuts or cats or anything. Just… old. Everything feels… a little off sometimes. But that's just… being old, you understand? Is that enough questions? I'm starting to feel… tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, that’s quite enough questions. Thank you for your patience. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, based on what you’ve told me – your recent fatigue, forgetfulness, shaking hands, aches and pains, and a history of high blood pressure – it sounds like we need to investigate a few things. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… more questions… more poking and prodding… Very well. If you must. I suppose it’s better to know… something. Just… be gentle, please. And don’t take too long. I'm starting to feel… quite tired. Just… hurry. And please… no surprises. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. No surprises, I promise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Not critically high, but something we’ll want to monitor. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your coordination is a little slow, but otherwise appears normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Everything seems within reasonable limits for your age, but the elevated blood pressure, fatigue, forgetfulness, and slightly diminished reflexes suggest we should run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests… blood… everything… This is… quite a lot. What will these tests… show? Are they… painful? What if something is… wrong? This is… unsettling. I didn’t want to come here, you know. I just wanted to… be left alone. But… if you think it’s necessary… Very well. Do what you must. Just… tell me the results. Quickly. And please… no surprises. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Szmyd. It is a lot, and I apologize for that. We’re just trying to gather information to understand what's going on. The blood tests are not painful – it’s just a small prick of the needle. The EKG is also painless – we’ll just attach some electrodes to your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms, such as anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, or heart abnormalities. I’ll explain the results to you as soon as they’re available, and we'll discuss the best course of action. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood and perform the EKG right away. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a low dose of medication to help manage your blood pressure. It’s a starting point, and we can adjust it as needed based on the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication… more pills… This is… quite a lot to take in. Very well. If you must. I suppose it’s better to… do something. Just… tell me what to do. Don’t ask me to… remember anything. And please… no surprises. Is that too much to ask? Just… hurry. I’m starting to feel… quite tired. And… what about the nurse? Will she be… gentle?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I'll write everything down for you, so you don't have to remember anything. And I promise to explain everything clearly and avoid any surprises. I'll write down the name of the medication, the dosage, and how often to take it. The nurse, Sarah, is very gentle and experienced. She’ll explain the procedure to you and answer any questions you may have. She's used to working with patients who are feeling anxious, and she'll take her time to make you comfortable. I'll ask her to come in now and draw the blood. It will only take a few minutes. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a printout of the instructions for the medication and a list of potential side effects. Please read it carefully when you have a chance. Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Mr. Szmyd?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… hurry. I’m starting to feel… quite tired. And… please, no more questions. I just want to… go home. This is… quite a lot for an old man. Just… let me go home. And… thank you. I suppose. But… this is… quite a lot. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I completely understand. Let me have Sarah come in and we’ll get you all set up to go home as soon as possible. Sarah, could you please come in here for a moment?
