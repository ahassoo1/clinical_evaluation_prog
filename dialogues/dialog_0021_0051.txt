DOCTOR: Right, Darl Nini. 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's a bit silly, really. My daughter… she says I should just know my blood type. For… things. You know, just in case. I don't recall ever having it checked, and I'm not very good at remembering things these days. Is that something you can do here? Determine my blood type?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do a blood type test. It’s a pretty standard procedure. But honestly, it's not silly to want to know. It's good to be prepared. We usually only do it if it’s medically necessary – before a surgery or if you're donating, that sort of thing. But we can certainly add it to your panel. Before we do that, though, is there anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, nothing else really. Just the blood type, yes. My daughter, Elena, she worries so much. A very good girl, Elena. Always thinking ahead. I suppose it’s better to be safe, as she says. So, how does it work, dear? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt at all. It's just a simple blood draw, like when you get your cholesterol checked. We'll take a small sample of your blood and run it through a few tests to determine your type – A, B, AB, or O, and whether you're Rh positive or negative. It takes just a few minutes. Before we proceed, let’s just quickly go through a few things, just standard procedure. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. Not to anything specific, no. I used to get stung by bees when I was a girl, helping my father in the orchard, but that was… a very long time ago. Didn't bother me much then, a bit of swelling, that’s all. Nothing now, I don’t believe. Oh, and I can’t tolerate shellfish. Makes me quite ill, sadly. Not an allergy, exactly, just… doesn't agree with me. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish intolerance noted. And no known allergies otherwise. It's good to be thorough. We need to know about anything that could cause a reaction during a procedure, or while taking certain medications. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. Just these, dear. For my… well, for my joints. They get achy, you know, with the weather. Elena reminds me to take them every morning. And… sometimes a little something to help me sleep. That’s all, I think. I can’t quite recall the names, sorry. They're… small and white. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s okay, we'll figure it out. Do you know the dosage of either one?
PATIENT: Dosage… oh dear. Elena manages all that, you see. I just take them as she tells me. I’m afraid I haven’t the slightest idea. She has a chart at home, with everything written down, but… well, I’m not very good with details, as I said. I suppose you could call her? She’s a very organized girl. Her number is… Oh, bother. Now I've forgotten. It begins with a '5', I think. Perhaps if I think hard…
DOCTOR: Alright. We can try to look up your medications based on what they look like, and maybe cross-reference them with your insurance records. Do you know if you usually fill your prescriptions at a specific pharmacy?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that’s it! The pharmacy! Yes, we always go to… Lopez Pharmacy. On Main Street. Old Mr. Lopez, lovely man. He knows Elena and me very well. He’d definitely have a record of what I take. He’s very… meticulous. Would you call him, dear? That would be wonderful. I do hate bothering people, but… I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me give Lopez Pharmacy a call. It’s no bother at all. Just one moment. Hello, this is Dr. Havird’s office. I’m calling regarding a patient, Darl Nini… Yes, that’s N-I-N-I. I was hoping to verify a list of her current medications…
PATIENT: I do hope I’m not causing too much trouble, dear. It's all so… complicated these days. It wasn’t like this when I was younger, you know. A simple visit to the doctor, and they knew everything. But… times change, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Alright, it seems Lopez Pharmacy has a record of two medications. One is Meloxicam, 7.5mg, taken daily for arthritis. And the other is Trazodone, 50mg, as needed for sleep. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, that's it! Meloxicam and… Trazodone. You are a clever girl, dear. A very clever girl. Elena will be so pleased you sorted that out. Yes, I take the Meloxicam every morning, for my joints. They get so achy, you know, especially when it rains. And the Trazodone… well, I don’t sleep very well sometimes. It helps me drift off. So, we've got everything sorted now, haven't we? Can we get to the blood type now? I’m rather curious to know what it is. Elena wants to be prepared for… everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, we have everything documented now. We can proceed with the blood type test. I’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes, and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Are you alright with me doing that now?
PATIENT: Oh yes, dear, that’s fine. Go ahead. A small prick, is it? I barely notice things like that anymore. Elena always says I’m very brave. It's probably not true, but it's nice of her to say so. I do hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have a cup of tea waiting for me at home. Earl Grey, my favourite.
DOCTOR: Alright, this will just feel like a quick pinch. Try to relax. There we go. All done. Just keep pressure on that for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. I’ll send this sample to the lab, and we should have the results back within the hour. Alright. Now we just wait. Is there anything else I can get for you while we wait?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That was barely a thing. You're very skilled. No, I think I'm alright, thank you. Just a cup of tea when I get home, I expect. It’s very kind of you to offer, though. Elena will be very relieved when I tell her it’s done. She worries so much about everything. Perhaps I’ll ask her to bring some biscuits next time. This is a lovely clinic, by the way. Very… calming.
DOCTOR: Thank you. We try to make it as comfortable as possible. I'll let you know as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me about your medications, or anything else related to your health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, I don't think so, dear. You've explained everything so well. I suppose… I do sometimes feel a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Is that something I should be worried about? It doesn't happen often, but… it's a bit disconcerting. It's probably nothing, but… you never know, do you?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Dizziness can have a number of causes. It could be something simple like dehydration, or it could be related to your blood pressure. To be on the safe side, I'd like to take your blood pressure now, just to get a baseline reading. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that's perfectly alright. Elena would want me to, I'm sure. She always says I should have things checked. I suppose it’s best to be safe, as she says. You’re very thorough, dear. It’s funny, isn’t it? When you get to my age, everything feels… different. More fragile, perhaps. But you’re very kind, and you make me feel quite reassured.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm. I’m going to inflate the cuff now. Your blood pressure is 110/70, which is within the normal range. That's good. It’s likely the dizziness is just a mild fluctuation, but it’s always best to be aware. I recommend staying well-hydrated, and standing up slowly. If the dizziness becomes more frequent or severe, or if you experience any other symptoms like blurred vision or chest pain, please let me know immediately. Are you experiencing any other symptoms at all, anything you haven’t mentioned yet?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know it’s normal, dear. No, no other symptoms, thank you. Just the dizziness, now and then. And… sometimes my hands get a little shaky, but that’s probably just old age creeping in. It doesn’t bother me much, usually. It’s just… a little inconvenient when I’m trying to pour a cup of tea. Elena worries about everything, you see. She wants me to be as careful as possible. But I’m alright, really. Just a bit… frail, perhaps. But I manage.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hand tremors can be common as we get older, and they're often benign. However, it's always a good idea to monitor them. If they worsen, become more frequent, or interfere with your daily activities, we might consider further evaluation. We are waiting on the results for your blood type and I’ve documented your concerns of dizziness and hand tremors. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, dear. You've explained everything so well. I suppose… I’m just grateful for your kindness and patience. Elena will be so pleased. She worries so much. It’s nice to know there are still kind people in the world. Thank you again, dear. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Darl. We should have your blood type results back any minute now. I’ll let you know as soon as they arrive. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any questions. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
