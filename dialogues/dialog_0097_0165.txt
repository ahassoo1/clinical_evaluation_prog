DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide, please. Look, I ain't got all day, so I'll get straight to it. Been runnin' a fever on and off for… well, a couple weeks now, I guess. It goes away, comes back. It's a pain, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide, that’s perfectly fine. A couple of weeks of on-and-off fever… that is a pain. Can you tell me a little more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts kinda slow, you know? Just feelin' a little warm, then it climbs. Gets up to maybe 101, 102… not super high, but high enough to make me feel lousy. Then it breaks, and I feel okay for a day or two. Then…bam. Back again. I take some Tylenol, usually helps bring it down, but it keeps comin' back, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, 101 to 102 with a pattern of coming and going, and Tylenol helps temporarily. That's good information. Have you noticed anything else happening when the fever comes on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really a lot. I get a little tired, achy. Like a mild flu, maybe. No cough, no sniffles. Just… weak. And thirsty. Really thirsty. Sometimes a bit of a headache, but not always. That's about it, I think. Honestly, Doc, it's just a nuisance. I don't usually bother doctors for little things, but this ain't goin' away.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if it feels like a nuisance. No cough or sniffles is helpful to know. You mentioned feeling thirsty – have you noticed any changes in how much you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question, Doc. I hadn't really thought about it. But… yeah, now that you mention it, I've been goin' to the bathroom more often. Not a huge amount more, but definitely more than usual. Especially when the fever's up. I just figured it was from drinkin' so much water, tryin' to stay cool.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased urination along with the fever and feeling thirsty… that's definitely something we need to explore further. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat what my wife cooks, same as always. She makes good food, can't complain. Maybe a little less hungry when I'm feelin' sick, but nothin' major. I ain’t one to turn down a good plate of arroz con pollo, even when I got a fever. She worries, though. Says I should be eatin' more when I'm sick. Women, right?
DOCTOR: They do worry, that's true. Okay, so appetite mostly unchanged. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any long-term health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin' like that. I been pretty lucky, health-wise. Doc says my cholesterol's a little high, but he just tells me to watch my diet. Which I try to do… when my wife ain’t cookin’. Seriously, though, no diabetes, no heart problems, no nothin'. I go to the doc for check-ups every year or so, and he always says I'm in pretty good shape for my age. Just this fever thing… it's throwin' me off.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve generally been healthy. And yearly check-ups are excellent. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yeah, actually. Back when I was a young man, I broke my collarbone playin' baseball. Had to have surgery to fix it. That was… oh, must be fifty years ago now. Other than that, nothin'. No appendicitis, no nothin' major. It healed up fine, though. Never bothered me since.
DOCTOR: Okay, a collarbone surgery many years ago, no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had high blood pressure, like I said. And my mother… she had some arthritis in her knees when she got older. But other than that, not really. No cancer, no heart disease, no nothin' too serious that I know of. We don't really talk about medical stuff much in my family, to be honest. My wife's side, I don't know a whole lot about. We didn't meet 'til we were older.
DOCTOR: Okay, some high blood pressure in your father and arthritis in your mother. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife doesn’t allow it in the house. And I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on a special occasion, but that's about it. No drugs, no nothin'. I'm a pretty straight-laced fella, Doc. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp, but my wife says that’s just a preference, not an allergy. Other than that, I ain't had any problems with any medicine the doc's ever given me. I take a multivitamin every day, but that's it. So, no allergies. I think that's everything, right? Can we get this figured out? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe that is everything, Clide. Thank you for being so thorough. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some possible causes and a plan of action. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doc. Let's get it over with. I appreciate you not keepin' me all day. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got a lawn to mow, and my wife’s expectin' me to fix the leaky faucet. A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Clide. I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just hop up on the table for me, we'll start with your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs and take a look at your throat and ears. It shouldn’t take long. Let's start with your temperature.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here we go. Just try not to poke too much, Doc. I'm a sensitive man, you know.
DOCTOR: 101.3 Fahrenheit. Alright, a little elevated, which confirms what you've been telling me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Throat is clear, no significant redness or swelling. Ear canals are clear, tympanic membranes are normal in appearance. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Alright, Clide. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. No signs of any serious infection or inflammation. Your vital signs are consistent with a mild fever, and your lungs and heart sound good. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, a few things could be going on. It could be a viral infection – a common cold or the flu, even though you don’t have a cough. It could also be a urinary tract infection, given the increased urination. Or, less likely, it could be something else. Given your age and history, we should rule out a UTI first. I'd like to order a urinalysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A urinalysis, huh? Sounds… unpleasant, but alright. If it gets me home faster, I’m game. So, just gotta pee in a cup? My wife's always tellin' me I drink too much anyway. Is it gonna be a long wait for the results? I really got things to do, Doc. You know, a man's gotta keep busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a sample in a cup, Clide. And your wife is right, it's good to stay hydrated! We have a private bathroom right down the hall. I'll give you a cup and instructions. The lab is very efficient; usually, we have results back within an hour or two. We can go over them together then and decide on a plan. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids and take Tylenol for the fever if needed. While you’re waiting for the lab results, I'm going to quickly check your electronic health record for any recent tests or medications, just to be thorough. One moment.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. An hour or two... I can manage that. Just… try not to keep me waitin' too long, okay? My back ain't what it used to be, you know. Bathroom, right? Lead the way, Doc. And thanks for not makin' me feel like an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Clide. We'll get this figured out. Here's the bathroom. Everything you need is inside. Just collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-stream into the cup. And please, don’t hesitate to call me if you have any questions or need assistance. I’ll be right outside when you’re finished. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Mid-stream, you say? Sounds… complicated. But I'll manage. Don't worry, Doc, I'm a grown man. I know how to use a bathroom. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide?
