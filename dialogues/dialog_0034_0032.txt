DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Seil, you say? A… rather unusual name, isn’t it? But never mind that. I suppose… well, it's a delicate matter, really. A most unpleasant development, if I may be frank. Something… leaking. Down there. It's been going on for a few days now, and my wife, bless her heart, insisted I come in. I haven’t the foggiest idea why it would be happening at my age, frankly. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. It is often uncomfortable to discuss these types of issues, and it's good of you to come in to get it checked out. It’s not uncommon for men to experience changes as they get older, and we can certainly figure out what’s going on. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe this leakage a little more?
PATIENT: Leakage… yes. Well, it’s not a flood, you understand. More of a… a dampness. A persistent dampness. And… there’s a certain… odor. Not particularly pleasant, I assure you. It’s clear, I believe. Or perhaps… slightly cloudy? It's difficult to say with certainty. I haven't examined it closely, naturally. My wife noticed it first, while… changing the linens, she said. It’s certainly troubling. I’ve not had anything like this before. And I assure you, Doctor, I’ve led a very… regular life. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, I understand. A clear or slightly cloudy discharge with an odor. And it's new for you. That's helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, no pain, thankfully. Not a twinge. And no… burning sensation. I haven’t noticed any swelling, either. It's just… this persistent dampness. I have felt a bit… fatigued lately, perhaps. But at my age, one is always a bit fatigued, wouldn't you agree? And… my appetite hasn’t been quite what it usually is. But again, that could be… well, anything. I suppose I’m just a bit… run down. Is that… is that relevant, Doctor? Honestly, I’m not certain what is relevant. It's all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, that’s all very relevant. No pain, no burning, no swelling – that’s good. And the fatigue and decreased appetite are things we should consider. Now, to get a more complete picture of your health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s a bit of a… sprawl, I’m afraid. I’ve lived a long life, you see. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, back in… oh, the 1970s, I believe. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Other than that… well, the usual aches and pains, of course. I've always been quite regular in my… bowel movements, if you don't mind me being so blunt. And my wife keeps a close watch on my blood pressure. It’s usually… satisfactory. I have Medicare, if that’s of any consequence. I don’t recall any… serious illnesses. I’ve always been a rather… robust fellow. Do you need specifics, Doctor? I'm not certain I can recall them all at this point. It was… some time ago.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Krok. Pneumonia and appendectomy – I see those listed here. And it's good to know your wife monitors your blood pressure. I’m reviewing your records now, and I see some readings from the past few years. Now, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, let me think. I take something for my blood pressure, of course. A small white pill. I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Or perhaps Losartan? One of those ‘-oprils’, anyway. And I take a daily aspirin, to keep things… flowing. My wife handles all the pills, you see. She's very organized. Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been able to tolerate most things. Except… well, I find shellfish rather disagreeable. But that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. I don’t believe I’ve ever had a proper allergic reaction. No hives, no swelling, nothing of the sort. Are you looking for anything specific, Doctor? It’s just… trying to recall all of this is a bit taxing.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Krok. Lisinopril or Losartan and a daily aspirin. And no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing this leakage, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Well, I suppose it’s inevitable, isn't it? It's not a particularly… pleasant prospect, I must say. But if it’s necessary… yes, I suppose so. I trust you’ll be… discreet? And efficient? I haven’t… well, I haven’t had one of these in quite some time. It's been decades, I should imagine. Do you need me to… undress completely? My wife insisted I wear my best trousers. They're rather comfortable, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you I will be as discreet and efficient as possible. You do not need to undress completely. Just lowering your trousers and underwear is sufficient for the examination. I will explain each step before I perform it. I’ll need to examine your abdomen and the genital area to assess the situation. I will also listen to your heart and lungs as a standard part of the exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Abdomen… genital area… yes. Well, it sounds… thorough, I suppose. Though not terribly appealing. Listening to my heart and lungs… that seems… reasonable. I suppose that's standard procedure. My wife always says I have a strong heartbeat. A very regular rhythm, she claims. Very reassuring, she finds it. But the… other part… well, let's get it over with quickly, shall we? I do have a lunch appointment with some friends after this. It's a monthly bridge game. I wouldn’t want to be late. And please… be gentle? This isn’t something I’m particularly looking forward to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I understand this is not comfortable, and we’ll proceed at your pace. If you could lie down on the examination table, please. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds strong and regular, as your wife mentioned. Lungs are clear. Now, if you're ready, we can proceed with the abdominal and genital examination. I’ll let you know each step before I do it.
PATIENT: Very well. A strong heartbeat… good to know. The lungs, too. It’s… comforting to hear. Though it doesn't address the… issue at hand, does it? Proceed when you're ready, Doctor. I suppose there’s no avoiding it. Just… please be quick about it. And… try not to make too much… fuss. This is all rather… undignified. And do let me know if you discover anything… alarming. Though I’d rather not dwell on the possibilities. Just… get on with it, shall we? I’m trusting you to be professional, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. I'm gently pressing on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: A little… a little pressure, yes. Not pain, precisely. More of a… fullness. A slight… ache, perhaps. It’s… difficult to describe. It’s not like a sharp pain, you understand. Just… a discomfort. Lower down, on the… right side. It's been like that for a few days now, actually. I hadn't paid much attention to it. I assumed it was… indigestion. Or something of that sort. But… it persists, doesn’t it? And now… the leakage. It's all rather unsettling. Please… be careful. I haven’t had anyone touch this area in… well, a very long time.
DOCTOR: I see. Tenderness on the lower right side. And you haven’t noticed any pain radiating to your back or flank?
PATIENT: No, no radiating pain. Just… that discomfort. Lower down. And the… dampness. It’s… difficult to explain the sensation. It's not a gushing, you understand. More of a… persistent trickle. I noticed it first on my undergarments. My wife, bless her heart, brought it to my attention. She's very observant, you see. Always has been. And… a slight odor. Not particularly pleasant, I assure you. It's… a rather delicate matter, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I'm not a young man anymore, you see. And I'd rather not… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. I've completed the examination. I see a clear, slightly cloudy discharge. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be a urinary tract infection, prostatitis, or urethritis. It's also possible, though less likely at your age, that it's related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, or an enlarged prostate. To determine the exact cause, I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen test to assess your prostate health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urinalysis… PSA test… Good heavens. It sounds… complicated. And rather… invasive. But… if it's necessary, I suppose so. I trust these tests aren't too… unpleasant? My wife, bless her heart, always handles the arrangements for these things. She's very good at dealing with doctors and… procedures. But… an enlarged prostate, you say? Is that… serious? Is it… common at my age? I do have a bit of trouble… emptying my bladder sometimes. Just a bit. But… an enlarged prostate. That doesn't sound particularly encouraging. Very well. Order the tests. Let's get it over with. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. And… please, Doctor, try to keep it as brief and painless as possible. I have a bridge game to get to, you see. A monthly affair. I wouldn't want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. The tests are relatively straightforward. The urinalysis is a simple urine sample, and the PSA test is a blood draw. Both are fairly quick and common procedures. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is very common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it can cause some of the symptoms you're experiencing, like difficulty emptying your bladder. The tests will help us determine if that's the cause and guide our treatment plan. I’ll write the orders for the lab now. The lab technician will explain the process when you go. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, Doctor. As much as I want to ask, I’m not certain I’d understand the answers. My wife always handles the specifics. She’s very… scientifically inclined, you see. Just… please, Doctor, try not to alarm me with the results. I’m not a young man anymore, you see. And I’ve lived a long, full life. I wouldn't want to… well, you understand. Very well. Order the tests. Let’s get it over with. And… thank you, Doctor. For your… discretion. And your… patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go and await the results. And perhaps… have a cup of tea. A strong cup of tea. It always helps to calm the nerves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand completely. I will ensure you receive the results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss them in detail. I’ll also have the nurse provide you with instructions on how to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And yes, a strong cup of tea is an excellent idea. Take care, Mr. Krok.
