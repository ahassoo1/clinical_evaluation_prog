DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Though everyone just calls me Arbie. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, honestly. Waste of time, most of ‘em. But… well, I saw something in the, uh, commode this morning that didn’t sit right. Blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fella wonder. It was in my stool.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if you don't usually. Seeing blood in your stool is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know? It was… red. Obviously. Not black or anything. Just… red. Like it usually is, I suppose. And… I don't know… mixed in with everything else. Not just… sitting on top, if you catch my drift. And it wasn’t a gushing thing, understand? Just… streaks. I’ve always had a strong constitution. Never been one to faint at the sight of a little thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Red blood mixed in with the stool, streaks rather than a large amount, and not on top of the stool. That suggests the bleeding is likely coming from lower in the digestive tract, like the colon or rectum. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little strain sometimes, you know, getting older. But not pain, no. And no burning, or anything like that. Look, I fly planes, alright? I've had worse discomfort in the cockpit. This is… a minor inconvenience. Though, I suppose you doctors get all worked up over everything.
DOCTOR: I understand it might seem like a minor inconvenience, Arbie, and I appreciate you telling me it wasn’t painful. However, any bleeding from the digestive tract needs to be evaluated. You mentioned flying planes - that’s wonderful! Do you do a lot of traveling?
PATIENT: Traveling? Used to. A lot. Now… not so much. Mostly local hops. Cargo runs. Back and forth to Ketchikan. The young fellas do most of the long-haul stuff these days. More interested in fancy gadgets than proper navigation, if you ask me. And they wouldn’t know a proper radial if it hit ‘em in the face. But that’s neither here nor there. What’s this have to do with… the situation? You gonna poke around in there or what?
DOCTOR: I just ask about the traveling because changes in diet or routine can sometimes contribute to digestive issues. And yes, I am going to need to do a physical exam, Arbie. It will involve checking your abdomen and, if you’re comfortable, a rectal exam. It’s the best way to get a better understanding of what might be causing the bleeding. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Honestly. At my age, I’ve had more invasive inspections of my aircraft than… Look, I suppose you have to do what you have to do. Though I expect a full explanation afterwards. And don't go poking around too much. My backside isn’t as sturdy as it used to be. And I expect you've washed your hands, haven't you? Don’t want any of those germs getting around.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. I understand your concerns completely, and I assure you I've washed my hands thoroughly. We'll proceed as gently as possible. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, let's get you lying on your side. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then gently press on different areas to check for tenderness. After that, we’ll do the rectal exam. It will only take a few moments. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I used to get a bit of hay fever when I was a boy, but that was decades ago. Mostly just annoyed me. And I can't abide shellfish. Makes me itch something fierce. But other than that… no. Now, get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. And please, be careful. I've got a flight to catch later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the shellfish. No hay fever or other allergies to worry about, then. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a thing. Feels like… well, feels like an old bag. A bit saggy, if you want the truth. You poking around up there? Feels a little… proddy. But no pain. Honestly, I’ve had worse jostling around in turbulence. Keep going, I suppose. Get it over with. This is all a waste of perfectly good flying time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness noted. Now, I am going to proceed with the rectal exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort, even if it’s mild. I’ll use lubricant and be as gentle as possible. I'm just going to ask you to bend your knees and take a few deep breaths. This will help relax everything.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry it up. And try not to be too rough. I’ve got things to do, you know. And for goodness sake, don’t say anything. Just get it over with. This is undignified. Absolutely undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie. That’s all done. I did not feel any obvious masses, and there was no active bleeding at the time of the exam. However, I did note some mild tenderness in the lower rectum, and a small amount of old blood on the glove. It’s likely this is related to what you saw in the commode this morning.
PATIENT: Old blood, you say? Mild tenderness? That's not exactly reassuring, is it? So, what does that mean? Is it something serious? Am I going to have to get… poked around even more? Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming in here. You doctors always make a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Arbie. You're right to ask questions, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. The mild tenderness and presence of old blood suggests there's some irritation or inflammation in the lower rectum. While it’s not necessarily serious, it does require further investigation to rule out more significant causes. The most common causes could be things like hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or diverticulitis. Less common, but important to rule out, are conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or, very rarely, colon cancer. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a colonoscopy. It’s the best way to visualize the entire colon and identify any potential issues. It will involve a thorough cleaning of your bowels beforehand, and a mild sedative during the procedure.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you’re talking. More poking and prodding? And cleaning out my bowels? Sounds delightful. Honestly. What’s the point of living if you can’t have a bit of peace and quiet? I suppose you have to do what you have to do. But it better not interfere with my flying schedule. I’ve got a cargo run to Ketchikan next week, and Old Man Hemlock is relying on me. And what about this sedative? Will I be… out of it? Will I be able to fly afterwards?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Arbie. It's not the most pleasant procedure, I agree. But it’s the most effective way to get a definitive diagnosis and ensure your health. Regarding your flying schedule, we can certainly work around it. The procedure itself takes about 30-60 minutes, and you’ll need a day for bowel preparation and another day for recovery. We can schedule it to minimize disruption. As for the sedative, it’s a mild one, usually just enough to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure. You’ll likely feel groggy afterwards, and you absolutely will not be able to fly or operate machinery for 24 hours following the colonoscopy. It’s crucial for your safety and the safety of others. We can provide you with a note for your employer explaining the restrictions.
PATIENT: Alright. 24 hours, you say? Fine. I suppose I can manage that. Old Man Hemlock will grumble, but he’ll understand. He’s a reasonable fellow, most of the time. And a note? Yes, a note is absolutely essential. I’m not explaining this to him without a doctor’s orders. So, what’s involved in this “bowel preparation”? Don’t tell me I have to drink gallons of something foul-tasting. I’ve got a sensitive stomach, you know. And what about… the cost? I’m retired, you see. Not exactly rolling in dough.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the bowel preparation and the cost, Arbie. Let’s address those one at a time. The bowel preparation does involve drinking a special liquid solution, but it's not as unpleasant as it used to be. There are different options available, some with flavors, and we can choose one that you might tolerate better. It’s about 8-10 glasses over several hours, and it’s essential to stay hydrated. We’ll provide detailed instructions and tips to make it easier. Regarding the cost, a colonoscopy can be expensive. However, we have a financial counselor who can help you explore payment options and potential assistance programs. We'll also check with your insurance, even though you mentioned being uninsured, to see if there are any options available. We want to make sure cost isn’t a barrier to getting the care you need. Would you like me to schedule a consultation with the financial counselor?
PATIENT: A financial counselor… honestly. This is getting ridiculous. But… alright. I suppose it’s worth a shot. Can’t hurt to ask, I suppose. And yes, schedule that consultation. The sooner this is all sorted, the better. And make sure they understand I’ve got a flight to catch. This whole thing better not interfere with my flying. And… what if they find something? What if it’s… serious? Don’t sugarcoat it, I want the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. I've scheduled a consultation with our financial counselor for next week. They’ll be able to go over the costs and explore your options in detail. Now, regarding your question about what if something is found… it's important to be prepared, but also to remember that most of the time, colonoscopies reveal benign findings, like polyps. Polyps are growths that are often harmless, but they can sometimes develop into cancer over time. If polyps are found, they can be removed during the colonoscopy, and we can monitor you closely. If something more serious is found, we’ll discuss all your options, which may include further testing, medication, or, in some cases, surgery. We have a team of excellent specialists here, and we’ll work together to create a personalized treatment plan that’s right for you. I want you to know that we’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll answer all your questions, address your concerns, and provide you with the best possible care. Before we finish, do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s everything. Honestly, it’s a lot to take in. A financial counselor, bowel preparation, polyps… It’s all a bit overwhelming. I suppose… I suppose I’ll see you next week then. And try not to keep me waiting. I’ve got a schedule to keep, you know. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. I understand it’s a lot to take in, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We’ll do our best to make the process as smooth as possible. I'll see you next week, and I assure you, I won’t keep you waiting. Here’s a card with my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and safe flying.
