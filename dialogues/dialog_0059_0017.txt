DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Chagaris, you say? Hmm. Yes, well... it's about this tryout. For the... the team. You know, the sports. I need the… the check-up. For that. It's… required. I think. Something about making sure I don't… fall apart. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A pre-participation physical is very important, and quite common. It’s good you’re taking the necessary steps. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the team you're trying out for?
PATIENT: Team? Oh. Right. The… the Wildcats. Yes, that’s it. Wildcats. It’s… baseball. I think. It's been a while. Lots of running and… throwing. Mostly throwing, I remember. It’s… for older folks. A league. Not the… the big league. Don't get your hopes up. It's just… something to do. Keeps me… moving.
DOCTOR: That sounds wonderful, Mr. Bartok. It’s excellent that you’re staying active. Just to be thorough, have you played baseball regularly in the past, or is this a return to the sport after some time off?
PATIENT: Regularly? Hmm. That’s a good question. Back in… the day. Yes. Played a lot. High school, mostly. And… some after that. Not… organized, you understand. Just with friends. Pick-up games. A long time ago though. Very long. I… I don’t even remember all the details. It’s all a bit fuzzy. But I was… good. I think. I was always pretty quick. Still am, probably. Though my knees… they make noises now. A lot of noises.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And you mentioned your knees making noises. Are those noises associated with any pain, swelling, or limitations in your range of motion?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Not all the time. It's a… dull ache. Mostly after… well, after I move. After running, or bending. It's not… sharp. Just… annoying. Swelling… I don't usually notice. And limitations… I can still get around. I walk the dog every day. A little poodle. Very energetic. But sometimes… getting up from a chair takes a little… effort. You understand. It's just… old age. It creaks. Everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. It’s quite common to experience some creakiness with age and activity. To get a clearer picture, could you rate that dull ache on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. That’s… specific. Let me think. On a good day… maybe a two? A three, if I’ve been really going at it. If I’ve been chasing that poodle… a four. Sometimes. But usually, it’s just… there. A background noise. I don’t… focus on it. It’s hard to put a number on it, Doctor. It's not… debilitating. It just… is. Is a three a good answer? I’m not good with numbers.
DOCTOR: A three is a perfectly good answer, Mr. Bartok. Thank you for clarifying. And it’s helpful to know it’s not debilitating. Now, outside of your knees, have you been experiencing any other pain or discomfort anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My shoulder, sometimes. The left one. It gets… stiff. Mostly in the mornings. I used to sleep on it… wrong, I think. But it usually works itself out. A little massage… that helps. And… my back. Lower back. It aches after… gardening. I like to garden. Tomatoes, mostly. But no… nothing major. Just… the usual aches and pains. Old man stuff. Nothing to… worry about, I don’t think. Do you worry about these things, Doctor? You seem very young.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Bartok. It’s my job to worry about these things, so you don’t have to! And a little gardening and some aches and pains are very common. Just to be thorough, do you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling… weakness… hmm. Not… recently. I think. Sometimes… my fingers get a little cold. Especially in the winter. But that's just the cold, I assume. Weakness… no. I can still lift things. I lift bags of… potting soil. For the tomatoes. Though it takes a little… effort. And sometimes… my feet feel a little… heavy. But that’s after walking the poodle. A very energetic poodle. He pulls. A lot. No… I don't think I'm weak. I'm… sturdy. That's the word. Sturdy.
DOCTOR: “Sturdy” is a good word, Mr. Bartok. Alright, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re currently being treated for, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? Diabetes? Heart… disease? Hmm. The doctor… a long time ago… said something about my cholesterol. Being… high. And… I think I had a little… trouble with my heart. A little… flutter. But it went away. They gave me some… pills. For a while. I stopped taking them. They made me… sleepy. And the doctor… he moved away. Yes. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. It’s… a waste of time, usually. Just tell you to… stop eating good food. And exercise. Which I do. Walking the poodle. A very energetic poodle. So… I don’t think I have anything… serious. Just… old age. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: While “old age” isn’t a medical condition in itself, it does increase the likelihood of certain things happening. And it’s good you’re already staying active with your walks. Let’s just clarify a few things. Do you remember what the doctor said about your cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: Cholesterol… hmm. Numbers? No. I don’t remember numbers. He said… high. Very high. And he… frowned. Yes. He frowned a lot. And he talked about… fat. Stopping eating fat. And… eggs. I like eggs. Scrambled. With… bacon. He didn’t like that. He said… something about my arteries. Getting… clogged. But I don't… understand what that means. It sounded… unpleasant. So I stopped going to that doctor. He was… negative. Always frowning. Is frowning bad for your health, Doctor? You don’t frown. That’s good.
DOCTOR: Frowning isn’t ideal, no. But more importantly, it sounds like you were told you had high cholesterol. And you’re right, that can be unpleasant. We should definitely check your cholesterol levels today to see where things stand. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… my tonsils, when I was a kid. That was… unpleasant. Very sore throat. And… my appendix. A long time ago. They took it out. Something about… bursting. But that was… a long time ago. And… I broke my arm, when I was… playing baseball. Yes. That was… a long time ago. Lots of running and… throwing. And I was in the hospital… for a few days. But that was… a long time ago. So… tonsils, appendix, broken arm. That’s it, I think. A long time ago. Mostly… old age. Is old age a surgery? It feels like one sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, old age isn’t a surgery, though I understand the feeling! Alright, so tonsils, appendix, and a broken arm. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think… Sometimes I take something for… my knees. When they really bother me. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think. The white pills. Over-the-counter. And… sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take something. A little blue pill. But not… often. And… I used to take something for… cholesterol. But I stopped. The doctor… moved away. And… sometimes, I take a vitamin. For… energy. But I forget. Mostly, I just… walk the poodle. He gives me energy. A very energetic poodle. So… Ibuprofen, a blue pill sometimes, and a vitamin sometimes. That’s it, I think. Mostly old age. Is old age a medication? It feels like one sometimes. Makes you… creaky.
DOCTOR: No, old age isn’t a medication, but I appreciate your sense of humor. Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for your knees, a blue pill occasionally for sleep, and a vitamin sometimes. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think… I used to get… itchy. When I was a kid. From… poison ivy. In the woods. But that was… a long time ago. And… I think I got a rash. From something. But I don’t remember what. And… I think I got… sneezy. From… pollen. In the spring. But that was… a long time ago. So… poison ivy, a rash sometimes, and pollen sometimes. But nothing… serious. Just… itchy and sneezy. Mostly old age. Is old age an allergy? It feels like one sometimes. Makes you… sensitive.
DOCTOR: No, old age isn’t an allergy, but I understand the feeling. Alright, so some minor reactions to poison ivy, a rash occasionally, and pollen in the spring. Nothing life-threatening, which is good. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… difficult. My family… they’re… scattered. Mostly in… Puerto Rico. I haven't seen them in… a long time. My mother… she… died. When I was young. Something with… her heart. I think. And my father… he… smoked. A lot. And he… drank. A lot. I think he… died. From… something with his liver. And my sister… she… had… something with her stomach. I don't… remember the details. It was… a long time ago. So… heart trouble, smoking, drinking, and something with the stomach. Mostly… sad. It was… a long time ago. I don’t… remember the details. Is sad a medical condition, Doctor? It feels like one sometimes. Mostly old age.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a difficult family history, and I’m sorry for your losses. And while sadness isn’t a medical condition in itself, it can certainly affect your health. Knowing about these conditions is helpful, though. So, heart trouble, smoking-related illness, a stomach condition, and a history of drinking. Now, lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. What does that mean? I… used to be married. But we… divorced. A long time ago. No children. I… live alone. I walk the poodle. He’s… my companion. I… don’t really have… friends. Not close friends. I… used to work construction. But I… retired. Now I… mostly garden. And walk the poodle. A very energetic poodle. And… watch television. Mostly… old movies. And… I drink… sometimes. A little… wine. With dinner. So… divorced, alone, retired, garden, poodle, wine. That’s… pretty much it. Is that social enough, Doctor? It feels… quiet. Mostly old age.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you’ve created a comfortable and peaceful life for yourself. And it’s wonderful you have your poodle as a companion. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… fine. A physical… exam? What does that involve? I hope it doesn’t involve… poking. I don’t like poking. And… needles. I really don’t like needles. I’m… a little… squeamish. Is that a word? Squeamish? Mostly old age. And… poking. Is there… a lot of poking?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Bartok. We’ll take it slow and gentle. And I’ll certainly be mindful of your concerns about poking and needles. We’ll start with just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and looking in your ears and throat. We can discuss blood work later if it seems necessary. It won’t involve anything drastic. First, let’s just sit up straight and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Deep breaths… yes. My chest… feels a little tight. Is that normal? I don’t… breathe very well anymore. Mostly old age. And… this poking. Is this what it feels like to be poked? Is it over yet? It feels… strange. And… cold. Mostly old age.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds a little wheezy, which could be from a number of things. We’ll look into that further if needed. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that could be from a little anxiety with the exam. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. This will feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 140 over 90. That’s a little elevated, but not critically high. Now, let’s take a look in your ears.
PATIENT: Cold… yes. Very cold. Is it over yet? My ear… feels ticklish. And… strange. I don't… like things in my ear. It feels… intrusive. Is that a word? Intrusive? And… what did you see? Is there… something in there? Mostly old age. And… cold things in my ears. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear in your ears, thankfully. Just a little bit of wax, which is perfectly normal. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your throat. Say "Ah" for me. Everything looks good in your throat as well. A little redness, but nothing concerning. Now, I'd like to quickly listen to your abdomen. This will just tell me if everything sounds normal.
PATIENT: Ah… yes. It’s… ticklish. And… uncomfortable. And… cold. Is it over yet? My throat… feels sensitive. And… my stomach… is rumbling. Mostly old age. And… poking. And… cold things in my throat. And… a rumbling stomach. Is that normal? Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: A little rumbling is perfectly normal, especially if you haven’t eaten recently. Everything sounds normal in your abdomen as well. Okay, that completes the quick physical exam. We’ve listened to your heart and lungs, checked your blood pressure, and looked in your ears and throat. Based on this initial exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your breathing sounds a little wheezy. Given your family history and social history, I recommend we do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Oh. That means… needles. Doesn’t it? I… really don’t like needles. I’m… a little… squeamish. You said something about… needles. Is it… a lot of needles? And… will it hurt? I don't… handle pain very well. Is there… another way? To check these things? Without… poking? Mostly old age. And… needles. I really, really don’t like needles. Is it over yet?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Bartok, and I want to assure you we’ll make it as comfortable as possible. It’s not a lot of needles, just a few vials of blood. And the discomfort is usually very brief, a quick pinch. We have techniques to minimize the pain – a numbing cream if you'd like, and a skilled phlebotomist who is very gentle. Unfortunately, blood work is the most accurate way to check your cholesterol levels and kidney function. Without it, it’s difficult to get a clear picture of your overall health. However, we can start with just a few tests to begin with. We can also discuss alternative options, such as monitoring your blood pressure at home, but that won’t give us all the information we need. Would you like to discuss the specific tests we’d be doing, and I can explain why each one is important?
PATIENT: Tests…? Specific tests…? Oh. That sounds… complicated. I don’t… understand all these medical things. Cholesterol… kidney function… What do those even mean? I just want to… play baseball. Is that too much to ask? Will the tests… hurt? And… will they take a long time? I have… things to do. Mostly old age. And… tests. And… needles. I really, really don’t like needles. Is there… a simpler way? To just… check if I’m okay to play baseball?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bartok. It can be overwhelming with all the medical terminology. Let me explain it in simpler terms. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood. High cholesterol can increase your risk of heart problems, which is why we want to check it. Kidney function tells us how well your kidneys are working, which is important for overall health. As for playing baseball, these tests will help us make sure you’re healthy enough to participate without any risks. It’s a precaution to ensure your safety. The tests themselves don’t take long – usually just a few minutes. The whole process, including filling out paperwork and waiting for the results, might take about an hour. We can start with just a basic blood panel, which includes cholesterol and kidney function. If everything looks good, you’re likely good to go. If there are any concerns, we can discuss further steps. Would you be willing to try just the basic blood panel?
PATIENT: An hour…? And… needles…? Even just a few? Oh. Is there… anything I get out of this? Besides… knowing if I can play baseball? Will it… make me feel better? Or… stronger? I just want to… enjoy my life. And… play baseball. I… I don’t know. This sounds… stressful. Mostly old age. And… tests. And… needles. I really, really don’t like needles. Maybe… maybe I should just forget about the baseball. It’s probably… too much trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Bartok. It's perfectly valid to feel overwhelmed and stressed. You're right, it's a lot to go through, and it's okay to prioritize your comfort and peace of mind. If you're not comfortable with the blood work at this time, we can absolutely proceed without it. However, it will be difficult to assess your overall health and ensure your safety without some basic information. If you're willing, we could start with a thorough physical exam and discuss your symptoms in detail. We can also monitor your blood pressure at home for a week to get a better understanding of your levels. If your blood pressure is consistently high, we can discuss medication options or lifestyle changes. Ultimately, the decision is up to you. I want to make sure you feel comfortable and empowered to make the best choice for your health. What feels right for you at this moment?
PATIENT: Monitor my blood pressure…? At home…? That… sounds… less stressful. No needles… at least not right away. I… I can do that. I think. I have… a blood pressure cuff. My wife… used to have one. It’s… somewhere. And… no other tests? Right now? Just… monitor my blood pressure? And… see how it goes? That… sounds okay. Okay. I… I can do that. Just… monitor my blood pressure. And… see how it goes. Maybe… maybe that’s enough. Mostly old age. And… avoiding needles. That’s a good thing.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bartok. Monitoring your blood pressure at home is a great first step, and I’m glad you feel comfortable with that. It will give us valuable information without the stress of immediate blood work. I'll write down instructions on how to properly measure your blood pressure, including the time of day to take it and how often. It’s important to take it at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you’ve had caffeine or exercise. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review your blood pressure readings. If your levels are consistently high, we can discuss further testing or treatment options. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headaches, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about monitoring your blood pressure or scheduling the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Chest pain…? Shortness of breath…? Oh. That sounds… scary. I… I hope I don’t experience those things. Same time each day…? Before caffeine…? That might be… difficult. I like my coffee. But… I’ll try. I’ll try my best. No… I don’t think I have any questions. Just… monitor my blood pressure. And… see how it goes. That’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For… not making me get a needle. Mostly old age. And… avoiding needles. That’s a good thing. Maybe… maybe I can still play baseball.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. I’m glad we could find a plan that works for you. And don’t worry too much about the chest pain and shortness of breath – it’s just a precaution. And you’re right, avoiding needles is always a good thing! Just remember to monitor your blood pressure consistently, and we’ll discuss the results at our follow-up appointment. In the meantime, focus on enjoying your life and staying active. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Bartok. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I sincerely hope you get to play baseball!
PATIENT: Nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you. For everything. I’ll… try my best. To monitor my blood pressure. And… maybe… play baseball. Bye bye.
