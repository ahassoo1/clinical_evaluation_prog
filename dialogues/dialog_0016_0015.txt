DOCTOR: Hi Mikeisha, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's August 2nd, and I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Yes, well... it's my sinuses. They been... bothering me. Not good. I don't remember exactly when it started, just… a while now. It's a pressure, you see? Mostly here…
DOCTOR: Okay, a while now with sinus pressure. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the pressure a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's not… a sharp pain, exactly. More like... fullness? Like my head is too tight. And sometimes… it feels like something is blocking the air. It makes it hard to breathe through my nose, maybe? I don't really know how to explain it. It just... feels wrong. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fullness and blockage – I understand. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not all the time. Worse when… when I lay down, I think. And maybe when it’s cold? I work outside, you see. With the… the drills. Oil work. It gets dusty. I forget what else makes it worse. It just… happens. Sometimes a little better, sometimes worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse when lying down and potentially with dust exposure from your work. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the pressure and blockage?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Sometimes my face feels a little achy. Like… around my cheeks and forehead, where the pressure is. And… maybe a little tired? But I work long hours, so it's hard to say if that's from the sinuses or just… being tired. I don’t… I don’t think I get a fever. No, not that I know of. Sometimes my throat feels… scratchy? But maybe that’s just the dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, so facial aching with the pressure, some fatigue, and a scratchy throat, possibly related to the dust. Do you have any nasal discharge – is your nose running, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, sometimes. My nose… runs a little. Not a lot. Mostly clear, I think. Sometimes… a little yellow? But not always. It’s hard to tell with all the dust, you see? Everything is dusty. I wipe my nose a lot, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly clear nasal discharge, sometimes a little yellow, and you wipe your nose frequently due to dust. Have you tried anything to relieve the symptoms so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I try to drink a lot of water. And I… sometimes I take a little rest when I can. But… no, I haven’t really taken anything for it. Just… tried to ignore it. It hasn’t been too bad, usually. But it's… been lasting a long time now, that's why I came. I don’t know any medicines for sinuses.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've been trying rest and hydration. I understand it’s been going on for a while, and that's why you decided to come in. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions like allergies, asthma, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. My husband, he usually takes care of things like that. I don’t have… allergies, I don’t think. I can breathe fine, usually. And no… no sugar sickness. I eat too much rice, maybe, but… not sick. I work hard, mostly. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my babies, of course, but… that was a long time ago. No… no surgeries. I don’t think so. And no… no hospital stays. Nothing like that. Just the babies, many years ago. I don’t remember anything bad happening.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, many years ago. But… they lived in El Salvador. It was different there. I don’t… I don’t really know what they had, exactly. It’s hard to remember, and hard to talk about. I haven’t seen them in a long time. They… they aren’t here anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Just water and… sometimes a little rest. My husband, he always says I'm too stubborn. But I don't like medicines. They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve never really taken anything, remember? I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. My skin gets a little itchy in the sun sometimes, but… that's just the sun, I think. Not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information, Mikeisha. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your sinuses for any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? I don’t like things in my ears.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Let’s start with listening to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out… good. Now another one… excellent. Lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your ears. Both ear canals are clear, no signs of infection. Now, I’m going to gently examine your nose. Your nasal passages are a little congested, but no significant polyps or masses. Finally, I'll check your throat. Say "ah" for me. Your throat is a little red, but no signs of significant infection. Palpating your sinuses… There's some tenderness to palpation over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. So, to summarize, your lungs are clear, ears are clear, throat is a little red, and you have tenderness over your frontal and maxillary sinuses. This is consistent with sinusitis.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s where it hurts. So… that’s what it is? Sinusitis? What… what does that mean? Is it bad? Will I need… pills?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, that tenderness confirms my suspicion of sinusitis, which is an inflammation of the sinuses. It’s very common, often caused by a viral infection or allergies, and in your case, it could be related to the dust exposure at work. It’s not usually serious, but it can be quite uncomfortable. And you asked about pills?
PATIENT: Yes… I don't like taking them. But… if I need them, I will. I just… they make me feel strange. And I have to work, you see? I can't be sick. What kind of pills are they? Will they make me sleepy? Will they… hurt my stomach?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. We'll start with the least invasive approach. Fortunately, most cases of sinusitis resolve on their own with supportive care. I’m going to recommend a saline nasal rinse twice a day to help clear the congestion. It’s a gentle way to flush out your sinuses. I’m also going to recommend an over-the-counter decongestant like pseudoephedrine, but you should only take it for a few days, as prolonged use can actually make things worse. If the symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen, we can consider other options, such as a short course of antibiotics. However, we’ll try the nasal rinse and decongestant first. As for your concern about pills making you feel strange, the decongestant can sometimes cause a little bit of jitters or a slightly elevated heart rate, but it shouldn’t be anything major. It can also cause some stomach upset in some people, so take it with food. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Nasal rinse… and… just a few days of pills. Yes, that sounds… better. I can do that. A nasal rinse… is that hard? I don’t want to make a mess. And… where do I get these things? The rinse and the pills? I don’t know where to go.
DOCTOR: No, a nasal rinse isn't hard at all! You can get a squeeze bottle or a neti pot at most pharmacies – Walgreens, CVS, even Walmart. They'll have saline packets too, which you mix with warm water. It takes a little practice, but there are lots of videos online that can show you how. Just be sure to use distilled or sterile water – tap water can sometimes contain bacteria. The decongestant – pseudoephedrine – you'll find that behind the pharmacy counter – you’ll need to ask the pharmacist for it. They may ask for your ID, as it's a controlled substance. I’ll also write down the instructions for both, just so you have them. And if you're unsure about anything, don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: So… the rinse and the pills. And only for a few days. And… the pharmacist will help me with the pills? That’s good. I don’t like asking for things. Just… will I be able to work? That's the most important thing. I need to work. Can I still do my job if I take these things? I can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. The rinse and decongestant should help relieve your symptoms enough that you should be able to continue working. The decongestant can give you a little boost to help you feel more alert, but it’s important to follow the instructions carefully and not take it for longer than recommended. And yes, the pharmacist will be happy to help you with the decongestant. Don’t hesitate to ask them any questions you have. They are a great resource. I'm also going to write you a work note excusing you from heavy lifting for the next week, just in case. It’s better to take it easy and prevent the symptoms from worsening. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse, please call the office, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: A work note… that’s good. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think that’s all. I just need to remember the rinse and the pills. And not to take the pills too long. Thank you for everything. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mikeisha. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day!
