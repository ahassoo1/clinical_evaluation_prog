DOCTOR: Good morning, Aldine. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, feelin’ like a tight band. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, maybe a week now, give or take a day. Not the worst pain ever, but persistent, y’know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A persistent headache can be quite bothersome, even if it’s not severe. A week, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. It comes and goes, but it’s there most of the time. Started kinda slow, just a little ache, but it’s… well, it hasn’t gone away completely. I thought maybe it was the heat, we’ve had some scorchers lately, but it's still there even on cooler days. I been drinkin’ plenty water though, I assure you. Old habits, y’know? Gotta stay hydrated!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’re staying hydrated. Hydration is very important. And it's consistently at the back of your head, like a band?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Right at the base of my skull, kinda wrappin’ around. Not on the sides, not in my forehead... just there. It’s not throbbing, not a sharp pain, more of a… pressure. Like someone's got a tight elastic band squeezin’ my head. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm tryin' to explain it the best I can. It’s a funny feelin’, hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Aldine. A pressure, like a band… I appreciate you describing it so clearly. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific. I’ve been doin’ my usual routine – workin’ at the salon, pottering around the garden, spendin' time with my wife… no change there. Maybe it’s a little worse when I’m bendin’ over, fixin’ somethin’ in the garden, but even then, it’s not a huge difference. It’s just… always there, you know? A constant companion, this headache. It's botherin' me, though. Really botherin' me.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant headache is definitely something we want to investigate. And you said you've been working at the salon… How long have you been doing that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a long time! I’ve been a manicurist and pedicurist for… oh, almost fifty years now, I reckon. Started when I was a young man in Jamaica, and I’ve been at it ever since. It's good work, keeps me busy and I enjoy chatttin’ with people. But all that bendin’ over people’s feet, workin’ with my hands… I wonder if that could have somethin’ to do with it? I never really thought about it before. Maybe the posture?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point, Aldine. Fifty years is a long time, and repetitive movements and posture can definitely contribute to headaches. Let’s do a quick examination, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I'm happy to cooperate any way I can. Just tell me what you need me to do. I'm not afraid of a little exam, long as it doesn't involve anythin' too… drastic! Haha. Old man’s bones, y’know? Not as flexible as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Nothing drastic at all, I promise. Just a quick look at your neck, your reflexes, and a basic neurological check. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. I’m just going to gently feel around your neck, see if there’s any tenderness or tightness.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds sensible. Go ahead when you’re ready. I'll try to stay as still as I can. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you need me to adjust my position or anything. I want to make this as easy as possible for both of us. This old body ain't what it used to be, haha!
DOCTOR: Okay, Aldine, I’m just feeling around your neck. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit. On the left side, you said? Yes, that’s… yeah, that's a bit sensitive. Not excruciating, but I can feel it now that you’re pressin’ there. It’s been feelin’ a little stiff there lately, to be honest, but I just put it down to old age. I tend to carry a bit of tension in my shoulders and neck, y’know? From all the years bendin’ over people’s feet. Oh, there! That’s a bit more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, and I’m just going to check your reflexes now. Could you just let your legs relax?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relaxed, you say? Never had my reflexes checked before, haha! Always busy workin', never much time for doctor's visits. Go ahead when you're ready. Hopefully, they still work after all these years!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything seems… within normal limits, although your reflexes are a little on the slower side, which can be common with age. Your neck range of motion is slightly limited, but nothing too concerning. Now, do you have any vision changes?
PATIENT: Vision changes? Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little bit of difficulty seein’ things up close, but I figured that was just the age catchin’ up with me. I’ve been needin’ to hold things a little further away to read ‘em lately. Nothing drastic, though. Still able to see perfectly fine in the distance, and my color vision seems alright. My wife always complains I pick out the wrong shades of paint, but that’s probably just my bad taste, haha!
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it sounds like your wife might just have better taste in paint! Now, just a few more quick questions. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your arms or hands?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Not at all. My hands are a bit achy sometimes after a long day workin’ on nails, but that’s just from the repetition, I reckon. I’ve been doin’ this for so long, my hands are used to it. They’re strong hands, these. Gotta be, to hold those files and buffers all day. But no numbess, no pins and needles, nothin’ like that. Still got a good grip, thankfully!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Aldine. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by the repetitive nature of your work and the posture you maintain. The mild tenderness in your neck muscles supports that. The slightly diminished reflexes and difficulty with near vision are likely age-related changes. However, to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a few simple blood tests, just to check your vitamin levels and rule out any underlying inflammation.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen and figure things out. Blood tests? No problem at all. I’ve had plenty of those in my time. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. And to be honest, it’s a relief to hear it might just be tension, after all this worryin’. So, what do I need to do about the tests? Do I need to fast beforehand, or anything like that? And will you explain the results to me when they come back?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course I will explain the results to you. For these tests, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, so it's best to schedule them for first thing in the morning. Just water is okay. I'll have the nurse print out a requisition form with instructions for you. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed, and I would suggest trying some simple neck stretches and exercises throughout the day. Also, pay attention to your posture and take frequent breaks while you're working. If the pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a week or so, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can discuss other options. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Fastin’ ain’t no problem, I can manage that. And I’ll try those stretches and exercises, definitely. My wife’s always tellin’ me to sit up straight, so maybe this’ll give me a good excuse to listen to her! Haha. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. And I'll definitely schedule a follow-up if things don’t improve. Thank you very much, Doctor Kamahele. I feel much better now, knowin’ what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aldine. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and go over the instructions with you. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. And listen to your wife!
PATIENT: Haha, I certainly will! Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Have a good day!
