DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… concerning me. I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand your concern. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels…firm, but not particularly painful, usually. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago. At first, I thought it was just something I ate, perhaps, but it hasn’t gone away. It seems…slightly bigger now, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. So, it's been present for about a month, feels firm, not very painful, and you've noticed some growth recently. Where exactly in your lower abdomen is it located?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. It’s…sort of in the middle, a little to the left of my belly button, I think? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Not right on my side, but definitely not centered. I hope that’s not too vague.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. A little to the left of your belly button, not directly centered. And you said it’s firm. About how big would you estimate it is now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… estimating sizes isn't my strong suit. Perhaps… about the size of a plum? Maybe a little bigger than a plum, now that I think about it. It's not huge, but noticeable when I lie down, especially.
DOCTOR: Okay, about the size of a plum, maybe a little larger, and more noticeable when you're lying down. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s been so strange. No pain, no fever, no changes in my…bathroom habits, nothing like that. Just the lump. It’s just… unsettling to have something there that I don’t know about.
DOCTOR: Alright, no associated symptoms like pain, fever, or changes in bowel habits. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I have Medicare, so I do have regular check-ups, but nothing major has ever come up. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. My wife handles most of the paperwork, so I don't always remember specifics, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it does make sense. So, generally healthy, with no known medical conditions. And you have regular check-ups through Medicare. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not a fan of hospitals, if I'm honest. I’ve avoided them as much as possible. Just the usual…wisdom teeth removal when I was young, but that hardly counts, does it? It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: No, wisdom teeth removal wouldn't be considered a major surgery in this context. Okay, good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a tricky one. My mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my father had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing major on my wife’s side, as far as I know. It’s not something we’ve discussed in great detail, to be honest. We aren’t very close to her family. Is that helpful? I’m trying to recall everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. High blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your father. That’s helpful to know. And now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above, Doctor. I don’t smoke, rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and certainly no recreational drugs. I’m a choreographer, so staying healthy is rather important for my work. It requires a lot of physical activity.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So you don’t smoke, rarely drink, and don’t use recreational drugs. That's excellent. And you're a choreographer, which keeps you physically active. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. My wife usually double-checks when I’m prescribed something, just to be safe. She’s very thorough. I think that’s all, Doctor. I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Thank you for providing me with all of that information, Amy. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll need to palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump and check for any other abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to start by gently palpating your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Okay… I can feel a firm mass in your lower abdomen, a little to the left of your belly button, as you described. It's approximately 2-3 centimeters in size. It doesn't appear to be particularly tender to the touch. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness. I’m also listening to your bowel sounds, which are normal. Bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants. I don't feel any other masses or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft overall, with no signs of fluid accumulation. It's difficult to determine the exact nature of the mass without further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn't unpleasant at all. It felt…thorough, if that makes sense. It's good to know it didn't feel immediately alarming to you. What does this mean, Doctor? What sort of further investigation are you thinking of? I’m a little anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Amy, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Based on the exam, it doesn't seem to be anything immediately concerning, but we definitely need to investigate further to determine what it is. The most likely next step would be an abdominal ultrasound. It's a non-invasive imaging test that can provide us with a detailed view of the mass and help us determine if it's a solid mass, a fluid-filled cyst, or something else. It can also help us assess its size and location more accurately. Would you be comfortable with scheduling an ultrasound?
PATIENT: An ultrasound sounds…reasonable. Non-invasive is good. Yes, I’d be comfortable with that, Doctor. When would be possible? And…what happens if it is something more serious? I'm trying not to jump to conclusions, but it’s difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. They'll send the results directly to me. Regarding your question about more serious possibilities… it's important to remember that most abdominal masses are benign, meaning non-cancerous. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as a cyst, a lipoma , or, less commonly, a tumor. If the ultrasound reveals a concerning mass, we may need to perform additional tests, such as a CT scan or a biopsy, to determine its nature and stage. I want to assure you that we'll take a step-by-step approach and will discuss all the findings and options with you thoroughly. We won't jump to any conclusions until we have all the information. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that…that does sound more reassuring, Doctor. Step-by-step is good. 9:00 AM tomorrow is fine. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A CT scan and biopsy…that sounds frightening, but I understand it’s better to know. Thank you. Is there anything I should do before the ultrasound? Anything I need to prepare?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. For the ultrasound tomorrow, there's not much preparation needed. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. The technician may ask you to drink a glass of water before the scan to help visualize the images better. It's also helpful to wear comfortable clothing. The scan itself usually takes about 20-30 minutes. You'll lie on a table, and the technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a transducer over the area. It shouldn't be painful, but you may feel some pressure. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as pain, fever, or nausea, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel…slightly less anxious now, which is a great relief. I’ll see you tomorrow, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ll see you tomorrow at 9:00 AM. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to worry too much.
