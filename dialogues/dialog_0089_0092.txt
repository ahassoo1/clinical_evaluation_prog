DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, morning. Rose...Roseburrough, you say? Well, it’s the…the breathin’. Gets harder, you know? And my mouth…always feels like the desert. Eyes too, feel like sand. Not good. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty breathing and a dry mouth and eyes. That is concerning. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. When did you first start noticing the breathing getting harder?
PATIENT: First…? Oh, jeez. A while. A long while. Maybe…spring? Or was it last winter? Hard to say. Things kinda blur together when you get to be my age, you know? It just…got worse little by little. Didn’t pay it much mind at first. Just figured it was…old age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to develop gradually, and it's easy to dismiss things early on. So, it's been worsening over several months, starting perhaps last winter or spring. Is it worse with any specific activities, like walking, or lying down?
PATIENT: Walking? Everything makes it worse! Even just…bein’. It’s always there, that tightness. But… …lying down…hmm. Maybe a little worse when I try to sleep. Gotta sit up a lot to catch my breath. Old pillows ain't what they used to be, either. Probably that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's pretty constant, but does worsen with exertion and when lying flat. And you’re finding you need to prop yourself up to sleep. That’s helpful to know. Now, you mentioned a dry mouth and eyes. Is that constant as well, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. Like I said, desert in my mouth. And my eyes…feel like sandpaper. Gotta keep drops handy, but they don’t do much good for long. Been using 'em for…oh, I don't know. A good while, now. Like the breathin’, it just…got worse. Never used to be like this. Back in Cuba……different kinda air, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant dry mouth and eyes, requiring drops but with limited relief. And you’ve noticed it’s different than what you experienced back in Cuba. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I’m old! Everything hurts. But… …I get tired. Real tired. Even after a nap. And sometimes…sometimes my ankles swell up. Especially at the end of the day. Doesn't happen every day, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue even after napping, and occasional ankle swelling, particularly at the end of the day. I'm going to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me see…the doctor back home, he said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking 'em. Didn’t feel like I needed 'em. And……oh, and my knees! Both of 'em. Had some work done on 'em. Years and years ago. That’s about it, I think. Mostly just…old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously treated with medication, and knee surgeries in the past. Do you currently take any medications at all?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Like I said, I don’t like takin’ pills. Mess with your insides, you know? I tried some for my arthritis a while back, but they didn’t do nothin’ but make me feel sick. So, I tossed 'em. Just gotta live with the pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Back in my day, we didn’t have fancy allergies. You ate what you could get. Maybe… …maybe some kind of reaction to a shot once, years ago. But I can't remember what shot it was. Just a little rash, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, or just a minor rash to a shot in the past. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart, and take a look at your ankles.
PATIENT: Exam, huh? Fine. But don't go pokin' around too much. I'm an old man, not a science project. Just get it over with. And be gentle!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, taking a listen to your lungs now… I hear some wheezing, and a little crackling in the lower lobes. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit fast. Your ankles do have some swelling, and they’re warm to the touch. Your blood pressure is elevated - 160 over 90. And your pulse is 92.
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? Figures. Everything's elevated when you get to be my age. Crackling, wheezing…what does it all mean? You doctors always got fancy words. Just tell me if I'm gonna die, alright? No need for a whole lotta mumbo jumbo.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Guilds. It doesn’t mean you’re going to die. The wheezing and crackling in your lungs suggest some fluid buildup, which is common with conditions like heart failure or COPD, especially with your history of high blood pressure. The swelling in your ankles also supports that. It also could be a sign of pneumonia, though based on what you've told me so far, heart failure is more likely. Your elevated blood pressure adds to that concern. I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture. We’ll need a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs, and some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a marker called BNP, which can help us assess for heart failure. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests… Always more tests. Fine, alright. Do what you gotta do. But don’t keep me waitin’ all day. And no pokin’ and proddin’, remember? Just get it over with. Chest X-ray, blood work…what else? And what’s this BNP thing? Sounds scary.
DOCTOR: No pokin’ and proddin’, I promise. And you won’t be waiting all day. The nurse will draw the blood now, and we can get the X-ray done right after that. BNP stands for B-type natriuretic peptide. It's a substance your heart releases when it's under stress. It's just a blood test – nothing scary. While we wait for the results, I want you to try to limit your salt intake, and I’d like you to monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. I also want to discuss a possible medication to help lower your blood pressure, but we’ll hold off on that until we have the test results back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Salt…weight…medication… …more rules. Fine, alright. I’ll try to remember the salt and the weight, but don’t expect miracles. And I don’t want any of those fancy pills until you know what’s wrong with me. Just get the tests done, and then we’ll see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. I understand. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available and we’ll discuss them when you come back. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No. Not really. Just…get it over with, alright? I’m tired of sittin’ here. And tell that nurse to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware. I’ll let her know to be gentle. Just relax, and we’ll get through this.
