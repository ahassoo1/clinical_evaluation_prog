DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Sink. Good day to you. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, it is. A bad one. On my foot. It hurts when I walk, especially.
DOCTOR: A sore, yes. On the foot. Right. And how long has this “sore” been…troubling you?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. A long time now. Maybe…three, four months? It started small, I think. Just a little spot. I didn’t pay it much mind at first. Old man things, you know? But it’s gotten bigger. And now it really hurts.
DOCTOR: Three or four months. And bigger… can you describe how much bigger?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say, exactly. Like…a nickel at first, maybe? Now…well, now it's more like a quarter, I think. Maybe a little bigger. Roundish. And it's…deep. Not just on the skin, you see. It's a hole, almost. It worries me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A quarter-sized…hole. Right. And is there any discharge from this…area?
PATIENT: Discharge? Oh…yes, I think so. Sometimes. It’s…not much. A little wetness, I guess. Mostly when I take my shoe off at night. It’s…clearish. Not much color to it. And sometimes…a little smell. Not a good smell. Sorry to say. Is that bad, Doctor? I get confused with these things.
DOCTOR: “Not a good smell” and discharge…yes, that is concerning. Have you noticed any redness around the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Redness, definitely. It’s…around the edges. And sometimes the skin feels…warm. Not feverish, but…warmer than the rest of my foot. I try to keep it clean, Doctor. Wash it with soap and water. But it doesn’t seem to help much. Is this…serious? I’ve heard things about feet, you know. Old people and feet.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll take a look. I need to examine your foot. Please, sit up and let me have a look. Have you had diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor told me years ago. A long time ago. I take my pills every day. Keep the sugar down, he says. But sometimes…it’s hard. I like a little sweet with my tea. Is that what this is about, Doctor? The sugar?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Diabetes can certainly cause problems with the feet. Let’s have a look. Could you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. Right on the bottom. When I put weight on it, it’s a sharp pain. And even when I'm not walking, sometimes it just aches. It’s…constant, really. Just a dull ache. It keeps me from my garden, you know. I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some redness and…discharge. And it’s warm to the touch. I also see some surrounding skin breakdown. It appears to be a fairly deep wound. “Patient presents with a deep, draining wound on the plantar surface of the right foot, associated with erythema, warmth, and surrounding skin breakdown. Patient reports history of diabetes.” I’m going to need to get a culture of this wound to determine the best course of treatment. And we should check your blood sugar to make sure it’s well-controlled.
PATIENT: A culture? Oh dear. Sounds…serious. And blood sugar? I took it this morning, Doctor. It was…a little high. Maybe 180? I don’t remember exactly. I wrote it down somewhere. I will find it, if you wish. It’s just…things get lost these days. Is this going to be expensive, Doctor? I’m on Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: We’ll worry about the paperwork later. Right now, we need to address this infection. I’m going to order a wound culture, as I mentioned, and a comprehensive blood workup, including your A1c, to get a better picture of your long-term sugar control. I’m also going to order an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. Not that I know of. The doctor gave me some for my water infection, years ago, and I didn’t have any trouble. But…what’s an antibiotic? Is that for the infection? Will I have to take pills? I don’t like taking too many pills, Doctor. They make my stomach upset.
DOCTOR: An antibiotic is a medication that fights the infection, Mr. Stoegbauer. Yes, you would likely need to take pills, or possibly receive intravenous antibiotics if the infection is severe. We will start with oral antibiotics and monitor your response. First, we need to identify what is causing the infection. That's what the culture is for. Now, I’m going to send you to the lab for the culture and blood work. And I will have the nurse draw some blood here as well. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh…a lab. And the nurse. Yes, I understand. Pills and a lab and the nurse. Will it hurt, Doctor? The lab, I mean. And the pills…will they make me sick? I don't want to be sick. I just want my foot to feel better so I can get back to my garden. Is there anything…anything I can do now to help it? Some ointment, maybe?
DOCTOR: The lab work will be a simple blood draw, a minor discomfort. As for the pills, some people experience mild side effects, such as nausea, but we'll start with a low dose. In the meantime, keep the wound clean and dry. Do not attempt to self-treat it with any ointments or creams. That can make the infection worse. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the lab procedures. I want to see you back here in three days for a follow-up. If you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or fever, come in immediately. Do you have any questions before I leave you to the nurse?
PATIENT: Three days…and no ointment. Okay, no ointment. And keep it clean. I can do that. Oh… one question, Doctor. Will I still be able to wear my slippers? They're very comfortable. And I don’t want to get them dirty.
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I suggest you avoid wearing any footwear until we have a better understanding of this infection. Wearing slippers could further irritate the wound and hinder the healing process. I need to see other patients now. The nurse will explain everything. Please, follow her instructions. .
PATIENT: Oh…no slippers. Okay…no slippers. No slippers…and no garden… this is not a good day. .
