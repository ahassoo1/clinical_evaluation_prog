DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luftcht. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're twenty years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pipkorn. Yes, that is correct. I am twenty years old. I… well, it’s about the cancer. It’s been… difficult.
DOCTOR: “Difficult” is… rather vague, Ms. Luftcht. Perhaps you could elaborate?
PATIENT: I apologize. It's just… hard to talk about. I was… married, not long ago. My husband… he passed away from it, a few months back. And now… I found out I have it too. It’s… a lot to process. I don't really know where to begin.
DOCTOR: I see. A recent loss, and now this diagnosis… certainly a great deal to contend with. And you are experiencing… what specific symptoms led you to seek medical attention now?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been very tired. More tired than usual, and it’s not getting better with rest. And… I've lost my appetite. Everything just… tastes wrong. I’ve also been having some pain, low in my stomach. It comes and goes, but it's… uncomfortable. I wasn’t sure if it was just… grief, but it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, appetite loss, and abdominal discomfort. Those can be related to a number of things, of course. To help me understand the situation better, Ms. Luftcht, can you describe the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: It's… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not really cramping. Just… a heavy feeling. It's lower in my stomach, on both sides. Sometimes it feels like pressure, like something is… pushing. It's worse after I try to eat, even just a little bit. And it doesn’t really go away completely, even when I’m resting.
DOCTOR: “Dull ache, bilateral lower abdomen, exacerbated by food intake.” Right. And has this pain affected your… bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: I… I’m sorry, could you say that again? I don’t understand “bowel habits.”
DOCTOR: Forgive me. I sometimes use medical terminology without thinking. I simply mean, have you noticed any changes in your… digestion?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. That makes more sense. Um… I haven’t been going as often. And when I do… it’s… difficult. It’s not… normal. Sorry if that's too much information. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly alright, Ms. Luftcht. These things are important. And you are in a medical setting, so frankly, there is no such thing as "too much information." You mentioned your appetite loss – have you lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: I think so. I haven’t weighed myself, but my clothes feel… looser. I haven’t been wanting to eat, and when I do, it doesn’t stay with me long. I just feel… full, even if I’ve barely touched anything. My mother mentioned it when she visited, that I looked thinner.
DOCTOR: I see here you have a history of… quite a few missed appointments in the past. And no regular primary care physician listed. Have you had any imaging done recently?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… embarrassing. I haven’t been very good at keeping up with things. After my husband… everything was just… a blur. No, I haven't had any scans or anything. This is the first time I've really tried to get checked out since… well, since everything happened. I didn’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, given your symptoms – fatigue, appetite loss, abdominal discomfort, altered bowel habits, unintentional weight loss – and the unfortunate family history… a thorough examination is certainly warranted. I’d like to start with a physical exam, and then order some blood work and imaging to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies. I can take most medications, I think. I haven't really needed many. Um… is the imaging… painful? I'm a little scared, to be honest. It's all so new and overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The type of imaging I’m considering – an abdominal CT scan – typically does not cause pain directly. You may receive intravenous contrast dye, which can sometimes cause a warm sensation, but it's generally well-tolerated. We will, of course, explain the procedure fully beforehand and answer any concerns you have. First, let’s proceed with the physical exam. If you'll please lie down on the examination table, we can begin. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it to assess for any tenderness or masses.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. I’ll lie down. Just… tell me what you're doing, please? It helps to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will begin by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, to assess the bowel sounds. Then, I will gently palpate, or press, on your abdomen to check for any areas of tenderness, masses, or organ enlargement. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but please let me know immediately if you experience any significant pain. Bowel sounds are… present, though somewhat diminished. Now, I will palpate. Please relax your abdominal muscles. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. It’s… dull, like the pain I was describing. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. A little pressure, mostly. It's… worse when you push.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: That’s… a little more tender. It feels… heavier there. Like a weight. It’s still a dull ache, but… stronger. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It is not necessarily "normal," Ms. Luftcht, but it is not unexpected, given your reported symptoms. There is some tenderness to palpation in both lower quadrants. No palpable masses are noted at this time. Alright. Based on the physical examination and your reported history, I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and an abdominal CT scan with and without contrast. The blood work will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health and may indicate signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your abdominal organs and identify any abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds acceptable. I just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it be very expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don’t want to cause a big problem. I don't want to add more stress to everything.
DOCTOR: The blood work results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. The CT scan results usually take a little longer, approximately 48 to 72 hours, as they require a radiologist to interpret them. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of these tests. There may be a copay or deductible, but our billing department can assist you in determining the exact amount. I assure you, we will do our best to minimize any financial burden. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a balanced diet, staying well-hydrated, and getting adequate rest. If you experience any worsening symptoms – severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or blood in your stool – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. You’ve been very… thorough. And you explained everything very well. I appreciate it. When do I schedule the tests?
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Luftcht. My staff will schedule the blood work and CT scan for you before you leave. They are aware of your appointment and will ensure everything is arranged promptly. They'll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the CT scan, including any necessary dietary restrictions. Is there anyone you’d like to have contacted regarding these tests, or with the results?
PATIENT: My mother. Her name is Evelyn Luftcht. She’s… very supportive. And she’s good at… remembering things. I tend to forget. Would it be alright to contact her with the results? If that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely contact your mother, Evelyn Luftcht, with the results. We’ll need her contact information, of course. And we’ll require your written consent to release that information. My staff will provide you with the necessary forms. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time before you leave, Ms. Luftcht?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Pipkorn. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will escort you to the scheduling desk. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, Ms. Luftcht.
