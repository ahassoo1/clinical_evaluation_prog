DOCTOR: Alright, Chelise, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? It said my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something. I don't really understand all the fancy words, but they said I should come talk to you about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. It means your cholesterol is elevated. A lot of people get it. It's not immediately life-threatening, but we want to get it under control. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My father… he had a bit of trouble with his heart when he got older. Not sure exactly what trouble, just that he wasn’t very well. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the details. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It matters. Family history is important. Increases your risk. Okay. And what about you?
PATIENT: Me? Well, I try to eat pretty well. Lots of vegetables, not too much meat, you know? I walk most days, too. I live out in the country, so there's not much choice but to walk sometimes! I don't smoke, never have. I do like a glass of wine with dinner, though… is that bad?
DOCTOR: A glass of wine isn't going to kill you, Chelise, but it does contribute. And “pretty well” isn’t specific enough. What does a typical day of eating look like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit, maybe a little yogurt. Lunch is often a sandwich… turkey or ham, with lettuce and tomato. Sometimes a salad, if I've been good! And dinner… well, that depends. Sometimes fish, sometimes chicken, sometimes… pasta. I do like pasta. And a side of vegetables, usually. It’s not fancy cooking, Doctor. I live alone, so I keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And what kind of fats are you using when you cook?
PATIENT: Fats? Oh dear. I mostly use olive oil, I think. Sometimes butter, but I try not to. My neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, she says butter is terrible for you. But everything in moderation, right? I do use a little margarine sometimes too, for toast. Is margarine bad? I get so confused with all the different things people say!
DOCTOR: It is confusing, I'll grant you that. Look, margarine can be problematic, depending on the type. Olive oil is better. Okay. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your pulse. Then we'll look at your lab results more closely. Can you step up on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. I always feel a little better after I've had a good check-up, even if it's not all good news. There we go. Hopefully I haven't had too much breakfast!
DOCTOR: 124 pounds. Okay. And you said you're almost six-foot tall?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Five feet eleven and three-quarters, actually. My mother always said I got my height from my grandfather. He was a very tall man, a sailor, travelled the world! Is that… a problem? Being tall, I mean? I’ve never thought of it as a medical issue before.
DOCTOR: No, being tall isn't a problem in itself. It just... affects some things. We'll get to that. Alright, let's have you lie down on the exam table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Do I need to do anything special? Take deep breaths, perhaps? I'm always a little nervous at the doctor's office. Not that you do anything wrong, Doctor. Just… a bit anxious, you know?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Chelise. Relax. … Okay. Heart sounds are regular, but a little distant. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Pulse is 72 and regular. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's take a look at those lab results. Your total cholesterol is 245. LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160. HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 45. And your triglycerides are 150. So, total cholesterol is above the optimal range. LDL is also high. HDL is a little low. Your triglycerides are borderline elevated. These numbers aren't terrible, but they're not ideal. We need to address them.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. All those numbers! Is that why I need to worry? I don't really understand what any of that means. What happens if I don't "address them," as you say? Will I get sick?
DOCTOR: Look, high cholesterol doesn't cause immediate symptoms, but over time, it can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. This increases your risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems. It’s a slow process, usually. Think of it like… corrosion in a pipe. It doesn't burst overnight. But eventually, if you don't address it, it will cause problems. We have two main ways to address this. Lifestyle changes—diet, exercise—and medication. Given your numbers, I think a combination of both is the best approach. We'll start with the lifestyle changes. We need to lower your total cholesterol and LDL, raise your HDL, and lower your triglycerides. That means reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, eating more fiber, increasing your physical activity, and… potentially cutting back on alcohol. I’m going to put you on a low-dose statin, too. It’ll help lower your cholesterol levels more quickly. We'll recheck your numbers in three months and see how you’re doing. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds like a lot to remember! Corrosion in a pipe… I can picture that, I suppose. And medication… I always worry about side effects with medication. What kind of side effects might I have? And what about the alcohol? I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Is one glass too much?
DOCTOR: Look, statins are generally well-tolerated. The most common side effect is muscle aches, but that’s not everyone. We'll monitor you for that. Rare but serious side effects are also possible, but they're uncommon. As for the alcohol, one glass of wine occasionally isn't going to kill you, but it does contribute to increased triglycerides. I’d recommend limiting it to once or twice a week, at most. And no binge drinking. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for atorvastatin, 10 milligrams daily. And I’ll give you a handout outlining a heart-healthy diet and exercise plan. I want you to really focus on that handout, Chelise. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Atorvastatin… okay. And the handout… yes, I'll read it carefully. Is there anything specific I should look for on the diet? Like, what kinds of foods are really bad, and what kinds are good? And about the exercise… I walk, like I said, but is that enough? Should I be doing something more strenuous? It’s just… it all feels a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Look, the handout details everything. But to summarize: avoid saturated and trans fats—found in red meat, processed foods, fried foods. Focus on lean proteins—fish, chicken, beans. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit sugar and refined carbohydrates. As for exercise, walking is a good start, but you need to get your heart rate up. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. That could be brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling. Something that makes you breathe a little harder. And honestly, Chelise, if you’re concerned, consider consulting with a registered dietitian or a certified personal trainer. They can help you develop a personalized plan that's right for you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I haven’t taken anything regularly in years, except for a little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains. This is all very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll definitely read the handout carefully and try my best to follow your advice. I suppose I should try to be a little more careful about what I eat… and maybe walk a little faster! Is that all for today?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months to recheck your cholesterol levels. In the meantime, if you experience any muscle aches, shortness of breath, or any other unusual symptoms, call the office immediately. Here's your prescription and the handout. Take care, Chelise. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate your help. I will try my best. Have a good day! .
