DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks. Well, I just moved here... kinda new to the area. I think this is, like, a check-up thing? My husband said I needed to come. I don't really remember all the stuff he said. Medicare... something about that too?
DOCTOR: A check-up, alright. It’s… prudent to establish care when relocating, I suppose. And yes, Medicare will handle the billing. Your husband seems to have anticipated these necessities. Before we proceed with a general assessment, perhaps you could clarify what specific concerns, if any, prompted this appointment?
PATIENT: Concerns? Um... not really? I feel okay, I guess. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but... I always have. Nothing new. He just said it was important to see a doctor when you move. He worries a lot. I don’t… I don’t really feel sick. Is that a bad thing? Should I feel something?
DOCTOR: It's… unusual to present for medical evaluation without a specific ailment, but not unheard of. Your husband's diligence is… commendable, if somewhat excessive. Very well. A comprehensive examination is always beneficial, even in the absence of acute symptoms. We'll establish a baseline. To begin, let’s discuss your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma?
PATIENT: Not that I know of... I mean, I used to get ear infections a lot when I was little, but that was ages ago. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that healed. My husband handles all the doctor stuff normally, so... I don't really keep track. Does that make sense? He just tells me what to do. Is that a problem? Should I know all this stuff?
DOCTOR: It is… preferable for patients to possess a working knowledge of their own medical background. However, we can certainly ascertain the necessary information. Let's move on then. Has your husband mentioned any family history of significant illness – heart disease, cancer, stroke, perhaps?
PATIENT: Um... my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… something with her heart, I think? She was really old when it happened, though. And… my uncle, he had cancer, but he smoked a lot. My mom always said that was his fault. I don't really know much about it. My husband would know more, I think. He reads all those… those papers. About everything. Should I call him? He's probably got a list or something.
DOCTOR: While your husband's thoroughness is… noted, we can proceed without interrupting his schedule at this juncture. A general family history will suffice. Now, regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, consume alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And not really alcohol either. I had a glass of wine once, at a wedding, but it tasted funny. And definitely no… no other stuff. I work with machines all day, so I need to be… clear-headed. It's important for safety. My husband doesn't like it when people drink too much. He says it makes them… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Abstinence from those substances is… conducive to good health. Now, let’s briefly discuss any allergies you may have. To medications, foods, environmental factors… anything at all that elicits an adverse reaction.
PATIENT: Hmm... I don't think so? I mean, I get itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that's just… cats. My husband says I’m probably just sensitive. And I think I got a rash once, after using a new soap. But it went away pretty fast. Nothing serious. I mostly just eat what my husband makes. He's a really good cook. He’s careful about things. He wouldn't let me eat anything bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. It appears you have no significant allergies. Now, to proceed with the physical examination, I will need you to change into a gown. The changing room is just down the hall. I will return shortly to perform a basic assessment of your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Uh... a gown? Like… a hospital gown? The ones that tie in the back? Will I have to… take everything off? And what do you mean, palpate? Does that… hurt? I don’t really like people touching me. It makes me… uncomfortable. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: Yes, a standard examination gown. It is necessary to ensure adequate access for the assessment. The gown allows for a proper examination of your back, chest, and abdomen. And "palpate" simply means to gently press on your abdomen to assess for any abnormalities. It is not intended to cause discomfort, but I understand your apprehension. We will proceed with sensitivity and respect your boundaries. If you prefer, you may leave your undergarments on. However, please understand that this may slightly impede the thoroughness of the examination. The goal is to establish a baseline understanding of your health. It is a routine procedure. The changing room is down the hall on your left. Please take your time. I will be waiting.
PATIENT: Okay… I’ll… I’ll go change. But… please be gentle? And… maybe tell me what you’re doing as you go? It makes me feel… less nervous when I know what’s happening. Down the hall… on the left… right?
DOCTOR: Yes, down the hall on the left. And I assure you, I will explain each step of the examination as I proceed. Please take your time. .
PATIENT: .
