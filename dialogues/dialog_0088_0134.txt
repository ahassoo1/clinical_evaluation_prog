DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… it's been my stomach, mostly. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don’t eat much. And I feel full awful quick, you know? Like, just a few bites and I’m done. It’s been going on for… a while now. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Stomach upset and feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food. And you said it’s been going on for a while. When you say "a while," would you estimate a few weeks, a few months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Longer than a few months, definitely. Maybe… six months or more? It’s hard to say. Things just… blur together after a bit, you know? I remember my Harold… he always kept track of dates. I wasn’t much for that, even then. It's been worse lately though, that I'm sure of.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to remember precisely. Six months or more, and it's been worsening recently. Okay. And when you say "sick to your stomach," are we talking about nausea – feeling like you might vomit?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it exactly. Nausea. It doesn't always happen after I eat, sometimes it's just… there. And sometimes I do throw up, but not every time. It's just a generally unsettled feeling, most of the time. Makes it hard to do much of anything, really. I used to love working with the animals… but even that’s been hard lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, sometimes with vomiting, and a generally unsettled feeling. And it’s impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, like working with animals. That's good information to know. Have you noticed any particular foods that seem to make it worse, or any foods that seem to help?
PATIENT: That's a good question… I don’t think so, not really. It doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, it just… happens. Bland foods don’t seem to help any more than anything else. I tried drinking ginger ale, like my mother used to, but that didn’t do much good either. Truth be told, I haven’t been eating much of anything lately. Just… trying to stay hydrated. I think soup is alright. Maybe. It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be related to specific foods, and ginger ale hasn’t helped. You've been mostly sticking to soup and trying to stay hydrated, which is good. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have. My clothes feel… looser, you know? Not in a good way. My daughter, bless her heart, commented on it when she visited last week. She said I looked… thinner. It worries her, I think. I haven’t weighed myself, but… I know I’ve lost some weight. It just hasn't felt important enough to bother with, to be honest. It's hard to explain. Everything just feels… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss, noticed by your daughter. That’s important information, Ms. Kelder. We’ll need to get a weight today. Besides the nausea and weight loss, have you experienced any other symptoms, like heartburn, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, or changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No heartburn, not really. Bloating, sometimes… but I get that just from… being old, I think! Constipation, yes, a little. That’s been happening more lately, too. And… my stool… well, it’s been darker, I suppose. Not black, mind you, just… not the usual color. I don’t know if that means anything. I’m probably just rambling now. It's just… hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all. This is all very helpful information, Ms. Kelder. Darker stools are something we definitely need to investigate. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My Harold was the one with the allergies, poor man. Always carrying an EpiPen. I haven't needed one myself, ever. I do take a vitamin D supplement, just what the doctor recommended a few years back. And… oh, a little something for my blood pressure, but it’s a small dose. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, vitamin D supplement, and a small dose of medication for blood pressure. Thank you. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… yes. A few years back… they found something. In my… well, never you mind where. It was cancer, yes. They… did things. Surgery, and… other things. They said it was gone, for a while. But… I haven’t been feeling well since. It's all a bit blurry, but I did have cancer. It feels like a lifetime ago, and yesterday, all at once.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. It’s good to know you had cancer treated in the past. Do you recall what type of cancer it was and approximately when you were treated?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… that was… Dr. Miller was the one who told me. It was… something to do with my stomach. Or maybe my insides? I can't quite remember the name of it. It was a long time ago… maybe five years? Or six? It feels like a blur. I remember going to appointments… and feeling very sick. And then… they said it was gone. They didn't tell me much about the specifics. I just… trusted them to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, cancer involving the stomach area approximately five to six years ago. We'll need to get those records. Now, have you had any surgeries other than the cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, a long, long time ago. And… oh, yes! I had my gallbladder removed years ago, too. That was… painful, I remember that. But that was before the cancer. And… I don't think that's it. Just the tonsils and the gallbladder, as far as I can recall. My memory isn't what it used to be, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and gallbladder removal. Now, can you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a hard one. My mother… she had heart problems. And my father… well, he died young, from a stroke, I think. As for my siblings… my brother had diabetes, I believe. And my sister… she had arthritis, bad enough she couldn’t get around much. But other than that… I don't know much about their medical histories. We weren't a family for sharing, you see. Everyone kept to themselves, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems, stroke, and diabetes. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Harold used to smoke, but I always made him go outside. And alcohol… I might have a sip of wine on special occasions, but that's it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I was raised better than that. I'm a simple woman, Doctor. I just like my animals and my garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Now, before we do a physical exam, just one last question. Have you been experiencing any changes in your appetite recently, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it’s just gone. I don’t feel hungry, not really. And… sometimes, yes, I have a little trouble swallowing. Food feels like it’s… stuck, you know? Not all the time, but often enough to be bothersome. It makes me nervous to eat sometimes, to be honest. It’s all so tiring, really. Everything just feels… wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, thank you for answering all of my questions. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and do a few other things. It shouldn't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm just… glad to be getting something done about it, finally.
DOCTOR: Okay. Take a deep breath in… and exhale… good. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to anxiety. Lungs sound clear… Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Is there any tenderness here… or here… or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That’s… tender. Right about… there. It’s not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And… I think it hurts more when I press on it hard. It's been like that for a while, I suppose. I just assumed it was my age.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m also noticing some mild swelling in your abdomen. And when I tap here… it sounds slightly dull, which could indicate fluid. Now, let's check your reflexes… Everything seems normal there. Okay, Ms. Kelder, that’s all for the physical exam. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at what’s going on. The CT scan will give us a more detailed image of your organs and help us determine the cause of your pain and swelling. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh my. A CT scan… that sounds serious. Will it… will it hurt? And what about the blood work? Will it take a long time? I get nervous about needles… And… will I know when you have the results? I just… want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s address your concerns. The CT scan is non-invasive; you’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take images. It shouldn’t cause any pain, though you may need to drink a contrast dye beforehand, which can taste a bit metallic. As for the blood work, it will only be a few vials – a small prick, and it’s usually over quickly. We can get a nurse to draw the blood gently, and if you are anxious about needles, let her know, and she can take extra care. We will get the results of the blood work back relatively quickly, usually within a day or two. The CT scan results will take a bit longer, maybe three to five business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them with you in detail and develop a treatment plan. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Kelder, and I want to assure you that we’ll take every step to make you comfortable. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… a little better, knowing it won't hurt. Thank you, Doctor. And you'll explain everything to me… when you have the results? Not just… tell me what's wrong? I appreciate you taking the time… I just… want to get back to my animals. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kelder. I will thoroughly explain all of the results to you in plain language, not just tell you what’s wrong. We’ll go over everything step by step, discuss the possible causes of your symptoms, and explore all of your treatment options. I will answer any and all of your questions, and I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. And I completely understand wanting to get back to your animals. Let’s get to the bottom of this so you can do just that. For now, I’m going to write the orders for the blood work and CT scan. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll schedule the CT scan for you. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve been very kind. I'll just… wait for the nurse then. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take good care of you.
