DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kaelyn Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, I've been having some trouble with my balance. It's rather unsettling, really. I feel... unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it seems to be getting worse. I’m not entirely sure when it started, to be honest. It all feels a bit... fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, I understand. Feeling unsteady and like you might fall is definitely unsettling, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's not uncommon for the timing to be a bit unclear when something develops gradually. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's been going on. When you say it's getting worse, can you describe how it’s worse?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. Hmm. It used to just be a little wobble when I’d stand up quickly, or perhaps when I was tired after a long shift at work. But now… now it happens more often, even when I’m just walking. And it feels less like a wobble and more like… well, like the room is tilting, sometimes. Or like I’m tilting. It's difficult to explain. It makes me nervous, and I worry about falling, especially at work. It’s a bit dangerous, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s progressed from a wobble with quick movements or fatigue to happening more frequently even with just walking, and now includes a sensation of the room tilting or you tilting. That’s helpful information. And it’s good you mentioned the nervousness and concern about falling—that’s important. To help me understand a bit more, can you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I operate a rotary drill… for oil and gas. It’s… physically demanding work, quite a bit of standing and moving around, and, well, a lot of heavy machinery. We work on rigs, mostly outdoors. It requires a good deal of balance and coordination, which is… concerning, given my current situation. We’re often working at heights, too, which is why I'm so worried about falling. It’s a dangerous job even on a good day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilyanna, that paints a very clear picture. Operating a rotary drill for oil and gas is indeed physically demanding and requires excellent balance and coordination, especially given the heights involved. Your concern about falling is absolutely valid. Now, let’s go through some other questions to get a more complete understanding of what might be going on. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the balance issues?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been rather… fatigued, I suppose. More tired than usual, even after a full night’s sleep. And… sometimes I get a bit of a headache. Not a terrible one, just a dull ache at the back of my head. Oh, and… I’ve noticed my vision seems a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that might just be from being tired. It’s difficult to say, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so it’s hard to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, a dull headache at the back of your head, and some blurry vision. And you mentioned some difficulty with memory – thank you for sharing that. It’s good you’re being so thorough, even with the memory concerns. Now, have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, like a bump to the head?
PATIENT: A recent injury… no, I don't believe so. Not that I recall, at least. Work can be a bit rough, of course, and I’m sure I’ve bumped my head a few times here and there, but nothing… significant. Nothing that would require a doctor’s visit, certainly. It's just… a lot of jostling around. It’s hard to remember every little bump, honestly. It’s been a while since I had a proper fall, though. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent significant head injuries or falls. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, my doctor, before… before my husband passed, he said I had slightly high blood pressure, but he put me on some medication for it. I think I’m still taking it… yes, I am. A small white pill, every morning. And… oh, I had a bout of vertigo a few years ago, but it cleared up on its own. Other than that… not that I recall. It’s difficult to remember everything. I do see a therapist, for… grief, but that’s not a physical condition, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of slightly high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous episode of vertigo that resolved on its own. And you are currently seeing a therapist for grief, which is very good. Let’s talk about your medications. Do you know the name and dosage of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is embarrassing. I should know this, shouldn't I? I have the bottles at home, but… I don’t carry them with me. It's a small, white pill… and I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I believe that’s correct. My husband always handled the refills and kept track of everything. It's been… difficult, adjusting. I apologize. I feel rather flustered.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s understandable, especially given everything you’ve been through. Lisinopril 20mg once a day – thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing that I’m aware of, at least. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat just about anything. I’m not particularly picky. My husband used to joke that I’d eat anything put in front of me. I do have… sensitive skin, perhaps? It gets easily irritated, but it's not a true allergy, is it? Just… easily bothered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just sensitive skin. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a difficult question. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble, later in life. He wasn't very good about going to the doctor, so I don't know much beyond that. And… I had an aunt who suffered from migraines, terribly debilitating ones. Other than that… I’m not really sure. My family wasn't very forthcoming about medical things, to be honest. It was considered rather… private. I apologize for being so vague. It’s hard to recall everything, and even harder to remember what was said.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. You’ve given me a good starting point. Arthritis, heart trouble in your father, and migraines in an aunt. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… well, as I mentioned, my husband passed away a little over a year ago. It’s been… a difficult time. We didn’t have any children. I live alone now. I have a few friends from work, but we mostly see each other during shifts. I don’t… go out much. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had the energy for it lately. And I don’t drink or smoke. I suppose that’s about it. It’s a rather quiet life, these days. I apologize for being so… uninteresting.
DOCTOR: You are not uninteresting at all, Lilyanna. It sounds like you've been through a great deal, and it’s completely understandable that you’re taking things quietly for now. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know, any other symptoms, concerns, or questions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, there is something. It's rather… peculiar. Sometimes, when I’m standing still, I feel a sort of… buzzing sensation in my head. Like a faint vibration. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds, and it’s not painful. But it's… unsettling. It started around the same time as the balance issues, I think. And… I’ve been feeling a bit… down, naturally, given everything. But it’s more than just grief, sometimes. Just a sort of… emptiness. I wasn’t sure if it was worth mentioning. It felt rather… trivial, compared to everything else. But you asked, so I thought I should. I apologize for rambling. It's just… a lot to process.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilyanna. It’s absolutely worth mentioning, and it’s not rambling at all. The buzzing sensation in your head and the feeling of emptiness are important pieces of information. Okay, let’s move on to a physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. I apologize in advance if I'm not very steady. I do hope you have a comfortable chair. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take things slowly. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 135 over 85. A little elevated, but not significantly. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. This is… rather nerve-wracking, I must admit. I do hope everything is alright. My heart has been racing a bit lately, I’ve noticed. Especially when I think about work.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. This will involve some simple tests of your balance, coordination, and reflexes. First, can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Though… it's a little unsteady, as you can see. I do apologize. It's worse when I'm nervous. I wish I had more… grace.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, take your time. It’s good you’re aware of it. Now, I’d like you to close your eyes and extend your arms out to the sides. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That was… not very accurate, was it? I seem to be having some trouble with my coordination today. I do apologize. Is that… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: It’s alright. It’s just a test, and it’s good we’re seeing what’s going on. A little difficulty with coordination isn't necessarily a bad sign, but it's important information. Now, I'd like you to walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh my. That was… quite challenging. I do apologize for the performance. I feel rather… dizzy now. I hope I didn't make a mess of things. I really do wish I were more steady. It's rather embarrassing, honestly. I feel terrible. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. You did very well, and there was no mess. It’s important to know what’s going on, and you’ve helped me get a clearer picture. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’ll gently tap on your knees with this small hammer. This is perfectly normal, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please proceed. Though… I do apologize in advance if I'm not very cooperative. I'm rather… jumpy today. I do hope everything is alright. Is this a bad sign? I'm so sorry to keep asking.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little sluggish, but not significantly. It's nothing to worry about at this point. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, I’d like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your head to rule out any underlying causes for your balance issues, dizziness, and other symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and a CT scan… alright. I suppose that’s… necessary. It just sounds a little… frightening, honestly. But if it will help determine what’s going on, then I’m happy to proceed. When would those be scheduled? And… what exactly are we looking for? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’m rather anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, Lilyanna. It's understandable. The blood tests will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and inflammation. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your brain to rule out any structural issues. I'll write you a referral for the blood tests and the CT scan. The blood tests can be done at the lab just down the street; they don’t require an appointment. As for the CT scan, the scheduling department will contact you to arrange a time that works for you. It should be within the next few days. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially anything that could cause you to fall. And if your symptoms worsen—if you experience severe dizziness, headache, vision changes, or difficulty speaking—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Avoid strenuous activity… yes, that’s… wise. I suppose I should probably take some time off work. And… the emergency room, if things worsen. I will remember that. Um… yes, I do have a question. The dizziness… is it possible it’s something… serious? I keep thinking about… tumors, or… something like that. I apologize for being so morbid. It’s just… I’ve been reading things online, and… it’s rather frightening. Is it possible it's something… more than just a simple imbalance? I'm so sorry to ask, but I need to know. I just want to be prepared. I really do. I apologize for being so difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask, Lilyanna. It’s much better to address your concerns directly. It’s understandable that you’ve been reading things online, but often that can lead to unnecessary worry. While it’s possible that the dizziness could be caused by a serious condition, it’s much more likely that it’s something less concerning, such as an inner ear problem, migraine, or even a side effect of medication. The tests we're ordering will help us rule out anything serious and get to the bottom of what’s going on. I want to be upfront: a brain tumor is a rare possibility, but it’s one we need to rule out. However, the vast majority of dizziness cases are not caused by tumors. We’re taking all the necessary steps to get you a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. For now, let’s focus on getting the tests done and following up with me once we have the results. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient and thorough. And for… being honest. It’s… reassuring, even though it’s frightening. I’ll schedule the blood tests tomorrow and wait for the call about the CT scan. And I’ll… try to avoid strenuous activity. And if things worsen… the emergency room. Thank you again, Doctor. I truly appreciate it. I apologize for being such a nervous patient. I really do. I'm so sorry.
DOCTOR: You are not a nervous patient at all, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to be anxious when you're not feeling well and don't know what's going on. I’m glad I could reassure you, and please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
