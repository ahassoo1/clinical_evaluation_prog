DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you. It’s… it’s a bit complicated, honestly. My mother’s side of the family, they’ve had… problems. A lot of them, actually. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It's just… I want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Preventative, really. I’d rather know what I’m dealing with before something happens.
DOCTOR: Right. "Problems." Okay. Well, preventative is… good, I suppose. Though, honestly, worrying about family history this much… it's often unnecessary. Still. Let's get some information down. So, you're concerned about heart problems and cancer specifically, because of your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Mostly heart. My grandfather died young, a heart attack. And my aunt… she had some kind of blockage a few years back, needed surgery. My mother worries constantly, and frankly, it’s getting to me. I just want a clean bill of health, tell me everything’s fine and I can get on with things. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, it's not… that much to ask. Though, as you know, medicine isn’t about guarantees. We run tests, assess risk, but a "clean bill of health" is rarely absolute. Let’s start with you. Any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I eat pretty well, mostly. I mean, I try to. I exercise when I can, things like that. I’ve always been… lean. Never had any problems with weight. Honestly, I think I'm in pretty good shape. My ex-wife used to complain I went to the gym too much. It's just… this family history is nagging at me, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, being lean is…generally positive. Though, it doesn't eliminate risk, naturally. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. Unless I'm, you know, running up a hill or something. Normal stuff. I do get a little…palpitations sometimes, but I just put it down to stress. Work's been hectic. I’m a teacher, and honestly, dealing with students these days… it’s enough to give anyone a racing heart. It's nothing, really.
DOCTOR: “Nothing” can still be something, Mr. Theriot. We need to be specific. When do these palpitations happen?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, fine. They happen… mostly when I’m stressed. Like, if I have a deadline or I’m dealing with a particularly difficult student, or… after a long meeting with the principal. They don't last long, maybe a few seconds. Just a fluttering feeling in my chest. It’s not painful, and it goes away on its own. Honestly, I’ve probably just got too much caffeine.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never. Absolutely not. My grandfather, the one who had the heart attack? He smoked. Terrible habit. I’ve always avoided it. And… well, my ex-wife hated it too. Look, is there anything specific you want to test for? Like, can we just do a full cardiac workup? I'm willing to pay for it, if necessary. I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: “Thorough” doesn’t mean ordering every test under the sun because of anxiety, Mr. Theriot. It means a sensible assessment of your risk factors and appropriate investigation. We'll start with a physical exam, then likely an EKG and some blood work. And we'll discuss lifestyle factors. Now, let's get to it. Please, have a seat. I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want this to be over with quickly, if possible. I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shirt off, please. Deep breath… and again. Heart rate is a little elevated, but not concerning given your stated anxiety. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. A little on the higher side, but not alarming. Have you been monitoring your stress levels at all?
PATIENT: Monitoring? No. I’m a teacher. My entire existence is monitoring stress. Look, I appreciate you doing this, but I really don’t need a lecture on stress management. I need answers. Is my heart going to explode, or what?
DOCTOR: Exploding is…unlikely, Mr. Theriot. But consistently elevated stress can contribute to cardiovascular issues. We need to take this seriously. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. None. I’m pretty robust, honestly. I rarely get sick. Look, can we just skip all this… preliminary stuff and get to the tests? I really think a cardiac workup would put my mind at ease. I'm happy to pay for it out of pocket.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. We'll order an EKG and a comprehensive metabolic panel. That will give us a baseline. And I'm going to order a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. It’s…prudent. However, I'm not ordering a full cardiac workup at this moment. It's not indicated based on this initial assessment. The lab results will take a few days. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to explore stress reduction techniques. It's not just about your heart, it's about your overall health. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when can I expect the results? And can the nurse just email them to me? I have a very busy schedule. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: The nurse will contact you within three business days to schedule the follow-up appointment. We will discuss the results in person. Emailing medical results is not standard procedure. Have a good day, Mr. Theriot. And please, try to relax. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you.
