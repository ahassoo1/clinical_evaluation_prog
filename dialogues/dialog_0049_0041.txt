DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, things… they just aren’t as strong as they used to be. My legs, mostly. It's been getting worse little by little, you see? It’s… a weakness. Like trying to walk through water sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weakness in your legs… and this has been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Slowly. Not all at once. Maybe… six months now? It’s hard to say exactly. It just feels… more effort to do things. Like getting up from a chair, or walking to the mailbox. Nothing sudden, thankfully. Just… tiring.
DOCTOR: Six months. Alright. And is this weakness in both legs, or is it more noticeable on one side than the other?
PATIENT: It’s… both legs, I think. But the left one… it feels a little more stubborn, maybe? It doesn’t want to move as easily as the right. Not by much, but that’s how it feels. Does that make sense? I'm trying to explain it the best I can. It's hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Astore. It does. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old. And… occasionally I feel a bit clumsy. I stumble now and then, but I figured I just wasn't paying attention. It's hard to say what's new and what's just… being my age, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Blurry vision and some clumsiness… I see. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. No tingling. Sometimes my feet feel a little cold, even when they shouldn’t be, but not numb. No… pins and needles, or anything like that. Just… cold. And tired, like I said. It’s mostly the weakness and the tiredness, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on, if you can figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No falls. I’ve almost stumbled a few times, but I always manage to catch myself. My wife… she worries a lot, so I try to be careful. I don't want to scare her. But I have been needing to hold onto things more, like the handrail in the hallway. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Holding onto things for support… yes, that's important to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a while back. I take a pill for it, every morning. And… I had a touch of diabetes too, a few years ago, but it's under control now, with diet and exercise. Nothing major, though. Mostly just trying to eat healthy and stay active. Oh, and my wife says I snore something terrible. Does that count?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and a history of diabetes… alright. And you said the diabetes is currently well-controlled?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The doctor checks it every six months. Last time he said my numbers were good. I try to watch what I eat. Lots of fruits and vegetables, less sugary things. I don’t drink much soda, not anymore. My wife keeps me in line, mostly. She's a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one pill. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many medicines if I can. Except sometimes I take something for my joints, when they're acting up. But that's just when I need it, not every day. It’s an over-the-counter thing, you can buy it at the store. It’s for arthritis, I think. The wife buys it for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve had a few mosquito bites, of course, but that's just regular itching. Nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I think. But this leg thing… this is new. This is what's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she had some trouble with her memory when she got older. The doctor said it was dementia, I think. And my father… he had heart problems, bad ones. He had to have surgery, but it didn’t help much. And… my sister, she has something with her nerves, I think. She gets numb sometimes. I don’t know exactly what it is, but she goes to a specialist. That’s all I really know, Doctor. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Dementia, heart problems, and a nerve condition… noted. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink alcohol, not anymore. I used to have a little beer sometimes, when I was younger, but my wife didn’t like it, so I stopped. She’s a good influence on me, that woman. Keeps me healthy. What about you, Doctor? Do you drink alcohol?
DOCTOR: That is… not relevant to your care, Mr. Astore. Now, let's focus on your history. Finally, do you have any significant social history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh! Excuse me, Doctor. I didn’t mean to pry. I just… sometimes you get to talking. I just mean, I've lived in Samoa most of my life. Moved here with my wife about ten years ago, to be closer to our grandchildren. I mostly stay home now, help with the garden. Church on Sundays. Quiet life. Is that what you meant, Doctor? Sorry if I’m being a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Astore, I'm going to need to do a brief physical exam. That will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the table. First, let’s check your reflexes. Could you cross your legs, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that right? Tell me if I’m doing it wrong. My bones aren't as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the other side… Hmm. Reflexes are a bit diminished, bilaterally, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that okay? I don't want to hurt you. I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but my hands aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to push against my hands, with both arms and legs. I want you to resist as I try to push them down. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will try my best. Just tell me when to push. I’ll try to push as hard as I can, even if it’s not very much. My legs are feeling a little weak, you know, but I’ll do my best. Is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, stand up for me, slowly. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's a little hard, Doctor. I feel a bit wobbly. I need to look down to make sure I don’t fall. Is this okay? Are you seeing anything?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Please have a seat again. Thank you. Based on my brief examination, you do have some weakness in your legs and some difficulty with balance. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. Given your age and history, several things could be contributing factors.
PATIENT: Oh. Several things? What sort of things, Doctor? Is it something serious? I was hoping it was just my old bones acting up. What kind of testing do I need? I’m a little scared, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, it's important to be thorough. Given your symptoms – the progressive weakness, balance issues, and the blurry vision – we need to rule out several possibilities. We'll need to do some blood work to check your vitamin levels, rule out any infections, and get a better understanding of your overall health. I also want to order an MRI of your brain and spine to look for any structural abnormalities. And finally, a neurological consult is warranted to assess your nerve function. This is standard procedure, Mr. Astore. I don’t want to alarm you, but it's important to be proactive. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that sounds like a lot, Doctor. An MRI… and a neurological… Is it possible it’s something… serious? Like, something with my brain? I’ve heard those things can be bad. Could it just be… my age? My wife… she’s worried too. She doesn’t want me to go through a lot of testing if it’s just old age. I don’t understand all these things, Doctor. It's… frightening. What does it all mean?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, I understand your concern, and it's perfectly natural to be anxious. It could be something simple, like vitamin deficiency or age-related muscle weakness, but we need to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. An MRI will give us a clear picture of your brain and spine, and the neurological consult will help assess your nerve function and identify any underlying issues. I don't want to jump to conclusions. The tests will help us get a definitive diagnosis and determine the best course of action. We are doing this to be thorough and ensure your well-being. I’m going to write the orders for the blood work, MRI, and neurological consult. The clinic will schedule these for you. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activities and use a cane or walker for support if needed. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A cane or walker… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Yes, Doctor. Just… what are we looking for, exactly? What are the bad things we’re trying to rule out? My wife… she worries about everything. I don’t want to frighten her unnecessarily. Is it something… like, will I lose my ability to walk? Will I lose my mind? Is that what the MRI is for? Please, Doctor… just be honest with me. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s bad. And how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, it's understandable that you’re anxious, and I want to be as transparent as possible. The tests will help us rule out several possibilities, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and certain types of nerve damage. These conditions can cause weakness, balance problems, and neurological symptoms. The MRI will help us visualize your brain and spine to identify any abnormalities. Now, I want to emphasize that these are just possibilities. It is highly unlikely that you have any of these conditions, but we need to rule them out to ensure we provide the best possible care. The blood work results should be back within a few days. The MRI and neurological consult will likely take a week or two to schedule and complete. Once we have the results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. I understand your wife is worried, and I encourage you to share this information with her. I will also be available to answer any questions she may have. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We are taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… Oh dear God. My sister… she has that. It… it’s terrible. I've seen what it does. Is that… is that what you think it is? Is that why you’re doing all these tests? And… if it is that… what can we do? Is there anything we can do? Will I… will I end up like my sister? I don’t want to be a burden on my wife. This is… this is awful. I… I don’t know what to do. Just… tell me what to expect. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, please, take a deep breath. I understand your fear, especially given your sister’s condition. However, it is extremely premature to jump to any conclusions. Multiple sclerosis is just one possibility, and there are many other conditions that could be causing your symptoms. We are doing these tests to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and until we have the results, we can’t say for certain what’s causing your symptoms. If it were to be multiple sclerosis, there are treatments available that can help manage the condition and slow its progression. The treatments vary depending on the type and severity of the disease, but they can significantly improve quality of life. Now, I want to emphasize that it is highly unlikely that this is the case. However, I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to provide you with the information and support you need. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, getting enough rest, and avoiding stress. I will also provide you with some resources on multiple sclerosis, so you can learn more about the condition if you wish. Do you want me to write down the clinic's number, and my extension?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… helpful. I just… I don't know what I'm going to tell my wife. She’s already so worried. She thinks I just need to rest. She'd be… devastated. And… what should I do about the garden? I promised her tomatoes this summer. I don’t know if I’ll be able to… Just… everything feels so uncertain. Thank you, Doctor. For being honest… even though it’s scary. Could you… just tell me again, what I should expect? And… how long will the tests take? Just… break it down for me. Please. I need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Let's break it down. First, the blood work. The clinic will call you to schedule that. It's a simple procedure; they'll just take a few vials of blood. Results should be back within 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they are available. Next, the MRI. The clinic will contact you to schedule that as well. It's a painless procedure; you'll lie inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain and spine. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes. Finally, the neurological consult. I'll send a referral to a neurologist, and their office will contact you to schedule an appointment. They'll perform a comprehensive examination of your nervous system to assess your nerve function. The total time it will take to complete all the tests is about 2-3 weeks, depending on scheduling availability. In the meantime, try to remain calm and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please contact me immediately. I understand your wife is worried, and I encourage you to share this information with her, but also reassure her that we are taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. I will also be available to answer any questions she may have. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being patient… and for explaining everything. I’m just… scared. I’ll wait for the clinic to call. And I’ll tell my wife. I appreciate everything you’ve done. And… if you don’t mind, Doctor… could I just… ask one more thing? Does all this mean I’m… going to get worse? Is there anything I can do to… prevent that?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, that’s a perfectly valid question, and I understand your anxiety. However, it's impossible to say for certain whether your condition will worsen. We don't even know what your condition is yet. If it turns out to be something manageable, like a vitamin deficiency or age-related muscle weakness, then the treatment is likely to improve your symptoms. If it turns out to be something more serious, like multiple sclerosis, then there are treatments available that can help slow its progression. In the meantime, there are several things you can do to maintain your overall health and well-being. These include: Eating a healthy diet: Focus on fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Getting enough rest: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Exercising regularly: Engage in moderate physical activity, such as walking or swimming. Managing stress: Practice relaxation techniques, such as yoga or meditation. Staying socially active: Engage in activities you enjoy and spend time with loved ones. These steps can help improve your overall health and well-being, regardless of what your condition turns out to be. I know this is a lot to take in, Mr. Astore. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions or concerns. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. You’ve been very kind. I’ll wait for the call. Tell your wife… I hope she’s well. And… thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I'm glad I could help. Take care of yourselves, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
