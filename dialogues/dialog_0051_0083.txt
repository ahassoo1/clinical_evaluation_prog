DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Glazewski, you say? Yes, well. It’s… a little thing, really. Not a serious thing. Just… I thought a card might be nice. You know, one of those… “Get Well” cards. Or encouragement. Something positive. My ex-wife… she always liked those. Made her feel better when she had… well, never mind that. It’s just… a little boost, that’s all. Is that… alright? It’s a bit silly, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Thank you for sharing that. It doesn't sound silly at all. It sounds like you're looking for some support, and perhaps something to lift your spirits. I understand that can be very important. To clarify, are you experiencing any physical symptoms that are causing you to feel down, or is this more related to… emotional well-being?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? No, no. Nothing like that. I’m… I’m a strong man. I work with boilers, you know? Big machines. They don’t bother me. It’s… more just… feeling a little low, I guess. Like a… a weight. Not a bad weight. Just… there. And a card would… brighten things up. Is it… is it strange to come to a doctor for that? Some people just… talk to friends, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Kammer. It's perfectly alright to come to a doctor when you're feeling low, even if there aren't specific physical symptoms. Your emotional well-being is just as important as your physical health, and sometimes a little support can make all the difference. It sounds like you're experiencing a sense of… heaviness, or perhaps a lack of energy. Could you tell me a little more about when this feeling started?
PATIENT: Heaviness… yes, that’s a good word. It started… hmm. Maybe a month ago? After… well, after my daughter called. Not a bad call, mind you. Just… she’s doing so well. Very successful, you see. Makes me… feel a little… old, I guess. And useless. Not that I am useless. I keep the house running. Boilers need looking after, even if I’m retired. But… it’s a feeling. Like… I’m not needed anymore. Does that make sense? It’s probably just… old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kammer. It’s very common to experience feelings like that when life changes, and especially when your children become more independent. It sounds like you're feeling a sense of… loss of purpose, perhaps?
PATIENT: Loss of purpose… yes. That’s… that’s a good way to put it. I had a purpose. Keeping those boilers running, making sure everything was safe. Now… I just… putter around. Fix things. Watch television. It’s not… fulfilling. My ex-wife… she always had hobbies. Painting. Gardening. I never… I never had time for those things. Too busy working. And now… well, now it’s too late, maybe.
DOCTOR: It's never too late to find new hobbies or rediscover old interests, Mr. Kammer. It takes courage to try new things, but it can be very rewarding. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little more about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Routine… hmm. I wake up around seven. Have some coffee. Read the newspaper. Mostly just… news. Depressing stuff, mostly. Then I’ll do a little work around the house. Fix whatever’s broken. The faucet drips sometimes. Small things. Then lunch. Usually a sandwich. And then… television. Or I’ll take a walk. Around the block. Not much to see. It’s… quiet. Very quiet. My ex-wife… she always had people visiting. Always something going on.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Kammer. That gives me a better understanding of your daily life. It sounds like you're a very practical person, someone who likes to keep busy and take care of things. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, that’s been… off. I wake up a lot during the night. Thinking. Mostly about… nothing important. Just… things. Old memories, mostly. And appetite… not much. I eat, but not with much enthusiasm. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard, almost. My ex-wife… she was a wonderful cook. Always something special. I haven’t… I haven’t made an effort to cook much since she left.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some difficulties with both sleep and appetite, which can often be associated with feelings of sadness or low mood. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more general questions about your health. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of self-harm?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… hmm. No, not exactly hopelessness. Just… a feeling of… emptiness. Like something’s missing. As for… self-harm… no. Never. I’m a strong man, Doctor. I wouldn’t do anything like that. Just… tired. Very tired. And… lonely. My ex-wife… she always knew how to cheer me up. She's… gone now. And my daughter… she’s busy with her life. I don’t want to bother her with… this. It’s just… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like you're coping with a lot right now – feelings of loneliness, emptiness, and the loss of companionship. It’s perfectly normal to feel this way when life changes, and it takes courage to acknowledge these feelings. To help me assess things further, would you mind if I ask you to complete a brief questionnaire?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? About… feelings? I don’t know, Doctor. I’m not good with… paperwork. And I don’t like talking about… personal things. Especially not with strangers. I came here for a card, you see. A “Get Well” card. Or encouragement. Not… a test. Is it… is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Kammer. It’s absolutely not necessary. I apologize if I’m making you uncomfortable. It’s just a tool I sometimes use to help me understand things better, but you are under no obligation to complete it. Perhaps we can skip the questionnaire and I can offer some suggestions based on what you’ve already told me?
PATIENT: That… that would be better, Doctor. Suggestions, yes. That sounds… sensible. I don’t want to bother you with… my problems. I just thought… a card might help. Something positive. To brighten things up a little. My ex-wife… she always said a little kindness goes a long way.
DOCTOR: That's a wonderful sentiment, Mr. Kammer, and I completely agree. A little kindness can make a world of difference. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing some symptoms of mild depression, related to feelings of loneliness, loss of purpose, and changes in your daily routine. It's not a formal diagnosis, but it's something to consider. I’d like to offer a few suggestions that might help. First, have you considered connecting with any local community groups or senior centers?
PATIENT: Community groups? Senior centers? I… I haven't. I used to work all the time, you see. Boilers don’t allow for much socializing. And now… well, now I just keep to myself. I don’t know anyone at those places. And frankly, Doctor, I’m not much of a people person. Always preferred the company of machines. They’re… predictable. People… aren’t.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It’s perfectly alright to prefer your own company. It doesn’t mean you have to join a group if you don’t feel comfortable. Another option is to explore some new hobbies or activities that you might enjoy. Is there anything you’ve always been interested in trying, or anything you used to enjoy doing before work took over your life?
PATIENT: Hobbies… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I used to… I used to tinker with radios. As a boy. Building them, fixing them. But that was a long time ago. And I don’t have the… the patience for it anymore. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. And frankly, Doctor, everything seems… pointless these days. What’s the point of building a radio if there’s nothing good on the air?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to find motivation when you’re feeling down. Perhaps we can start small. Is there anything you enjoy reading, or watching on television?
PATIENT: Well… I read the newspaper. Mostly the news. Depressing stuff, mostly. And I watch… documentaries. About history. But it’s all… sad, really. Wars and… disasters. Not much cheerful stuff on these days. My ex-wife… she liked comedies. Always laughing. I never… I never really understood it.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re drawn to learning, which is wonderful. Perhaps you might enjoy listening to audiobooks or podcasts about history. Or maybe watching some lighter documentaries, or exploring a different genre altogether. And finally, Mr. Kammer, have you considered talking to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: A therapist? Counselor? No. Absolutely not. I don’t… I don’t talk about my feelings. Never have. And I certainly don’t want to pay someone to listen to them. I came here for a card, Doctor. A simple “Get Well” card. Or encouragement. Not… a psychological evaluation. Is that… too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kammer. That’s not too much to ask at all. I apologize if I’ve been pushing you too far. It sounds like you’re very independent and prefer to handle things on your own, and I respect that. I completely understand your reluctance to talk to a therapist. It’s not for everyone. Let’s focus on what you feel comfortable with. I can write you a prescription for a mild sleep aid to help with your insomnia. And I can certainly provide you with a “Get Well” card. I also have some information on local community resources, should you ever decide you’re interested in exploring them. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A sleep aid… yes. That might help. And a card… yes, a card would be nice. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s all I ask. A little kindness. My ex-wife… she always said a little kindness goes a long way. And perhaps… perhaps a little quiet. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kammer. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Here’s a prescription for Trazodone, a low-dose sleep aid. It should help you get a more restful night's sleep. And here’s a card for you. I wrote a little something inside. It’s just a small gesture, but I hope it brightens your day. I also have some brochures with information on local senior centers and community resources. Feel free to take a look at them. I’ll make a note of our conversation in your chart. If you experience any changes in your condition, or if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Mr. Kammer?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… that’s everything. Thank you for your kindness. And for the card. It’s… appreciated. I think I’ll… I’ll be going now. Thank you again. And… have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day as well. .
