DOCTOR: Hi Lilyanna, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this unsteadiness, really. I’ve been feeling…off balance. It’s hard to explain. It’s not constant, but it happens enough that it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteadiness. I understand. "Off balance" is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… That’s…difficult. Everything feels a bit hazy, honestly. It feels like it’s been a few months, maybe? Possibly longer? It's hard to pinpoint, I'm afraid. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s not…a sudden thing, if that makes sense. More gradual.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Gradual onset is helpful to know. And don't worry about the memory thing, we can work around that. So, over these few months, has it been getting worse, staying the same, or better?
PATIENT: I think…worse, yes. Definitely worse. At first, it was just a little wobble now and then. I’d just steady myself and it would be fine. But lately, it’s…more frequent. And stronger. I worry about falling, especially at work. It's…not ideal when you're operating heavy machinery, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. That sounds concerning, especially with your job. Okay, so it’s becoming more frequent and more intense. Can you describe what the unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: Well…it’s not dizzy, exactly. It’s not like the room is spinning. It’s more like…my feet aren't quite there. Like they aren't connected properly to the ground. And sometimes it feels like I’m going to tip over to one side, without actually falling. It’s… unsettling. Like I'm fighting to stay upright. It doesn't happen all the time, but when it does, it’s…frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, "feet not quite there" and a feeling of fighting to stay upright…that's a really helpful description. And not spinning, which helps us narrow things down. Do you notice anything that triggers it?
PATIENT: Triggers… That's a good question. It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t think there’s one specific thing. Sometimes it happens when I’m tired, definitely. Long shifts at work don’t help. And…when I’m stressed, perhaps? But mostly it just seems to come on randomly. I haven't noticed a pattern, not really. Though… maybe when I stand for long periods? But even then, not always. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, stress, and potentially prolonged standing. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Hmm. Well, I've been…more fatigued than usual, I suppose. But I work long hours, so I always assumed that was just from that. And… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but I wear glasses, so I just figured it was my prescription needing adjusting. Nothing major, honestly. It’s mostly just the unsteadiness that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue and occasional blurry vision. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, not really. I haven't been to the doctor much over the years, to be honest. I always felt healthy enough. My husband… he passed away a little over a year ago. I've been…distracted since then, I suppose. I did have the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. No major surgeries or anything like that. I do take vitamins, if that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It’s completely understandable that your health may have taken a backseat during that difficult time. And vitamins don't count as medical conditions, no worries. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Not regularly, anyway. I sometimes take something for a headache, if I need it. Over-the-counter, you understand. Just ibuprofen or something like that. But I don't take anything prescribed by a doctor, and I haven't for…well, ever, I think. I try to avoid taking pills when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Good to know. Now, are you allergic to anything – medications, food, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. No trouble with food, no rashes or anything when I’m outside. I live in a rural area, so I’m around pollen and everything, but it hasn’t bothered me. I haven't ever been officially tested for allergies, if that makes a difference. I’m not really one for… hospitals and testing, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, neurological problems?
PATIENT: Family history… That's…difficult. I didn't grow up with a lot of close family. My parents passed away when I was young, and I didn’t have many relatives I saw regularly. I believe my mother had high blood pressure, perhaps? But I'm not certain. And…I think my grandfather had some sort of trouble with his balance when he got older, but I don't know what exactly. It wasn’t really discussed much. It's not something I know a lot about, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible high blood pressure in your mother and balance issues in your grandfather. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, to get a better idea of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s causing this unsteadiness. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Great. First, I’m going to check your ears. Then, I'll test your reflexes, and do a few balance tests. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs. Your ear canals look clear, no signs of infection. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. 2+ and symmetrical. Normal sensation to vibration. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to have you stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just for a few seconds.
PATIENT: It's…a little difficult, Doctor. I have to concentrate to stay upright. I feel like I’m swaying a bit. It’s definitely harder with my eyes closed. I feel…less stable. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It is a bit more difficult with your eyes closed, and some sway is normal. However, it seems slightly more pronounced than I would expect. Now, can you walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for me?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to keep my balance, Doctor. I have to concentrate very hard. I don’t usually walk this carefully, normally. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. There's a bit of unsteadiness and some difficulty maintaining your balance, even with your eyes open. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it seems like you may be experiencing some sort of vestibular issue. That means something’s affecting your inner ear or the balance centers in your brain. It could be a number of things. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. Would you be alright with that?
PATIENT: Vestibular issue…? Tests…? What kind of tests, Doctor? What are we looking for, exactly? I’m not really fond of tests, to be honest. But…if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then…yes, I suppose so. But could you explain what they involve?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your hesitation. We're looking to rule out a few things, and to get a better idea of where the problem lies. I’d like to order an audiological evaluation – that’s a hearing test, but it also includes balance tests. It’s non-invasive, and it will help us assess your inner ear function. I’d also recommend an MRI of the brain, just to rule out any structural issues. It's the best way to see everything clearly. The audiological evaluation will take about an hour, and the MRI will take longer, about 45 minutes to an hour, and you’ll need to lie very still during the scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…and a hearing test. The hearing test sounds… manageable, I suppose. But the MRI… will it be uncomfortable? Will I be in a closed space? I don’t like small spaces, to be honest. And I get anxious easily. Is it absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern. You are right to ask. MRIs can be anxiety-provoking for some people, especially if they have claustrophobia. The machine is a closed space, but it’s relatively wide and you can talk to the technician throughout the scan. They can also give you earplugs to block out the noise, and even a mild sedative to help you relax, if you’re comfortable with that. We can discuss alternatives, but an MRI gives us the most detailed information about your brain, and it’s the best way to rule out serious causes of your balance issues. Without it, we’re essentially working in the dark. I understand your anxiety, and we will take every precaution to make you comfortable. We can also start with just the hearing test and see how you feel, and then discuss the MRI later. What feels most comfortable for you right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… Perhaps… let’s start with the hearing test, then. If it goes well, and if you still think the MRI is necessary… we can talk about it again. But I’d like to see what the hearing test reveals first. And… if I decide to do the MRI, I think I’d definitely need something to help me relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a very reasonable plan. We’ll start with the hearing test. I'll write you a referral order for that, and the technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activities that might cause you to fall. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like dizziness, headache, vision changes, or weakness – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for being patient with me. I appreciate it. I just want to feel normal again. I think that’s all for now. .
