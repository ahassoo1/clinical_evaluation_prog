DOCTOR: Hi Odell, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… hi. Yeah. I… need some shots, I think? For… going away. My wife… she said I need things before we go. She… handled everything. I don’t really… remember where. It was a long time ago now. A really long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It sounds like your wife was proactive about getting you prepared for travel, which is great. “A long time ago” – can you give me a rough idea of when you had these shots done?
PATIENT: Shots? Uh… before… before she… passed. Maybe… two years ago? No, longer. Before the… sickness. I don't… I don’t keep track of dates, you know? It was all… a blur. We were going… somewhere warm. Beach, I think. She liked the beach.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. That sounds like a very difficult time, and it's completely understandable you wouldn't remember specific details. Okay, so roughly before your wife passed, you received some vaccinations in preparation for a trip. Do you recall which vaccinations, even generally?
PATIENT: No, no idea. She… she took care of all that. I just… showed up. Doctor, papers… she signed everything. I just… trusted her. It was… easier that way. I don’t like doctors, really. Too many needles. And… bad smells.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's perfectly alright. It sounds like you were relying on your wife to manage the medical details, and that’s completely common. Since you don’t recall which vaccinations you received, and it's been a while, we’ll want to make sure you’re fully protected for your upcoming trip. To start, do you know where you're traveling to?
PATIENT: Uh… Nepal. I’m going back to Nepal. To… see family. It’s… complicated. I haven't been back since… well, since before. It’s… not a vacation. More like… duty. My cousin… he sent for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nepal. That’s helpful to know. And it sounds like it's a significant trip for you. Given that you haven't been back in a while, and it's not a typical vacation, we definitely want to be thorough about your vaccinations and health precautions. Do you have any idea what region of Nepal you'll be visiting?
PATIENT: Kathmandu, mostly. And… some village. High up. My cousin’s village. I… don’t know the name. He said it’s… hard to get to. Lots of mountains. And… bugs, probably. Lots of bugs everywhere. It’s… different there. Not like here.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kathmandu and a village in the mountains. That helps narrow things down. You're right to mention the bugs – Nepal can have risks for certain insect-borne diseases. Before we discuss specific vaccinations, let’s quickly go over your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… I don’t think so. I get… itchy sometimes. From everything. Dust, pollen, cats… you name it. But… not like… a bad reaction. Just… sniffles and itching. Nothing serious. My wife… she gave me something for that. A little pill. I… stopped taking it after.
DOCTOR: Okay, so general allergies, mostly sniffles and itching, and you were taking a pill for it that you’ve since stopped. No serious, life-threatening allergies we need to be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never been to the hospital. Except… when she… passed. That was… a hospital. But… I didn't have any allergies then either. Just… sad. Really, really sad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known serious allergies. Thank you for clarifying. And I'm very sorry for your loss, Odell. Now, let's talk about any medical conditions you currently have. Do you have any ongoing health issues like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. I… work. I lift things. I’m strong. I mean, I was stronger. But I still work. They need me at the airplane place. No… no problems. Just… tired sometimes. Everyone gets tired, right?
DOCTOR: You’re right, everyone gets tired. So, no diagnosed medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… old. I’m not that old. But… not young either. My wife… she worried about my back. Said I should lift with my legs. I… tried.
DOCTOR: Okay. No current medical conditions, and some occasional back discomfort. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter medications like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. When my back hurts. I… take those little white pills. Ibuprofen, I think? The ones… everyone uses. But… not every day. Only when I need them. And… I used to take something for sleep. But that made me… weird. So I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain, and you previously tried a sleep aid but stopped due to side effects. That's helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Uh… fine. Whatever. Just… be quick, okay? I don’t like being… poked and prodded. And… I get nervous. Easily. Don’t… don’t laugh.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Odell. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I definitely won't laugh. I understand you're nervous, and that’s perfectly alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Again… and out… alright. Now I’m just going to feel your pulse. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Pulse is a little elevated, but that could be from nerves. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, likely due to nerves. Now let's take a quick look at your throat and ears. Could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Uh… ahhhhh. It’s… dry. Everything is dry. I don’t drink much water. Too busy working. Itchy throat too. Maybe… a cold? I don’t know. My wife… she always had a lozenge. For my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a little red, but nothing concerning. It could be due to dryness. I’m going to take your temperature now. Your temperature is normal. Alright, Odell. That was quick. Everything seems okay physically, but we will need to consider your travel destination and potential exposures. Given that you're traveling to Nepal, and specifically a village in the mountains, it’s important to talk about vaccinations and preventative measures. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. Okay. Shots, right? I figured. My cousin… he said something about needing shots. He said it’s… dangerous there. Bugs and… sickness. I don’t like bugs. They bite.
DOCTOR: Yes, shots. Your cousin is right to be concerned. Nepal has risks for certain diseases that you aren’t likely exposed to here, and vaccinations are the best way to protect yourself. Based on your travel plans – specifically Kathmandu and a mountain village – I recommend the following vaccinations: Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis booster if you haven’t had one in the last ten years. Additionally, I recommend you speak with a travel medicine specialist about Japanese encephalitis and rabies – those are dependent on the specific region and activities you’ll be doing. Do you have any questions about these vaccinations?
PATIENT: Uh… Japanese… what? And… rabies? Like… dogs? I don't… I don't want shots for dogs! And… what about the other ones? What do they… do? I just… want to go see my cousin.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s break it down. You’re right to be concerned – it sounds like a lot. Japanese encephalitis is a virus transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause inflammation of the brain. Rabies is a virus transmitted through the saliva of infected animals, typically dogs, but also bats and other mammals. Since you’ll be in a rural area, the risk is higher. Typhoid is a bacterial infection you can get from contaminated food and water. Hepatitis A is a liver infection, also spread through contaminated food and water. We don’t have to get all of these right now. I think it’s most important we get you started with Typhoid and Hepatitis A. We can discuss the others with a travel medicine specialist – they are better equipped to assess your specific risk for Japanese encephalitis and rabies based on your itinerary and planned activities. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. Typhoid and… Hep… something. That sounds… less bad. But… how long do they last? And… do they hurt a lot? And… can I still go see my cousin if I get the shots? He’s… waiting.
DOCTOR: That's a great question, Odell. Yes, you can absolutely still go see your cousin, and getting these shots is precisely to make sure you're healthy enough to do so! Typhoid vaccination lasts for 2 years and is given as an injection. Hepatitis A vaccination lasts for a lifetime and is also given as an injection. Both can cause some mild side effects, like soreness at the injection site, but they don't usually cause serious reactions. The discomfort is usually brief. I can administer the Typhoid and Hepatitis A vaccines today if you'd like. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a travel medicine specialist for a more detailed consultation about Japanese encephalitis and rabies. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Today… okay. Just… quick, please? And… not too high up. My arm… gets funny. And… are you sure I really need all this? My cousin… he didn’t say anything about all this… trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Odell. It's a lot to take in. And I'll absolutely be as quick and gentle as possible. I can also adjust the injection site to avoid any areas that bother you. Your cousin may not have mentioned all of this because everyone has a different risk tolerance and access to information. However, as your doctor, it’s my responsibility to ensure you’re as prepared as possible for your trip, and that includes protecting you from potential health risks. These vaccinations are the best way to do that, and I want you to be able to visit your cousin without worrying about getting sick. Okay, let’s get started. I’m going to clean your arm with an alcohol swab… Now, you might feel a slight pinch… Alright, all done! Just a little pressure there. I’ve also given you a card with the details of these vaccinations and the referral to the travel medicine specialist. Please schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I think… I think that’s it. My arm… feels funny. But… thank you. Maybe. It was… fast. And… you were nice. I… should probably go. My cousin is waiting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. And you're right to listen to your body - take it easy with that arm. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a safe trip, and give your cousin my best.
