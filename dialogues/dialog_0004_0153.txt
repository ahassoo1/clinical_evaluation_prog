DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it's about a physical, I think? For… something to do with acting. Or a performance. They sent me over. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s a bit hazy. They just said I needed to be cleared, that's all. Is that right? It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: <stage>I tap my pen against the chart, a slight frown creasing my brow. A performance, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that's it! Something with a performance. I… usher, maybe? Or tickets? No, no, I think I acted, once. A long time ago. It's very confusing. I mostly just show people to their seats these days, you know? I just want to get this over with, if that's alright. It's a bit of a bother, traveling all this way.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, regardless of whether it’s acting, ushering, or… something else, we need to ensure you're physically fit enough for whatever this entails. It’s standard procedure. Let's start with a basic history. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. I suppose so. No major complaints. A bit tired, maybe? Old age, I reckon. Everything aches a little, but what doesn't at my age? I haven't been to a doctor in… goodness, I don't even remember. Years, certainly. Nothing wrong, exactly. Just… old. Is that helpful? Honestly, I’m not sure what you need to know.
DOCTOR: It's… a start. Fatigue is certainly something we should investigate, even if you attribute it to age. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… oh dear. I haven’t stepped on a scale in ages. Probably lost some. I used to be… well, I used to be a bit bigger. Now? I’m mostly skin and bones, I think. My clothes are a bit loose. Does that count? I don't really keep track of numbers anymore. It all feels… irrelevant.
DOCTOR: Right. Significant weight loss, even if not precisely quantified, is something we need to address. And have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or cough in the past few weeks?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. Chills? Sometimes. But that's just the air conditioning, I think. Gets a bit cold in those theaters. Night sweats… now you're asking me things I really don’t pay attention to. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Cough? A little bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but nothing serious. Old man cough, you know? It comes and goes. I really don't think I've been sick. Is this taking long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: We’re getting there, Mr. Krahn. Let's move onto your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of things. Let me think. The doctor, years ago, mentioned my… blood pressure, I think? Something about it being a little high. He put me on a pill, but I stopped taking it. Too many pills. And my joints ache, terribly. Especially in the mornings. Is that arthritis? I don’t really know. I never bothered to ask. It just… is. I've mostly just ignored it. I’m a stubborn old man, you see. And… honestly, I can’t recall anything else. Is that bad? I'm terribly sorry I'm not more helpful.
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that’s a good question. Let me think… Yes! When I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… ages ago. And… oh, and I had a bad knee once. They… fixed it, I suppose. A lot of pain. A long recovery. I think that was it. Years and years ago. I don’t remember much about either one, to be honest. Everything gets… blurry. Are we almost done? This chair isn’t terribly comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, one final section of questions, Mr. Krahn, and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Are there any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I avoid pills like the plague! Too many side effects, you know? I tried some arthritis medicine once, but it made me feel dreadful. No, nothing at all. Just… tea. And water. Is that alright? I really don’t like taking medication. It feels… unnatural. Now, can we please get this over with? My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krahn. Let's proceed with a physical exam then. Please sit up straight and I’ll begin by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and briefly assess your joints. It shouldn’t take long. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’ll try to sit up straight, but my back isn't what it used to be. Careful with my joints, alright? They creak something awful. Hurry it up a bit, if you could? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Your blood pressure is a little high, but we’ll discuss that later. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Breathing seems a bit labored, some mild wheezing present. Now, if you could just extend your arms to the sides… Let's check your range of motion. And can you bend at the waist for me?
PATIENT: Oof! That’s… uncomfortable. My back is really protesting. It creaks like an old ship. And my knees… oh, my knees. They aren't what they used to be. Everything is stiff, you know? Old age. It's just old age. I’m not a very flexible man, Doctor. Never have been. Can we please move on? This is… rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I’ve completed the exam. Based on your history and the findings, your blood pressure is elevated, and you have some limitations in your joint mobility, consistent with arthritis. The wheezing I detected suggests some mild airway obstruction, possibly related to age or underlying lung condition. Now, given your age and these findings, I recommend we get some further testing to determine the cause of the wheezing and assess the severity of your arthritis. This would include a chest X-ray and some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out other underlying conditions. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Testing? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know. Honestly, I just want to be cleared to… whatever it is I need to be cleared for. Is that possible? Can't you just… write something saying I'm fit enough? I’m not complaining about anything. Just a little ache here and there. Old age, you know? I really don’t want to go through a lot of tests. It sounds… stressful. And expensive. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your concerns about the cost and complexity of testing. However, it is my professional responsibility to ensure your safety and well-being. Simply writing a note saying you are “fit enough” without a proper evaluation would be irresponsible, and potentially dangerous. Given your elevated blood pressure and the findings from the exam, I strongly advise against that course of action. However, I understand your financial constraints. We can discuss options for lower-cost testing facilities, and I can work with you to prioritize the most essential tests. At the very least, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any serious lung condition. Now, are you willing to consider a chest X-ray?
