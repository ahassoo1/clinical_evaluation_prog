DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here regarding the requirements at my workplace… about wearing masks and other protective gear. It's causing me some… difficulty, and I was hoping to discuss a possible exemption.
DOCTOR: An exemption, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand the importance of safety for everyone, truly I do. But the gear… it doesn’t quite work for me, and I wanted to explore if there might be another way. It’s a bit hard to explain, but it feels… unsettling. It has to do with my background, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Your background?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am Lakota Sioux. It’s… a cultural thing, really. Certain coverings over the face… they carry a weight with my people. It's not something easily put into words, but it brings up feelings of… restriction, and honestly, a little fear. My ancestors… well, it’s a long story, but it’s tied to times of hardship and loss. It’s not that I refuse to be safe, just that this particular safety measure feels… deeply wrong, if you understand.
DOCTOR: So, you’re saying a mask is… emotionally distressing?
PATIENT: That's… a fair way to put it, Doctor. “Distressing” feels strong, but it’s not comfortable. It brings up… memories, feelings. I don’t want to make a fuss, and I understand the need for protection, believe me. I’m a protective service worker, after all. But it feels like… asking me to relive things that should stay in the past. It impacts my ability to focus on my work, truthfully. It's… a weight on my spirit, for lack of a better way to say it.
DOCTOR: I see. And this is impacting your ability to perform your job duties, you’re saying?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. It causes… a distraction. I find myself… preoccupied, thinking about the feelings it brings up instead of focusing on the people I’m there to help. It's not a constant thing, but it happens enough to be concerning. I don't want to be less effective in my role, and I worry that continuing to wear the masks will only make it worse. It’s… a delicate balance, trying to do my job and honor my history.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, with all due respect, while I appreciate you sharing your cultural background, we must adhere to certain safety protocols, especially given your profession. But… let’s try to get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any physical symptoms alongside these… feelings?
PATIENT: That's a fair question, Doctor. No, not physical symptoms, not exactly. It’s not like I have trouble breathing, or a rash. It’s… internal. A feeling of being… closed in, and anxious. It's difficult to explain, because it’s not a physical ailment. It’s more… a mental and emotional response. It impacts my concentration, makes me feel… unsettled and disconnected. I understand the need for protocols, I truly do, but I was hoping we could explore options that don't require me to… relive difficult experiences.
DOCTOR: Right. So, anxiety triggered by the mask. Have you ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve always been… a fairly stoic person, if you will. I don’t typically… show my feelings. But this… this is different. It’s not a general anxiety, it’s specifically tied to the mask and what it represents. It’s a feeling that comes up only when I’m wearing it, or even thinking about wearing it. I've just... never experienced anything quite like it before this requirement at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we can rule out pre-existing conditions then. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. It’s standard procedure. Can you tell me, briefly, about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m generally in good health. I try to stay active, though my work can be demanding. I don't have any chronic illnesses, no high blood pressure, diabetes, nothing like that. I had a check-up last year, everything came back normal. My weight is… around 189 pounds, I believe, and I’m 6’3” tall. I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally. I haven't been hospitalized in… well, decades, to be honest. I try to take care of myself, it's important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax, and breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out. Sounds clear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is a steady 72. Anything here feels off to you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing feels off to me. It all feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I haven't been experiencing any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness. It’s just… the feeling in my spirit, I suppose. That's the part that’s difficult to explain. Everything physically feels… as it should. I appreciate you taking the time to check, though. It's reassuring to know everything is functioning properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, physically, you appear to be in good health. It's… difficult to accommodate subjective experiences, Mr. Knabenshue. However, I can document your concerns. I’m not comfortable providing an exemption based solely on this information. But perhaps a referral to a mental health professional would be beneficial?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. I appreciate your honesty, truly. A referral… that's… something to consider. I hadn’t really thought about it, but perhaps talking to someone about it would be helpful. It might help me articulate the feelings better, and perhaps… find a way to manage them. If you think that would be a good step, I’m willing to explore that option. Would you be able to provide me with some resources?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can provide you with a list of mental health professionals in the area. Many accept Medicare. I also have some pamphlets on coping with anxiety and stress. Here you are. I recommend scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. Until then… I suggest you continue to wear a mask at work, and perhaps practice some deep breathing exercises when you feel overwhelmed. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very helpful, I appreciate it. The resources are… a good starting point. I’ll definitely look into scheduling an appointment. And I'll try the breathing exercises, though I can’t promise they’ll be… completely effective. I'll do my best. No, that’s all for today, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your consideration.
DOCTOR: Very well. If your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any other health concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day, Mr. Knabenshue. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
