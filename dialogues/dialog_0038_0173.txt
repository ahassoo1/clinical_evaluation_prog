DOCTOR: Alright, Jailenne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Auelua, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I've just been getting the chills lately. It's a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever, just… cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, but no fever. That is a bit unusual. Could you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, it's not like a normal cold where you feel warm then cold. It's just… cold. Like, I'll be perfectly fine, then suddenly I'm shivering. It happens at different times of the day, doesn't seem to be linked to anything specific. I've been wearing a cardigan even when it's warm, which is not me, haha.
DOCTOR: Right, so it’s not consistently linked to a specific time or activity, and it’s new for you. And you've noticed you're needing extra layers. Okay. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about a week, maybe a week and a half? It started gradually, just feeling a little cooler than usual, and then it got to the point where I noticed I was actually shivering. It hasn't gotten worse worse, just… consistently there, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a week to a week and a half. And consistently present, but hasn't been progressively worsening. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chills?
PATIENT: No, not really. No sore throat, no cough, no body aches… Just the chills. I've been a little tired, but honestly, who isn't these days? I can't really say it's anything more than normal tiredness. Oh! And maybe a tiny bit thirsty, but I always drink a lot of water so… I don’t know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other obvious symptoms – no cough, sore throat, aches, and tiredness that could be from other things. And a little extra thirst, but you normally drink a lot of water. Let's do a quick check of your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure, and then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart just to rule things out. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good! Whatever you think is best, Dr. Auelua. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 37.2 Celsius – that's normal. Pulse is 78, blood pressure is 122 over 80 – also both within a normal range. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m just going to listen to your lungs and heart. Take a nice deep breath in… and out… again… good. Everything sounds clear on both sides. No wheezing or crackles. Heart sounds regular too. Now, just to be thorough, are you experiencing any night sweats, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No night sweats, thankfully. And no weight loss, definitely not! If anything, I've been eating more lately, haha. Appetite is normal, I guess. Everything seems pretty standard, honestly. That's what's so strange about these chills, it's just… there. It's not part of anything else going on.
DOCTOR: Right, so no night sweats, no weight loss, appetite is stable. It’s really just these isolated chills. Okay. Let's go through a bit of your medical history if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and whatnot, but nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that's about it. No ongoing health problems or anything like that. Oh! And I was divorced about two years ago, if that matters? It was… stressful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jailenne. Stressful life events can sometimes manifest physically. Okay, no significant medical history aside from the tonsillectomy and the recent divorce. Any surgeries besides your tonsils?
PATIENT: No, just the tonsils. No other surgeries, ever. I’m pretty good at avoiding hospitals, haha. And I don't have any allergies, not to medications or anything.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No allergies, no other surgeries. And how about medications?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. I don't take any regular medication. Not even vitamins, usually. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don't really feel the need.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. And finally, any family history of any significant illnesses – things like autoimmune diseases, thyroid problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My mum has high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma on my dad’s side had… something with her joints, arthritis maybe? But nothing really major, as far as I know. No one has any autoimmune diseases or thyroid problems, not that I'm aware of. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mum with high blood pressure, grandma with possible arthritis. Nothing else significant. Alright, Jailenne. That’s helpful. Given everything you've told me – the isolated chills, normal vital signs, no other symptoms, and your medical history – it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause immediately. A few things could be going on. It could be a mild viral infection that’s not fully presenting, or sometimes stress can absolutely cause these kinds of symptoms. To rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. The CBC will check for any signs of infection, and the TSH will check your thyroid function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Dr. Auelua. Whatever it takes to figure it out! A CBC and a TSH test, right? I can do that. I guess I’ve been a little stressed lately, so maybe that is it. Do I need to go somewhere special to get those done?
DOCTOR: Yes, a CBC and TSH. And you're right, stress can manifest in many ways. No, you don’t need to go anywhere special. We can do both of those tests right here in the clinic. I’ll just write you a lab requisition, and the nurse will draw your blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to prioritize stress management – whatever that looks like for you. Things like getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and finding time for relaxation can really make a difference. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds perfect! I can definitely do that. Get enough sleep, eat healthy, relax… I think I need to make a conscious effort with the relaxing part, haha. So, I just go with the nurse now to get my blood drawn? Thank you, Dr. Auelua. You’ve been really helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. If you follow me, I’ll introduce you to the nurse, and she’ll take care of the blood draw. And you're very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Let's get you taken care of.
PATIENT: Okay, great! Thank you again.
