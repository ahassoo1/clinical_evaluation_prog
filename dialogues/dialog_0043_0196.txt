DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 52 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I guess. Honestly, I just… feel tired. Really tired. All the time. It’s been going on for… a while now. I don’t even know how long, to be honest. A long time. I just wanted to see if there was something… something I could do about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. Feeling constantly tired can be very disruptive. “A while now” is a bit vague, and that's alright. Let’s try to narrow it down a bit. Has this fatigue been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh… suddenly, I think? No, wait. Maybe not. It’s… hard to say. Things just… faded, I guess. Like a light dimming. I remember being… busier. More things to do. Now… not so much. I just… sit a lot. Does that make sense? I don’t remember when it started exactly. Sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It’s perfectly alright to not have exact dates. We'll piece things together. So, it sounds like this tiredness has crept up on you gradually, with a sense of decreased activity as well. Aside from the tiredness and sitting more, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Let me think… I ache a lot. My joints, mostly. And… I don’t sleep well. I go to bed, but I just… toss and turn. Not like I used to. Used to be able to sleep through anything. Now, every little noise… I wake up. And… I guess I’m just… sad sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. My husband… he’s gone now. It’s been a few years, I think. It’s hard.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Licano. That must be incredibly difficult. Thank you for sharing that with me. So, to summarize, you're experiencing persistent tiredness, joint aches, difficulty sleeping, and periods of sadness. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these symptoms, or have they developed gradually without a clear cause?
PATIENT: Trigger…? No, not really. Not that I remember. It just… happened. Maybe after… after he passed, it got worse. But even before that, I felt… run down. Like I was always coming down with something, but never actually sick. Does that make sense? I just… have no energy. I used to garden, you know? Loved gardening. Now… I can barely walk to the mailbox.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. A feeling of being constantly run down, even without a specific illness, is very helpful information. It sounds like this has been going on for quite some time, potentially worsening after your husband’s passing. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about some other things. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… not really. I eat. When I remember to. My daughter tries to make sure I do. Weight… I don’t know. I haven't weighed myself in… a long time. Probably lost some, but I don’t pay attention to it. Everything just feels… heavy. Hard to explain. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Licano. You're explaining everything very clearly. "Heavy" is a good way to put it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms, such as headaches, muscle weakness, dizziness, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Not bad ones, just… dull aches. Muscle weakness… yes, I think so. Everything feels… weak. Like I'm carrying a weight, even when I'm not. Dizziness… a little bit, when I stand up too fast. And… no, my bowel habits are… normal, I guess. As normal as they can be. Honestly, Doctor, I just feel… old. And tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. It sounds like you’re dealing with a number of concerning symptoms, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel overwhelmed. Before we proceed, I’d like to review your medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… Let me see. My doctor… before… he said I had… high blood pressure, I think. And… arthritis, in my hands. But that was a long time ago. I take some pills… for the blood pressure. And… a pain reliever, sometimes, for my hands. But I forget which ones, honestly. My daughter handles most of that. She brings me the pills. I just… take them.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Licano. That’s helpful. Let me just pull up your records here… Ah, yes. I see a history of hypertension, and osteoarthritis. It also looks like you’ve had a lipid panel done recently, and your cholesterol is slightly elevated. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Well… maybe a little bit of itching sometimes, with certain soaps. But nothing serious. I just… use whatever my daughter buys. She knows what’s good for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. And you mentioned you take medication for your blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name or dosage of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don’t. It’s… a little white pill. Maybe two little white pills? I take them every morning. My daughter… she fills those little boxes for me, with the days of the week on them. I just take what’s in the box. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering things. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We can certainly work around that. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Yes, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I haven’t had one in… a long time. Just… don't poke too much, okay? My joints ache.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Licano. I'll be very gentle. We’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look at your joints, and do a basic neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… alright. Just… take your time, okay? And… be gentle. My daughter always says I’m a bit of a baby when it comes to doctors.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We’ll take all the time you need, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Okay… here. Just… don’t squeeze too tight. It hurts, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. Just relax your arm for me. I listen intently, recording the reading. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let’s listen to your heart. I move the stethoscope to listen to her heartbeat, noting the rhythm and any unusual sounds. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs or gallops. Now, I'll listen to your lungs. I move the stethoscope to listen to her lungs, instructing her to take deep breaths. Your lungs are clear, with normal breath sounds. Now, let's take a look at your hands. Could you please open and close them for me?
PATIENT: There… See? They’re all swollen. And… it hurts when I bend them. Especially this one. I point to my right hand. My daughter puts cream on them, but it doesn't really help.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see some swelling and tenderness in your joints, particularly in your right hand. There’s also a slight limitation in your range of motion. This is consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I use a reflex hammer to test her reflexes in her knees and ankles. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. Finally, I'll do a brief neurological exam to assess your strength and sensation. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There… is that enough? It’s hard… everything just feels… weak.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Ms. Licano. Your grip strength is somewhat diminished, which could be related to the fatigue you’ve been experiencing. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I suspect several possibilities. The persistent fatigue, joint aches, difficulty sleeping, and diminished grip strength could be due to several factors, including osteoarthritis, underlying depression related to the loss of your husband, and potentially a vitamin deficiency. Given your age and symptoms, it’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as hypothyroidism or anemia. I'd like to order some blood tests to help us get a clearer picture. These tests will include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin D level, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh… blood tests. More blood tests. My daughter always says I’m a pin cushion. But… if it will help… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. I just want to have some energy again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Licano. And we will do everything we can to help you feel better. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll be expecting you. They'll need to draw a few vials of blood. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend some gentle exercises to help maintain your joint mobility and strength. I can provide you with a list of exercises, or you can consult with a physical therapist. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Exercises…? Oh… I don’t know. I’m not very good at exercising. My daughter tried to get me to do some… yoga, once. But it just hurt. Maybe… maybe just the list, then. If that’s okay. I’ll see if I can… manage something. I don’t want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Licano. We’ll start with a list of gentle exercises, and you can do them at your own pace. I'll also write a prescription for a low-dose vitamin D supplement, as many people are deficient in vitamin D, especially during the winter months. It's also important to address your sleep. I can provide you with some tips for improving your sleep hygiene, such as establishing a regular sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine. Finally, given your history of loss, I recommend considering grief counseling. It can be very helpful to have someone to talk to about your feelings. I have a list of qualified therapists in the area if you’re interested. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a lot of things. I… I don’t know. Grief counseling…? Maybe. I haven’t really… thought about it. I mostly just… keep busy. Or try to. I guess I’ll take the list of exercises, and the vitamin D. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It’s… nice to have someone listen. I think that’s all for now. I just want to go home and… rest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. I’m glad I could listen. It takes courage to share what you’ve been going through. Here are the orders for your blood tests, the list of gentle exercises, and the information on vitamin D. The nurse will be in shortly to review everything with you and schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Take care, and get some rest. And please, feel free to reach out if you decide you'd like to explore grief counseling. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
