DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. It’s this blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, the nurse said when she checked it. Truth be told, I mostly just want to get it sorted so I can get back to my bakin’.
DOCTOR: “A little high,” you say. And how long has it been “a little high,” Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe a month or so? It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t pay it much mind usually, just felt a bit more tired than normal when I was kneadin’ dough. Nothin’ major, though. I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And you mentioned feeling more tired when kneading dough. Any other symptoms you’ve noticed alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, maybe a few more headaches than usual. Not terrible, just… a dull ache in the back of my head. And sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. But honestly, at my age, things ache and I get dizzy all the time! Could be anythin’.
DOCTOR: I understand things can change with age, Ms. Steines, but it’s important we investigate these symptoms nonetheless. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. The doctor back in… well, it was a long time ago now… never said nothin’ about it. Just the usual aches and pains, you know. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Mostly just good Cherokee cookin’ and hard work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for anything at all, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. Helps with the kneadin’, keeps the pain down. It’s… let me see… Naproxen, I think it's called. Been takin’ it for years, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Naproxen. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. I eat all sorts of wild berries and plants when I’m gatherin’ ingredients, and I’ve never had a problem. My mama always said a little bit of everything is good for ya.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Steines, let’s talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's a tough one. My mama, she passed when I was young, and I didn’t know much about my daddy’s side. He wasn’t around much. I think my grandma, on my mama's side, had some heart trouble towards the end, but it was a long time ago and folks didn’t talk about these things much back then. It was mostly just “old age” or “weakness”.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I bake, mostly. Keeps me busy. I try to stay active, walk around the house, tend to my garden. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much, maybe a little wine with supper sometimes. But I do love my salt in my bakin’. Gotta have it for flavor, you know.
DOCTOR: Salt, you say. And how much salt would you estimate you use in your baking, Ms. Steines?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's hard to say exactly. A couple of tablespoons in a batch of bread, maybe? A little less in the pies. It's just… it needs it! Everything tastes bland without it. I’ve been bakin’ like this for seventy years, and I haven’t keeled over yet.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Steines, I’m going to need to take a look at you. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It’s standard procedure, and will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just gettin’ it sorted is what I want. Let’s get this over with so I can get back to my kitchen, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is elevated: 162 over 94. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly forceful. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Overall, your examination is relatively unremarkable, but your blood pressure is definitely elevated. Given your history and exam, I suspect you may be experiencing essential hypertension. We need to rule out any secondary causes. I would like to order some basic blood work – a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a urinalysis – to assess your kidney function and overall health. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Well, I don't like the sound of that, but if you think it's best… yes, alright. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just tell me what it all means when you get the results, alright? And how long will it take? I’ve got a pie crust waitin’ for me.
DOCTOR: It will take a few days to get the results back, Ms. Steines. The lab is quite busy. As for what it means, these tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help me determine the best course of action. The complete metabolic panel checks your kidney function and electrolytes, which can be affected by high blood pressure. The lipid panel assesses your cholesterol levels, as high cholesterol can contribute to heart disease. The urinalysis checks for protein in your urine, which can also indicate kidney problems. In the meantime, I'd recommend trying to reduce your salt intake. I know you mentioned it’s important for your baking, but even a small reduction can make a difference. Also, try to get some regular exercise, if you're able. Once we have the results, we can discuss medication options if necessary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Less salt... that's gonna be hard. But alright, I'll try. And I do walk around some, tend to my garden. I understand what you're sayin’, Doctor. So, no salt, walkin’, and wait for the tests. Is that it for now? I reckon I can manage that. Just… hurry with those results, will ya?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for now, Ms. Steines. I’ll have the lab draw the blood before you leave. The results should be back within three to five business days. My nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Now, do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty clearly, Doctor. Just… try not to keep me waitin’ too long. I've got bakin’ to do. Thank you kindly for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Steines. My nurse will escort you to the lab. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get this sorted. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
