DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. All over. It’s been going on for… hmm, a couple of weeks now, I’d say. Not terrible, but just… persistent. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Persistent itching can be very bothersome. A couple of weeks, you say. Okay. And is this itching all over your body, or is it localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much everywhere, Doctor. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp feels a bit itchy sometimes. I haven’t noticed it not being itchy somewhere, if that makes sense. It doesn’t seem worse in any one spot, just… general. It’s not like a rash, thankfully. Just… itchiness.
DOCTOR: Okay, generalized itchiness for about two weeks, no rash. That helps narrow things down. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, honestly. I haven’t really noticed anything specific. I’ve tried different lotions, you know, just regular moisturizers, but they don’t seem to do much. Hot showers seem to make it a little better while I’m in them, but it comes right back afterward. It’s pretty consistent, really. No matter what I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific triggers or relieving factors beyond temporary relief with hot showers. And the lotions haven’t helped. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no weight loss… I haven’t noticed any changes in my bathroom habits, if you know what I mean. No fatigue, really. Oh! Wait a minute. I have been a little more tired lately, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just… getting older, you know? I’m 53, after all. But it’s been a bit more than usual, maybe. Just a general feeling of being… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – some increased fatigue alongside the itching. Nothing drastic, but more than usual. And you haven't noticed any changes in your skin other than the itchiness itself – no redness, bumps, blisters, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Just the itch. My skin looks normal, I think. Maybe a little dry, but I live in a dry climate, so that's not unusual. My wife… well, she always said I had sensitive skin, but that was before… before she passed. But no visible changes, no bumps or anything. Just… itch. It's a real nuisance, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds very frustrating. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Ferneding. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney disease, liver problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s been a few years now. As for medical history… hmm. Nothing major, really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. My doctor, Dr. Volkov, monitors it regularly. Otherwise… just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious, nothing diagnosed. I get a checkup every year, but everything’s always come back normal. I'm on Medicare, so they check pretty thoroughly, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Dr. Volkov sounds like a good physician. And regular checkups are excellent. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. And a hernia repair, maybe fifteen years ago? It was a pretty small thing, outpatient surgery. Nothing since then. I generally try to avoid hospitals if I can, to be honest. Not my favorite place.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for aches and pains, like ibuprofen. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. My wife always said I could eat anything. She used to tease me about it. We never had any trouble with allergies, ever. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Sure. My mother had… well, she had arthritis, pretty bad. She was in a lot of pain. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was young, so I don't remember a lot of details. No one else in the family that I remember had anything major, honestly. Pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. My sister's doing just fine, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and heart problems in the family. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. I used to drink a little beer, back in my younger days, but I haven't had a drink in years. Not a fan of recreational drugs, either. I prefer a quiet evening at home, reading a book. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all of that information, Mr. Ferneding. That gives me a good understanding of your situation. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin and check a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit here for me. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at your skin. I’ll be palpating your lymph nodes as well. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I'm just going to gently examine your arms, legs, and back. I'm not seeing any rash or obvious skin changes. Your skin feels slightly dry, but that could be related to the climate as you mentioned. Your lymph nodes don't appear to be swollen or tender. Everything looks normal on the physical exam, which is good. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, I suspect this may be a case of generalized pruritus, or generalized itching, with no apparent cause. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Blood tests are fine. I’d rather be sure, you know? Whatever you think is necessary. What kind of tests are you thinking? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues. We’ll also check your iron levels, as iron deficiency can sometimes cause itching. It’s a fairly standard panel of tests to investigate unexplained pruritus. The lab technician will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It shouldn’t take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds reasonable. I don't think I have any questions. Just… how long does it usually take to get the results back? I’m not in a rush, but I’d like to have some idea.
DOCTOR: Generally, the results should be back within 3 to 5 business days. The lab will notify me as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the results, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin regularly, especially after showering. You could also try an over-the-counter anti-itch cream containing hydrocortisone. And I’d suggest avoiding harsh soaps and detergents. If the itching becomes severe or you develop any other symptoms, like fever, fatigue, or weight loss, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll try the moisturizer and hydrocortisone, and I’ll let you know if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You have a good day as well. .
