DOCTOR: Right. Evann Buoniconti, 35 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Overgaard. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’m hoping to get some paperwork sorted out, if you don’t mind. Something about… future care, I believe? A friend suggested I look into it, and I confess, the details are… hazy. It has to do with making wishes known, should I… be unable to communicate them myself. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m not entirely certain.
DOCTOR: An Advance Directive, or a POLST form... Yes, quite sensible to think about these things. It’s better to be prepared, though frankly, most people put it off. You're rather young to be concerning yourself with this, but I suppose it’s never too early. It sounds like you’re looking to establish a plan for your healthcare wishes, should you become incapacitated. Before we get into the legal aspects, though, let’s just quickly establish your overall health picture. It helps to have a baseline, you see. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A baseline makes perfect sense. I… I’ve had check-ups, periodically. It's been… irregular, I’ll admit. My work keeps… demanding hours. Etching and engraving, you see. It requires a great deal of concentration, and travel occasionally. I believe my last thorough examination was… oh dear. Perhaps two years ago? With Dr. Chen, in Billings. I don’t recall any… significant issues being identified then, but my memory isn’t what it used to be. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Billings, alright. Two years is… not ideal, but not disastrous. Engraving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… quite intricate work. Metal, mostly. Silver, sometimes gold. It requires a very steady hand, and a great deal of patience. My father was an etcher as well, it’s… a family trade, you could say. It’s… demanding physically, though. Long periods of stillness, then sudden, precise movements. It’s… difficult to explain if one isn’t familiar with the process. But it’s what I do. And truthfully, it’s what I enjoy, despite the… strain. Are you familiar with the craft, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The specifics aren't my concern, Ms. Buoniconti. Physical demands... right. Stillness then sudden movements. Interesting. It can certainly lead to repetitive strain injuries, but we'll get to that if necessary. Let's focus. You mentioned no significant issues identified two years ago. But have you noticed anything different lately?
PATIENT: Different… That’s a difficult question. My eyesight, perhaps? It does seem to tire more easily. But that could simply be the nature of the work, staring at such fine details for hours on end. And… a general fatigue, I suppose. A persistent weariness. But I attribute that to the long hours, and… truthfully, a rather unsettled personal life recently. I was divorced last year, and… it was a difficult process. Emotionally draining, certainly. I’m probably just… run down. Is that… relevant? I apologize for rambling. It’s difficult to isolate specific symptoms, when everything feels… somewhat blurred.
DOCTOR: Blurred is... unhelpful, Ms. Buoniconti. Fatigue and eye strain... common complaints, but we need to differentiate between stress, lifestyle, and something more. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A review of systems sounds… thorough. I want to be as helpful as possible, despite my… deficiencies in recollection. Where shall we begin? Perhaps with vision, given my earlier comment? Or is there a standard order? I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m… admittedly rather out of practice with these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: We'll start with vision, as you suggested. You mentioned fatigue and strain. Are you experiencing any blurring, double vision, or loss of vision in either eye?
PATIENT: No, no loss of vision, thankfully. And not… double vision, no. It’s more of a… general haziness. Like looking through a slightly clouded lens, perhaps. Especially at the end of a long day. It doesn't happen constantly, only when I'm particularly tired, or after prolonged concentration. And… sometimes, a sort of… flickering sensation, at the periphery of my vision. It's fleeting, though. Very difficult to describe. I hadn't actually mentioned it to anyone before, as it seemed… minor. A minor annoyance, rather than a serious symptom. Is that… concerning? I apologize for the continued vagueness. It's frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Haziness and flickering at the periphery… alright. Not ideal. Have you noticed any floaters—small shapes or specks that drift across your field of vision?
PATIENT: Floaters… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. Small, dark spots. They come and go, mostly when I look at a bright, blank surface. Like looking at the sky, or a white wall. I hadn't thought much of them, to be honest. I assumed they were… a normal part of aging. Though, at thirty-five, I suppose that’s… presumptuous. They don’t obstruct my vision, thankfully. Just… present. Annoying, but not debilitating. Is that… a cause for concern, Doctor? I apologize for the constant questioning. I simply want to be thorough. And… I confess, I’m feeling rather anxious at this point.
DOCTOR: Anxiety is understandable, Ms. Buoniconti. Okay, floaters and flickering. Now, let's move on to headaches. Have you been experiencing any headaches recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Headaches. They've been… increasing in frequency lately. Not severe, usually. More of a… dull ache, around the temples. And sometimes, a tightening sensation at the back of the neck. They usually occur after a long day of work, or when I’m particularly stressed. I usually take… an over-the-counter analgesic. Ibuprofen, mostly. It usually provides some relief, but the headaches seem to be… becoming more resistant to it, recently. And… occasionally, I’ve noticed a slight… sensitivity to light, accompanying the headaches. It’s not debilitating, but… noticeable. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I apologize for the continued rambling. I feel as though I’m simply listing symptoms, without providing any coherence.
DOCTOR: Increasing frequency, resistance to ibuprofen, light sensitivity... alright. Let's continue. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting associated with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No nausea or vomiting. Thankfully. It’s just the headache itself, and the… occasional light sensitivity. And the tightness in my neck. It’s… not a migraine, is it? I’ve never suffered from migraines before, but… the symptoms seem somewhat similar, in retrospect. Although, I’m hardly an expert. And I apologize for the continued vagueness. It’s difficult to isolate specific details, when everything feels… somewhat blurred. Is that… a reasonable assessment, Doctor? Are migraines a possibility? I’m… admittedly rather anxious at this point. And I confess, I’m beginning to regret bringing this to your attention. Perhaps I’m simply… overreacting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, it’s good you brought this to my attention. It's better to investigate than ignore. You're not overreacting. And yes, migraines are a possibility, but we need to rule out other causes. Let's move on to neurological symptoms. Have you experienced any weakness, numbness, tingling, or difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not exactly. Though… occasionally, my hands feel… clumsy. A slight tremor, perhaps. Especially after prolonged concentration. But I attribute that to the nature of my work, the delicate movements, the… strain. Numbness… no. Though, sometimes, a slight… prickling sensation in my fingers, after a long day. But it’s fleeting, and not particularly bothersome. Difficulty speaking… no. Although… occasionally, I find myself… struggling to find the right words. A momentary lapse, perhaps. But I attribute that to… stress, and fatigue. And… my general forgetfulness. It’s hardly a new symptom. I apologize for the continued rambling. It’s difficult to isolate specific details, when everything feels… somewhat blurred. And I confess, I’m beginning to feel rather overwhelmed at this point. Is this… concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, let's be direct. Fatigue, headaches, visual changes, hand tremors, difficulty finding words… these are not simply stress. Given your history, and these symptoms, I’m concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. We need to investigate further. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain and an appointment with a neurologist. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Are you saying… something is actually wrong? Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I occasionally experience a mild reaction to certain metals, when working with them, but it’s simply a skin irritation. Nothing… life-threatening. And I apologize for the… emotional response, Doctor. It’s simply… unsettling, to hear such a diagnosis. I confess, I’m rather anxious at this point. And I… I’m beginning to regret bringing this to your attention. Perhaps I’m simply… overreacting. But… if you believe it’s necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. What sort of neurological issue are you… considering? And… what does an MRI involve? I apologize for the constant questioning. I simply want to be prepared. And… I confess, I’m feeling rather overwhelmed at this point.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, it’s better to be proactive. I'm considering several possibilities—migraine, but also other, more serious conditions that require investigation. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any abnormalities. It involves lying still inside a large magnet, and it takes approximately 30-60 minutes. You'll be given earplugs to protect your hearing, and you’ll be able to communicate with the technician throughout the procedure. I understand your anxiety, but I assure you, we are taking this seriously. We need to rule out any potential issues, and the MRI is the best way to do that. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: Metal implants… no, none that I’m aware of. I had my wisdom teeth removed several years ago, but that was… a simple procedure. No metal screws or plates, as far as I recall. Pacemaker… no. I’ve never had any… cardiac issues, thankfully. Thirty to sixty minutes… lying still inside a magnet… It sounds… rather daunting, Doctor. And… the potential issues you mentioned… are they… serious? I confess, I’m beginning to feel rather overwhelmed at this point. And… I apologize for the constant questioning. It’s simply… unsettling, to hear such a diagnosis. Is there… anything I should prepare for? Anything I should be aware of before the procedure? And… what happens if… something is wrong? I apologize for the… emotional response, Doctor. It’s simply… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, it’s understandable that you're anxious. The MRI itself is not dangerous, but being inside the machine can be claustrophobic for some people. We can discuss options for managing that, if it becomes an issue. As for what happens if something is wrong… we will cross that bridge when we come to it. We will discuss the results of the MRI, and develop a plan of action based on what we find. For now, let's focus on scheduling the MRI. I'll have my assistant schedule it for you. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity, and continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms—weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, severe headache—go to the emergency room immediately. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel, just to get a baseline assessment of your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… yes, that sounds… acceptable. I suppose it’s better to be thorough, as you said. Complete blood count and metabolic panel… and avoid strenuous activity. I can manage that, I suppose. My work is… demanding, but I can take a break, if necessary. Doctor… about the neurological issue… Is there… anything I should be telling my family? Anything I should be preparing them for? Or would that be… premature? I confess, I’m beginning to feel rather overwhelmed at this point. And… I apologize for the constant questioning. It’s simply… unsettling, to hear such a diagnosis. I… I simply want to be prepared, if necessary. Is there… anything I should be aware of before the MRI, besides the… claustrophobia? And… what if I… I’m afraid of what we might find.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand your anxiety, and your desire to prepare. However, jumping to conclusions at this stage would be premature and unhelpful. It's important to remain calm, and let the MRI results guide our next steps. As for your family, I recommend waiting until we have the results of the MRI before discussing anything with them. It's important to avoid unnecessary worry and speculation. Before the MRI, you can continue to take any over-the-counter medications you normally use. You should remove any metal jewelry, and inform the technician if you have any metal implants or pacemakers. Be sure to arrive at least 15 minutes early to complete the necessary paperwork. I understand this is unsettling. But we are taking this seriously, and we will work through this together. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Not at this time. I suppose… I simply need time to process everything. And… prepare for the MRI. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. For your time… and your patience. And… for your reassurance. I confess, I’m feeling rather overwhelmed at this point. But… I trust your judgment, Doctor. And… I will arrive at least fifteen minutes early for the MRI. And… I will inform the technician if I have any metal implants or pacemakers. And… I will try to remain calm. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. My assistant will contact you to schedule the MRI. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care of yourself, and try to remain positive. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
