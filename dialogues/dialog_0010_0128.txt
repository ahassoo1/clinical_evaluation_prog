DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. I’m Dr. Annesley. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… my joints, mostly. They get really stiff in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving, you know? Not a big deal, usually, but it's been… longer lately, I think. I forget things easily, so hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings. And you said it’s been lasting longer recently, which is what prompted you to come in. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly these joints are stiff?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My fingers, definitely. And my knees… yes, my knees are bad too. Sometimes my shoulders, but not always. It’s… all over, really. It’s hard to pinpoint. I used to just shake it off, but it's getting harder to do that, you know? I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A long time ago, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. “All over” can be tricky to narrow down. So, fingers, knees, and sometimes your shoulders. And it’s been progressing over time. When you say stiff, is it painful stiffness, or more of a limited range of motion?
PATIENT: Oh… good question. It’s not really painful, not like a sharp pain. More… achy? And hard to bend. Like… when I try to make a fist, it doesn’t go all the way. And my knees… they just feel stuck, you know? Like they need oil or something. I don't know if that makes sense. I'm not good with describing things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Lilliana. Achy and a feeling of being “stuck” is very helpful. So, not sharp pain, but achiness and limited range of motion. Do you notice this stiffness is worse at any particular time of day, besides the mornings?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s always bad in the mornings, like I said. But… if I sit for too long, it gets worse. Like, if I’m watching television, or… I don’t know, doing a puzzle… after a while, they get really stiff. Then I have to get up and walk around. But even then, it takes a bit to loosen up. I don’t really do much anymore, so it’s hard to tell if it gets worse with activity.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mornings and after periods of sitting. That gives us a good starting point. Now, have you noticed any swelling around these joints – fingers, knees, or shoulders?
PATIENT: Swelling… let me see. I don't think so. My hands are a little… puffy sometimes, but I just figured that was… age, or something. I haven't noticed them looking bigger or anything. My knees… maybe a little, but it's hard to tell. I'm a little… well, I carry a bit of weight, so it's hard to say. I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to tell with some weight on the joints. Alright, Lilliana, let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the joint stiffness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Not that I can remember, really. I get tired, but… I’m old, so that’s not surprising. Sometimes my hands feel… numb, but only for a little while. It comes and goes. I don’t know if that’s related. Honestly, Doctor, I just thought it was getting old. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Lilliana. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. Fatigue and occasional numbness are worth noting. Can you tell me a little more about this numbness?
PATIENT: It’s… in my fingers, mostly. Like a tingling feeling. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… weird. And it doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes. It happens when I’m… I don't know, doing something with my hands. Like knitting, or… well, I used to knit. It hasn't been happening much lately. It's not a big deal, really. I just wave my hand and it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in the fingers, related to hand use, and resolves quickly. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that have been diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I had… high blood pressure, I think? A long time ago. The doctor put me on a pill, but I stopped taking it. I didn't like how it made me feel. And… my husband, God rest his soul, he had arthritis, really bad. But I don’t know if that means anything. I’m not sure I remember much else. It’s been a long time, and I don’t go to the doctor often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, and a husband with arthritis. We'll definitely keep that in mind. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, a long, long time ago. And… I was in the hospital when I had my son, of course. But that was… ages ago. Nothing else, I don’t think. Just the usual things, colds and flu, nothing serious. I’m trying to remember, but my memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and delivery. And we've established some memory concerns. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any other medical conditions that run in your family – aside from your husband’s arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she had… problems with her bones, I think. Like, they were brittle. She broke her hip a couple of times. And my sister, she had something with her joints, but I don’t remember what it was. It wasn’t arthritis, I think. Everyone in my family seems to get something, but I never paid much attention. I was always busy raising my son. I'm sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Lilliana. It's good you're sharing this information with me. So, your mother had brittle bones, and your sister had some joint problems. That's useful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never smoked. My husband tried it once, but I made him stop right away. Bad for you, you know? I drink a little wine sometimes, with dinner. Nothing much. Just a glass or two. I try to eat healthy, but… it's hard when you're on your own. I mostly cook for myself, and sometimes I just don't feel like it. It's easier to just have a sandwich, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional wine, and a generally healthy diet. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, I stopped taking the blood pressure pill a long time ago. I used to take something for my arthritis, but it didn’t help much. And now I just… don't take anything. Maybe some aspirin sometimes, for a headache. But that's it. I don't like taking pills, you know? They always make me feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your joints and get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My joints are a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little hard, you see? And it doesn't feel right. It feels… tight. It's not as good as it used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some stiffness in the joints of your fingers, especially on this hand. Not a lot of obvious swelling, but there is some decreased range of motion when you make a fist. And you are right, it does appear tight. Now, let’s move on to your knees. Can you sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable. But I’m alright. It’s always a little sore when I first get up. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lilliana. I'm feeling some crepitus – that’s a grating sensation – in both of your knees when you bend them. There’s also some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. No significant swelling or warmth at this time. Can you try to straighten your legs out for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like this? It doesn’t go all the way straight. It feels… stuck. It's not painful, just… tight. I don’t want to push it too much, you know? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There is some limitation in extension, meaning you can’t straighten your legs completely. The ligaments feel stable, which is good. Now, I’m going to listen to your knees with my stethoscope, just to check for any fluid or clicking sounds. Alright, I’m not hearing any significant clicking sounds, and there doesn’t appear to be any fluid buildup in your knees. Based on the exam, it appears you have some crepitus and limited range of motion in both knees, and stiffness and decreased range of motion in your fingers. I also noted some tenderness in the inner sides of your knees. Now, given your history and the physical exam, I suspect you may have osteoarthritis. It's very common, especially as we get older.
PATIENT: Osteo… what was that? Arthritis? Like my husband had? Is it… bad? Will I end up like him? He couldn't walk without a cane, you know. I’m not sure I understand. Is there something you can do about it? I don't want to end up in a wheelchair.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis, often just called OA, is a type of arthritis caused by the breakdown of cartilage in your joints. It’s very common, and it’s not necessarily the same as what your husband had. Different types of arthritis have different causes and progression. It’s important to remember that everyone is different. OA progresses at different rates for everyone, and not everyone ends up needing a cane or wheelchair. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests and X-rays of your hands and knees. The blood tests will help us look for other types of arthritis and inflammation, and the X-rays will show us the condition of the cartilage in your joints. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. If you think it will help, then yes. Blood tests and… X-rays. Okay. I don’t mind. As long as you’re sure it’s not… as bad as my husband’s. And… how long will it take to get the results? Will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s good to be thorough, and I understand your concerns. The blood tests will help us rule out other causes, like rheumatoid arthritis. The X-rays will show us the extent of cartilage loss in your joints, which will help us confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, but it's usually quick. The X-rays are painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes pictures. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to manage your symptoms. I recommend gentle exercises, like walking or swimming, to keep your joints moving. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as needed. Would you like me to write down some resources for gentle exercises and pain management?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. Gentle exercises… and the pain relievers. I think I have some acetaminophen at home. I'll try to do the exercises, but… I’m not very good with remembering things. Maybe my son can help me. He’s very good with that sort of thing. And… what if it is bad? What kind of treatment… is there? I don’t want to end up in a wheelchair, Doctor. That's my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Lilliana. It’s good to be prepared. If the X-rays show significant cartilage loss, we have several treatment options. First, we would focus on conservative measures – that’s things like physical therapy, weight management, and assistive devices like a cane or walker. Physical therapy can help strengthen the muscles around your joints and improve your range of motion. Losing even a small amount of weight can reduce the stress on your joints. If conservative measures aren’t enough, we can consider injections – like cortisone or hyaluronic acid – to help reduce pain and inflammation. In more severe cases, we may discuss joint replacement surgery. Joint replacement is a very successful procedure, and it can significantly improve your quality of life. But we would only consider that as a last resort. Right now, let’s focus on getting the blood tests and X-rays done. We’ll take it one step at a time. Here’s the referral order. It lists the tests I want done and the radiology center where you can go. They’ll schedule the appointment for you. And here are some resources for gentle exercises and pain management. Do you have any questions before I finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. I hope it's not too bad. I’ll make an appointment for the tests as soon as I can. And… thank you again. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilliana. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’ll take it one step at a time. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you back here once the results are in. Have a good day, and take care.
