DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. It’s about… pain. Down there. It’s… in the, um, the groin area. Yes, that’s right. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. Honestly, I don’t quite… remember when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, groin pain. I understand it can be a little uncomfortable to talk about, so don’t worry about being precise if it's hard to remember details. “A little while now” – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… Perhaps… a month? Maybe two? It’s very strange. I feel… foggy about it. It’s not constant, you see. It comes and goes. More often when I’ve been… working, I think. Yes, definitely when I’m working with the wood.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or two, intermittent, and seems to be related to work – specifically working with wood. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes… a heaviness. Like something is… weighed down. It’s not excruciating, Doctor, but it’s… noticeable. And uncomfortable, of course. It sometimes radiates a little… towards my… well, towards the front. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Noelani. A dull ache and heaviness, radiating to the front. Is it on one side or both?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s a good question. I… I think it’s more on the left side. Yes, definitely more prominent on the left. Though, sometimes I feel it a little on the right too, but not as much. It's difficult to be sure, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily on the left, but sometimes a little on the right. And you mentioned working with wood – what kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I make things. Furniture, mostly. Small tables, chairs… sometimes carvings. I’ve been doing it for a long time. It’s… it’s my passion, really. But it involves a lot of… standing, and bending, and… pushing. I use a lot of tools. Saws, chisels… and sometimes, heavier machinery. Perhaps that’s what’s causing the problem?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Noelani. Standing, bending, pushing, and using tools, especially heavier machinery. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Other symptoms… Let me see. I don't think so. No fever, no chills. I haven't noticed any… swelling, or redness. And… no changes in my… bathroom habits. Though, I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired lately. But that could just be… life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, swelling, redness, or changes in bathroom habits, just a bit more tired. And you're 44, if I recall correctly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Forty-four. And… I have Medicare, if that's important. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to figure out what’s causing this pain. It’s… unsettling, not knowing. Is it something serious, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, 44 and with Medicare. It's understandable to be unsettled not knowing what's causing the pain. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss potential causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would. It’s a little sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I'll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. After that, I’ll examine your lower back and hips. I also need to check your gait and range of motion. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Listening, feeling… checking. It’s all right. I understand you need to do what you need to do. Just… let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable, okay? It’s the lower back and hips you said?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain. Okay, a little tenderness here… on the left side. Not sharp, but definitely sensitive. And here… a little bit more pressure feels uncomfortable. Now, let’s check your lower back. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. Not terribly, but… yes. Oh… oh dear. That’s… not easy. It’s a little stiff. And… a little sore. I don’t bend as easily as I used to, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and some discomfort with bending. Your gait appears normal, but I do notice a slight wince when you take your first few steps. Now, I’m going to check your hip range of motion. Can you lie on your back on the exam table, please?
PATIENT: Yes, all right. Hip range of motion… What will you be doing exactly? It’s just… I like to know what to expect, you understand. I’ve never had this done before, not properly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m going to gently move your legs in different directions to see how easily your hips move. It may feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know immediately if you feel any sharp pain. Okay, a little resistance with internal rotation on the left… and some discomfort with flexion. Now, I’ll do the same on your right leg. No significant resistance or discomfort on the right.
PATIENT: Yes, all right. So… what do you think? Is it something serious? Is it my back? Or my hips? Or… something else?
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. Based on the physical exam and your description of the symptoms, it’s likely you’re experiencing musculoskeletal pain – meaning pain related to your muscles, ligaments, and joints. It seems to be primarily affecting your left hip and lower back, possibly due to strain or overuse, given your work with wood. I don’t suspect anything immediately serious, like a fracture or infection. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few simple tests. Would you be willing to get an X-ray of your lower back and hips?
PATIENT: Musculoskeletal pain… That sounds… less frightening than something broken, at least. An X-ray… Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will rule things out, then yes, I’m willing. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will it be… uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I have… commitments, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray itself shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. You'll just stand or lie still for a few moments while the machine takes pictures. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, including the time to position you and get the images. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within a day or two. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, like ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. You can also try applying ice packs to your lower back and hip for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. And try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain as much as possible. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Ibuprofen, ice packs… avoiding aggravating activities. I do have some ibuprofen at home, thankfully. And I can certainly try to take it easier with the wood. Though, that’s… easier said than done, you understand. It’s my livelihood. But I will try. And you’ll have the X-ray results in a day or two? And then we’ll discuss them?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. I’ll have the results in a day or two, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, numbness, or weakness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Noelani?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Ibuprofen, ice, rest… and follow up when the X-ray results are in. I appreciate your time, and your patience. It’s… unsettling, not knowing what’s wrong. But I feel a little better now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out. Thank you, Doctor Roseburrough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. The nurse will be in shortly to escort you to the X-ray department. And please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day to you too.
