DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I keep getting really sick after I eat fava beans. Like, really yellow, and tired... and just awful. It started a few weeks ago, and I thought it was just a bad stomach bug at first, but it keeps happening whenever I have them.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Interesting. And you've only experienced this after consuming fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Nothing else makes me feel this way. I eat all sorts of things, but it’s always the fava beans. It's… unsettling. I love them, usually, but now I'm scared to eat them at all.
DOCTOR: Well, that is specific. And how long after eating the fava beans does this “awful” feeling start?
PATIENT: Usually within a few hours, maybe four or five. It starts with just feeling really weak, then I get nauseous, and then… well, then everything starts to look yellow. My skin, my eyes… It's quite noticeable, I assure you. It lasts a couple of days, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has this happened with all fava beans, or just certain types?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don’t think I’ve really paid attention to the type, to be honest. I just buy them from the grocery store. They all look the same to me. I usually get the frozen ones, but I had some fresh ones a couple of times too, and it happened with those as well.
DOCTOR: Alright. This sounds… unusual, but not unheard of. There’s a genetic condition, quite rare actually, called Favism. It's a deficiency in an enzyme, G6PD, that makes people susceptible to the effects of fava beans. It causes hemolytic anemia – that's a breakdown of red blood cells. The yellowing you're experiencing is likely jaundice, a sign of that breakdown. But we can’t just assume that's what this is. We need to run some tests. Do you have any family history of anemia, or… unusual reactions to food?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. That sounds… serious. Favism, you said? I’ve never heard of that. As for family history… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she was always a bit pale, I remember. But everyone just said she was delicate. No one ever talked about anemia specifically, or any weird reactions to food. We weren't really a family that talked much about health, if I'm honest. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: It's something, yes. Okay. We're going to start with a complete blood count, to see if your red blood cells are being affected. And a G6PD enzyme level test, to see if you have that deficiency. We'll also check your bilirubin levels, which will confirm the jaundice. It's a simple blood draw; the lab technician will take care of you. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to avoid fava beans completely. Until we know what's going on, it's best to be safe. Do you have any allergies to anything, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no medications either. Just a bit of vitamin D in the winter, but that's it. Avoiding fava beans… well, that’s not going to be easy, but if you think it’s best, I will. Thank you, Doctor. I’m glad we're looking into this. It's been really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Good. Worrying is understandable. Alright, let's get those blood tests ordered. I'm going to have my nurse, Maria, come in and draw them for you now. She'll explain the process. And then, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available – usually within a few days. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today, or any questions you have before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just the tests, and then avoiding fava beans. Thank you so much, Doctor Kur. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismiss it as… I don't know, a weird stomach thing. I’ll just wait for Maria, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. Maria will be right with you. It’s important to take these things seriously, even the “weird” ones. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms in the meantime. We'll get to the bottom of this.
