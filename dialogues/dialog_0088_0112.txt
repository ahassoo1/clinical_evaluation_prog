DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Piet. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve just been… going to the bathroom a lot lately. It’s quite disruptive, really. I don't… I don't quite know why it started, or when exactly, just that it’s happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Okay. “A lot” is fairly vague, can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. It's… well, normally I’d go, perhaps four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every hour, or even more frequently. It’s… quite embarrassing, to be frank. And sometimes, even when I don’t feel a strong urge, I find myself just… checking, if that makes sense? I apologize, I’m not being very precise. My memory isn't what it used to be, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: No, that's alright, Ms. MacVittie. It's helpful to have some idea, and it sounds frustrating. So, more than five times a day, and sometimes you feel the need to go even when you don't have a strong urge. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… precisely it. More than five, definitely. And the… the “checking,” as I called it, is quite bothersome. It's not a pain, exactly, just… a feeling, a constant awareness. It’s… unsettling. I don’t recall anything changing in my diet or lifestyle that might explain it, which is rather perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or burning. It’s… just the frequency, and this need to… constantly be aware of it. It doesn't hurt, which is a relief, but it's… disruptive. I just wish I understood what was causing it. I've not had any fever, or chills, or… any other symptoms, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is your urine normal in color and clarity?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, I believe so. It looks… normal. A typical pale yellow, I suppose. Nothing cloudy, or… any unusual color. I haven’t noticed anything different about the appearance of it, only the… quantity, and how often I’m needing to go. I’m terribly sorry if I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… it’s difficult to recall specific details.
DOCTOR: No, you’re being perfectly helpful, Ms. MacVittie. It’s alright. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like a urinary tract infection, or diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… a difficult question. I’ve had the usual things, I suppose – colds, flu, the occasional sprain… But a diagnosis? I honestly can’t recall. I was married for quite a long time, and my husband always handled those sorts of things… the appointments, the paperwork… I’m divorced now, and… I haven’t really needed to see a doctor regularly since then. I think I had a bladder infection once, years ago, but it was… quite a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, and… perhaps a wisdom tooth pulled, but nothing that required a hospital stay. Everything was… fairly routine, as far as I recall. My husband again, was very good at handling those sorts of things. It’s… frustrating, not being able to remember these details. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. MacVittie. It’s common to not remember specifics, especially if it was a long time ago. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven't had any reactions to any medication in the past, as far as I recall. My husband always checked those things, too. He was… very thorough. I'm really sorry for being so vague. It's just... things haven't been very clear in my mind lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don't take anything regularly. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing consistent. I prefer to… avoid medications if possible. I believe in… letting the body heal naturally, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion. And… absolutely not with recreational drugs. I lead a… very quiet life, actually. Mostly reading, gardening, and… simple things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, if you don't mind me asking, what do you do for work, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I'm a concierge. I work at a few different buildings around town – mostly assisting residents with various tasks. It's a pleasant enough job, keeps me busy. It does involve being on my feet quite a bit, which… might be relevant, perhaps? I often have to… hold it for extended periods while assisting people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is relevant. And finally, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well. No. Not currently. I’ve been divorced for several years, and… I haven’t been involved with anyone since then. I apologize if that’s… too personal a question. It’s just… a bit awkward to discuss.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Ms. MacVittie. That's perfectly fine. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and do a quick neurological check, just to rule out anything obvious. It won’t be invasive. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m just… eager to find out what’s causing this. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the exam table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. Your abdomen sounds… normal. No unusual sounds. And your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Alright. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength seems good. Based on this quick exam, there’s nothing immediately concerning physically. It could be a urinary tract infection, even without a fever, or a bladder issue. However, given your description and the frequency, it could also be overactive bladder, or even something psychological. To be sure, I'd like to order a urinalysis, to check for infection. And possibly a postvoid residual volume test, to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. I'm happy to proceed with them. A urinalysis and… the other test you mentioned. A postvoid residual volume test, was it? Yes, please. I’m just… anxious to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully find some relief.
DOCTOR: Yes, a postvoid residual volume test. The nurse will explain how to do that. It involves urinating, then a quick ultrasound to measure the remaining urine. While we wait for the results, I'm going to suggest you start keeping a bladder diary. Write down every time you urinate, and how much you drink. It can help us identify any patterns. And I'm going to suggest you reduce caffeine and alcohol intake for a few days, just to see if that helps. Is that something you’re comfortable doing?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. A bladder diary… I can certainly do that. It sounds… quite thorough. And reducing caffeine and alcohol… that's not a problem at all. I don't consume much of either, as it is. A bladder diary and… waiting for the results. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Thank you. I feel… a little more reassured already, just having a plan of action.
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad to hear that. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some urine for the analysis, and explain the postvoid residual volume test. She’ll also give you a form for the bladder diary. If, in the meantime, you develop a fever, pain in your back or side, or blood in your urine, please call the office immediately. And if you don’t see any improvement after a week, or your symptoms worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate your patience. A fever, back pain, or blood… I’ll be sure to watch for those. And a follow-up appointment if things don’t improve. No, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. MacVittie, it was nice meeting you. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. And thank you. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. Have a good day. .
