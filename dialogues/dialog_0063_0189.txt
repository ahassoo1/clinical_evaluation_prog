DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It's about my… well, it's my bathroom habits, if you must know. Not a pleasant topic, really. There was blood. In the stool. Quite alarming, I assure you. Not something a man my age needs to be dealing with.
DOCTOR: Blood in the stool. Right. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's been… a couple of times now. Not every time, mind you. Just… appeared. Maybe three times in the last… week? It's hard to say exactly. I don't spend that much time analyzing it, you understand. A quick look is usually enough to tell you something's not right. And this was definitely… not right.
DOCTOR: A week. And would you describe the amount as… substantial, minimal, or somewhere in between?
PATIENT: Substantial is… a bit strong, I think. Minimal isn’t quite right either. Let’s say… noticeable. Enough to make one take pause, definitely. Not a Niagara Falls, if you catch my drift. Just… streaks. Red streaks. And frankly, at my age, everything’s a bit more concerning, isn’t it? You don't bounce back like you used to.
DOCTOR: Streaks, you say. And has there been any change in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Change? Well, now that you mention it… perhaps a little thinner than usual. Not drastically, mind you. Just… not as robust. And I wouldn’t say it’s difficult to pass, but it requires… a bit more effort. Though that could just be age, of course. Everything requires more effort these days.
DOCTOR: “Of course.” And any abdominal pain, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Abdominal… pain? Hmm. Not a sharp pain, no. More of a… discomfort. A bit of cramping, perhaps? Lower down, mostly. It comes and goes, really. Barely worth mentioning, if you ask me. I’ve always been able to tolerate a fair bit of discomfort. Flying for as long as I did, you get used to things being… less than comfortable.
DOCTOR: And what did you have for dinner last night, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Dinner? Oh, let me see… My daughter brought over a casserole. Some sort of… vegetable thing, I suppose. I didn’t pay much attention. I’m not much of a cook, you see. And frankly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything. Is she implying my daughter is trying to poison me?
DOCTOR: Just trying to gather information, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, have you noticed any black, tarry stools at all?
PATIENT: Black, tarry stools? Good heavens, no! Just the red streaks, like I said. Honestly, you're asking a lot of… personal questions. Are you sure you need to know all of this? It's hardly dignified, discussing one's… output. And I'm a pilot, you know. I’ve dealt with far more complex systems than this.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any family history of… gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: Family history? Now there's a question. My mother… she had indigestion, I think. And my uncle George… he was always a bit… delicate. Always complaining about something or other. But a serious illness? Not that I recall. We weren't a family that discussed such things openly. A stiff upper lip, that was our motto.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my knees. The arthritis, you see. Getting old isn't for the faint of heart. A small pill, once a day. Nothing major. And a little something for my blood pressure, but that's all. Nothing that would… cause this, surely.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick examination, Mr. Rowbottom. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. An examination. Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, I’m not particularly fond of poking and prodding. Is there a way to… expedite this? I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Just lie down, Mr. Rowbottom. It won’t take long. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don't rush a man. It's not as easy as it looks, getting up and down these days. I’ll try to relax, but no promises. Honestly, I’ve been through worse turbulence.
DOCTOR: I'm hearing some… reduced bowel sounds, Mr. Rowbottom. And there's a slight tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Nothing overtly concerning, but we'll need to run some tests to be sure.
PATIENT: Tests? Good heavens. What kind of tests? I don't do well with tests. I’m a bit of a… nervous patient, you see. Needles, probes, all sorts of unpleasantness. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps it’s just indigestion. A change of diet, maybe?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with the blood in your stool, and the tenderness I’m finding, we need to rule out anything serious. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a stool sample for occult blood and infection, and a colonoscopy. The colonoscopy is the most important. It allows us to visualize the colon directly and identify any abnormalities.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Absolutely not! I’ve heard stories. Dreadful stories. Probing and… unpleasantness. I will not be subjected to a colonoscopy! There must be another way. Perhaps another doctor? One who is… less invasive? .
DOCTOR: .
