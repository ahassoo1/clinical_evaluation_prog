DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Billman. It’s… well, it’s my memory. It’s been a little off lately, and it's starting to worry me. I just… forget things. Little things mostly, but it happens more and more, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Little things,” okay. Can you give me some examples of these “little things”?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard to explain. Like… yesterday I made a cup of tea, and completely forgot I’d made it until the water got cold. And then this morning, I went to brush my teeth… and couldn’t remember if I’d already brushed them. I just… stood there staring at my toothbrush. It’s silly stuff, really. And I keep misplacing things – my keys, my phone… things like that.
DOCTOR: Right. So, forgetting things you've done recently, and trouble keeping track of belongings. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… maybe six months? It started slowly, just occasionally forgetting where I put something. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last couple of months. Like, noticeably worse. It's not every day, but enough to make me feel… off. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And has anyone else noticed this?
PATIENT: That's a good question… Not really. I haven't told anyone, to be honest. I’m a dentist, you know? I ask people about their health all day, but talking about my own… feels weird. My assistant, Sarah, might have asked if I’d remembered to order some supplies last week, but that could have been anything. She's always keeping me on track. I just haven't wanted to worry anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no one's directly commented on memory issues, but it's something you've been aware of for about six months, gradually worsening. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. I’ve been a little more tired lately, maybe? But I work long hours, so that’s not unusual. And I guess I’ve been a bit more… irritable, but that could be the stress from the practice, too. I wouldn’t say anything major, just… a little off, overall. I don't think I'm confused or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. No confusion, just some fatigue and irritability along with the memory problems. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a little something for it every day. And… that’s about it, really. I had my gallbladder out a few years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Otherwise, pretty healthy for my age, I think. Do you want the name of the blood pressure medication?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. And when did you have your gallbladder removed, roughly?
PATIENT: It's Lisinopril, I think. 20 milligrams. And the gallbladder… let me think… it must have been about five years ago. 2019, maybe 2020. It wasn’t a big deal, thankfully. Just needed to get it done. They said it was getting a little sluggish. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg, and gallbladder removal in 2019/2020. That's good to know. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven't ever had a problem with medications. I double-check with Sarah before I prescribe anything new to patients, of course, but I've never had an issue personally. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let’s talk about your family history. Any family members with memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… well, she got pretty confused towards the end of her life. But she was very old, you know? I think she just faded with age. My mother says she had some trouble remembering things, but honestly, my mother is not the most reliable source of information. She tends to exaggerate things. I don't think anyone else had anything serious, but I can't say for sure. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Right. Grandmother with some confusion in old age, but unclear details. Okay. And just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I don’t smoke. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe two or three times a week. Just red wine. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a dentist, Doctor! That would be… unprofessional, wouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Right, of course. So, occasional red wine – a couple of glasses a week. Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m a little nervous, to be honest, but I’m glad I came in. Let’s get it over with. I have a patient waiting at 3:30, though, if that’s a concern.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll try to be as quick as possible. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not terrible considering you're likely a bit stressed right now. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes, coordination, and do a very brief memory test. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… let me think. Today is… August… the second? August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I’m always a little shaky on the dates.
DOCTOR: Alright, August 2nd, 2025 is correct. Good. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay… three words? Sure. What are the words?
DOCTOR: I'll say them, and you repeat them back to me. Ready?
PATIENT: Ready! Go ahead.
DOCTOR: The words are: apple, table, penny.
PATIENT: Okay, let me see… apple, table, penny. Got it. That should be easy enough. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words. Let’s see… What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a tricky one! Is it… 2025? Yes, it must be 2025, right? I feel silly even saying it. I know it’s 2025, I just… sometimes my brain feels a bit slow. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: It is 2025, you're doing fine. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… This is… Doctor Billman’s office? Is that right? It’s… a suburban clinic, isn’t it? A nice, clean office. I’m a dentist, so I see a lot of clinics. It's just...hard to focus sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you repeat those three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… Oh dear. This is embarrassing. Apple… and… table? And… something shiny? Was it… penny? No… I can’t quite… I'm so sorry. I knew them just a moment ago! This is why I was worried!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. That's okay. Don’t apologize. Based on your history and this brief exam, you’re experiencing some memory difficulties. You’ve also expressed fatigue and irritability, and your blood pressure is a little elevated, which could be contributing. While it's unlikely to be anything drastic, it warrants further investigation. I want to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and vitamin B12 levels. We should also rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. I’m also going to order a cognitive screening test, a more detailed assessment of your memory and thinking skills. It’s a simple questionnaire that we can do right here in the office, or I can refer you to a neuropsychologist for more comprehensive testing. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… thorough. Blood work and a test… Okay. I guess that’s a good thing, to be sure. A thorough check-up. Yes, I think that’s best. A neuropsychologist? That sounds… serious. Is that really necessary? Would the questionnaire here be enough to start with? And what about the high blood pressure? Could that be causing this? I take my medication regularly. I just… I want to make sure it’s not something really bad.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions. A neuropsychologist would provide a very detailed evaluation, but it’s not necessarily the first step. We can absolutely start with the questionnaire here in the office. It will give us a baseline and help determine if more in-depth testing is needed. And yes, your high blood pressure could absolutely be a factor. Uncontrolled hypertension can affect cognitive function. We'll check your blood pressure again today, and if it's consistently elevated, we may need to adjust your medication. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities – vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and even early signs of cognitive decline, though I don’t want you to jump to any conclusions. It’s far more likely to be something treatable, like a medication side effect or a vitamin deficiency. We'll get the blood work ordered and schedule you for the questionnaire. In the meantime, try to get a good night’s sleep, manage your stress as much as possible, and stay hydrated. Would you like me to provide you with a referral for a neuropsychologist now, just in case, so you have it for future reference?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes me feel a little better, hearing it could be something treatable. And yes, getting the blood work is a good idea. The questionnaire sounds good to start with, and… yes, a referral for the neuropsychologist would be good, just in case. It’s good to be prepared. I really appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Billman. I was getting quite worried there for a moment. And thank you for not making me feel silly about forgetting things. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It's my job to help you understand what's going on and to alleviate your concerns. Forgetting things is frustrating, and it's perfectly valid to feel worried. Alright, let’s get the blood work ordered and I’ll have Sarah schedule you for the cognitive questionnaire. She’ll also print out the referral for the neuropsychologist. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – confusion, dizziness, weakness, or changes in vision – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Billman. I really appreciate your time and your kindness. I feel a lot better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. I guess I’ll let Sarah get the paperwork started, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. Take care, and we’ll see you soon. .
