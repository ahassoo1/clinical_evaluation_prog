DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's a bit embarrassing, really. I'm having trouble, you know, going to the bathroom. It's difficult to start, and it takes a long time, even then. It's been going on for… oh, maybe a month now, I'd say.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly not something to be embarrassed about, Ms. Yadao – these things happen, and we’re here to help. So, it’s been about a month of difficulty initiating urination, and a slow stream?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Slow stream is a good way to put it. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out, you know? Like I still have to go, even after I’ve been. It’s… frustrating. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully, just… the trouble getting it started and not feeling completely empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, but a sensation of incomplete emptying along with difficulty starting and a slow stream for approximately a month. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine, or have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever or chills, no discomfort in my belly. The color… well, it seems normal, I suppose. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so that could be it. The smell… no, I don't think so. Nothing that I've noticed, anyway. I usually don't pay much attention to the smell, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is good you mention that you drink a lot of tea, Ms. Yadao. That can certainly affect urine color. And it's perfectly alright that you don't routinely check the smell; I just ask to be thorough. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Oh, well… let's see. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, that's why I walk with a cane sometimes. And my blood pressure, the doctor told me it runs a little high, so I take a pill for that. Just one a day. Otherwise… I think that's it. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and hasn’t bothered me since. I'm on Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. That’s helpful. Arthritis in the knees, hypertension managed with a daily medication, and a previous cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal. Medicare is good to know as well. Now, could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have the bottle right here somewhere… Ah, here it is. It says… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. 20 milligrams. I take it every morning with my tea.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily. Perfect. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, to my knowledge?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother in her garden, and I handled all sorts of flowers and plants, never had a problem. I eat pretty much everything, too. I like a good pickle, if that counts for anything!
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Yadao. No known allergies. Now, finally, have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past few years?
PATIENT: No, no recent surgeries or hospital stays. Like I said, the gallbladder was many years ago. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk when my knees allow, I eat a reasonable diet, and I see my primary doctor regularly. This bathroom thing is… well, it’s just a bit unsettling, that’s all. I haven’t had trouble like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao, and it's good you've been proactive about your health. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… try to be gentle with my knees, if you can. They do ache a bit today.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. I will be very gentle. First, let’s listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie back on the examination table, if you would. I’ll start by listening for any unusual sounds. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, go ahead, Doctor. Just… take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I'm just listening to your abdomen now. Breathe normally. Sounds are within normal limits. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please tell me immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little pressure, but nothing unpleasant. Go ahead, Doctor. You're being very gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about here?
PATIENT: No, that’s alright too. Nothing. It doesn't feel different than anywhere else. Sometimes my stomach gurgles a bit, but that’s probably just the tea. I drink a lot of it, you know. Herbal tea, mostly. Chamomile, peppermint… things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Your abdomen feels soft and non-tender. Now, I’d like to quickly check your neurological function, just to assess the nerves that control bladder function. This involves a simple reflex test. Could you please bend your knees and let your legs dangle over the side of the table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. There we go. Be careful, Doctor. My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I will be very gentle. I’m going to lightly tap on the back of your knee with this reflex hammer. This is called the patellar reflex. It’s a normal part of the exam. Please relax your legs. And now the other leg.
PATIENT: Hmm… felt a little tickle, that’s all. Not much of a reaction, though. And the other leg… feels the same. Not much happening there either. Is that normal, Doctor? I’ve never had this test before, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Yadao. The reflexes are a bit diminished, which can be normal with age or certain medical conditions. However, in your case, given your symptoms, I think it’s important to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I would like to order a urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, a blood test to assess your kidney function and prostate-specific antigen level , and a post-void residual measurement to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis, blood test, and… post-void residual, you said? That sounds like a lot of tests, but if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please. Medicare should cover it, right? I have the card with me if you need it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Yadao. Medicare should cover these tests, but we will confirm that before proceeding. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we'll collect a urine sample. For the post-void residual, you will urinate as completely as you can, and then we will use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. The nurse will explain the procedure in more detail. It's possible, depending on the results of the initial tests, we may need to consider a referral to a urologist. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, Doctor. Blood test, urine sample, and then a measurement after I go to the bathroom. And maybe a specialist if needed. That all sounds reasonable. I don't have any questions right now, but I'm sure I'll think of something once I get home and have a cup of tea. Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease a little bit, knowing you’re taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I'm glad I could reassure you. Let me call the nurse now to get started with the blood draw. Please let me know if you feel faint or unwell at any point during the process. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Nurse, could you please come in and assist Ms. Yadao with a blood draw?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. And please tell the nurse about my knees, just in case I need a little help getting up and down.
