DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though I must say, this… establishment isn’t quite what I expected. But never mind that. I’m here because I’ve been bruising rather easily lately. It’s… concerning, given my medication, of course. The blood thinner. I’ve noticed it especially on my arms, mostly. It’s just… appearing, without any real cause, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Bruising easily, particularly when on a blood thinner, is certainly something we need to investigate. It’s good you're aware of the potential connection with your medication. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about these bruises, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Well, what more is there to tell you? They’re bruises. They’re purple, they ache a bit, and they… appear. I haven’t been falling or bumping into things, not that I recall, anyway. I’m a reasonably careful man. Perhaps my skin is just… thinner these days. Is that a possibility? I mean, I am getting on in years. Though I hardly think that accounts for this much bruising. Honestly, it’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Farson, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. It is unsettling when things change without a clear explanation. Thinning skin can certainly contribute to bruising, but as you say, that wouldn’t typically account for spontaneous bruising like you’re describing. Let me just pull up your records here... Ah, yes. I see you are currently taking Warfarin. And how long have you been on Warfarin, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Warfarin… it feels like an age. Probably… eight years now? Maybe nine? It was after my wife… well, never mind that. The doctor at the city hospital prescribed it. He was a good man. Reliable. I’ve been seeing a different one lately, closer to home, but he seems… less thorough, shall we say. I’ve had my levels checked regularly, of course. They’ve always been… within the acceptable range, according to them. Though, honestly, sometimes I wonder if they really pay attention.
DOCTOR: Eight or nine years is a significant period on Warfarin. Thank you for that information. And it’s helpful to know you’ve been having your levels checked regularly. It’s good that you’re proactive about your health, Mr. Farson. I see your most recent INR was… 2.3, taken about a month ago. That is within the therapeutic range, yes. However, even within the therapeutic range, some individuals may experience unexpected bleeding or bruising. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I’ve been… a bit tired, I suppose. But who isn’t these days? I chalked that up to the heat. And my gums bleed a little when I brush. Nothing dramatic, just a bit of pink on the toothbrush. Nothing I haven't experienced before, really. It’s all rather… irritating, to be honest. I just want to know why this is happening. Is it the Warfarin? Should I be taken off of it? It’s a nuisance, constantly having to watch what I eat and get these tests. It feels like my life revolves around this medication.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. It's completely reasonable to feel that way when a medication impacts your daily life so significantly. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. The fatigue and gum bleeding are relevant pieces of information. We need to explore all potential causes. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No blood in either. Just…the bruising. And the gums, as I said. I do take a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but it’s just the standard over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy. Could that be contributing? I read somewhere that aspirin thins the blood as well. Though, honestly, I find these articles on the internet rather…alarmist. They just cause unnecessary worry. But yes, no blood in the stool or urine. Definitely not. I'm reasonably certain of that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Farson, thank you for clarifying. And you are correct – aspirin does have blood-thinning properties, and even a low dose can contribute to bleeding risk when combined with Warfarin. We’ll definitely factor that into our assessment. Now, to get a better understanding, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your skin, and I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must. Though, frankly, I doubt it will reveal anything I haven’t already told you. I’ve been a perfectly healthy man, for the most part, all my life. But yes, go ahead. Examine away. Just be gentle, please. My skin is rather…sensitive these days. And try not to take too long. I have a lunch appointment. Not that it matters much, given… everything. But still.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Farson. I will be as gentle as possible and keep it brief. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m noting multiple ecchymoses – that’s the medical term for bruises – on your forearms, ranging in size from about one to five centimeters. They appear to be mostly purple and slightly raised to the touch. No immediate signs of swelling or inflammation. I do not feel any underlying masses. Skin appears relatively dry. I'll just check your capillary refill time… It's a bit slow, around three seconds, which could indicate some mild dehydration. Alright, Mr. Farson. Thank you for your patience. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The slow capillary refill suggests mild dehydration, which can sometimes contribute to easier bruising. The aspirin use is also a factor. However, given the prolonged duration of Warfarin use, we should also rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying blood disorders.
