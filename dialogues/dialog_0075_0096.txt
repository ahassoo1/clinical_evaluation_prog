DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this light, you see. I'm just... really bothered by it lately. Everything seems too bright, and it's giving me a headache. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I think. Not sure exactly when it started, but definitely getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of increasing sensitivity to light and headaches. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the headache for me?
PATIENT: It’s not a really bad, pounding headache, more of a dull ache… right behind my eyes and in my forehead. It feels worse when I’m outside, or even just near a bright window. And my eyes… they feel strained, like they're working too hard. It doesn't last all day, but it's enough to be annoying, you know? Especially trying to get anything done.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache behind the eyes and forehead, worse with bright light, and eye strain… that gives us a few things to consider. Now, has anything changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not really, I don’t think so. I haven't started any new medications, haven't bumped my head or anything like that. Just… life, I guess. It has been pretty warm lately, though, hotter than usual, maybe? And I've been spending a little more time gardening, which means more time in the sun. But I always wear a hat... usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new medications or head trauma. The increased sun exposure with gardening is something to note, even with a hat. Now, let's talk about your vision generally. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I wear glasses for reading and close work. My distance vision is okay, but up close everything gets blurry. I've had the same prescription for about two years now, I think. Doctor said my eyes hadn't changed much at my last check-up.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you noticed any changes in your vision other than needing your glasses for close work?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything looks normal, just... bright. No blurriness or spots or anything like that. It's more like the brightness is making it harder to see clearly, even with my glasses on. Does that make sense? I don’t know if I'm explaining it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, the brightness itself seems to be interfering with your vision. Now, let's briefly go through some other things. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting. Just the headache and the sensitivity to light. And the tired eyes, of course. It’s not like a migraine where everything feels awful, just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable when it's sunny.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No nausea or vomiting, just the headache, light sensitivity, and eye strain. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual lately. I just figured it was the heat. But… maybe it's connected? I don’t know. I’ve been sleeping okay, I think. Not much different from normal. It’s just… a general feeling of being run down.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue along with the headache, light sensitivity, and eyestrain. We're gathering some good information. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam. I’m going to check your eyes, pupils, and do a basic neurological assessment, just to rule out anything serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever tests you need. Just let me know if anything feels strange. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Arbin, just follow my light with your eyes. Looking good. Now, I'm going to check your visual fields. I want you to look straight ahead, and tell me when you can see my finger waving in your peripheral vision. First, your right eye… …And now, your left eye. Okay, good. Your visual fields appear full. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Now, I’m just going to gently check your extraocular movements. Again, just follow my finger with your eyes… up, down, left, right. No nystagmus or limitations. Now, I'll check your cranial nerves. Everything appears intact so far. Finally, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 128/78, heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let me document these findings. Okay. So, the exam doesn't reveal anything immediately concerning. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, it's possible this is a combination of eye strain, possibly exacerbated by the increased sun exposure, and potentially some dehydration. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. And, to be on the safe side, I'm going to order an appointment for you with an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. They can check for any subtle issues with your vision or the structure of your eyes. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. A blood test and seeing the eye doctor… that makes me feel better, knowing we’re checking everything. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests. I didn't want to just ignore it and hope it went away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. It’s always best to investigate. I’ll write the orders for the blood work now. You can get that done at the lab down the hall. They should have an opening soon. As for the ophthalmologist, I’ll give you a referral. Their office will call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, especially when you’re spending time outdoors. Wear sunglasses with good UV protection, and take frequent breaks when you’re gardening or doing close work. If the headaches worsen significantly, or you experience any new symptoms like blurry vision, double vision, or fever, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. That’s really helpful, and I feel much better knowing what to do next. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
