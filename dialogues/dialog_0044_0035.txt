DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Asami! It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now. Just won’t stop! It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A week, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, a full week! Started right after I had a bit too much fizzy drink with my lunch last Tuesday. Normally I don’t bother with those things, but my granddaughter was visiting and she was having one, so I thought, “Why not?” Now I’m paying for it! It's not painful, just… constant.
DOCTOR: I see. So they started after having a fizzy drink last Tuesday, and have been pretty consistent since then. And you say it’s not painful, just…annoying?
PATIENT: Exactly! Annoying is the perfect word. It’s like someone’s tapping a little drum inside my chest. It doesn't hurt, thankfully, but it’s very distracting. Makes it hard to concentrate on my stories, and even harder to have a proper chat. I haven't been sleeping brilliantly either, keeps waking me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Distracting, disrupting sleep… those things can really add up. Let’s talk a little more about these stories you mentioned. Do you find yourself getting stressed when you're writing, or is it generally a relaxing activity?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not stressed at all! I love my stories. It’s mostly remembering things, you see? Bits and pieces of life, things I’ve seen and heard over the years. I write them down so I don’t forget. It's usually very calming, very peaceful. But when these hiccups keep interrupting...well, it pulls me right out of it. It’s hard to get back into the flow. It's like trying to hold water in your hands, you know? Slippery.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Losing your train of thought like that is frustrating. And it’s good to know it’s usually relaxing—that tells me a lot. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. I haven’t felt unwell, no fever or anything. My appetite's been normal, thankfully. I have been a bit… gassy, if I'm honest. Maybe that’s just from trying to stop the hiccups, holding my breath and all that? It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Mirriam. The gas could very well be from trying to stop them. Now, have you tried anything specific to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens yes! Everything my granddaughter told me to. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, a spoonful of sugar... she found it all online, you see. Even getting someone to scare me! None of it’s worked, sadly. I feel a bit silly trying all these things, to be honest. A grown woman and all.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Mirriam! It’s perfectly reasonable to try things when you’re uncomfortable. It's good you've already tried a few remedies. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, go right ahead, Doctor. I’ve got a pretty good memory, so I should be able to tell you everything you need to know. I was a psychiatric aide for many years, so I’m used to talking about these things, even if it's usually the other way around! I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I had the flu a couple of times, the usual sort of thing. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, I wear glasses. Otherwise, pretty healthy for an eighty-six-year-old, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mirriam. Being a psychiatric aide certainly gives you a good foundation for discussing medical things. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. It was causing a lot of trouble, quite painful. That was… oh goodness, must have been in the early nineties. Everything went well, though, no complications. And that’s about it, I think. Nothing else at all. Just the gallbladder, a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit of a sad story, to be honest. My husband passed away many years ago. I had one daughter, but she… she passed away a few years back too. I have a lovely granddaughter, though, she lives nearby and comes to visit often. I don’t really know much about my parents' medical history. They both passed away when I was quite young. I don't recall ever talking about illnesses with them. It wasn’t really something we did.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your losses, Mirriam. That must be difficult. It’s alright if you don't know much about your parents’ medical history. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat pretty much anything, thankfully. And I haven't had any bad reactions to medications in the past, as far as I know. I don’t take any regular medication at the moment, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, but that's it. I’m a pretty straightforward case, I think!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mirriam. It sounds like you are. Alright, with your permission, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a quick physical exam. That’s just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to all this, you know, from my time working as an aide. I don’t mind at all. Do just as you need to. Let me know if anything feels strange, although I doubt it will.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath in… and out… again… good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 78 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal here. I notice you are a bit on the thinner side, and your skin is quite dry. Do you have a good appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that all sounds very good, doesn't it? I do try to eat well, Doctor. I enjoy my food. But you’re right, I have lost a bit of weight recently. I haven't been pushing myself to eat as much, I suppose. I mostly eat soups and sandwiches, and the occasional bit of fish. And fruit, I love my fruit. I just don't feel as hungry as I used to. It could just be getting older, I suppose. Things do slow down, don't they?
DOCTOR: They certainly do, Mirriam. Now, just one last thing. Can you squeeze my hands, nice and tight?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Like this? Is that alright? I used to check reflexes with the patients, you know. Old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Perfect. And now, relax. Good strength in your hands. Everything seems pretty good physically, Mirriam. Now, considering your history and the exam, these hiccups are likely just… hiccups. Sometimes they just happen, and they can be stubborn. But the fact they’ve been going on for a week, and with your recent slight weight loss, I’d like to just rule out a few things. I want to order some blood work. Just a routine panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid. Also, a chest X-ray, just to be sure everything looks clear. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. If it puts my mind at ease, I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Blood work and an X-ray, no problem at all. I used to help arrange those for the patients, you know. I know the drill. Where do we start? Do I need to make an appointment somewhere else, or can it be done here?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do everything right here in the clinic, Mirriam. I'll write you a lab requisition for the blood work, and a request for the chest X-ray. The nurse, Sarah, will draw your blood, and then you can go down the hall to the radiology department for the X-ray. It shouldn't take long at all. Once the results are back, we'll review them and discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Sarah, you say? I’ll remember that name. And I’ll just head down the hall for the X-ray. Easy enough. Thank you for being so thorough. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of these hiccups. Hopefully they’ll stop before I have to start telling stories about having hiccups!
DOCTOR: I certainly hope so too, Mirriam! We'll get to the bottom of this. Sarah will be in shortly to get you started with the blood work. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and being so thorough. I’ll just sit here and wait for Sarah, then. Thank you again. I suppose I should try to relax and not get more hiccups while I'm waiting!
DOCTOR: Absolutely! Try to relax. And don't worry about getting more hiccups! We'll figure this out. I’ll leave you to wait for Sarah. She'll be right with you. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Asami. I will! .
