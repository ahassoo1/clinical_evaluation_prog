DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Parascandola. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Thanks for seein' me. It's my foot, see? It’s been swellin’ up, mostly on the inside part. Started a few days ago, but it’s gettin’ worse each day, I think. Not much pain, just…big.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your foot, primarily on the inside, and it’s been increasing over the last few days. Not much pain, just the size of it. Alright. And just to clarify, when you say a few days, can you give me a more specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It was…Tuesday, I noticed it a little bit. But Wednesday it was definitely bigger. So, yeah, about three days, maybe a little more. I was workin' both days, so I didn’t really pay much attention 'til yesterday when my shoe felt kinda tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Tuesday you noticed a little swelling, Wednesday it was more noticeable, and yesterday you felt your shoe getting tight. And you've been working through this?
PATIENT: Yeah, workin' every day. I sit most of the time, doin' loans, you know? Lots of paperwork and talkin’ on the phone. Didn’t think much of it at first, just figured my feet were tired. But it's not goin' down, and now it's…well, it looks bad. You can see it, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see it. We'll definitely take a look. Before we do that, let's go through a little bit more of your history. Have you had any injuries to that foot recently – a twist, a bump, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven't tripped or anything. I mean, I walk to and from the bus stop, but the sidewalk’s pretty level. I did change my shoes last week…new work shoes, more comfortable ones, but this swellin’ started after that. Could be somethin’ to do with that, maybe?
DOCTOR: That’s good information – the new shoes are worth noting. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any redness or warmth to the foot along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no redness. It doesn't feel warm either, just…puffy. Regular skin color, I guess. Maybe a little pale, now that I think about it, but that could just be from sittin’ so long. It's hard to say, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other symptoms associated with this?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no chills, no pain in my leg or anything. Just the foot, bein' big and kinda…there. I haven’t felt any different other than that, really. It's just worryin' me 'cause it keeps gettin’ bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or leg pain. Just the swelling, which is increasing. Let’s do a quick examination. If you don’t mind, I'm going to gently feel around your foot and ankle to assess the swelling and check your pulses. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I don't mind at all. Just tell me if you need me to do somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling your pulses now… good, both are present. The swelling is definitely localized to the medial aspect of your foot, primarily around the navicular bone. It's soft to the touch, not hard. I don’t feel any significant tenderness when I press around it, but there is some mild discomfort with range of motion. I'm also checking the skin temperature...it feels normal. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, it could be a sprain or a soft tissue injury, possibly exacerbated by the new shoes. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of, anyway. I haven’t taken anything for a while. Just a little painkiller sometimes for my back, but that's it. And that was ages ago. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ at all. I try to stay away from pills if I can help it. Just a little coffee in the mornin', that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No medications. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an X-ray of your foot to rule out a fracture. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine, Doctor. I can do that. Whatever you think is best. I just wanna get this sorted, if you know what I mean. It’s just been gettin' worse, and I don’t want it to be somethin’ serious. Where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, room 203. I'll send the order over electronically, and they'll be expecting you. It should only take a few minutes. Once they’ve taken the images, they’ll send them back to me, and we’ll discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend you elevate your foot as much as possible and avoid any strenuous activity. We'll also discuss some pain management options if you experience any discomfort while you’re waiting. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good for now, Doctor. Just gettin’ the X-ray is the main thing, I suppose. Thank you for seein’ me so quickly. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. I'm glad we were able to get this addressed. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Just head down to room 203, and let them know I sent you. I’ll be here when you get back, and we’ll take it from there. Do you need help getting to room 203?
PATIENT: No, I think I can find it. It's just down the hall, right? I’m good, thank you. I'll see you in a bit, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Wonderful. Please don't hesitate to let the technician or the front desk know if you have any difficulty finding the room or experience any pain while walking. I’ll see you shortly.
