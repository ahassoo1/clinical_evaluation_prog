DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy feels… big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. It's just… not good. I feel tired, too, but… old people get tired, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your tummy feels bigger than usual, you're not very hungry, and you've been feeling tired. It’s good you came in to get this checked out, even if it is sometimes just part of getting older. Let's try to figure out what's going on. When you say your tummy feels big, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Big… like a balloon, maybe? Not painful, just… full. It started… oh, I don't know when, really. A few weeks, maybe? It feels harder than it used to. I don't remember exactly… things aren't so clear anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of feeling fuller and harder than usual. That's helpful. And no pain, which is good. It's alright that you're not sure about the exact timing, Soila. Memory can definitely be tricky. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. What does that mean? Do you mean… going to the bathroom? It's… regular, I think. Not different, not more, not less. Just… normal. Old lady normal, anyway.
DOCTOR: Yes, I did mean going to the bathroom. "Bowel habits" is just medical talk for that. Thank you for clarifying that it’s been normal for you. That's good to know. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Let me see. Oh! Yes, a little. Not much, but my shoes are tighter than they used to be. It's been like that for a while, though. I thought it was just my feet getting wider with age. Old age does strange things to a body, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does! Okay, so some swelling in your legs and ankles that’s been gradual. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, you already asked about appetite… I don't want to eat. Not hungry. Everything tastes… like nothing, almost. And I think I've lost weight. My clothes are… looser, yes. But I haven't… stood on a scale. Not for a long time. It’s hard to keep track of things when you live alone, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right, I apologize for repeating myself. It’s easy to get lost in the questions. Okay, so decreased appetite, things don’t taste as good, and you think you’ve lost some weight. That’s all very important information. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should know about?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s a long time ago. I used to… I think I had high blood pressure, once. A long time ago, though. The doctor gave me pills. I took them for a while, and then… I don’t remember. And my heart… the doctor said it was a little weak, but that was years and years ago. I don't see doctors much anymore. It's all so blurry. I try to stay healthy, though. I eat my soup, and I walk a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and a weak heart, both in the past. And you've been trying to stay healthy with soup and walking, which is wonderful. Have you had any surgeries or been in the hospital before?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! When I broke my arm, a long time ago. Fell off a fence, silly thing. And… I think I was in the hospital once, when I was very old, but I don't remember why. It was just for a few days, I think. Everything is so… fuzzy. It was a long time ago. Doesn’t matter now, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils out as a child, broke your arm, and a brief hospital stay sometime in the past. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… no. Not really. I used to take something for my arthritis, but… it didn’t help much, so I stopped. And sometimes I take a little vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on, but that’s it. Just soup and rest, mostly. Old remedies are best, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications other than occasional Vitamin C. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don't think so. I eat everything. And I haven't had any trouble with medicines, not that I remember. Maybe a little bit of a stomach ache sometimes, but nothing serious. I'm a pretty sturdy old woman, you know. Everything has to be tested these days, yes?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you, Soila, that's all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your legs for swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones are a little… creaky.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, Soila, I’ve listened to your heart and lungs, felt your abdomen, and checked your legs. Your heart rhythm is a little irregular, and I hear a mild murmur. Your lungs sound good. Your abdomen is a little full and tender, but not sharply painful. And your legs have some swelling, which is called edema. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be retaining some fluid, which can be causing the swelling in your legs and contributing to the fullness in your abdomen. The decreased appetite and weight loss are also concerning. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These tests will help us check your kidney function, liver function, and look for any signs of infection. We may also need to do an imaging scan of your abdomen, like an ultrasound or CT scan, to get a clearer picture of your organs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests… scans… it sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And… expensive? I don't have much money, Doctor. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It does sound complicated, and I apologize for that. The blood tests are just a simple needle prick, and the urine test is just collecting a sample. As for the imaging scan, it's generally painless, though we may need to use some contrast dye, which can feel a little cool. Regarding the cost, I know finances can be a worry. We can discuss options to help make it more affordable. This hospital has a financial assistance program, and we can also see if we can prioritize the most essential tests first. I will also ask our billing department to give you a clear estimate of the costs before we proceed with anything. It's absolutely not too much to ask to feel better, and that's exactly what I'm here to help you with. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly along the way. Would you like me to go ahead and order the blood tests and urine test for now?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, alright. Blood tests and… pee test. If you think it will help. Just… please be gentle. And explain everything, like you promised. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be as gentle as possible, and I promise to explain everything clearly. Okay, I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and urine test now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, or significant swelling, please don’t hesitate to call my office or go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You explained everything very well. Just… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old woman and her fuzzy memories. It means a lot. I think I just need to rest now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t apologize for your memories – you’ve lived a long life, and it’s perfectly natural for things to be a little fuzzy sometimes. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, just relax and take it easy. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to let the staff know. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, Soila.
