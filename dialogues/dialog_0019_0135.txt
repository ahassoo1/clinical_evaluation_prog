DOCTOR: Good morning, Gerhard. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you too. I… have problem with my ear. There is… liquid coming out. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid coming from your ear for about three days now. I see. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear liquid. Not blood. Not… thick. Just… water-like. And… it smells a little. Not good smell. I try to clean it, but it keeps coming. It does not hurt, but… feels full. Like pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear, watery liquid with a bit of an odor, started three days ago. No pain, just a feeling of fullness and pressure. That’s helpful. Have you had any fever, or any trouble with your hearing, or dizziness at all?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. I check. No dizziness. But… my hearing is… not so good in that ear. Not much different than before, but… maybe a little worse. It is hard to hear quiet sounds. Like… birds. I like to hear birds.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little bit of hearing loss in that ear, especially with quiet sounds. That’s good to know. And have you noticed any ringing in your ear at all?
PATIENT: Ringing? No. Not ringing. Sometimes… feels like… something moving inside. Very small. Like… bubble. But not always. It come and go. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Hmm, a sensation of something moving inside, like a bubble, coming and going. Yes, that is something we should take a look at. Have you had any ear infections before, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: I… think so. When I was young. Very long time ago. In Somalia. I was a small boy. Mother… she clean my ears. I do not remember much. It hurt then, I think. But I have not had problem since. Not until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of ear infections in childhood. That's good information to have. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No cold. No sinus. I feel… healthy. Except for ear. I eat good food. I sleep good. Maybe… a little tired now, but that is because I worry about ear. It is… strange. This liquid. I do not like it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gerhard. It is unsettling to have something unexpected happening with your body. Okay, let's take a look at your ear. I’m going to use an otoscope – it’s just a lighted instrument to look inside. It won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will be still. Lighted… instrument? Is like… small flashlight? I trust you, Doctor. Please be careful. My ear is… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerhard. I'm seeing some fluid in the ear canal, as you described. Your eardrum does look a little cloudy, and it's not moving quite as freely as it should be. There's also a little bit of… debris in there. It doesn't look like there's a hole or any major damage, thankfully. Based on what I’m seeing, it’s likely you have an ear infection, possibly with some fluid buildup. It's hard to be certain without a few more tests, though. Would you be comfortable with me checking your temperature and listening to your lungs, just to rule out anything else?
PATIENT: Temperature… and lungs? Yes, Doctor. If you think it is necessary. I want to know what is wrong. What… tests? Will they hurt? Is… serious? This infection? I worry… about my hearing. I like to hear.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry about your hearing, and that’s a very valid concern. Checking your temperature and listening to your lungs are quick and painless – just to make sure the infection hasn’t spread. As for tests, I’d like to do a quick hearing test – called an audiometry – and maybe a tympanometry, which measures how well your eardrum moves. Those aren't painful either. They’ll just involve wearing headphones and responding to sounds. As for how serious the infection is… most ear infections are treatable, especially when caught early. It’s good you came in when you did. If left untreated, it could lead to more serious issues, but we're not at that point yet. The biggest risk right now is temporary hearing loss, which usually resolves with treatment. Let’s start with the temperature and listening to your lungs, and then we can talk about the hearing test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Temperature… and lungs first. Then… hearing test. You explain very well. I trust you. Just… please be quick. I do not like to be sick. And… I hope my hearing is okay. I like to hear birds. Is… important to me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Gerhard. We’ll take it as quickly as we can. And I understand how important it is to you to hear – we’ll do everything we can to make sure your hearing stays protected. Your temperature is slightly elevated, 100.4 Fahrenheit. And your lungs sound clear, which is good. No sign of any congestion or infection there. Alright, let's move on to the hearing test. It’s just down the hall in the audiology room. It’s a quiet room, and a technician will walk you through everything. It will take about 20-30 minutes. Do you feel up to that now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I feel… okay. A little warm, but okay. Twenty… thirty minutes. Birds… I will think of birds. Can I… have water after the test? My mouth feels… dry. And… will you tell me the results right away? I do not like to wait.
DOCTOR: Of course, Gerhard. You can absolutely have water afterwards. And I will absolutely tell you the results right away. I’ll be here waiting for you. The technician, Sarah, is very good and will explain everything as she goes. Just follow the hall to your left, and you’ll see the audiology room. Sarah is expecting you. Don’t hesitate to let her know if you have any questions or feel uncomfortable at any point. Take your time, and I’ll see you shortly. I'm going to quickly make a note of our conversation to prepare for the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I… will go now. Birds… I hope to hear birds again.
DOCTOR: …60-year-old male, Somali descent, presenting with left ear discharge for three days. Clear, watery, with odor. Slight hearing loss, sensation of fullness. History of childhood ear infections. Slightly elevated temperature… Likely otitis media, but need audiometry to assess the extent of hearing loss… …And make a note to discuss the possibility of a referral to an ENT if the hearing test shows significant loss or if the infection doesn’t respond to initial treatment. Safety first. Always.
