DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time, okay? It’s my breath. It smells. Bad. Like… really bad. It’s embarrassing. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s definitely good you’re addressing it – bad breath can be frustrating. It's good to rule things out. "Smells bad" is a good start, but could you tell me a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, more? Fine. It’s… just always there. Morning, noon, night. Doesn't matter if I brush, floss… doesn’t matter what I eat. My ex-husband complained about it constantly. Honestly, probably one of the reasons we got divorced. Is that helpful enough? I really need to get back to work. We’re short-handed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it’s persistent, despite good oral hygiene, and doesn't seem related to anything specific you're eating. And it’s been going on for… how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. Years, probably. Honestly, I stopped keeping track. It's not like it's a new problem. It’s just… always there. Look, is there a quick fix for this or not? I’m a highway worker, not a dentist. I don’t have time for a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I want to assure you, we’ll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. While a quick fix would be ideal, sometimes persistent bad breath can be a sign of something else going on. It's good to rule out a few things. Before we jump to conclusions, could you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does that even mean? I work outside, I lift heavy things, I get eaten alive by mosquitoes… I'm reasonably healthy for someone doing my job. I don’t sit around all day. I don’t have any fancy diseases, if that’s what you’re asking. No, I haven’t seen a doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I just deal with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, "deal with things" - I hear you. That’s pretty common. But sometimes things need a little extra attention. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bad breath?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t get fevers or anything. My teeth hurt sometimes, but that’s probably from chewing on ice. I get tired, obviously, it’s a hard job. And my stomach… it doesn’t always agree with me, let’s just say that. But everyone has stomach problems, right? This is getting ridiculous. Are you going to actually do something, or just ask me questions forever?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few things to work with, thank you. The stomach issues are good to know. And yes, we're getting there. Let's do a quick exam, just to check things out. I'd like to take a look at your mouth and listen to your lungs, just as a starting point. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just hurry it up. I have a pothole waiting for me. And don't make me open wide and say "ah" like some kid with a sore throat. This is embarrassing enough as it is.
DOCTOR: No "ah" required, I promise. We’ll just take a quick peek. Alright, if you could just lean back... I'm just going to take a look at your mouth and tongue, and then listen to your breathing. Okay... Your gums look a little inflamed, and I see some coating on your tongue. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 128/82, pulse is 76. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Inflamed gums? Probably from all the coffee I drink. Look, I’m not a delicate flower. And no, I don’t have any allergies. I work outside all day, remember? I’m exposed to everything. Dust, pollen, mosquito bites… the whole shebang. What does this even mean? Are you going to prescribe me mouthwash and send me on my way? Because that’s just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Coffee can certainly contribute to gum irritation. And you're right, being outdoors exposes you to a lot. Given the persistent bad breath despite good hygiene, inflamed gums, and the occasional stomach issues, it could be a few things. It's unlikely to be a simple case. It could be a mild case of gingivitis, or a sign of something affecting your sinuses, or even something related to your stomach. To be safe, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count to rule out anything systemic, and a referral to a dentist for a thorough cleaning and evaluation of your gums. I also think it would be worth checking in with a gastroenterologist about your stomach issues. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Tests? A dentist? A gastroenterologist? Are you serious right now? This is turning into a whole thing. I just wanted to know if there was a magical mouthwash. Look, I don’t have time for all this. And I certainly don’t have the money. I’m divorced, remember? Things are… tight. Just tell me if it’s serious or not. Is my breath going to kill someone? That’s all I need to know. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear your frustration and I completely understand your concerns about time and money. It’s not about a "magical mouthwash," and I wouldn’t want to dismiss your concerns. No, your breath isn’t going to kill anyone, but persistent bad breath can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health issue. The tests will help us determine if there is anything we need to address. Given your financial situation, I can write you a referral to a low-cost dental clinic and provide information on affordable gastroenterology options. We can also start with a simple prescription for a therapeutic mouthwash to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. Would you be open to that?
