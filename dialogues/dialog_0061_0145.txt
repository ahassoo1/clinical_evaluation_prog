DOCTOR: "Bula Lonell, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Kimm. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because… well, my daughter, she believes I should have some assistance at home. She says something about… eligibility for help? I am not quite sure all the details, to be honest. She arranged this visit.
DOCTOR: "That's perfectly alright, Lonell. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful, and wants to make sure you have the support you need. It's common to feel a little unsure when these things are first brought up. We can definitely explore what options are available to help at home. So, just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit about why your daughter thinks you might benefit from some assistance?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… difficult to explain. I am a surgeon, you see. Pediatric. I was very active, always working. But… my hands, they are not as steady as they once were. It makes… certain procedures difficult. I retired six months ago, but I still try to help around the house, you know? Gardening, small repairs. But… I drop things. More than I used to. And sometimes… I forget where I put my tools. Nothing serious, but… enough to worry my daughter, it seems. She says it’s a safety concern.
DOCTOR: "I understand. That sounds frustrating, Lonell, especially after a long and dedicated career like yours. It's good you're aware of these changes, and your daughter is right to be proactive. It's always best to address things early on. So, these changes in your hands and with your memory… have they been gradual, or did they seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, Doctor. Very gradual. I noticed it first, perhaps… a year ago? A slight tremor when I was tying sutures. I dismissed it as fatigue, honestly. Long hours, stressful work. But it… persisted. And then, maybe six months ago, I misplaced my glasses… several times a day. Small things, really. But they added up. I assure you, my mind is still quite sharp – I remember every surgery I’ve performed, every patient – but… everyday tasks are becoming… more challenging.
DOCTOR: "That's helpful to know, Lonell. It sounds like it's been a slow progression, which is important. And it’s good you’re able to recall details so clearly – that is a good sign. Now, besides the tremor and misplacing things, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My daughter mentioned… my appetite. She says I am not eating as much as I used to. And… I sleep more. Much more. Not unwell sleep, just… tired. I used to be a very energetic man. Always busy. Now… I find myself napping in the afternoon. And sometimes I feel… a little sad, though I cannot pinpoint a reason. It is not depression, I do not believe. Just… a general feeling of… weariness.
DOCTOR: "Okay, that gives me a more complete picture, Lonell. So, decreased appetite, increased sleepiness, and a general feeling of weariness, along with the tremor and memory issues. Have you had any changes in your vision, or any difficulty with balance or walking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My vision is… adequate. I wear reading glasses, of course, but that is simply age. And my balance is… fine. I walk without difficulty. I still enjoy a stroll in the garden, though I do not do it as often as I used to. No falls, no dizziness. Nothing like that. And my speech… is this clear enough? I worry about sounding… confused.
DOCTOR: "You're perfectly clear, Lonell. No concerns there at all. It's good to hear you haven't experienced any issues with vision, balance, or walking. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I was diagnosed about ten years ago. I take medication for it, and it is… generally well-controlled. My doctor in France monitored it closely. No diabetes, no heart problems. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, but that was many years ago. Otherwise… remarkably healthy, considering my age and profession. I always took care of myself, ate well, exercised. Until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so high blood pressure, well-managed with medication, and an appendectomy in your childhood. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes. Just one other. A small dose of something for… arthritis. In my hands, mostly. It helps with the stiffness, but… not with the tremor, naturally. It is a cream, I rub it on at night. My French doctor prescribed it. I believe it is called… diclofenac. Something like that. It's been quite some time since I looked at the label.
DOCTOR: "Okay, diclofenac cream for arthritis in your hands. And you said your blood pressure medication is well-controlled?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As far as I know. I have regular check-ups with my French doctor – well, had regular check-ups. It has been… difficult to arrange appointments since I retired and moved here. But I take my medication as prescribed, and I have not experienced any… unpleasant side effects. My daughter monitors it sometimes with a machine at home, the blood pressure machine. She is very conscientious.
DOCTOR: "That's good to hear, and it sounds like you have a very supportive daughter. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she had some memory problems in her later years, but it was never formally diagnosed. She simply… became forgetful. My father was very healthy, lived to be ninety. No Parkinson's, as far as I know. My sister… she has high blood pressure, like me. But… no neurological conditions that I am aware of. It is not something we discussed much in my family. We were… a practical people. Not given to worrying about such things.
DOCTOR: "Okay, so some memory issues in your mother, high blood pressure in your sister, but no known neurological conditions in the family. That’s helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. And I drink… very little alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Mostly, I drink water. My daughter… discourages me from drinking wine, actually. She says it might interfere with my medication. I do not mind, honestly. I do not particularly enjoy it. I prefer water with a slice of lemon. It is much healthier.
DOCTOR: "That's good to hear, Lonell. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. That’s excellent. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I have never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. No food allergies, no environmental allergies. Remarkably unremarkable, really. My daughter always asks me this question, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. Perhaps it is a testament to a healthy lifestyle. Or perhaps… just good luck.
DOCTOR: "That's wonderful, Lonell. No known allergies. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a brief neurological exam – check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it is necessary. I will do my best to cooperate. I trust your judgment. Though… I confess, I am a little nervous. It has been some time since my last thorough examination. But I am in your capable hands.
DOCTOR: "Alright, Lonell. Just relax, and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72, regular. Let me listen to your heart and lungs now… Deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. I'll lightly tap on your tendons, and you just let your leg relax… Okay, good. And now, let's check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can close my eyes. It is… difficult. I feel a bit… wobbly. Perhaps I should hold onto something? I am not accustomed to standing like this. It makes me feel… vulnerable. But I will try my best to remain still. Do not worry if I stumble, Doctor. I am an old man, after all.
DOCTOR: “That’s alright, Lonell. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsteady. Just hold still as best you can. I’m here to support you. I see a slight tremor in your hands when you stand, and a bit of unsteadiness… It's subtle, but it's there. Now, let’s try a simple coordination test. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. It is… not as smooth as it once was. My hand… it does not seem to obey my commands quite as readily. But I believe I have managed it. Is that satisfactory? Do I need to repeat it? I apologize for my clumsiness.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Lonell. It’s not about being ‘clumsy’. I’m just assessing your coordination. There is a noticeable tremor, and a slight hesitation in your movements. Okay, let's finish with a quick mental assessment. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? It is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I am quite certain of that. My daughter and I were discussing it this morning. We were planning a small outing, you see. But… I believe that is correct. Is that satisfactory, Doctor? I sometimes worry about my memory, but I recall dates quite well. It is the small things… the everyday things… that are more difficult.
DOCTOR: “That’s correct, Lonell. August 2nd, 2025. And you recalled it perfectly. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, you’re experiencing a gradual decline in your hand coordination with some associated memory concerns. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that’s likely related to your existing condition. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. They may want to consider imaging, like an MRI of the brain, to rule out any other underlying causes. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Blood tests, a neurologist… I trust your judgment. Anything that might help determine the cause of these… changes… is worthwhile. My daughter will be pleased that you are being so thorough. She is very proactive, as I have mentioned. Please proceed with the tests and the referral. I will follow your instructions carefully. Will you be contacting me with the results, or should I contact my daughter? She handles most of my appointments.
DOCTOR: “Excellent. I’ll order the blood tests right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. I’ll also prepare a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-regarded neurologist in the area. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you and your daughter with all the details – appointment times, lab results, and any necessary paperwork. In the meantime, it’s important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And please, be mindful of activities that might put you at risk of falling – things like climbing ladders or reaching for high shelves. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Lonell?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and your attention to detail. My daughter will undoubtedly have many questions, but I do not… at the moment. Perhaps after the tests, I will have a clearer understanding of what is happening. Thank you again for your assistance. I feel… reassured, despite my anxieties.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Lonell. I’m glad I could reassure you. Remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your appointment with the neurologist. Sarah will be in touch shortly. Have a good day, and please, take care. If you feel dizzy or unsteady at any point, please contact your daughter or call 911 immediately. "
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I shall await Sarah’s call. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: “Goodbye, Lonell. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon.”
