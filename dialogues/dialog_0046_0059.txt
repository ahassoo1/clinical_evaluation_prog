DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. My speech… it hasn’t been quite right lately. It feels… slurred, sometimes. That’s why I scheduled the appointment, I believe. I don’t entirely recall when it started, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Swaby. It’s understandable that it can be difficult to pinpoint when something like that began. Slurred speech is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. Hmm… it's not always slurred, you see. It seems to come and go. And… well, my husband says it’s more noticeable when I’m tired, perhaps? Or… when I’ve been talking for a while. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully. Just… sounds different, I suppose. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest. I don’t remember if I’ve always spoken this way.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Swaby. It’s concerning when something feels off, especially with speech. And it’s helpful that your husband has noticed it’s more pronounced with fatigue or extended talking. To get a clearer picture, could you describe how it sounds different?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a tricky one. It’s… hard to explain. It’s not a stutter, not exactly. It’s like… the words don’t come out as clearly as they should. A bit muffled, maybe? Or… like I’m not forming the sounds properly. My husband says it sounds like I'm speaking with something in my mouth, sometimes. I truly don't know, Doctor. It's just… off. I apologize for being so vague. My memory hasn’t been the best lately, either.
DOCTOR: You’re not being vague at all, Ms. Swaby. It sounds like you’re describing a subtle difficulty with articulation, and it’s perfectly normal to have trouble pinpointing these things. The fact that it’s intermittent and potentially worse with fatigue is important information. And you mentioning recent memory concerns is also relevant. To get a better understanding of the overall picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I believe… I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. My husband handles most of the medical paperwork, so I’m not always entirely aware of everything. I think I have high blood pressure, but I take medication for it. And… I had a surgery a few years ago, on my knee. That’s all I can recall at the moment, Doctor. I apologize again for my… lapses. Would my husband’s information be helpful? Perhaps he remembers more details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It’s very common for patients to not recall all the details of their medical history, and it’s good you’re taking medication for high blood pressure. Your husband’s input would absolutely be helpful, if he's available. But let's continue with what you do remember for now. You mentioned a knee surgery a few years ago. Do you recall when that was, and what it was for?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was… approximately three years ago, I believe. I tripped and fell, and badly injured my knee. It was quite painful. I needed… a repair, I think. Something about a torn ligament. I was in a cast for several weeks, and then I had physiotherapy. It's much better now, thankfully. I can walk normally, although it sometimes aches after a lot of walking. It wasn’t a major operation, as far as I recall. I don't think it's related to the speech problem, though. Is it relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear your knee is functioning well now. While it’s unlikely to be directly related to the speech issue, it’s important to have a complete picture. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as stroke, neurological disorders, or speech problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's another difficult one. My mother… she had diabetes, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems, unfortunately. He passed away a few years ago. As for neurological conditions or speech problems… I don’t recall anyone in my family having those. My mother didn’t really discuss health matters much, and I wasn't particularly close to my father. I truly don't know, Doctor. It's possible, but I have no specific recollection of it. My apologies. It feels as though my brain is a bit foggy today.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Swaby. You’re providing as much information as you can, and that's what’s important. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never smoked in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a fairly… quiet person, Doctor. I enjoy gardening and spending time with my husband. We live a very simple, peaceful life. I don’t really socialize much. Is that helpful information?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Swaby. It’s good to know you don’t smoke, and you only drink alcohol occasionally. Now, let’s discuss any medications you are currently taking. You mentioned you take something for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name and dosage, if you know it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. The name… it begins with an ‘A’, I believe. Amlodipine, perhaps? Yes, that sounds right. And the dosage… I believe it's 5 milligrams, once a day. My husband handles the refills, so I’m not entirely sure. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And… I occasionally take paracetamol for headaches, but that’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many medications, if possible. I apologize for my vagueness, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ms. Swaby. Amlodipine 5mg daily is a common medication for high blood pressure. Now, finally, let's discuss any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, thankfully, no. I don’t believe I have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications or foods. And I haven’t had any problems with pollen or dust. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I can enjoy flowers and the outdoors without any concerns. I truly don’t believe I have any allergies, Doctor. Is there anything else I can tell you?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Swaby. No known allergies is good to know. Okay, thank you for providing me with all of that information. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment, which will include checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I’ll also look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I’m ready whenever you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have a few gardening tasks I’d like to complete this afternoon. But please, take your time and do whatever is necessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Swaby. Your blood pressure is a little high today, but that's not uncommon if you’re feeling anxious or stressed. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6°F. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and your coordination seems good overall. However, I did notice a slight slowness in your speech when you counted. It's subtle, but it’s consistent with what you’ve described. I’m also going to check your cranial nerves. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can, Doctor. It’s… a bit difficult to focus, perhaps? My eyesight isn't what it used to be. But I believe I’m following it correctly. I’m trying my best. Is that alright? It feels… strange, concentrating so hard on something so simple. I hope I’m not making this difficult for you.
DOCTOR: You’re not making this difficult at all, Ms. Swaby. It’s perfectly normal for vision to change with age. And you're doing very well. Your facial movements are symmetrical, and your hearing seems intact. Swallowing appears normal as well. Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Okay, Ms. Swaby. That completes the physical examination. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of the examination, I’m concerned about a possible neurological issue that could be affecting your speech. The slight slowness in your articulation, combined with your recent memory concerns, warrants further investigation. I'm not prepared to give a definitive diagnosis at this point, however.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A neurological issue? That sounds… rather serious, Doctor. Is it… something I should be very worried about? I truly hadn't considered anything so… significant. I thought it was perhaps just fatigue, or the stress of managing the garden. What sort of investigation are you thinking of? And… what are the potential causes? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m naturally a bit anxious. Perhaps my blood pressure is elevated because of this worry?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’re anxious, Ms. Swaby, and you’re right to ask questions. It’s important to be informed. And yes, your blood pressure could certainly be elevated due to worry. At this stage, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. A range of conditions could be causing your symptoms. Potential causes could include a transient ischemic attack – often called a TIA or “mini-stroke,” a stroke, early signs of Parkinson’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis, or a less common neurological condition. It could also be related to a medication side effect, although you are only taking Amlodipine which isn't typically associated with these symptoms. It's also possible it's something else entirely. To investigate further, I recommend an MRI of the brain to get a detailed look at the structures of your brain and identify any abnormalities. I also recommend a consultation with a neurologist for a comprehensive neurological evaluation. They can perform more specialized tests, such as nerve conduction studies, and assess your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. Would you be comfortable with these next steps?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a neurologist? Oh, goodness. That sounds… rather involved, Doctor. And rather frightening, if I’m honest. I hadn't anticipated anything like this. Is an MRI… painful? And will it take long? And what exactly does a neurologist do? I understand you’re recommending these tests, and I trust your judgment, but I’m naturally a bit apprehensive. And… would these tests involve a hospital stay? I haven’t been in a hospital in many years. I suppose… if it's necessary to determine the cause, I am willing to proceed. But please, tell me everything I can expect. The more information I have, the less anxious I will be. And… are there any alternative tests we could consider? Perhaps something less… invasive?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask these questions, Ms. Swaby. It’s important to feel informed and comfortable with any medical procedures. An MRI is not painful. You’ll lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it uses radio waves and strong magnetic fields to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a bit loud, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-60 minutes, but it’s generally well-tolerated. You won't need to stay overnight. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in disorders of the nervous system – the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. They'll conduct a thorough neurological examination, assess your reflexes, coordination, strength, and cognitive function, and review your medical history. They may also order additional tests, such as nerve conduction studies. Currently, an MRI is the best initial test to rule out serious conditions and determine the cause of your symptoms. While there are other tests, such as a CT scan, they don’t provide the same level of detail as an MRI. I understand your apprehension about a hospital stay, but these tests are typically performed on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day. I can provide you with referrals to a reputable imaging center and a qualified neurologist in the area. Would you like me to do that now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be most appreciated. Referrals to both an imaging center and a neurologist would be wonderful. And… if you have any information about them – perhaps their specializations or patient reviews – that would be very helpful as well. I suppose… it’s best to rule everything out. And you’re right, I should trust your expertise. It’s just… the thought of something serious is quite unsettling. Thank you for being so patient and understanding, Doctor. You’ve eased my anxieties considerably. I suppose… I should prepare myself for these tests, then. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Perhaps anything I should avoid? Or any symptoms I should be particularly mindful of?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. I’m glad I could ease your anxieties. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsettled, and I’m here to support you through this process. I will provide you with the contact information for two highly-regarded imaging centers and neurologists in the area, along with their specializations and links to patient reviews. One of the neurologists specializes in movement disorders, which may be particularly relevant given your symptoms. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid any strenuous physical activity or tasks that require intense concentration. Please continue taking your Amlodipine as prescribed. Most importantly, be mindful of any new or worsening symptoms, such as: Sudden weakness or numbness on one side of your body Difficulty speaking or understanding speech Vision changes Severe headache Loss of balance or coordination If you experience any of these symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. I will also send you a summary of our conversation and the referral information via email. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been exceptionally thorough and helpful. Thank you once again for your patience and understanding. I feel much more prepared now, and less anxious. I suppose… I’ll schedule the MRI and neurology appointment as soon as possible. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Swaby. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results of your tests with you. Take care, and have a good day.
