DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s August 2nd. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let's get this over with. It's… something in my mouth. It’s quite bothersome, really. I haven't the foggiest idea what it is, but it's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’d like to get to the bottom of this quickly. “Something in your mouth” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… white. Patches, you see? On my tongue, mostly. And it’s… irritating. Makes it difficult to eat, particularly anything with any sort of spice. Honestly, it’s rather undignified. I've tried rinsing, but it doesn't seem to do much good. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches on your tongue, mostly, causing irritation and difficulty eating, especially with spice. You’ve tried rinsing. How long have you noticed these patches, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A week, maybe? It's hard to say precisely. Time isn't something I spend dwelling on. It just… appeared, one day. I assumed it would go away on its own. It hasn't, obviously. Frankly, I find it quite bothersome to be discussing this at all.
DOCTOR: A week or so. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the patches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? It hurts when I eat, as I already said. And it looks… unsightly. Is that what you're getting at? I haven’t developed a fever or anything dramatic, if that’s what you’re fishing for. Honestly, I'm a busy man; I don't have time for a comprehensive inventory of every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever. Just the pain with eating and the visual appearance of the patches. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of taste?
PATIENT: Changes in my taste? Goodness, no. I have perfectly good taste, thank you very much. I simply haven’t noticed anything different. I eat… well, I eat good food. It’s hardly something I focus on analyzing. Really, are you going to ask me about every minor bodily function?
DOCTOR: Alright. I appreciate your patience. Would you mind if I take a quick look inside your mouth?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t see the point. You’ve asked me a few simple questions, I’ve answered them. I fail to see how poking around in my mouth is going to solve anything. But… fine. Get it over with. Quickly, please. I have appointments.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I'll be as quick as possible. Please open wide and say "Ah." Okay, I see the patches you described. They’re quite prominent. They don't seem to be easily rubbed off, and there’s a little redness around them. Have you been using any new mouthwashes or toothpastes recently?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not! I use the same products I’ve used for years. Sensible, high-quality brands. I wouldn’t dream of experimenting with anything… inferior. This is all rather undignified, you know. Are you sure you can’t just tell me what this is and prescribe something? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Based on what you've told me and what I've seen, it could be oral lichen planus, or possibly a fungal infection like oral thrush. However, it's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. To be certain, I'd like to order a scraping to send to the lab for a microscopic examination. That will confirm whether it's a fungal infection or another cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A scraping? More poking around? Honestly, this is becoming ridiculous. Look, I haven’t got time for “investigations.” Just give me something for it. An antifungal, perhaps? I read something online about those. Surely that can't hurt? I’d really prefer to avoid any further… procedures. I have important business to attend to. Frankly, I'm beginning to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your frustration and your desire for a quick solution. However, prescribing medication without a clear diagnosis isn’t best practice. While an antifungal might help if it is a fungal infection, it won’t be effective – and could even worsen things – if it’s something else. Oral lichen planus, for example, requires a different approach. I’m concerned about making an incorrect assessment. I want to ensure you receive the right treatment. Given your concerns, and since you’re uninsured, I can offer a referral to a dental specialist for a consultation. They can perform a more thorough evaluation and provide you with a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A referral? More waiting, more appointments… This is unacceptable. Look, I appreciate your… concern, but I think I’ve wasted enough time here. I’ll manage this myself. I’m a resourceful man. Just… give me a note for something – anything – for the pain. And I’d prefer not to discuss this any further. Good day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I understand your decision, though I still recommend seeking a proper diagnosis. I will write a prescription for a topical anesthetic to help manage the pain. Here you go. The instructions are on the label. Please be sure to read them carefully. If the pain worsens or doesn’t improve within a few days, please seek further medical attention. I wish you all the best, Mr. Schieber. .
