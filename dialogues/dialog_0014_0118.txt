DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Oriley. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… a certification, isn’t it? For my… work. Something about needing to be up-to-date. Honestly, the paperwork these days. It's all quite tedious. I believe it has something to do with my… ears, or perhaps my eyes. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. Do you have a record of it somewhere?
DOCTOR: A certification… ears or eyes… Yes, well, let’s see if we can pull up anything relevant. Though frankly, these administrative requests are rarely clear. Hmm. Nothing immediately obvious pops up under “certification” or related terms. You said it’s for work?
PATIENT: Yes, for work. Healthcare, you see. Important work. Though, not the sort where one handles patients directly, if you catch my meaning. More… behind the scenes. It’s… difficult to explain without delving into rather technical details. And honestly, my memory isn’t what it once was. Is it absolutely necessary I recall the precise nature of this certification? Perhaps the office sent a letter? A form, maybe? I do seem to recall a rather officious-looking woman at the front desk…
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we can certainly try to locate something. But honestly, Mr. Oriley, it makes my job considerably harder when details are… vague. I’m a physician, not a detective. Let's start with this: is this related to any sort of specific training or re-training you've undertaken recently?
PATIENT: Retraining… hmm. Not that I recall, specifically. I’ve always kept abreast of developments in the field, naturally. One must, to maintain a certain… standard. Though, whether that necessitates a formal retraining course… I honestly couldn't say. It's possible. Everything feels rather rushed these days, you know? Important things simply… slip one’s mind. Is this a particularly new requirement? Perhaps something imposed by… the board? It all feels very bureaucratic.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, “slipping one’s mind” isn’t a particularly helpful answer. The clinic needs documentation for this certification. Are you experiencing any difficulties with your vision or hearing currently?
PATIENT: Difficulties? Well… now that you mention it, things are a bit… muffled, perhaps? Not terribly, mind you. Just… not as crisp as they once were. And reading small print is becoming… strenuous. But that’s simply a consequence of age, wouldn’t you agree? A perfectly natural phenomenon. I wouldn't describe it as a difficulty, per se. More… a slight diminishing of faculties. Surely, that doesn't invalidate my professional standing?
DOCTOR: So, you are experiencing some changes in your hearing and vision. That's helpful, thank you. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure when someone is questioning a certification that requires specific sensory function. It'll only take a few minutes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your finger… yes, perfectly capable. Though I must say, this all seems rather… unnecessary. Is it truly required to subject a perfectly competent professional to such… rudimentary tests? I've passed far more challenging assessments in my career, I assure you. There. Am I not following adequately?
DOCTOR: Your tracking is… somewhat slow. And you seem to be losing focus quickly. Alright, now cover your right ear with your finger. I'm going to snap my fingers near your left ear. Tell me when you hear it.
PATIENT: Yes, yes… I heard it. Though, rather a loud snap, wasn’t it? One doesn’t require such… forceful stimulation to detect a sound. Honestly, I'm starting to feel as if I'm being assessed for some sort of… infirmity, rather than a routine certification. Is this truly the standard of care these days? It’s all rather… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now the right ear. Okay. And how would you rate your hearing overall, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being perfect?
PATIENT: Seven, perhaps? Though, I maintain that’s a rather generous assessment, given the… boisterous nature of your testing method. I do occasionally request individuals to repeat themselves, it’s true. But that’s simply a matter of… enunciation, I assure you. And background noise, naturally. One cannot expect perfect clarity in a bustling environment. Seven seems… reasonable. Though, I still fail to understand why this is necessary for a simple certification. It's all rather… excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, you are exhibiting signs of mild hearing loss in both ears, and some difficulty with visual tracking. This is necessary to determine if you meet the requirements for this certification, whatever it may be. We need to rule out any underlying issues that could affect your ability to perform your job safely and effectively. I’m going to recommend a formal audiological evaluation and a comprehensive eye exam. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: Formal evaluations? Really? For a little certification? Honestly, this is preposterous. I’ve been perfectly capable in my profession for decades, thank you very much. I assure you, my abilities have not diminished to the point where I require such… extensive scrutiny. It’s simply unnecessary paperwork, driven by… well, I won’t speculate. I suppose I can consider it, but I strongly object to the implication that my competency is in question. And I expect a detailed explanation of why this is deemed necessary. And frankly, I expect the clinic to cover the costs. It's hardly my fault if administrative procedures are so… convoluted. Now, what exactly does this certification entail? Perhaps if I knew the specifics, I could better understand this… charade. .
