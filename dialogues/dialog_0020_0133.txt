DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be quick about it, I need some forms signed and…verified, I guess? They're for my health, and I just need a notary, really. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, forms. I can certainly take a look. Though, I am a physician, not a notary public, so I can review the medical content and verify that aspect, but I can't officially "notarize" them. Is this for a specific program or reason?
PATIENT: Oh! See, that’s what I meant. Verify the health parts. I just… sometimes I don’t explain myself well. It’s for a senior assistance program. They need a doctor to say I’m…well, to confirm what's on the forms, I suppose. It’s a lot of paperwork, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, paperwork can be…extensive. Absolutely, I can review the forms and confirm the medical information. Let’s take a look at them together. Do you have them with you, or are they somewhere else?
PATIENT: Right here. I tried to keep them all together. It's a mess, I apologize. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I didn't want to lose anything!
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Melvenia. It’s perfectly understandable. Please, have a seat, and we’ll go through them at your pace. I’ll do my best to decipher everything. Let’s start with the first page…
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s mostly about…well, my blood pressure and some arthritis in my knees. And a little about my vision, as you can see. I hope it’s not too much trouble. I just want to get this assistance…it would really help with the bills.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure, arthritis, and vision. Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Do you currently monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I used to, but the machine…it broke. And honestly, I just haven’t gotten around to replacing it. I get it checked at the pharmacy sometimes, when I pick up my prescriptions. They tell me it's usually a little high, but nothing too bad, they say. Do you need me to bring a list of my medications? I have it written down somewhere…
DOCTOR: That's alright for now, we can get that information later if needed. It would be helpful to get a current reading though. Would you mind if I took your blood pressure here, just to have a baseline?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead. I suppose it's good to know for sure. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be. Everything seems to ache these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relax your arm. Deep breaths, if you can. Alright, your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 160 over 90. Do you experience any symptoms with your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? No, not really. Sometimes a little headache, but I just thought it was from the heat. And maybe a little dizziness when I stand up too fast. But nothing too serious. I just figured it was old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: It's good you've noticed these symptoms, Melvenia. While it could be related to age, high blood pressure consistently above 140/90 does require attention. The headaches and dizziness could be linked. Do you have a history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. See, I knew I should have replaced that machine. My mother…she had some trouble with her heart when she was older. She always said it was from all the stress. She didn't take care of herself, always working. I think my father did too, but I don't remember much about his health. It was a long time ago. I always tried to be healthy, but…life happens, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Family history is important, and it sounds like there's a predisposition there. The fact that you've noticed some symptoms and have a history of high blood pressure, even if infrequent, means we should investigate further. Let's talk about your arthritis. You mentioned pain in your knees…can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s mostly a dull ache, you know? Especially in the mornings, or when it rains. It gets stiff, and it's hard to get up and move around. Sometimes it swells up a little, but not too bad. It just…makes everything harder. Walking, climbing stairs…even getting out of a chair. I’ve tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they don't always help. It's just a part of getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have some typical symptoms of osteoarthritis. We can certainly discuss some options for managing that pain. But before we do, I'd like to ask a few more general questions about your health. Have you had any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh yes, actually. It's been getting worse lately. Things are blurry, especially up close. I have to hold things further away to read them, and even then it's a struggle. I went to the eye doctor a few months ago, and they said it was cataracts. They said I needed surgery, but…well, it's expensive, and I don’t have insurance. It's just another thing.
DOCTOR: Cataracts are very common as we age, and surgery is often the best solution. It’s unfortunate about the cost and insurance situation. Okay, so we have high blood pressure, osteoarthritis, and cataracts. Let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I take something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And a little blue pill for…well, for keeping me regular, you know? Constipation. And sometimes, when my arthritis is really bad, the doctor prescribed me something for the pain, but I try not to take it unless I absolutely have to. It makes me feel…fuzzy. That’s about it, I think. It’s hard to remember sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, a stool softener, and pain medication as needed. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in years! I think I’m okay on that front. Is that everything? I’m afraid I’m taking up too much of your time. I just want to get these forms signed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not taking up too much of my time at all. It's important to gather all this information. Alright, so to summarize, you have a history of high blood pressure, currently taking Lisinopril, osteoarthritis, cataracts, and you take a stool softener. You’ve also experienced some dizziness and headaches. Given your blood pressure reading and family history, I recommend we get an EKG and some blood work to rule out any underlying heart issues. We should also discuss a referral to an ophthalmologist to reassess your cataracts, and I can write you a prescription for a stronger stool softener. As for the forms, I can confirm the medical information on them is consistent with what you’ve told me today, but I won’t be able to officially “notarize” them. Would you like me to proceed with those orders?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That sounds like…a lot. But if you think it’s best, then yes, please. The EKG and blood work. And the referral to the eye doctor. I just…I want to get this assistance program. And if this is what I need to do, then I’ll do it. And yes, please confirm the forms. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I really do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Melvenia. It's my job to help. I’m ordering the EKG and blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. I’ll also print a referral for an ophthalmologist, and I’ll have the nurse give you the information on how to schedule an appointment. As soon as the lab results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a treatment plan. And I'll sign the forms confirming your medical history. Just to be safe, if you experience any chest pain, severe dizziness, or shortness of breath before your follow-up appointment, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds…serious. But yes, okay. I’ll remember that. Chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath…Emergency room. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I suppose I should go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: Yes, please go to the lab. They’re expecting you. And don’t hesitate to ask the nurse if you need any help or have questions before you go. She’s just outside the door. We’ll get this sorted out, Melvenia. Don’t worry. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything.
