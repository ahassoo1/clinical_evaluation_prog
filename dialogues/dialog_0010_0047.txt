DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Uh... well, it’s about... long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. Said I needed to get checked out for... insurance. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I just... want to make sure things are okay for when I get older, you know? It's hard to remember what she said exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if details are a little unclear – that's what I'm here for. So, your daughter scheduled this appointment as a general check-up, focusing on long-term health and insurance considerations. Is that a fair summary?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. She was worried about... things. About me being alone, I guess. She’s a good girl, my Sarah. Always looking out for me. I mostly just do... work. Moving things around. Out at the docks. It keeps me busy, but... well, it's not the easiest thing to explain. I don't really think about the future much, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Rover. Many people focus on the present. And it’s good that you’re staying active at the docks. Let's start with a quick overview of your current health. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm... Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But I’ve always been tired after a long day of work. My back aches a bit, but that’s just... old age, I suppose. Nothing I can’t work through. I don't get sick much, though. Knock on wood. Is that what you mean by symptoms? Like, feeling bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Anything like shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, headaches, changes in your appetite or weight, or any problems with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Sometimes, when I'm lifting really heavy stuff, I get a little winded, but that's just from the effort, I think. Chest pain, no. Dizziness… maybe a little when I stand up too fast, but everyone gets that, right? Headaches… not often. Appetite's okay, I guess. I eat when I'm hungry. Weight… I don’t know. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time. And my hearing… well, it ain’t what it used to be, but I can still hear fine enough to get by. Is that helpful? I’m trying to remember what Sarah told me the doctor would ask… it’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Rover. You have a good memory, recalling all of that. Just to clarify, the dizziness happens when you stand up quickly, and your hearing has gradually decreased over time. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… and bladder…? Oh. Uh… well, I go to the bathroom. When I need to. Everything seems… normal. I don’t really… talk about that with anyone. Is that something I need to talk about? I'm sorry, Doc. It's just… personal. I just move boxes and stuff all day, I don’t really think about… that stuff. It’s been okay, as far as I know. Never had any problems. I think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. It is a personal topic, and you’re not obligated to share anything you’re uncomfortable with. I simply ask to get a complete picture of your health. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor at the clinic back home… he gave me some pills, a long time ago. I don't remember why. I stopped taking them after a while, they made me feel… funny. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never had to worry about sugar. Heart disease… not that I know of. Arthritis… my joints ache sometimes, like I said, but I thought that was just getting old. It's hard to remember everything. I haven't been to a proper doctor in… years. Mostly just the clinic nurse for check-ups. And she didn't talk much about… conditions.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I think… when I was a kid, I had my tonsils taken out. That’s all I can remember. And… maybe my appendix? But I was so young, I don’t really know for sure. Hospitalized… not really. I broke my arm once, falling off a roof when I was a teenager, but they just set it in a cast at the clinic. Never had to stay overnight or anything. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Family… My… my wife, she got sick. A long time ago. Cancer. It took her quick. And my… my father, he got… confused, towards the end. He didn't remember things. Sarah said that might have been Alzheimer’s, but I don’t know much about it. He lived back home, and I wasn't there much. My mother… she was always healthy, as far as I know. Strong woman. I don’t really know about anyone else. My family… we weren’t close. Lots of distance. Is this important, Doc? It’s… hard to talk about.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Rover, but only if you're comfortable sharing. Knowing your family history can help us understand your potential risks. But it's perfectly alright if you’d rather not discuss it further. Let's move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. And I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. But not regularly. And… no, definitely no drugs. Never had any interest in that. I just… work. And when I'm not working, I try to get some rest. Sometimes I go fishing, but not as much as I used to. It's getting harder to get around. Mostly, I just like being quiet. Is that the kind of thing you need to know, Doc?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Rover. Knowing your lifestyle habits helps me get a complete picture of your health. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, and nothing’s ever bothered me. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to any medicine either. I’ve taken some pills here and there for headaches or colds, but nothing serious. I get bug bites when I’m working outside, but that’s just… normal, right? I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Never been much of a sickly person.
DOCTOR: Well, that's all very helpful information, Mr. Rover. Thank you for sharing. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just routine things – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking in your ears and eyes, and feeling your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doc. Just… let me know if it’s gonna hurt. I ain’t as young as I used to be, you know? My back’s been acting up lately. But… go ahead. I trust you. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rover. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but we can discuss that later. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I hear some slight crackling in your lungs when you breathe. This could be due to a number of things, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your ears and eyes. Your ears and eyes look good. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender when I press here on the right side. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yeah, that’s a little sore. Not terrible, but… yeah. It’s been feeling like that for a while now, on and off. I just thought it was… old age. Or maybe from lifting heavy boxes. I don’t know. It doesn't hurt all the time, just when you press on it. Is that bad, Doc?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant can be caused by a few things, Mr. Rover. It could be something simple like muscle strain, or it could be related to your liver or gallbladder. Given your history and the finding on the exam, I think it would be best to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? More tests… I guess so. If you think it’s necessary, Doc. I just… I don’t like going to the hospital. And I don’t like needles. But… if it’ll help figure out what’s wrong with my stomach, then yeah. Go ahead. What kind of tests are they gonna do? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rover. We’ll keep it as simple and painless as possible. We’ll just need a standard blood panel to check your liver function, kidney function, and overall health. It’s a routine test, and the needle prick is usually very quick. The phlebotomist is very skilled. It’s mostly just a little pinch. The tests will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. We’ll also check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, just to get a complete picture. Here’s a form with some basic information. Can you fill this out for me while I explain the next steps?
PATIENT: Okay… I can try. It’s been a while since I filled out a form like this. My eyesight ain’t what it used to be either. Name… address… date of birth… it’s all a bit blurry. I hope I’m writing it right. This is… a lot of information.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Rover. There’s no rush. And please let me know if you have any questions. I can help you fill it out if you’d like. Perfect. Thank you. Now, once the lab results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We’ll go over the results together and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting and staying well-hydrated. And if you experience any worsening pain or develop any new symptoms – like fever, nausea, or vomiting – please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. No heavy lifting. I can probably manage that. And I’ll drink more water. I usually forget to do that. And… I’ll call if anything gets worse. So… about the long-term care insurance? Is that still a thing? My daughter… she wanted me to get checked out for that. Will these tests tell you if I need… help? With… taking care of myself? I just don’t want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rover, the long-term care insurance is still part of the reason for this check-up. The insurance company wants to assess your overall health to determine your eligibility for coverage. These tests will give them a good picture of your current health status and help them make a decision. It’s important to remember that needing help in the future doesn’t mean you’re a burden. It simply means you’re human, and we all need assistance at some point in our lives. The goal is to plan ahead and ensure you have the support you need when the time comes. Regardless of the insurance outcome, we'll work together to develop a plan that meets your individual needs and preferences. We can discuss options for in-home care, assisted living, or other resources that can help you maintain your independence and quality of life. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained everything so… clearly, Doc. It still feels a little scary, thinking about needing help. But… I appreciate you being honest with me. And I appreciate you not making me feel like a burden. Thank you. I think I’ll just… go home and rest now. And drink some water. I’ll call if anything gets worse. Thank you again, Doc. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was my pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
