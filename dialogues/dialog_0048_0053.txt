DOCTOR: Right. Kandy Yadao, 66 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my… going to the bathroom. Or, not going, really. It’s been… difficult. I have to really strain, and it takes a long time. And even then, it doesn't always feel like I get everything out, you know? It’s been going on for maybe a week now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And is this…difficulty consistent, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty much all the time, now. At first, I thought maybe I just drank too much tea the day before, but it hasn't gotten better. It’s the same whether it’s morning or night. And it's not like a sharp pain, just… pressure, and like something's blocking it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its consistency – harder, softer, thinner than usual?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. And… the stool itself is normal, I think. Maybe a little harder than usual, now that you mention it, but I haven’t really paid close attention. I eat a lot of rye bread, so it’s usually… firm, anyway. It’s just getting it out is the problem, not what comes out.
DOCTOR: Right. So, normal consistency, perhaps slightly harder. No blood. Any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside this difficulty?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. And the pain isn't really…abdominal. It’s more…down there, you know? Like a pressure right before you go, and even a little bit after, like something's still there. It’s not a bad pain, just uncomfortable. I’ve been trying to drink more water, hoping that would help, but it doesn’t seem to be doing much.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, none of that. I feel…tired, but that’s just old age, I think! I’ve been doing a lot of gardening lately, so my muscles ache a little, but no fever or chills, definitely. I sleep alright, too. It’s just this…bathroom situation. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… just a small dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure, that’s all. And I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, but not right now, it’s August, lots of sunshine. Nothing else, really. I try to stay away from pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, and Vitamin D seasonally. Any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I used to get hives when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago, and I haven’t had them in… decades. I eat shellfish, nuts, everything, really. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. Hopefully, that’s still true! Although, this… this is making me question things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And before we proceed, have you had a colonoscopy or any other screenings for colon cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had a colonoscopy five years ago. Everything was normal then, the doctor said. And a sigmoidoscopy the year after that, just to be sure. Nothing found then either. My sister… well, she had some trouble, so I’ve been very careful about those screenings. It was all clear, though. I remember being very relieved.
DOCTOR: Good. Colonoscopy five years ago, sigmoidoscopy the year after, both normal. Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better understanding of things. It will be… a rectal exam, unfortunately. It won’t be comfortable, but it will be quick. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I was hoping to avoid that, but… if you think it’s necessary, yes. I suppose it is. It's just… not a very dignified thing. But if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then please, go ahead. Just… be quick, if you could?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side, with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I’ll need to use some lubricant. I’m going to palpate your abdomen first, then proceed with the rectal exam. Let me know if you experience any pain or discomfort. Alright, I'm going to start now. … I note some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. The rectal vault appears normal, no obvious masses. I do feel some slight resistance, but it's difficult to assess fully. No blood noted. Alright, that’s all. It's not definitive, but it seems you might be experiencing some constipation, potentially with some fecal impaction.
PATIENT: Constipation? That's… not so bad, I suppose. I’ve had trouble with that before, especially when I travel. Fecal impaction sounds a bit worse, though. What does that mean, exactly? And what can we do about it? Is it something I can fix with more water and… prune juice, or do I need something stronger?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, it simply means there's a build-up of hardened stool in your rectum that you're unable to pass on your own. Prune juice can sometimes help, but at your age, and given the length of time you’ve been experiencing this, I wouldn’t rely on it. I’m going to prescribe you a stool softener and a mild osmotic laxative. Start with the stool softener daily, and use the laxative sparingly, if needed. And, crucially, increase your fiber intake. More fruits, vegetables, whole grains… less rye bread, perhaps. I also recommend a gentle walking routine, as exercise can stimulate bowel movements. Come back in a week if you don’t see improvement. We may need to consider further investigation if it persists. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Less rye bread… that’s a hard one. It’s my favorite. But alright, I’ll try. And a walking routine… yes, I can manage that. Will the laxative… cause any discomfort? I don’t want to end up with… other problems, you know? And what if it doesn't work? You said "further investigation." What does that entail? More… poking and prodding? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The laxative can cause some bloating and cramping, but it’s generally mild. If you experience severe pain, stop taking it immediately. As for “further investigation,” it could involve a sigmoidoscopy to rule out any blockages or abnormalities. Or, less likely, a full colonoscopy. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Try the stool softener and laxative, increase your fiber intake, and see how you feel in a week. It's likely that’s all you’ll need. I'm writing up the prescriptions now. Do you have any further questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, doctor. I’ll try my best with the… less rye bread, and the walking. And I’ll come back in a week if things don’t improve. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Hopefully, it’s just a bit of constipation, and it will sort itself out. It’s good to have a plan, at least. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are your prescriptions. Follow the instructions carefully. Goodbye. .
