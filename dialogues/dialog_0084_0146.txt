DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my muscles. They feel weak. Really weak, sometimes. It's been happening on and off for a few weeks now, I guess. I just wanted to get it checked out, you know? Before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weakness… on and off for a few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not all the time. Some days I feel pretty normal, honestly. But other days… getting up from a chair is hard. Or carrying groceries. Simple stuff. It feels like I don’t have the strength I used to. It started in my legs, I think, but now it’s… everywhere, kinda. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, just… gives out. Mostly in the evenings, if I've been on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your legs and now it’s more generalized, you’re noticing it more with activity, and particularly in the evenings. Does it come on suddenly, or is it a gradual weakening throughout the day?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It’s not like bam, suddenly gone. It just… fades. I notice it more at the end of the day, like you said. I work as an insurance appraiser, mostly looking at car damage, so I'm doing a lot of walking around yards and stuff. But even on days I don’t do much walking, it can happen. It’s just… frustrating. I don't wanna slow down.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not directly tied to how much you're walking, just more when you're tired, generally. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess, but I figured that’s just from work. No pain, no numbness, no tingling. Nothing else that really stands out. I haven’t really noticed anything else, no. I just feel… weak. That’s the main thing. It’s just… concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, numbness, or tingling, just the weakness and some increased fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I’ve probably put on a few pounds, like everyone does, but nothing drastic. I’m… around 160, maybe? I'm not sure, exactly. I'm about 5'1", and, well, I could stand to lose a few, but it hasn’t been a big concern.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I can remember. I had a little sniffle a couple of months ago, but it didn't last long. Nothing major, definitely nothing that required a doctor’s visit. Just a normal little cold, and it went away on its own. That's it, really. I'm usually pretty healthy, to be honest. That's why this is weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent illnesses. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never really been sick, honestly. I haven't had any surgeries, no chronic conditions… nothing like that. My family… my dad had high blood pressure, I think, but that’s about it. I’ve just always been… okay. That’s why this is so strange. I don’t even know where to start.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant medical history, no surgeries. And your father had high blood pressure. Do you know if anyone else in your family has any medical problems, like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: Uhm… my mom, she had some problems with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. And my grandmother on my mom's side… she had diabetes, yeah. But that was a long time ago, and I don’t really know much about it. I wasn’t very close to her. Honestly, I’m not really sure what else. My family isn’t big on talking about health stuff, to be honest. It’s… not a priority.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, arthritis in your mother and diabetes in your grandmother. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don't drink much either, maybe a beer or a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that's it. I try to stay away from it, honestly. I don't have much of a tolerance for it. I'm not a big drinker, and I definitely don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, nothing for any specific condition. Just the occasional multivitamin, and that’s it. I try to get most of my nutrients from my food, honestly. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, honestly. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Great. Please have a seat here. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your arms and legs. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and your lungs sound clear. Reflexes are normal. However, your strength is slightly diminished in your arms and legs, 4 out of 5 on both sides. That means you can resist some force, but it’s not as strong as expected. I also notice some mild fasciculations in your calf muscles, small, involuntary muscle twitches. Do you notice those yourself sometimes?
PATIENT: Fasciculations? What are those again? Small… twitches? I don’t know… I haven’t really paid attention, honestly. I'm always busy. If my muscles are twitching, I guess I haven't noticed. I just feel the weakness, you know? Not little… twitches. I just feel tired and worn out. Weak. Is that… bad? What does it mean? I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, small, involuntary muscle twitches. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm on its own, but it’s something I want to note. The diminished strength and the twitches, along with your fatigue…it’s not definitive, but it could be suggestive of a few things. We need to do some blood work to rule out some possibilities. I’m thinking we should check your vitamin D levels, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. It will also be helpful to test your creatine kinase level, just to rule out any muscle inflammation. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Blood work is fine. I just want to know what’s going on. All this talk about twitches and inflammation… it’s a little scary, to be honest. But if it helps figure it out, then yes, let’s do it. When can we get that done? I have to get back to work tomorrow, unfortunately. I'm hoping it's not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It’s good we’re being thorough. Our lab here can get that done today. I’ll write you a requisition. You can go to the lab right after you leave here. It usually takes about 30 minutes. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and I’ll call you to discuss them. In the meantime, try to get some extra rest and stay hydrated. Avoid overexerting yourself. If you experience any sudden worsening of the weakness, any difficulty breathing, or any new symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Extra rest, stay hydrated… I can do that. And I’ll go to the ER if anything gets worse. No, I don't think so. Just… what are we looking for, exactly? What could it be? I know you said it's hard to say, but… is it something serious? I just want to be prepared, you know? I have a job to do, bills to pay... I don't have time to be sick. .
DOCTOR: Okay. It's understandable you want to know more. The blood work will help us rule out a number of possibilities. Things like vitamin deficiencies – low vitamin D is quite common and can cause muscle weakness and fatigue. We also want to rule out thyroid issues, kidney problems, and any signs of muscle inflammation. In rare cases, it could be a sign of a neurological condition, but we’re not jumping to any conclusions at this point. That's why the blood work is important. We'll start there, and I will call you as soon as I have the results. Don’t worry too much, we’re just being cautious. I want to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Here's the requisition. If you have any questions or concerns before I call, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Alright. Get some rest, and I’ll be in touch.
