DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, wheezing. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two, three weeks? It comes and goes, but it’s more often now. Not every day, but… often enough to make me notice. It’s worse when I walk fast, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three weeks, comes and goes, worse with exertion. Do you notice anything that improves it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… When I sit down and rest, it gets better. And… if I drink some warm tea, that helps a little. Not a lot, but a little. Is that… good information? I don’t know what is important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mrs. Kilton. Resting and warm tea seem to provide some relief – good to know. Now, can you describe the wheezing itself?
PATIENT: Oh… how to explain. It’s like… a whistling sound. When I breathe out. Not when I breathe in, but when I let the air out. Sometimes it’s quiet, just a little whistle. Other times… it’s louder. It feels… tight in my chest when it’s loud. Like something is blocking the air. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A whistling sound on exhale, with chest tightness when it’s more pronounced. Okay. And have you had a fever, cough, or any chest pain alongside the wheezing?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. I have a little cough, but it’s not bad. Just a tickle in my throat sometimes. And… no, no chest pain. Just the tight feeling when I wheeze. It’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a heavy weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… let me think. I haven’t really looked, Doctor. I wear slippers most of the time. I will have to check when I get home. I don't think so, but I haven’t paid attention. Is that important? It’s hard for me to bend down to look.
DOCTOR: It can be, Mrs. Kilton. Don't worry about it right now, we can revisit that if needed. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on medicine, and it’s been good for many years now. I take a small pill every morning. And… I had a bad fall a few years ago and broke my wrist. But it’s healed now, and doesn’t bother me. Oh! And I have some arthritis in my knees. It aches sometimes, especially when it's cold. Is that enough information? I worry I forget things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. High blood pressure, managed with medication, a previous wrist fracture, and arthritis in your knees. Okay. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I have any allergies. I like flowers, and I can smell them without any problem. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, but I thought that was just the pollen. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, Doctor. And sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they really ache. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The white one. My daughter buys it for me. I don’t take it every day, only when I need it. It helps with the pain, but it makes my stomach a little upset sometimes, so I try not to take too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Then we can discuss what might be going on and what we can do about it. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I will just sit here quietly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Kilton, just breathe normally for me. Deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Your oxygen levels are 94%, which is within a normal range. I do hear some wheezing in your lungs, which corresponds with what you’ve been experiencing. Your heart sounds good and regular. Now, can you tell me if you have any shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I don’t feel short of breath when I am sitting still. It’s only when I walk, or climb stairs, or do something active. Even then, it’s not bad, just… I have to stop and rest sometimes. It’s more of a… tightness, really. And the wheezing. It’s easier when I sit and catch my breath.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history of high blood pressure, the wheezing we’re hearing, and the fact that it’s worse with exertion, it sounds like you might be experiencing some asthma or COPD, possibly triggered by something. COPD is common in people who have had long term exposure to irritants, and asthma can develop at any age. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything else, and I'd also like to order a pulmonary function test. This is a simple breathing test that measures how well your lungs are working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Asthma… or… COPD? Oh dear. I don’t smoke, Doctor. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. Is that… from being outside too much? I like to garden, you see. A chest… X-ray? And a breathing test? Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. It's just… is it serious? Is it something I can fix?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve never smoked, Mrs. Kilton. While smoking is a major risk factor, it’s definitely not the only one. Exposure to things like pollen, dust, or even cold air can trigger these conditions. Gardening can expose you to some of those irritants. The X-ray will just give us a picture of your lungs to make sure there’s nothing else going on, like an infection. The breathing test will tell us how much air you can move and how easily. It’s not necessarily about “fixing” it, but about managing the symptoms so you can stay active and comfortable. We can often control these conditions very well with inhalers – medications that open up your airways. We'll discuss treatment options once we have the results of the tests. I'm going to write up the orders for the X-ray and pulmonary function test now. The radiology department and the pulmonary function lab are both in the same building, so it should be relatively easy to schedule them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Inhalers… like my daughter uses? She has allergies, you see. Yes, that sounds… good, if that can help. I want to be able to garden, and walk. I don’t want to be stuck inside all the time. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will you explain them to me when I come back? I don't want to be confused.
DOCTOR: Yes, just like your daughter uses. They’re very effective for many people. The radiology department should be able to get the X-ray done today, and the results will be available to me within 24 hours. The pulmonary function test usually takes a bit longer, maybe a couple of days to get the full report. Absolutely, I will explain everything to you in detail when the results are back. We’ll go over what they mean, what your options are, and what we can do to help you breathe easier. I will make sure you understand everything completely. I’m going to have my nurse come in and schedule those tests for you now. She will also give you a written summary of the orders and instructions. She’ll also give you a prescription for an albuterol inhaler to use as a rescue medication. It can help relieve the wheezing if it gets bad before your appointment. Do you have any trouble remembering things, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, that is very kind of you, Doctor. A rescue inhaler sounds… reassuring. Yes, a little. I sometimes forget where I put my glasses, or what I was going to say. Nothing too bad, but… it happens. My daughter says it's just getting old.
DOCTOR: It's very common, Mrs. Kilton. Perfectly normal. I’ll make a note of that in your chart, and we’ll just take things a little slower if needed. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the instructions with you. She is excellent at explaining things and answering questions. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is all. You have been very helpful, and very kind. Thank you so much for listening to me. I feel much better just knowing what might be wrong, and that there is something we can do about it.
