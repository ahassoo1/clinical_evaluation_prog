DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. It’s been bothering me for a few days now. And… I have a heart thing, the doctor told me it was… a-fluttering, I think? It’s called Atrial… something.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Kreckel. Swelling in your left leg and a history of atrial fibrillation – or as you said, “a-fluttering” – are both important things to address. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about the leg swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started… I think last week, maybe earlier? It’s mostly in my calf, and it feels… tight, and a bit achy. Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. It seems worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my feet teaching. I haven’t bumped it or anything, it just… appeared.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the swelling began approximately a week ago, localized to your calf, and it’s aggravated by prolonged standing, specifically related to your work as a teacher. You haven’t experienced any trauma to the leg?
PATIENT: No, no trauma at all. I haven't tripped or anything. Just… standing. And sitting for long periods sometimes makes it feel a bit worse too, if I’m honest. It’s a bit strange. I usually try to move about when I can, but teaching… well, you know how that is. It’s hard to be constantly moving.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly appreciate the demands of a teaching profession. It sounds like the swelling isn’t consistently relieved by movement, which is helpful to know. Now, has the swelling been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little bit of… tiredness, but I’m always a bit tired, to be fair. And I think my ankle feels… a bit heavier than usual. But that could just be my imagination. I haven’t noticed any redness or warmth, and definitely no pain, like a sharp pain. Just… the ache and the heaviness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no redness, warmth, or sharp pain, just ache and a feeling of heaviness, alongside some general tiredness. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your atrial fibrillation – do you currently take any medication for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take… a little orange tablet, twice a day. I think it’s something like… Bisoprolol? That’s the name on the bottle, anyway. And I take a blue one sometimes, when my heart feels… jumpy. That one’s called… Flecainide. The doctor told me to take it when I feel it fluttering badly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I see Bisoprolol 5mg twice daily and Flecainide as needed for atrial fibrillation. And how often would you say you are needing to take the Flecainide?
PATIENT: Oh, not very often, thankfully. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. It’s usually if I’ve had a stressful day, or haven't slept well. I try to avoid it if I can, because it makes me feel a bit… funny. A bit dizzy, sometimes. So, I really only take it when I need to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s good that you’re mindful of the side effects and only use it when necessary. Now, Ms. Kreckel, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your leg, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be fine, Doctor. Thank you. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to get it sorted, if you know what I mean. It’s just… worrying, you know? It’s not like me to have problems with my legs.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Ms. Kreckel, and we will certainly do our best to determine the cause of the swelling. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, please. I’ll start with a visual assessment. I don't see any obvious redness or warmth at first glance, which is good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your calf muscle and ankle to assess for tenderness and the extent of the swelling. Okay, I do note some mild tenderness to palpation in your calf, and… yes, there is 1+ pitting edema present in your ankle and lower calf. That means when I press on your skin, it leaves a slight indentation for a few seconds. And just to get a baseline, I'm going to measure the circumference of both your calves. Your left calf measures 38 centimeters, while your right calf measures 36 centimeters. That’s a 2-centimeter difference. Your pulses feel strong and equal in both feet, which is reassuring. I’m also going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… quite thorough, Doctor. Thank you. Two centimeters… that does sound like a lot, doesn’t it? I hadn’t realised it was that much bigger. I just thought it felt a bit tight. What does all this mean? Is it something serious? I do get a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: It is good that you’re paying attention to these changes, Ms. Kreckel. And it’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious. The 2-centimeter difference is noticeable, and, along with the tenderness and edema, it does suggest some fluid accumulation in your left leg. Now, there are several possibilities, and it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing it. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, we need to consider the possibility of a blood clot – a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. However, other causes, like muscle strain, venous insufficiency, or even lymphatic blockage, are also possible. Because of your heart condition, and the potential for a DVT, I’m going to order a D-dimer blood test and a lower extremity ultrasound. The D-dimer will help rule out a blood clot, and the ultrasound will provide a detailed image of the veins in your leg to confirm or exclude a DVT. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood clot… oh dear. That does sound serious. I haven’t felt any pain, just the swelling and the ache. Is it common with the… a-fluttering? And an ultrasound… will it hurt? I'm not very good with medical things, you see. I get a bit… flustered. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, then yes, I’ll have the tests. But please, could you explain it all a bit slowly? And tell me what happens if it is a blood clot. Is it something I can get better from?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel flustered, Ms. Kreckel. It’s natural to be concerned when we hear about potential serious conditions. Let’s take things slowly. Yes, atrial fibrillation can increase the risk of blood clot formation, as the irregular heartbeat can allow blood to pool in the heart and form clots. However, not everyone with atrial fibrillation develops blood clots, and we need the tests to determine if that’s the case for you. The D-dimer is a simple blood test, just like the ones you have to check your cholesterol. We’ll take a small sample of blood from your arm. If the D-dimer level is elevated, it suggests there might be a clot. Then we’ll do the ultrasound, which uses sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg. It's completely painless – a technician will apply a gel to your leg and move a small probe over the skin. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. If it is a blood clot, it’s important to remember that it’s a treatable condition. The standard treatment is anticoagulation – blood thinners – which help prevent the clot from growing and reduce the risk of it traveling to your lungs. The good news is that with prompt treatment, the vast majority of people recover fully. We'd discuss the best option for you, weighing the risks and benefits. Do you have any questions about that so far, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: That… that’s a bit better, thank you. Blood thinners… are they safe? I’m a teacher, you see, and I worry about bumping into things or… getting hurt. And what if I fall? Would I bleed a lot? I read things on the internet, and it all sounds very scary. And… if it’s not a blood clot, what else could it be? Is it something serious then? I just want to know… what’s the worst that could happen? I know it’s silly, but I just worry.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Kreckel. It's perfectly natural to want to understand the potential risks and benefits, and to be concerned about your health. And you're right to ask questions. Blood thinners do carry a risk of bleeding, but it’s important to remember that the risk is relatively low, and we take precautions to minimize it. We’d start with a low dose and monitor you closely for any signs of bleeding. We’d also discuss lifestyle modifications to reduce your risk of falls and injuries. And, of course, we’d advise you on what to do if you do experience a minor injury. There are different types of blood thinners available, and we'd choose the one that's most appropriate for you, taking your lifestyle and medical history into account. If it’s not a blood clot, other possibilities include venous insufficiency – meaning the valves in your veins aren’t working properly – muscle strain, or lymphatic blockage. Venous insufficiency is usually not life-threatening, but it can cause chronic swelling and discomfort. Muscle strain would typically resolve with rest and physical therapy. Lymphatic blockage is less common but can cause swelling in the leg. In the unlikely event of a large blood clot that travels to your lungs – a pulmonary embolism – it can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and dizziness. That’s why it’s important to rule out a blood clot quickly. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of people recover fully. The good news is that we're taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your swelling and get you the appropriate treatment. We'll do the D-dimer and ultrasound, and then we can discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that does sound alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained it all very clearly. I think I feel a bit better now, knowing what to expect. So, the blood test and the… scan… when will I get the results? And what happens after that? Will I need to come back? And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting my leg? Or wearing support stockings? I do have a pair somewhere…
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Kreckel. It’s important to me that you feel informed and comfortable. The blood test results should be available within a few hours, and the ultrasound results typically take a bit longer, maybe 24 to 48 hours, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage your symptoms. Elevating your leg whenever possible can help reduce the swelling. You can also try gentle compression, like wearing support stockings – the ones you have are fine. Avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and try to move around regularly. Rest your leg when you can, but gentle movement is also important to prevent stiffness. It’s important to let me know immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Also, if your swelling worsens suddenly, or if you develop any pain or redness in your leg, please contact us right away. So, to recap: we’ll do the blood test and ultrasound, we’ll call you with the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, elevate your leg, wear support stockings, avoid prolonged standing or sitting, and let us know if you experience any new symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel much less worried now. Right, I suppose I should go and get the blood test done, then? Where do I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kreckel. I'm glad I could help. Yes, please. The phlebotomy lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist will be able to direct you. They'll take a small sample of blood, and it shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Once that's done, you can come back and we’ll schedule your ultrasound. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns, Ms. Kreckel. We're here to help. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you soon. .
