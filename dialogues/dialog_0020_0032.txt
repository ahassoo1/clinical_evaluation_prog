DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Beinborn, you say? A…Palauan name, is it not? Well. I suppose I’m here about…a rather delicate matter. It’s been…discharging. Yes. A most unpleasant thing, really. Not something one discusses easily, you understand. Though I assure you, I maintain impeccable hygiene. Always have.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It can be difficult to talk about these things. "Discharging," you say. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? Hmm. Well, it's…clear. Not blood, thankfully. Though it is rather…persistent. Has been going on for…oh, goodness. A week? Perhaps longer. Time does seem to slip away these days, you know. I wouldn't hazard a guess beyond that. My wife noticed it first, naturally. She has a keen eye for such things. A very practical woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it associated with any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not precisely pain. Though there is…a slight discomfort. A bit of…sensitivity, perhaps. It’s not agonizing, you understand. More of a…nagging sensation. And itching? No, not particularly itchy. Though sometimes…afterwards…it feels a little…raw. Yes, that’s the word. Raw.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly is this discharge coming from, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I should think it’s rather obvious, shouldn't it? From…down there. From the…appendage. The…member. Is that the proper terminology? My wife prefers “down there,” naturally. A discreet woman, she is. I wouldn't dream of being…indecent with you, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, “down there” is perfectly fine, Mr. Krok. No need to be embarrassed. So, it’s coming from the penis. Has this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: To my knowledge? Hmm. That’s…a difficult question. One doesn't keep track of such things, you understand. Not typically. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A very long life. It’s possible, I suppose. In my younger days…well, let’s just say I was a…spirited fellow. But whether it was this particular ailment? I couldn’t say with any certainty. No, I don't recall it being quite like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active currently, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Sexually active? Goodness. At my age? Well…that's a rather…personal question, isn't it? My wife and I…we maintain a…companionable relationship. Let's leave it at that. It's not…as vigorous as it once was, naturally. But yes, we…occasionally engage in marital relations. Though, I assure you, we are very careful. Very, very careful.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And have either you or your wife had any new sexual partners recently?
PATIENT: New partners? Heavens, no! Absolutely not! My wife and I have been married for…oh, goodness…sixty-two years! Sixty-two years! We wouldn’t dream of such a thing. A most devoted relationship, you understand. She’s a woman of…principle. And I…well, I’m a man of…habits. Changing habits at my age is…simply unthinkable.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Krok. Now, do you have any other symptoms – fever, chills, pain in your lower abdomen, or painful urination?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I feel quite warm, but that's just the summer heat, I assure you. Chills? No, no chills. Though my bones do ache a bit these days, but that's just…old age. Pain in my lower abdomen? No, nothing of the sort. And painful urination? No, no pain. Just…the usual discomfort of an aging prostate, you understand. Perfectly normal. Though, I must say, it requires a bit more…effort these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see…Ah, yes. I take a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. And something for my cholesterol. Atorvastatin, perhaps? My wife manages all of that, you understand. She’s very organized. Allergies? No, I don't believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though I avoid shellfish, naturally. A most disagreeable thing, shellfish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Krok, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just need you to lie down on the examination table. This will help me to get a better look at things. It’s just a visual exam, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An examination, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose it’s necessary, isn't it? Though I must confess, I'm not terribly fond of doctors poking and prodding. But if you assure me it’s just a visual exam…yes, alright. Lead the way. Though I do have a rather sensitive back, you understand. So, be gentle. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. We'll be as gentle as possible. Just lie down on your back, and we'll take it slow. I'm just going to take a look now, Mr. Krok. I see some mild redness and a small amount of clear discharge. It doesn’t appear to be anything immediately alarming, but we'll want to rule out a few things to be certain.
PATIENT: Redness, you say? Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? A small amount of discharge, you say? Well, that's what I told you! It's been…persistently present. What sorts of things are you ruling out, Doctor? Are we talking about…something serious? My wife will be terribly worried if it’s something serious. She's a very…sensitive woman, you understand.
DOCTOR: It's good we're getting this checked out, Mr. Krok. Don't worry, it’s unlikely to be anything immediately serious, but it's best to be thorough. Possible causes could include a mild infection, irritation from something, or even a non-infectious inflammation. To be certain, I'd like to collect a urine sample and possibly take a swab of the discharge to send to the lab for testing. That will help us identify the cause and determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine sample? And a…swab? Goodness. That sounds…rather unpleasant. Though, I suppose I must do what’s necessary. I haven’t had a swab taken since…well, I can’t even remember the last time I had a swab taken. But if it will put my wife’s mind at ease…yes, alright. Lead the way. Though, I do have a slightly…weak bladder these days. So, perhaps we should hurry? And do try to be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. We'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Here’s a sterile cup for the urine sample. Just try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount mid-stream. And I’ll have a swab ready when you’re finished. Don't hesitate to let me know if you have any trouble. I’ll be right here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I believe I'm ready. It took a bit longer than usual, as you might expect. But I managed to collect a sample. A rather…small sample, I’m afraid. But it's all I could muster. Now, about this…swab. Is it going to be…painful? I do have a rather…sensitive constitution, you understand. And please, do try to be as discreet as possible. My wife would be terribly embarrassed if she knew the details.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. A small sample is perfectly fine, don’t worry. Now, for the swab. It may cause a slight discomfort, but it should not be painful. It's a quick procedure, and I will be as gentle and discreet as possible. Alright, all done. That was quick, wasn't it?
PATIENT: Quick, yes, but not entirely…pleasant. Though I suppose it’s over now. Is that all? Can I get dressed now? My wife is waiting for me, you understand. She’s terribly anxious. And please, do tell me the results as soon as you have them. I don't want to keep her worried any longer than necessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krok, that’s all for now. You can certainly get dressed. I’ll send these samples to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days – typically 2-3 business days. As soon as I have them, I’ll give you a call to discuss them and schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just being thorough. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all. Thank you for your…patience. And thank you for being so…discreet. My wife will be most relieved. Just please, do call me as soon as you have the results. She’s terribly anxious, you understand. And if it turns out to be something serious…well, I don't even want to think about it. Yes, just call me as soon as you have them. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Krok. I will call you as soon as the results are back. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. You take care, and give your wife my best. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. And please, do tell your staff to be…gentle on the phone. My wife doesn’t handle bad news very well, you understand. Goodbye.
