DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi. Um...nails. My nails. They just…look funny now. I don't remember how they got funny, exactly. Just noticed it a little bit ago, I think. It's a little embarrassing, to be honest. They're not pretty anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. It's perfectly alright to be concerned about changes in your body, Ms. Thut, and you shouldn't feel embarrassed at all. We're here to help figure things out. So, you've noticed a change in the appearance of your nails recently. Can you describe what “funny” looks like?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda…yellowish? And not shiny like they used to be. And… thicker, maybe? I don't do nails, if that makes sense. Never had fake ones or anything. Just… regular nails. I used to paint them red sometimes, but not lately. Oh, and one of them feels… loose? Not falling off, but wiggly. Is that weird? I don't know what's normal and what isn't.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not weird at all, Ms. Thut. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Yellowing, loss of shine, thickening, and a feeling of looseness are all things we want to investigate. Have you noticed this change in all of your nails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Hmm… mostly the big toe on this foot. But maybe a little bit on a couple of the others? It's hard to say. I don't really look at my feet unless I'm putting on shoes. And like I said, my memory isn't what it used to be. It's probably all the same, but I just noticed the big toe first, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Thut. It’s common to notice changes on one nail first. Alright. We'll take a closer look. Would you mind if I examined your feet and nails?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I guess not. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you gotta look, I guess you gotta look. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me if you see anything really bad. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Thut. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything I'm doing as I go. And I promise to let you know if I see anything concerning, but let’s not worry about that just yet. Okay, I’m examining your big toe now. I do notice some thickening and yellowing, as you described. The nail seems slightly detached from the nail bed, and there’s a bit of debris underneath. It doesn’t seem acutely inflamed, which is good. The other nails show some mild yellowing, but the changes aren’t as pronounced. This presentation is suggestive of a fungal infection of the nail, known as onychomycosis. It's fairly common, especially with prolonged exposure to moisture. However, to be certain, we'll need to send a sample of the nail clippings to the lab for a definitive diagnosis. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Fungus? Like… moldy? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. I don’t like mold. Is it… contagious? Will I get it on everything? And what do I do about it if I have it? I live alone, you know. Don't want to be spreading it around. A lab sample… that sounds… serious. Is it gonna be expensive? I'm on Medicare, I hope it covers it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you hear about potential infections. Yes, it's a type of fungus. But it’s not the same as mold that grows on food. It's a specific fungus that thrives in dark, moist environments, like under your nails. It can be contagious, but it’s not easily spread. It’s most often transmitted through direct contact, so it's unlikely to spread to surfaces in your home. Good hygiene – keeping your feet clean and dry – is usually enough to prevent it from spreading. We'll need to send a small clipping of your nail to the lab to confirm the diagnosis. It's a simple procedure, and it's covered by Medicare. The lab test will determine the type of fungus, which will help us choose the best treatment option. If it is onychomycosis, treatment can involve topical antifungal medications, or, in some cases, oral antifungal medications. We can discuss the pros and cons of each option, and choose the one that's best suited for you. Do you have any other questions about this, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oral… as in, I gotta take something? Oh no. I don't like taking pills. They always make me feel sick. And what if it takes a long time? I don't want to be on medication forever. Is there anything else I can do? Like… a special polish or something? I read things on the internet sometimes, but I don't know if it's true. Honestly, I'd rather just ignore it if it's not going to kill me. But then again, you said it could spread… This is all very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about taking pills, Ms. Thut. Many medications can have side effects, and it's natural to want to avoid them if possible. Topical antifungal medications are an option, but they often have limited effectiveness, especially for more severe cases. They also require consistent application for several months, and even then, the results aren't always guaranteed. Oral medications are more effective, but as you said, they can have side effects. We would carefully monitor your liver function with blood tests while you're on medication, to ensure your safety. The good news is that onychomycosis isn't typically life-threatening, and it doesn't usually cause serious health problems. However, it can be uncomfortable, and it can spread to other nails or even to the skin on your feet. You're right to be concerned about that. Before we make any decisions, let’s get the lab results back. That will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. And I can assure you that we'll explore all available treatment options, and choose the one that's best suited for you. We will take things slowly and cautiously. Would you like me to go ahead and order the lab test?
PATIENT: Oh… I guess so. If you think it’s the best thing to do. But please, be careful. And don’t give me anything too strong. I get nervous about doctors and pills, you know? And make sure they don’t poke me too much when they take the clipping! This is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Thut. I understand your concerns, and I promise to take them seriously. We'll be very careful when collecting the sample, and I'll make sure the technician knows you’re anxious about it. It’s a very quick and simple procedure, and we'll make it as comfortable as possible. Okay, I’ve ordered the lab test. The lab will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. They usually have several locations, and they’re very accommodating. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, keep your feet clean and dry, and avoid sharing nail clippers or other personal hygiene items. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… try not to give me too much bad news, okay? And thank you for being patient with me. I know I’m a little… difficult. I guess I’ll go home now and try to forget about it.
DOCTOR: You’re not difficult at all, Ms. Thut. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical issues, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. And I promise to be as honest and straightforward as possible. We'll take things one step at a time. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Ms. Thut, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
