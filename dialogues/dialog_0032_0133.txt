DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some forms signed, really. They said I needed a notary to verify some health things… for something. Honestly, I can’t quite remember what for, but the lady on the phone was very specific about needing it done here. It’s a bit of a hassle, running around like this at my age, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. While I'm happy to assist where I can, this office provides medical care, Ms. Tippens, not simply notarization services. It seems… unusual to request a physician’s signature for administrative forms. Could you perhaps clarify which forms you were asked to have verified, and by whom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re right, dear. It is a bit odd when you put it like that. Let me see… Here they are. It's for… a program. A senior assistance program. They said something about needing proof of my… well, my ability to handle my own affairs, I think? To get some help with… bills. The forms are from “Golden Years Support,” I believe. The lady’s name was… Brenda? Oh, it’s all so confusing. I just want to get this done so I can finally get some help.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, these forms assess your ability to manage daily tasks and finances – it's not necessarily something a physician would routinely verify. It sounds like Golden Years Support is requesting documentation of your cognitive function. I can certainly perform a brief cognitive assessment, if you’d like, and document my findings. However, that is a medical evaluation, and requires a proper consultation and associated charting. It won’t simply be a signature. Would you like to proceed with that, or would you perhaps benefit from me directing you to a social worker who may be better equipped to assist you with completing these forms and navigating the application process?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A proper consultation? Well, I wasn’t really expecting all this. I just thought it would be a quick signature, you see? I’m not sure I have the time… or the money, honestly. I don’t have insurance. Is there… anything simpler? Maybe just a statement that I seem alright? I do my bills, I cook, I… I remember things, mostly. It’s just… getting old is hard, you know? I really just want to get this program sorted.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your frustration, but as a physician, I have an ethical obligation to ensure any medical documentation I provide is accurate and reflects a thorough assessment. Simply stating you “seem alright” would be irresponsible and potentially detrimental, should there be underlying issues that require attention. Given your lack of insurance, a full cognitive evaluation would incur a fee. However, I can offer a limited assessment, focusing on your short-term memory and basic orientation. It won't be as comprehensive, but it may suffice for the program's requirements. This will involve a few simple questions and a brief check of your reflexes. It will take approximately twenty minutes, and the cost will be… sixty dollars. Alternatively, as I suggested, a social worker can assist you with the paperwork and potentially navigate the program's requirements without needing a physician’s assessment. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a social worker?
PATIENT: Sixty dollars… That’s… more than I was hoping for. But honestly, running around to different places is exhausting. And I’m not very good at paperwork these days. Alright. Alright, Doctor. Let's do the… limited assessment. Twenty minutes, sixty dollars. Just get it done, please. And try to make it quick, dear. My appointment at the salon is at three.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your name and date of birth, to confirm your identity. Then I'll ask you a few questions about your current medications, and we’ll proceed from there. Now, can you state your full name and date of birth for me, please?
PATIENT: Melvenia Tippens. And… Oh dear. The date… it’s… August… It's August… the… second, isn't it? Yes, August 2nd. And the year… goodness. Let me think. It’s… 1948. No, wait. 1949! Yes, 1949. I think. It’s hard to keep track these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Tippens. Now, can you tell me the current year?
PATIENT: The year? Oh, goodness. Is it… 2023? No, wait… it feels like 2024… Oh dear. I always get mixed up. Is today… after Christmas? That's how I remember. After Christmas… so it must be… 2025, isn't it? Yes. 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, based on this brief assessment, I have some concerns about your cognitive function. While I can complete a more detailed evaluation, I believe it would be most prudent for you to be evaluated by a neurologist. They are specialists in brain health and can provide a more comprehensive assessment and determine the underlying cause of your disorientation. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable neurologist in the area. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is it… is it something bad? I just wanted a signature, you see? I don’t need a… a specialist. I’m fine, mostly. A little forgetful, perhaps, but… I don’t want to go to a specialist. I just want to get my program sorted. Can’t you just… write something? Anything? Please?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, I understand your reluctance, but as a physician, I cannot ethically provide documentation that I know to be inaccurate or potentially misleading. Providing a signature without a proper assessment would be a disservice to you and could jeopardize your eligibility for the program. However, given your insistence, I am willing to document my observations from this consultation: that you are experiencing some difficulty with short-term memory and orientation to current events. This is not a statement of your overall cognitive health, merely a record of my findings during this assessment. It is up to the program to determine if this documentation is sufficient for their needs. Please be aware, however, that I strongly recommend you reconsider a neurological evaluation. I will provide you with a list of local neurologists. Here is the documentation. And here are the referrals. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, thank you. I just… I just want to leave. This has been very… upsetting. Sixty dollars… for that. Honestly. Thank you… I think. .
