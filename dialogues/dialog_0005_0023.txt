DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hello doctor. It’s my chest. It… hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes. Feels like a… ache, you know? Mostly on this side. <points to left side of chest>
DOCTOR: “A little” ache, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not… bad bad. More like… annoying. It doesn’t stop me from working, but… it’s there. I’m a roofer, so I’m up and down a lot. Maybe that’s it? I don’t know. It started a few weeks ago, I think.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, okay. And does anything specific make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Maybe when I’m really tired. And… when my wife, she… hugs me too tight, sometimes. It’s a little sore then. But mostly it’s just… always a little there. It’s weird. I never had this before.
DOCTOR: Your wife hugging you too tight… right. And you said it doesn't stop you from working. What kind of work do you typically do on a roof?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s… strange. She likes to squeeze. I do everything, you know? Shingles, tiles, gutters… climbing, lifting… all of it. It’s hard work, but… I need to work. We need the money. I try to be careful, but… accidents happen sometimes. Not big ones, though. Mostly just bumps and scrapes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any injuries to your chest recently?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing I remember. Like I said, just the normal bumps and scrapes from working. I haven’t fallen or anything. I’m pretty good at staying up there. <chuckles lightly> It’s just… this pain. It’s… in my chest, not my muscles, I think. It feels… deeper? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… no. Not really. I’m… tired a lot, but I always am, from the work. No… no lumps, no… changes to my skin. Nothing like that. I haven't felt sick, or anything. Just the pain. And being a little tired. That’s it, I think. <pauses, looking thoughtful> Oh! Wait. My nipple… it feels… a little scratchy sometimes. Just on this side, where the pain is. But it comes and goes. I didn't think it was important.
DOCTOR: "Scratchy," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not… itchy, exactly. Just… like a little… prickle. Not all the time. Only sometimes. It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t bother me much, really. It’s just… there. I didn’t want to bother you with it. It seemed… silly. But you asked about other things, so I thought I would tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any discharge from your nipple?
PATIENT: Discharge? Like… leaking? Um… no. Not that I’ve seen. I… I don’t usually… check. <blushes slightly> My wife hasn’t said anything, either. No, no leaking. Just the scratchy feeling. I promise I don’t usually worry about my chest! It’s just… this pain. And now I’m thinking about my nipple… It’s weird. I’m sorry. I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Bulaong, you're doing fine. Let's just take a quick look. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. <starts to get up, a little awkwardly> Is something… wrong? Should I be worried? I… I don’t like doctors much. They always find something.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Mr. Bulaong. Just want to rule things out. Nothing to worry about yet. Just a precaution. Lie down on your back, arms at your sides.
PATIENT: Okay. <lies down on the exam table, looking a little nervous> Arms at my sides, right. This is… cold. <shivers slightly> I hope it’s nothing. I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright. Does this hurt at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… a little tender. Not bad, but… yeah. Right there. <points to the same area on his left chest> It’s like a… dull ache, when you push there. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. <winces slightly> Are you… finding something?
DOCTOR: And what about here?
PATIENT: No, not there. That’s okay. Just… that spot. That’s where it hurts. Is it… bad? You’re being very quiet. Is it something serious? I don’t like this. I really need to get back to work. <shifts uneasily on the exam table> My wife will worry if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just finishing up. Can you sit up slowly?
PATIENT: Okay. <sits up slowly, looking anxious> Well? What is it? Is it… a muscle? Can I just put some cream on it? I really don’t want to take time off work. <rubs his chest gently> It feels a little sore now. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I've found a small lump and some fluid discharge from your nipple. It's not necessarily anything serious, but it requires further investigation. We need to rule out some possibilities. It’s important that we get this checked out.
PATIENT: Further investigation? What kind of investigation? Like… a biopsy? Is it… cancer? Oh god. My wife… she had a sister… <starts to look pale> I don’t like this at all. I just want it to be a muscle. Please tell me it's just a muscle. I can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be a number of things, and cancer is just one possibility. We need to do some tests to figure out what's going on. I'm going to recommend a mammogram and an ultrasound to get a better look at the lump. And yes, a biopsy may be necessary, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I want to be upfront with you, a thorough workup is needed to rule out anything serious. This is the best course of action, and the sooner we get answers, the better. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: No. I… I don’t really go to doctors. Not unless I have to. I just… work. My wife usually takes care of things like that. But she’s… busy. She works a lot too. <pauses, looking distressed> A mammogram… is that… painful? And a biopsy… that sounds… scary. How long will this take? I need to get back to work. I really, really need to get back to work. <rubs his chest again, wincing slightly> What if it is something bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your concerns, and it’s okay to be scared. A mammogram will be uncomfortable, but it’s relatively quick. The technician will do everything possible to make you as comfortable as possible. A biopsy, if needed, would involve taking a small sample of the tissue for examination. It’s also a relatively quick procedure, and we’d have the results back within a week. I'm going to refer you to a specialist, a radiologist, who can perform these tests. I’ll give you the referral information, and they'll schedule the appointments. While we wait for the results, it’s important to monitor the area for any changes. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No. I… we don’t have insurance. It’s too expensive. We just… pay as we go. This is… bad, isn’t it? I can’t afford a lot of tests. My wife will be so worried. And I need to work! <rubs his forehead, looking increasingly anxious> What if they won't do the tests if I don't have insurance? What if… what if it costs a lot of money? I don’t know what we’ll do. <looks down at his hands, defeated>
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your financial concerns. Not having insurance makes things much more challenging. I’m going to be honest with you: these tests will cost money. However, there are resources available to help. I can connect you with a social worker who can help you explore financial assistance programs and find affordable options. Some facilities also offer sliding-scale fees based on income. We'll do everything we can to find a solution. It’s crucial that we get this checked out, regardless of the cost. I'll give you the social worker's contact information, and they can explain your options in detail. In the meantime, I want you to try and stay calm. We'll take this one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I… I don’t think so. I’m just… scared. And worried about the money. And the work. <pauses, looking lost> I need to tell my wife. She's going to be so angry. And then worried. And… and I don’t know what we’ll do. <takes a deep breath> Just… give me the social worker’s number. And… the radiologist's number. And… I guess I should go home and tell my wife. Thank you, doctor. <stands up slowly, looking dejected> I hope it’s nothing. I really hope it’s nothing. <starts to walk towards the door, shoulders slumped>
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll do everything we can to help. .
