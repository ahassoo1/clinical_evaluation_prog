DOCTOR: Good morning, Mikeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They been… bothering me. It’s hard to explain. Like… pressure, mostly. And a little… ache? I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, sinus pressure and a bit of an ache. I understand it can be tricky to pinpoint exactly when things started. Let’s try to get a better understanding. When you say pressure, where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Hmm… everywhere, maybe? Around my nose, and… my cheeks? And… up here? <points to forehead> It’s… hard to say for sure. It doesn’t feel like a bad pain, just… there. Like something is… full? I hope that makes sense. I am not good with… describing things.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mikeisha. You’re doing fine. “Full” is a good way to put it. So, the pressure is mostly around your nose, cheeks, and forehead. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Sometimes it is… worse, when I… bend over? Or when it is cold. Not always, but… often. I don’t remember if it’s better on good days… maybe? My husband says I complain more when it rains. <chuckles softly> He knows me better than I know myself, sometimes.
DOCTOR: So it seems to be worse with bending over and in cold weather, and possibly with changes in the weather. Your husband sounds very observant. Okay, and when it is at its worst, would you describe it as a dull ache, a sharp pain, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh… it's not sharp, definitely not. Dull… yes, that's a good word. Like… a heavy feeling. And sometimes… stuffy? Like I can’t breathe good through my nose. Not always blocked, just… harder. I don’t know if that makes sense. I’m sorry, I’m not very good at… this.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mikeisha, don’t worry about it at all. It’s my job to help you explain it. So, a dull ache with a feeling of fullness, and sometimes stuffiness in your nose. Does anything relieve the stuffiness or ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I tried… a hot towel on my face, sometimes. It feels nice, but it doesn’t… fix it. My husband gets me… those little… what are they called… vapor rubs? I put it under my nose, but it doesn't last long. Mostly, I just… try to ignore it. I don’t want to bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hot towel and vapor rubs provide temporary relief, but nothing lasting. I appreciate you trying those things. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little tired. But I always feel a little tired. <chuckles softly> Maybe not because of my sinuses. I… don't think so. Oh! And sometimes, my head… feels a little heavy? Like a… weight on top. But not a headache, exactly. Just… heavy. Is that a symptom? I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: That definitely counts, Mikeisha. Fatigue and a feeling of heaviness in your head are both good things to mention. And it’s good you distinguish between feeling tired generally, and the heaviness specifically. Now, have you had any fever, cough, or sore throat with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever. And no cough. No sore throat either. Just… this. <points to her face again> It just feels… uncomfortable. Everything else is… okay, I think. I haven't felt really sick. Just… bothered. I hope I am not making this hard for you. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re not making it hard at all, Mikeisha. You’re describing your symptoms very well, and it’s helpful to know what isn't happening as well. Okay. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like allergies, asthma, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any of those. Nothing like that. I have always been… pretty healthy, I think. Well, except for this! <chuckles softly> My husband always says I’m strong, but sometimes I worry I’m just stubborn. I don’t go to the doctor much. I don’t like… bothering people. That’s why I waited so long. Maybe this is… silly.
DOCTOR: It's definitely not silly to come see a doctor when you're feeling unwell, Mikeisha. And it sounds like you’ve been quite healthy up until now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no surgeries. And never been in the hospital. Not even when I was little! I… broke my arm once, when I was a girl, but my mother fixed it herself. She was very good with… everything. Not a hospital, though. Just a… bandage. And lots of rest. I think that’s everything. I don’t… really remember much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And your mother sounds like a very capable woman! Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. My husband makes me try new things all the time. He likes… fancy foods. And I haven’t noticed any problems with… flowers or trees or anything like that. I haven't had any reactions to anything, ever. I think. Maybe? I don’t remember. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, just one more question about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings – have a history of chronic sinus problems, allergies, or asthma?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had… headaches, sometimes. But not like mine. More… strong headaches. And my father… he worked outside all the time. He… coughed a lot when he got old. But he smoked, you know? I don’t think it was allergies. My sister… she’s very healthy. Never sick a day in her life. I don’t think… anyone else had… this. Just… my mother’s headaches, and my father’s cough. Is that helpful? I’m sorry if I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly helpful, Mikeisha. You're doing a great job. Okay. So, to summarize, you've been experiencing sinus pressure and fullness around your nose, cheeks, and forehead, sometimes with a stuffy nose and a feeling of heaviness. It comes and goes, worsened by bending over and cold weather. You've tried hot towels and vapor rubs, with limited relief. You have no known medical conditions, allergies, or surgeries, and no significant family history of sinus problems. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll just listen to your lungs, look in your ears and throat, and gently feel around your sinuses to check for tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. It’s… alright. I’m not afraid. Just… if it hurts, please tell me? I don’t want to be… bother you. But I want to find out what is wrong. Yes, you can look. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mikeisha. I’ll be gentle, and I’ll let you know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright. Your lungs sound clear, and your ears and throat look normal. I do notice some tenderness when I gently press around your sinuses, particularly on your forehead and cheeks. There’s no fever, and your throat isn’t inflamed. Based on what you've told me and what I’m finding on the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis – inflammation of your sinuses. It's a common condition, and often caused by a viral infection, although sometimes it can be bacterial. It’s good that you don’t have a fever or any signs of a more serious infection.
PATIENT: Sinusitis? That sounds… bad. Is it… serious? Will I need… medicine? I don’t want to take too many pills. I’ve always been… careful about what I put in my body. <fidgets slightly> I hope it’s not something I caught from someone. I don’t want to make anyone else sick. Is it contagious?
DOCTOR: It sounds more serious than it is, Mikeisha. Most cases of sinusitis are not serious and will resolve on their own or with simple treatment. It's just inflammation, so it's not like a serious infection. And yes, it can be contagious, especially if it's caused by a virus, but it's usually spread through respiratory droplets – coughing, sneezing, things like that. So, good hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with others when you’re feeling unwell is a good idea. As for medication, we can start with some conservative measures first. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the discomfort, and a nasal saline rinse to help clear the congestion. You can find these at any drugstore. We can see how you respond to that over the next week, and if it doesn't improve, we can discuss other options, like a nasal steroid spray or, in some cases, antibiotics. But we'll try the simpler things first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. No pills right away. I can try the… saline rinse. And the pain relievers. I think I have some ibuprofen at home. My husband always keeps… everything. <chuckles softly> So, I just… rinse my nose? Is it hard? I don’t want to make it worse. And how long should I try this for? Before I… bother you again? A week? Is that right? I hope I remember everything. It's hard to keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, just the saline rinse and the ibuprofen for now. And you’re right, a week is a good starting point. If your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they get worse, then please call the office, and we can schedule another appointment. The saline rinse isn’t difficult, it just takes a little getting used to. You can find a pre-mixed saline solution at the drugstore, or you can make your own with distilled water and non-iodized salt. There are different types of rinse bottles you can use, like a squeeze bottle or a neti pot. The instructions will be on the packaging. It might feel a little strange at first, but it’s very effective at clearing congestion. And it won’t make it worse, I promise. To summarize, we’re starting with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed and a nasal saline rinse daily for a week. If no improvement, or worsening symptoms, please call the office. Do you have any questions about this plan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand. Pain relievers and the… nose rinse. For a week. And then call if it’s not better. You have explained it very clearly. I don’t want to keep you any longer. You have been very kind. And patient. Thank you. <smiles gratefully> I hope I didn’t bother you too much. I worry about… taking up your time.
DOCTOR: You didn't bother me at all, Mikeisha. I’m happy to help. Remember, it’s my job to listen to your concerns and help you feel better. If you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I wish you a quick recovery. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
