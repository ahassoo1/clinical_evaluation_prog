DOCTOR: Good morning, Alese. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Beinborn. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, really. I’ve been having quite a bit of pain, down low. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it’s… unpleasant. I understand it has something to do with… a condition I have? Something about my immune system? It's all rather hazy, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach pain… and you mentioned something about your immune system. I see here in your records you have a diagnosis of Crohn’s disease. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Crohn’s… That sounds familiar… yes, I believe that is it. Though, honestly, Doctor, the details escape me. It’s been… a long time since anyone explained it fully, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do know it involves… well, something being amiss with how my body handles things. And that it can cause discomfort, clearly. Is that… a simplification?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. It is a complex condition, and it’s very common for details to get a little fuzzy over time. And yes, that’s a good basic understanding. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease – essentially, your immune system reacts to things in your digestive tract, causing inflammation. To get a better idea of what's going on now, could you tell me a bit more about this pain?
PATIENT: Yes, inflammation… that sounds about right. The pain… it’s difficult to describe precisely. It’s not constant, as I said. It comes in waves, really. A cramping sort of feeling, mostly in my lower abdomen. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, other times it’s… sharper. And it seems to come and go with… well, with eating, I think? Though I haven’t been very careful about noting the connection, if I'm honest. Does that make any sense? And it's been worse lately, which is why I decided to come in. It’s been… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Cramping and a dull ache that comes and goes with eating… and it’s been worse recently. Okay. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Oh! Yes, sometimes I feel… rather tired. More tired than usual, certainly. And… well, my appetite hasn't been very good lately. Not that I have a huge appetite normally, but it’s diminished even further. And… oh dear. Is this relevant? I've been going to the restroom more frequently. It's… a bit embarrassing to discuss, but yes. That has been happening. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as I assumed it was just… age.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not embarrassing at all, Alese. All of that is very relevant, and thank you for sharing. Fatigue, decreased appetite, and increased frequency of bowel movements… Okay. And when you say increased frequency, can you tell me roughly how many times a day you're going compared to, say, a month ago?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers aren't my strong suit. A month ago… well, perhaps two or three times a day, on average? Now… I’d say… closer to five or six. Sometimes more. And… it's not always solid, if you don't mind my being so blunt. It's… looser than usual, and that’s rather distressing. I do hope I’m not oversharing. I just want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: No, you're not oversharing at all, Alese. It’s important to be thorough, and I appreciate you being so open. Five or six times a day, looser stools… Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a rather unpleasant question. I… I don’t believe so. Not that I’ve specifically looked, if I’m honest. But I don’t recall seeing any. It's possible, I suppose. Sometimes things are… obscured. But I would have remembered, wouldn’t I? It would be rather noticeable. I haven’t intentionally checked, if that makes sense. I… I avoid looking, generally. It's not a pleasant thought.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. It's not something anyone enjoys checking for. Alright. And have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t believe so. I haven’t felt particularly warm, and no one has mentioned it when taking my temperature. Nausea… perhaps a little, occasionally. Not severe, just a vague feeling of… queasiness. And no, I haven’t vomited. I’m quite a bit more stable than I was a few years ago, if that's any indication. Though my memory of that period is rather fragmented, to be honest. It was… quite distressing. I had to rely heavily on my sister.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, occasional nausea, no vomiting. And you said you were more stable than a few years ago. That’s good to hear. Now, just to review a bit of your medical history… I see here you were diagnosed with Crohn’s disease in 2010. Do you recall what treatment you received at that time?
PATIENT: 2010… that's… a long time ago. Treatment… I remember pills. Lots of pills. And… injections, I think? Something that made me feel quite tired, and a bit achy. I recall being monitored regularly, having blood tests. And… a rather unpleasant procedure involving a long tube. I’m afraid my recollections are very vague. I do recall my sister accompanying me to many appointments. She was a great help. I don’t know the names of the medications, unfortunately. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, pills, injections, a procedure with a tube… that sounds like standard Crohn’s disease management. Do you currently take any medications for Crohn’s disease?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take… this one, every morning. It's… mesalamine, I believe. And… this one occasionally, if I’m having a flare-up. It's a steroid, I think. Prednisone? That's what the label says, at least. I've been on these for… well, for quite a while now, I suppose. I honestly don't keep very close track. My sister usually handles the refills.
DOCTOR: Okay, mesalamine daily and prednisone as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, as far as I know. I’m a bit sensitive to… certain fragrances, perhaps. They can give me a headache. And… I used to react rather badly to bee stings when I was younger, but that was decades ago. I haven't been stung in years. As far as medications go, I don't recall any specific allergies. I haven't had any… unexpected reactions, to my knowledge. But I haven't taken many different medications, so it's difficult to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensitivity to fragrances, past reaction to bee stings, no known medication allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, heavens, no. Never have, never will. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit, and I rather agreed with her. My late husband used to smoke, but he eventually gave it up. It caused him quite a bit of trouble, I recall. No, I’ve never been a smoker. Not even a little bit. It always seemed rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of smoking. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Perhaps once or twice a week, if that. Nothing excessive, I assure you. A small glass of Pinot Noir, usually. It helps me relax. My late husband enjoyed a bit more, but he always drank responsibly. I wouldn’t say I’m a heavy drinker, not at all. It’s more of a social thing, really. A little indulgence.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any other symptoms you've been experiencing that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me see. Well, my joints have been a little achy lately. Not constantly, but it comes and goes. Mostly in my hands and knees. I assumed it was just… age, or the weather. It’s been rather damp lately, and that always seems to aggravate things. And… sometimes I feel a bit tired, even after a good night's sleep. More tired than usual, certainly. It's difficult to describe. Just… a general sense of fatigue. I don’t know if that’s relevant. It could just be… getting older.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Alese. Joint aches and fatigue are definitely relevant. It sounds like these symptoms may be related to your Crohn’s disease. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and examine your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand it’s necessary. I must confess, I’m not terribly fond of medical examinations, but I trust your judgment. Do let me know if anything is… uncomfortable. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if I’m feeling unwell. Please proceed when you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Alese. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s… tender. Right there, on the lower left side. It’s not excruciating, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. And… a little bit higher up, too. Not as bad, but I can feel it. Is that… normal? It’s been rather achy for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left quadrant and a bit higher up. That’s consistent with inflammation in the colon. Now, I’m going to check your joints. Can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a little stiff. Not terribly painful, but I can feel it. A little creaky, if that makes sense. And… my knuckles are a little achy, too. Not severe, but definitely noticeable. I’ve noticed it’s worse in the mornings, or after I’ve been sitting for a while. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: Okay, slight swelling and tenderness in your knuckles and wrists, and stiffness in your knees. That, combined with the abdominal tenderness, suggests that your Crohn’s disease may be flaring up, and it’s also affecting your joints. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, I suspect you are experiencing a Crohn’s disease flare. To confirm this and assess the severity, I’d like to order some blood work and a stool sample. The blood work will check for inflammation markers and anemia, and the stool sample will help rule out any infections. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and a stool sample. It’s rather unpleasant, I imagine, but if it will help determine the cause of my discomfort, then I’m all for it. Are there any… preparations I need to make for the stool sample? And will the blood work require fasting? I do hope it’s not too extensive. I’m not terribly fond of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to fast for the blood work, and I’ll only be drawing a small amount. As for the stool sample, the lab will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. It's best to follow those carefully. They’ll likely ask for a small amount, and it's best to collect it as soon as possible after a bowel movement. While we wait for the results, I’d like to discuss treatment options. Since I suspect a flare, we may need to adjust your medication. We could increase your prednisone dose, or consider adding another medication to reduce inflammation. Are you familiar with medications like mesalamine or biologics?
PATIENT: Mesalamine… yes, I believe I take that already, as you mentioned. Biologics… that sounds… rather complicated. I honestly don’t recall much about my treatment options from previous years. My memory is rather hazy, as you know. I do recall being concerned about side effects, particularly with the stronger medications. Is it possible to manage the flare with a higher dose of prednisone, perhaps? I've always been a little wary of adding more medications, if that makes sense. I’m rather sensitive to changes in my body, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Alese. We can certainly start by increasing your prednisone dose. That's often the first step in managing a flare. We'll monitor your symptoms closely to see if it’s effective. However, it’s important to remember that long-term prednisone use can have side effects. If the flare doesn’t respond to prednisone, or if it keeps coming back, we may need to consider other options, like biologics, but we can discuss those in detail later, if necessary. For now, I’ll write you a prescription for a higher dose of prednisone and order the blood work and stool sample. I’d also like you to keep a symptom diary, noting the frequency and severity of your abdominal pain, bowel movements, and joint aches. That will help me assess your response to treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Increase the prednisone, monitor my symptoms, and keep a diary. I can certainly do that. A diary… is there a particular format you’d recommend? And how often should I record my symptoms? I do hope I’m not being too much trouble. I always worry about forgetting things, you see. I'll do my best to keep track, but my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You’re not being any trouble at all, Alese. That’s what I’m here for. As for the diary, just a simple notebook will do. Record the date and time, the severity of your abdominal pain on a scale of 1 to 10 , the number of bowel movements, and any notes about your joint aches or other symptoms. You can record it as often as you feel necessary, but at least once or twice a day would be helpful. I’ll also have my nurse, Sarah, give you a handout with detailed instructions about the prednisone and the symptom diary. She can answer any questions you may have. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything for the moment. You've been very thorough, Doctor Beinborn, and I appreciate your patience with my… hazy recollections. I’m grateful for your help and guidance. And please, tell Sarah thank you in advance for her assistance. I do hope I won't be too much trouble for her either. I believe that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah will be in touch shortly. And please, take care of yourself. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
