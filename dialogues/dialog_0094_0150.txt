DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to have a baby, and I want to make sure it happens without any…complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s wise to be proactive, and wanting a healthy pregnancy is a wonderful goal. We can absolutely discuss how to optimize your chances for a smooth and healthy pregnancy. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s… complicated. And frankly, a bit of a bore. Divorced, as you’ll see on the paperwork. My ex… well, let’s just say he wasn't the healthiest specimen. I had the usual check-ups when I was with him, but nothing major. I’ve got Medicare now, so they probably have something on file. I mostly just want to know what I need to do to make sure everything is… optimal. Do you really need to know about every little ache and pain from twenty years ago?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Shteynberg. We don’t need to rehash everything, but some information is helpful for a comprehensive assessment. Knowing about past medical issues, even if seemingly minor, can sometimes give us clues. I see here you’ve had routine check-ups and vaccinations as expected. No major diagnoses listed. That’s a good start. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any current medications you’re taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Oh, goodness. Yes. I take a multivitamin, of course. And fish oil – very good for the brain, you know. My sister, she swears by turmeric, so I’ve been trying that. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen. The usual things an older woman takes. Nothing… exciting. And absolutely no prescription drugs. I prefer to avoid those if at all possible. They just seem to cause more problems than they solve.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Ms. Shteynberg. That’s helpful to know. Multivitamins, fish oil, turmeric, and occasional ibuprofen – that’s a fairly common regimen. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any history of pregnancy complications in your mother or sisters?
PATIENT: Ugh, family. My mother… she had high blood pressure. And she was always complaining about her joints. Rheumatoid arthritis, I think it was. My sister, she had a… difficult pregnancy. Gestational diabetes, I believe. And she was very, very sick. It put her in the hospital for weeks. That’s why I’m so worried about this. I don’t want to spend my pregnancy bedridden. Frankly, the thought of it makes me shudder. Are you writing all this down? I hope so. I don’t want to have to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything carefully, Ms. Shteynberg. Your mother’s high blood pressure and rheumatoid arthritis, and your sister’s gestational diabetes and difficult pregnancy – that’s all very important information. It helps us understand your potential risk factors. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I work. I repair bicycles. It’s physical work. I eat… reasonably well. I try to avoid sugar. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink. I don’t go to the gym, if that’s what you’re asking. I'm not one of those people. I'm a practical woman. I just want to know what I need to do to have a healthy baby, not listen to a lecture about kale smoothies. Is there a test I can take? Just to be sure?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Shteynberg. No kale smoothie lectures, I promise. Repairing bicycles is excellent – it keeps you active. And avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol is wonderful. You're right to ask about testing. A thorough workup is the best way to assess your readiness for pregnancy. I recommend a few things. First, a complete physical exam, including blood pressure, weight check, and a general assessment of your overall health. Then, we’ll need some blood tests to check your hormone levels, blood count, and screen for any potential infections. We'll also check your rubella immunity. And finally, a urine test to check for protein and glucose. Would you like me to go ahead and order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner I know, the sooner I can start planning. Do I need to do anything special to prepare for the blood tests? Fast overnight? And can I get the results quickly? I don’t have time to wait around for weeks. Honestly, the bureaucracy of healthcare is appalling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I completely understand your frustration with the pace of things. Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw – no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I’ll mark the orders as urgent, and our lab usually has results back within 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. I don't think so. I had a rash once, years ago, after taking some antibiotic for a… a minor infection. But I can't remember what it was called. And it was ages ago. I generally avoid medication whenever possible, as I said. It's best to just let my body heal itself, naturally. Is there anything else? I really would like to wrap this up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. A past rash with an unknown antibiotic – we’ll make a note of that. We can document “possible antibiotic allergy, unspecified.” Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed. Could you tell me about your typical menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting personal. Honestly. Well, it's… irregular. It’s not like clockwork, if that's what you're asking. Sometimes it's shorter, sometimes it’s longer. It’s been even more unpredictable since… well, since my divorce. I haven't really been keeping track, to be honest. It’s not as if I’ve been planning anything until now. Is this really necessary? I mean, I'm here because I want to get pregnant, not because I have a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Knowing the regularity of your cycle, even if irregular, helps us pinpoint the best time to check for conception, and to monitor your hormone levels appropriately. Okay, so irregular menstrual cycles. We’ll note that. And we can do a hormone level check as part of the bloodwork to get a clearer picture. Finally, do you have any current medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. As I said, I’m generally quite healthy. My blood pressure is fine, I don’t have diabetes, and I haven’t been diagnosed with anything else. I might ache a bit after a long day at the shop, but that’s just… age. And hard work. Honestly, I think I’ve answered enough questions. Can we just order the tests and be done with it? I have a bicycle to fix.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shteynberg. I completely understand. Here’s your lab requisition form. Please take this to the lab, and they’ll draw your blood. They’re located just down the hall, room 203. Once the results are back, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Shteynberg. You’re very welcome. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
