DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it's about this tiredness. It's just… getting worse. And frankly, it's embarrassing to even talk about, but here I am. I just feel… drained, all the time. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don't look at me like that. It helps, okay? It's not like I want to, but… it feels good going down.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Candis. It takes courage to share things that feel difficult to talk about. I understand you’re experiencing increasing fatigue, and you’ve also been… consuming dirt. Could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s not courage, it’s just… I’m here now, aren’t I? And honestly, it's interfering with everything. I can barely get through a shift at work. I'm a physical therapy aide, you know. Supposed to be helping people move, not dragging myself around like a zombie. It's been going on for… oh, goodness, months now, at least. Seems to get worse in the afternoons. And it's not just being sleepy, it's… everything feels heavy.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you clarifying that, Candis. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life, especially given your physically demanding job. Months of increasing fatigue, worse in the afternoons, and a general feeling of heaviness… That gives me a better understanding. Could you describe what you mean by “eating dirt”?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m shoveling it in! Honestly. It’s… I go out in the garden – my little patch, it’s mostly clay, reddish stuff – and I… pick off little pieces. Wash 'em, of course. Don’t want to get sick from bugs, you know. And I just… eat them. It's a craving, alright? Like needing a cup of tea. It soothes something. I don’t know what it soothes, but it feels… better. For a little while, anyway. It’s ridiculous, I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Candis. It helps me to understand what you’re experiencing. And it's not ridiculous at all; it's important to share these things with me. We'll figure this out together. I'm looking at your chart now. I see you haven't had a comprehensive physical exam in quite some time. Before we dive deeper into the fatigue and the… dirt consumption, I’d like to get a good baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. As long as it's quick. I have things to do. A physical? Honestly. What's a physical going to tell you? I'm tired and I eat dirt. Seems pretty straightforward. But alright, do what you need to do. Just… don’t take all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. A full exam helps us rule out potential underlying causes for both the fatigue and this unusual craving. It doesn't take long, and it can give us valuable information. First, I’ll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. We'll do a quick neurological check as well – just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Ugh, neurological check? Are you thinking I’m losing my mind now? Seriously? Look, I may eat dirt, but I’m perfectly capable of knowing my own name. Fine, do your little checks. But if you start asking me to count backwards from 100 by sevens, I’m walking out.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Candis. No backwards counting from 100 by sevens, I assure you. It’s a standard part of a neurological assessment, but we can certainly tailor it to your comfort level. We’ll just check your reflexes and basic coordination – nothing complicated. Let’s start with your vital signs. Could you please take a seat on the exam table?
PATIENT: Get it over with. Honestly, you'd think I was some kind of… case study. Just a tired old woman who likes to eat dirt. It's not that complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Very good. Again… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear. Throat appears normal. Now, let’s just check your reflexes quickly… Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Arms extended. Get on with it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’ve had more productive afternoons taking a nap. Is this going to be much longer? I really don’t have time for… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Just checking your reflexes now. And testing your strength… Can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s… fine. Everything’s fine. Can we be done? I’m starting to feel a little dizzy, honestly. Probably from all this… fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do notice you appear somewhat pale, and you mentioned feeling dizzy. And your grip strength seems a little diminished. Also, your gums appear slightly pale. Given your fatigue, the unusual craving, and these findings, I’d like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count – that will tell us if you have any anemia. I also want to check your iron levels, vitamin B12, and vitamin D levels. And a thyroid panel, just to rule out any thyroid issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking? Honestly. Blood work… fine. Whatever. If it gets me out of here faster, do it. Just… don’t tell me everything it’s looking for. I don’t want to hear about my ‘levels’ and ‘panels’. Just tell me if something’s wrong. And make it quick. I have things to do. Can I at least get a glass of water? I'm feeling faint.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. And I understand you don't want a lot of detail. I'll just let you know the results when they come back, and we can discuss anything that needs attention. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll print out a requisition form for you. It tells them what I need them to test. You can go there whenever you’re ready. It shouldn’t take long. While you're waiting for the results, are you currently taking any medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t believe in all that… pharmaceutical nonsense. Just a little chamomile tea at night to help me sleep. That’s it. Supplements… well, sometimes I take a multivitamin. But I can’t even remember the last time I bought one. It’s probably expired. Honestly, I mostly just try to eat a sensible diet. Though I've been craving dirt lately, as you've undoubtedly noted.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And I appreciate you being upfront about everything, Candis. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, thankfully. I’m pretty sturdy, all things considered. Never had a problem with anything. Penicillin, codeine, shellfish… doesn’t bother me a bit. Honestly, I think these young people are too quick to claim allergies these days. A little discomfort never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like anemia, thyroid problems, or any digestive disorders?
PATIENT: Well… my mother, she always complained about being tired. Said she had no energy, all the time. I never really paid much attention to it. She wasn’t one for doctors, either. Thought they were all just trying to sell you something. As for anything else… my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had some sort of stomach trouble. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t really know the details. We weren’t a family that talked much about… health.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Candis. That’s helpful. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing increasing fatigue, you have an unusual craving for dirt, and you have a family history of fatigue and possible stomach problems. You haven’t had a comprehensive physical exam in some time. We’ve checked your vital signs and I’ve completed a basic physical exam. I’ve ordered some blood work to check for anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and thyroid issues. I’ll call you as soon as the results come back, which should be within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe dizziness – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. As long as it doesn't take weeks to get a phone call. And don’t try to scare me with talk of emergency rooms. Honestly. Just… call me when you have something concrete. And I really need to get going now. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll prioritize your results and call you as soon as I have them. Thank you for coming in today, Candis. I know it wasn't easy to share all of this, and I appreciate your honesty. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
