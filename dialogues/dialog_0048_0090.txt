DOCTOR: Right. Mackenzi Brightful, 29 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Sink. It’s… well, it’s about a surgery I’m hoping to have. A cosmetic one, that is. I believe I need clearance before I can schedule it. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, terribly so. It’s difficult to recall the specifics… it was a decision my husband and I made together, before… well. Before he passed. I think it’s a tummy tuck and… possibly a lift? But I honestly couldn’t say with complete certainty. It’s been… a while. And a lot to process.
DOCTOR: Right. A tummy tuck and a lift. And you need medical clearance for this elective procedure. I see. Well, let’s try to piece things together. Do you recall when this was discussed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I truly don’t. It feels like it was last year, perhaps? Or the year before? Everything feels a little… blurred around the edges. We spoke with a surgeon, I remember that. A very kind woman. But the details… the date, the exact consultations… they’re lost to me, I’m afraid. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: It’s… suboptimal, let’s say that. We need to establish a timeline, and understand your overall health status before proceeding with anything. Do you have any records from this surgeon?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Records… I hope so. My husband was very organized. He handled all the paperwork. I believe… yes, I think he kept a folder. It’s at home, in his study. I haven’t really… been in there much since. I can have someone retrieve it, if that would be helpful? Perhaps a friend? I’m not sure I’m up to sorting through everything myself right now. It’s… rather emotionally difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, retrieving those records would be… advisable. While we wait for that, let’s go through a basic medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had… a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that cleared up with antibiotics. Oh! And I have seasonal allergies. Terrible hay fever every spring. Beyond that… I don’t believe so. I’ve always been fairly healthy, actually. I spend a lot of time outdoors with my work, which I enjoy. Though I suppose that could contribute to… things. Do you need to know about specific injuries? I’ve had a few scrapes and bruises, naturally, from landscaping. Nothing major, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Scrapes and bruises are… irrelevant. Any high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I don't know. I haven't really been checked for that specifically. I mean, I have had my annual check-ups, generally. But I don’t recall the doctor ever mentioning anything about my blood pressure being high. I feel fine, generally. A little tired sometimes, but… that could be anything, couldn’t it? I work very long hours. Would my general practitioner have this information? I can provide their name and number, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, yes. Your primary care physician's information. We need to ascertain your baseline health. Name and number, please. And while you’re at it, are you on any medications currently?
PATIENT: Certainly. His name is Dr. Ramirez. The number is… let me see… 555-123-4567. He’s located in Coral Gables. And medications… just an antihistamine during allergy season. Cetirizine, I believe. A standard over-the-counter one. And sometimes ibuprofen, if I strain my back at work. That’s it, I promise. I’m usually very good about avoiding medications if I can help it. Is this… sufficient information for now? I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: For now. It’s… minimal. And we will need those surgical records. I’ll have my assistant send a request to Dr. Ramirez’s office. Now, family history. Any significant illnesses in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… My mother had… high cholesterol, I believe. And my father… he had heart disease, I’m afraid. He passed away several years ago, unfortunately. It was… sudden. And my brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Medellin, so I don’t see him often. Does that… help? I’m terribly sorry, I feel like I’m rambling. It’s just difficult to recall everything at once. Is it alright if I take a moment? I feel a little faint.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, heart disease is… relevant. A moment won't be a problem. But we need to be efficient. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I do. I'm allergic to penicillin. A very bad reaction when I was a child. And… hmm. Nothing else comes to mind. No known food allergies, no allergies to latex… I think that’s it. Is there anything else I should be telling you? Perhaps about my work? It can be quite strenuous, lifting heavy pots and plants all day. It might… affect things, somehow? I'm just trying to be thorough, I promise. Is this helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy is noted. And strenuous work… marginally relevant. We'll address physical demands later. Now, let's move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he smoked, unfortunately. It was… a difficult habit. But I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. I find it… rather appalling, actually. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I prefer tea, if I'm honest. It’s much more calming. Is that… acceptable? I'm trying to be as forthcoming as possible, Doctor. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps I could bring in those surgical records tomorrow? I can ask my friend to retrieve them. She lives closer to the surgeon's office. Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Acceptable. Surgical records tomorrow. That's… preferable. Now. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? I… I was married, as I mentioned. My husband passed away… a year and a half ago. I haven’t… I haven’t been with anyone since. I’m still… grieving. So, no. Not currently. Is that… sufficient information? I apologize if I seem flustered. These questions are… unexpected. Is there anything else I should know about this consultation, Doctor? Perhaps the reasons for asking these specific questions? It might help me understand and provide more accurate information.
DOCTOR: It's standard protocol, Ms. Brightful. Part of a thorough medical assessment. Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, respiration... the usual. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. If that’s standard… I apologize for my… hesitancy. I do hope it won’t take too long. I’m not particularly fond of hospitals or… examinations. But I understand it’s necessary. Please let me know if I need to do anything specific. And… thank you, Doctor. For your patience.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… slightly elevated. 138 over 85. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration is normal. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… unremarkable. Abdomen is soft, but there is some… fullness. Weight is also a concern. 93 kilograms… that places you in the obese category. This complicates the surgical risk. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh. Obese… That’s… not what I was expecting. I do enjoy my food, I confess. And my work is quite sedentary at times, despite the lifting. It’s been a difficult year. I haven’t been prioritizing my health… I suppose. Is there anything I can do to improve my chances of being approved for the surgery? I’m willing to make changes… I just need some guidance. And… perhaps a little encouragement. This is… rather overwhelming. I apologize for my… emotional state. Is the weight a significant barrier, Doctor? Truly?
DOCTOR: It is a significant barrier, Ms. Brightful. Anesthesia risks are elevated with obesity, wound healing is impaired, and the overall surgical outcome is less predictable. We need to address this. We will need to schedule a consultation with a nutritionist, and you will need to demonstrate a commitment to weight loss before we can even consider proceeding. And frankly, the history of fuzzy memory also raises concerns. This surgery is elective, and it requires a clear understanding of risks and post-operative care. Now, do you have any other medical conditions we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Fuzzy memory… I… I suppose there is one thing. It’s… rather embarrassing. And I haven’t told anyone. It’s just… fleeting moments of… confusion. Sometimes I forget where I am, or what I was doing. It’s not constant, but it’s… unsettling. My husband noticed it first, towards the end. He said I was… distracted. I thought it was just grief, but… perhaps it’s something more. I haven’t seen a doctor about it. I didn’t want to be… labeled. Is that… a problem? A serious problem? I apologize for not mentioning it sooner. Is this going to disqualify me from the surgery entirely? I’m starting to feel… rather hopeless.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy memory" is not something to be dismissed, Ms. Brightful. Especially in light of the upcoming surgery and the need for post-operative care adherence. This is… concerning. We need a neurological evaluation immediately. I will not approve this surgery until we have a clear understanding of what is causing these cognitive lapses. I am referring you to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in geriatric cognitive function. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. This is non-negotiable. Now, I believe we are finished here. My assistant will schedule a follow-up appointment once you have seen Dr. Sharma. .
PATIENT: Oh. I… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. For your… honesty. I suppose… I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma. Goodbye, Doctor.
