DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, please. I appreciate that. I don’t have all day, you see. It’s… it’s been a bit rough lately, and frankly, I'd rather get this sorted and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, most people feel that way. Now, could you please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to explain. Just a general feeling of… heaviness, I suppose. Not enjoying things like I used to. Everything feels like a lot of effort. And I'm tired, Doctor. Very tired, even when I've slept. I don’t know. It’s been going on for a few months now, and it’s not getting any better.
DOCTOR: "Heaviness," you say. Months, you say. Hmm. And is this… heaviness, as you put it, constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly constant, to be honest. Some days are worse than others, naturally. But even on “good” days, there’s still… something there. Like a weight pressing down. It’s not a sudden thing, Doctor, it’s… lingering. A dull ache, if that makes sense. And it makes it hard to… concentrate.
DOCTOR: Concentrate, you say. Are you experiencing any difficulties with your memory, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not… specifically, no. I wouldn't say my memory is worse, exactly. It’s just… harder to focus enough to make a memory, perhaps. It’s like my mind is… wandering. And things just seem to… slip away. Dates, mostly. And names. Though I’ve always been terrible with names, to be fair. But it's a little more frequent now, I suppose. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And are you finding any changes in your appetite, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Not much of an appetite these days, no. Food just doesn't… appeal. I used to enjoy cooking, you see. Nigerian cuisine takes a lot of effort, a lot of spices… Now, the thought of it… it's exhausting. I mostly just pick at things. A little soup, maybe. Or a biscuit. Nothing substantial. It’s worrying, actually. I'm losing weight.
DOCTOR: Weight loss. Right. And have you noticed any… disturbances in your sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That too. I go to bed at a reasonable hour, but I toss and turn. Wake up several times during the night. Sometimes I just… lie there for hours, staring at the ceiling. Even when I do finally fall asleep, I don't feel rested. It's… frustrating. And exhausting, naturally. It's a vicious cycle, isn't it? Tired all day, can't sleep at night.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many things can cause these… disturbances. Have you experienced any recent significant life stressors, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Stressors? Oh, goodness. Where to begin? The divorce was… final last year. Still adjusting, naturally. And my son… he moved to Canada. Very far away. Doesn’t call as often as I’d like. And the work… lifeguarding in August isn’t easy, you see. All those teenagers! It’s… draining. But I need the money, naturally. It’s a lot, Doctor. A lot. Is that what you mean by stressors? Everything feels… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Lifeguarding, you say. Hmm. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Derasmo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if I can, you see. Always have. I believe in… natural remedies, mostly. Though I must admit, they haven’t been terribly effective lately. I tried some herbal teas, but… nothing. And I don't like the thought of side effects, you see. I'm a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. Or, was a healthy woman, at least.
DOCTOR: No medications. Right. And any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. Never had any trouble with food, or anything like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, frankly, it doesn’t feel very strong these days. Perhaps she was wrong. But no, no allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you don't mind, Ms. Derasmo, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to rule out any… obvious causes. If you could please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t take too long, you see. I have… commitments. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would. My joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation, although… somewhat diminished breath sounds. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Not concerning. Reflexes are… present, but slightly diminished. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Everything appears normal, Ms. Derasmo.
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring, I suppose. Though it doesn’t explain how I feel, you see. Everything feels… wrong. But if everything is medically “normal”… what then, Doctor? Are you suggesting I’m just… imagining things? Or am I too old to be feeling this way? I apologize, Doctor, but I’m feeling rather… frustrated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, frankly, these symptoms are… vague. It could be a number of things. Stress, as you've mentioned. A touch of age, perhaps. Or, potentially, mild depression. I'm reluctant to prescribe medication at this stage, given your aversion to it. However, I recommend a trial of regular exercise and… mindful relaxation techniques. And perhaps a referral to a… therapist. If these symptoms persist, then we can revisit the possibility of further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Therapy? Exercise? Doctor, with all due respect, I've been a lifeguard and ski patrol for thirty years! I am exercise. And I've faced down emergencies most people couldn’t even imagine. I don't need someone to… talk down to me. I just want to feel… normal again. But if you’re suggesting this is all in my head… then I don't think I'm the right patient for you, Doctor. Frankly, I'm wasting my time here. What exactly is your professional opinion? Are you suggesting there's nothing physically wrong with me? Because if that's the case… I think I'll seek a second opinion.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, with all due respect, you are presenting with symptoms that do not readily lend themselves to a clear diagnosis based on the initial examination. I’ve ruled out acute conditions. To pursue further investigation – blood work, imaging – would be… unnecessary at this juncture. I suspect a degree of… psychological distress. A therapist might be beneficial. However, if you insist on a second opinion, you are, of course, free to seek one. I will provide you with a referral for a therapist in the area. Is there anything further?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that says everything, doesn’t it? You've ruled out everything physical, so you're left with… my mind. Wonderful. Yes, a referral is fine. But I'm not hopeful, frankly. I just wanted a bit of help, a bit of understanding. But I suppose that’s too much to ask. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I’ll be going now. .
