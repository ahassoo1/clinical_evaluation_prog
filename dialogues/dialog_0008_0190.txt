DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling quite unsteady on my feet lately. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest. I don't quite recall when it started exactly, just that it’s been happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsteady on your feet… and you said it’s been increasing recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Increasing. It’s… hard to pinpoint, but I used to feel quite stable, and now… well, I stumble a bit more often. It doesn’t happen every time I walk, but it’s frequent enough to worry me. It’s just… disconcerting, you understand? I work… I did work with machinery, so stability is rather important.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds concerning, especially with your previous work. Just to get a better picture, can you describe how you're unsteady?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How… well, it's not a fall, not yet. More of a… a wobble, I suppose. Like I might lose my balance. Sometimes it feels like the room is tilting just a little, though I’m not sure if that’s just me feeling off. And sometimes, it’s just a sudden feeling of weakness in my legs. It’s hard to describe precisely… it’s not consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wobble, feeling like the room is tilting, and sometimes weakness in the legs… and it’s not consistent. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… honestly, I haven’t been able to discern any particular pattern. I think it's worse when I'm tired, naturally. But I work long hours… or did. I haven't really noticed anything specific that improves it. It just… happens. It’s frustrating, because I feel like I should be able to identify a trigger.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Hmm. Now that you mention it… I've been having rather frequent headaches. Not terribly severe, but… persistent. And I’ve noticed my vision seems a little blurry at times, though I've always had slightly poor eyesight. I suppose I just assumed it was that getting worse. I… I don’t recall anything else, no. I apologize if I'm not being terribly helpful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, you’re being very helpful. Headaches and blurry vision, alongside the unsteadiness. Okay. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, weakness in any other part of your body, or difficulty speaking or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And my neck doesn't feel stiff. No weakness anywhere else, thankfully. And no trouble speaking or swallowing. Just… this unsteadiness, the headaches, and the blurry vision. It all feels rather… disjointed, to be honest. I apologize again for being vague. It’s just difficult to recall everything precisely. It's been… a difficult time, personally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no neck stiffness, no other weakness, no speech or swallowing difficulties. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit complicated. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure some time ago, and I take medication for that. And… well, my husband, God rest his soul, passed away a few years ago. He… had some heart problems. I haven’t been feeling quite myself since. Other than that… I don’t believe so. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing… significant. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, medication for that, and a history of heart problems in your husband. I'm very sorry for your loss, by the way. That must have been incredibly difficult. And yes, your insurance is relevant. Just for my records, what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… a very trying time. As for the medication… Oh dear. This is where my memory fails me most. It’s a small white pill… I believe it starts with an 'A'? I… I honestly can’t recall the full name. I get the refills automatically from the pharmacy, so I don’t often think about it. I could perhaps ask them for a list? It’s terribly embarrassing to admit, but I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can certainly look that up in your pharmacy records. Just one moment… Okay, it looks like you're currently taking amlodipine 5mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… yes, that sounds right! Amlodipine, 5mg… yes, that’s it! Thank you, Doctor. You have a remarkable memory. I truly appreciate you retrieving that for me. I've been under a great deal of stress lately, and things have been… muddled, to say the least.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Stress can certainly impact memory. Alright, and have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, thankfully. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very routine procedure. And I had a small cyst removed from my arm a few years ago, but that was very minor, just a local anesthetic. Other than those two… I don't believe so. Nothing significant, at least. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions. I can eat anything, thankfully. And I haven’t noticed any sensitivities to pollen or anything like that. I live a relatively simple life, you see, so I haven’t been exposed to many… unusual substances. It’s just… this unsteadiness, and the headaches. It's quite concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’ve never been one for alcohol. And I certainly don’t partake in any… recreational drugs. I lead a very quiet, respectable life, Doctor. I prefer a good cup of tea, if you don’t mind. It’s… soothing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Lilyanna, thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to assess your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment implicitly. I just want to get to the bottom of this unsteadiness, and hopefully find a solution. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'd like to take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. We'll do some neurological checks to assess your balance, coordination, and reflexes. And I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed at your own pace. I’ll simply sit here and do my best to remain still. It’s… rather unsettling, feeling so unsteady, but I trust you’ll do everything you can to help. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Pulse is 88 and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but there's a very faint murmur. Nothing to be overly concerned about at this point, but we'll note it. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to look in your ears… Your ears look normal. Now, I’ll take a look at your eyes… Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, let’s check your throat… Your throat looks normal. Okay, now we'll do some neurological checks. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head.
PATIENT: Yes, I can follow your finger perfectly well, Doctor. It’s… a bit dizzying, perhaps, feeling so unsteady, but I can manage. I hope I'm not making this difficult. Do let me know if you need me to stop at any point. It’s just… a strange sensation, this wobble. I find myself gripping the arms of this chair rather tightly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing perfectly fine. Gripping the chair is perfectly understandable. Okay, now I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger. Now, touch my finger with your index finger. Okay, now I'm going to ask you to stand up slowly. Now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I don’t believe I can, Doctor. I’m rather unsteady on my feet. It’s… it’s quite pronounced when I close my eyes. I feel as though I might fall. Perhaps it’s best if I remain seated. I apologize for being such a bother. It’s just… this wobble is rather insistent today. I do hope you can discern what is causing it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, please sit down. It's good you told me. That suggests a problem with your balance. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Lilyanna, based on this brief exam, there are a few possibilities. Your elevated blood pressure could be contributing to this, and the faint heart murmur warrants further investigation. The unsteadiness and difficulty with balance suggest a possible inner ear issue, or a neurological problem. We're going to need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG to start. And I'm going to refer you to an audiologist for a hearing and balance test, and a neurologist for a neurological evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… quite thorough, and rather unsettling, to be honest. But I understand the need for further testing. If that is what is required to discern the cause of this unsteadiness, then I wholeheartedly agree. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an EKG… and referrals to an audiologist and a neurologist… Yes, please. Do let me know the next steps, and how to schedule those appointments. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you, Doctor, for your patience and thoroughness. You have been most kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. I’ll print out the lab orders and referral forms for you. The lab should be able to take you today, or tomorrow at the latest. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the appointments with the audiologist and neurologist for you. They should be able to get you in within the next week or two. In the meantime, I want you to be cautious. Avoid driving, and try to avoid situations where you might fall. If you experience any new symptoms, such as vision changes, severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. I’m also going to prescribe you a low dose of medication to help lower your blood pressure. It’s important to take this as prescribed. Here are the lab orders, referral forms, and the prescription. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, I believe I do have a question. The blood pressure medication… will that cause any… drowsiness or dizziness? Considering my current unsteadiness, I am rather concerned about exacerbating the problem. And… what if the tests reveal something… serious? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… the uncertainty is quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Lilyanna. The medication I’m prescribing, amlodipine, can sometimes cause dizziness, but it’s not common, and the dose is low to minimize side effects. If you do experience dizziness, especially when standing up, please let me know immediately. We can adjust the dose or switch to a different medication. As for the tests… I understand your anxiety. It’s natural to be worried about the unknown. But remember, we're taking these tests to get a clear picture of what’s going on, so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. I want to be upfront and honest with you. The possibilities range from something relatively minor, like an inner ear infection, to something more serious, like a neurological condition. But we won't know until we have the results. I will be here to discuss the results with you in detail, and answer any questions you may have. We will work through this together. Do you want me to write down the emergency room information just in case?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please, do write down the emergency room information. It would… certainly provide some peace of mind. And thank you, for your honesty and patience. It is… rather unsettling, this uncertainty. But knowing that you will be here to discuss the results with me, and that we will work through this together… that is… reassuring. I suppose there is nothing else for me to do but wait for the test results, and try to remain cautious. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been most kind and thorough.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. I will call you as soon as the test results are available, which should be within a few days. In the meantime, please try to get some rest, and avoid situations that might increase your risk of falling. If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Cumper. You as well. I truly appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. I… I will keep your number handy, and I will certainly call if I have any concerns. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
