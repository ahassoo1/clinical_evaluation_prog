DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? It’s this pain, you see. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… somewhere in my chest, I think. It’s hard to say exactly where, really. Been going on for a bit now. I just want to get it checked, if that makes sense. I don't like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. It’s good you came in to get it checked. Pain with breathing is something we definitely want to understand. So, you've been experiencing this chest pain for a "bit now"—can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a good question. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes, you see. Not every breath, just… sometimes. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter, she noticed it first, actually. Said I was wincing when I was gardening.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, and it’s good your daughter is observant. A few weeks is good information. Does the pain feel sharp, dull, achy, or something else?
PATIENT: Hmm… sharp, dull… let me think. It’s not really sharp, not like a cut. More… achy, I guess. A heavy ache, right in the middle of my chest. Sometimes it feels like pressure, too. Like someone is sitting on me, but not really sitting, you know? It’s a funny feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand what you mean, Mr. Ruocco – a difficult feeling to describe. And pressure is good to know. Does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Well… lifting things, definitely. I used to be able to lift anything, you know, with the construction work. But now, even carrying groceries feels… risky. And sometimes, when I walk up hills, it gets worse. Not always, but often. Being cold doesn't help either. A chill will really bring it on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lifting, walking uphill, and cold temperatures seem to aggravate it. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Let me see… resting, mostly. If I sit down and take it easy for a bit, it calms down. And… warm tea. My wife, she used to make me warm tea when I wasn’t feeling well. It always helped soothe things, I think. Although… that was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Rest and warm tea – good to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any coughing, shortness of breath, or any fever recently?
PATIENT: No coughing, no. And I haven't felt feverish, no. Breathing… sometimes I get a little winded, you know, like I said walking up hills. But that's just because I'm getting old, I think! Not really short of breath, just… tired.
DOCTOR: That’s fair. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like heart problems, lung disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Arthritis, yes. In my hands, mostly. The doctor told me years ago. Something about the joints. As for heart or lungs… I don’t think so. I worked construction all my life, so I was pretty healthy. Lots of physical work, you know. I never really had much trouble with my chest before this.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your hands, but no prior diagnoses of heart or lung problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. And… oh, I had a bad shoulder injury on the job site a long time ago. They had to fix that with surgery too. That was… oh, maybe thirty years ago? Everything feels like a long time ago now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and shoulder surgery. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t taken much medication over the years. A little pain reliever now and then for the arthritis, but nothing regularly. Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, sometimes. The kind you rub on your hands. And occasionally, if my hands are really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just a couple of pills, when I need them. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis cream and occasional ibuprofen. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he had high blood pressure, I think. And my mother, she had… well, she just got old, mostly. Lots of aches and pains. As for heart trouble… I don’t think so. My brother, he smoked a lot, but he’s… he passed away a long time ago. I don’t really know much about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had high blood pressure, and your mother had general aches and pains. Your brother smoked, but you don't have details about his health. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam, if that's alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to see if there's any tenderness. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. I don’t like feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, just breathe normally. Deep breaths in and out for me… Okay… I’m hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. Nothing drastically concerning, but we’ll keep that in mind. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not a loud murmur, but it's present. And now, I’m checking for any tenderness. There’s a little bit of discomfort when I press here… …and here… …but nothing severe. Do you feel that tenderness as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. When you press there, it’s like a dull ache. Like I said, it's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And yes, I think I feel it a little more on that side too, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Ruocco. That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing musculoskeletal chest pain, possibly with some underlying contribution from your lungs and heart. The diminished breath sounds and slight murmur warrant further investigation. Now, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. I also want to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm and see if there are any signs of a heart problem. And finally, a blood test to rule out any infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. An X-ray and a heart test… and the blood work, yes. Whatever it takes to get this figured out. I just… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll schedule you for the X-ray and EKG. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, avoid any strenuous activity, and take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen as needed for the discomfort. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to review everything. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Rest, ibuprofen… and the follow-up. Next week, yes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s a relief to finally be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. I’m glad you came in. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before I leave the room?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not at the moment. Just… try not to worry too much, right? That’s what my daughter always tells me. Just try not to worry. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor Vodzak.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent advice from your daughter, Mr. Ruocco. Try to focus on resting and taking it easy. We'll have those results back soon and go from there. I’ll see you next week. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before then.
