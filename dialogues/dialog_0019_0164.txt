DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling… unwell after eating fava beans. I know it sounds odd, but I get really tired and… yellow. Like, my skin gets yellow, and the whites of my eyes too. It started a few weeks ago, and I thought it was just something I ate, but it only happens after I eat those beans.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is interesting. Tired and yellowing of the skin and eyes… that sounds like jaundice, potentially. And it consistently happens after fava beans, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, consistently. Every time. I love them, usually. My grandmother used to make a wonderful stew with them, and I hadn’t had them in years, so I thought I'd try again. But each time… within a day or so, I start feeling weak, and then the yellowing begins. It’s a bit scary, to be honest. I haven't felt this tired in a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It’s good you’re paying attention to this and seeking it out. The timing definitely points to something related to the fava beans. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I guess… sometimes my stomach feels a little upset afterwards, but I figured that was just from enjoying the stew a bit too much. And maybe… just maybe… I’ve been a little short of breath, but it’s been so hot lately, I thought it was just the weather. It’s hard to tell, really. Nothing dramatic, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Stomach upset and shortness of breath… those could be related. It sounds like we need to investigate a possible condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency where people can't properly process fava beans. Do you happen to know if anyone else in your family has had similar issues after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Favism? No, I've never heard of that. That’s… a bit of a shock. Let me think about my family… My grandmother, the one who made the stew, she was Romanian, like me. And she always ate fava beans. I don’t recall her ever mentioning any problems, but she didn’t talk about much, honestly. My mother… she didn’t really like beans much, so she didn’t eat them often. I have a brother, though. He lives in Bucharest. I… I don’t know if he’s ever eaten them. I haven’t seen him in years. Would it matter if he has?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Mande. Favism is caused by a genetic deficiency, so knowing if other family members are affected can help us understand the likelihood of it being the cause. It’s also important to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and then order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, that sounds good. A physical exam and blood tests… whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on and feel normal again. I really appreciate you taking this seriously. It’s… unnerving, feeling like something is wrong and not knowing why.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It is unsettling not knowing. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Alright, let's start with a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Afterwards, we’ll draw some blood. If you could just hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, no problem. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous, but I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear on your heart and lungs, which is good. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice a little tenderness in your upper right quadrant. It’s not significant, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, we just need a small sample of blood. I’ll send it off to the lab for a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay – that last one is specifically to check for the deficiency related to Favism. It may take a few days to get the results back. Is there anything else you’d like to mention before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think you've got everything. Liver function tests… that makes sense, with the yellowing. And the G6PD… I guess that’s the test for the bean thing? I’m a little scared about waiting for the results, but I understand it takes time. Just… try to be quick, if you don’t mind. I’m not a big fan of needles.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mande. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’ll just be a small prick, and then it’s over. There we go, all done. Just hold this cotton ball firmly for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. You might have a small bruise later, but it will fade. Alright, the samples are on their way to the lab. We’ll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid fava beans and anything containing them. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn't so bad, actually. Thank you for being so gentle. And yes, I am allergic to penicillin. It gives me a terrible rash. Otherwise, I don’t have any known allergies. And I’ll definitely steer clear of those beans! It’s a bit sad, because I really did enjoy them, but… health comes first, of course.
DOCTOR: Good to know. We’ll make sure to document that clearly. Alright, Mande, while we're waiting for the lab results, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Just routine stuff. Have you had any major medical problems in the past, like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, nothing major, thankfully. I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was many years ago, and I recovered well. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, to be honest. I try to eat a balanced diet, and I walk regularly. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally, usually with dinner.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mande. A healthy lifestyle is very important. And the appendix removal was quite some time ago. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… my father had heart disease, unfortunately. He passed away a few years ago from it. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. Other than that… I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My parents didn’t really talk about it much. And I haven’t seen my brother in years, so I don’t know anything about his health either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. The heart disease history is something we'll keep in mind. And it’s not uncommon for family medical history to be incomplete. We can’t control what we don't know. Alright, Mande, I think that covers the major questions for now. We’ll wait for the lab results to come back, and then we’ll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or significant yellowing of the skin – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience and understanding. It’s… a relief to finally be getting some answers, even if we don’t have them yet. I will definitely contact you if anything changes. And I’ll avoid those beans! Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here if you need us. We’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results are available. Get well soon, and please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.
