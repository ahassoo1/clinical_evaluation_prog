DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. All over. It started, oh, maybe a couple of weeks ago, just a little thing, but it’s gotten…well, more noticeable. It's driving me a bit mad, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itching can be incredibly bothersome. A couple of weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. August 1st, maybe? I keep pretty good track of dates, you see. It started small, on my arms mostly, just a little tickle, but now it’s… everywhere. Back, legs, even my scalp. No real rash, just…itchy. And it doesn’t seem to be getting better with lotion. I’ve tried a few different kinds.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started around August 1st, primarily on your arms, and has now spread to your back, legs, and scalp. And you’ve tried lotions without much relief. Is the itching constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, but…mostly it’s there. It’s not a sharp itch, more… a persistent annoyance. Like a really bad mosquito bite that you just can’t quite scratch. Worse at night, I think. Keeps me awake sometimes. And it doesn't seem to be connected to anything specific - food, soap, anything like that. I've been trying to think, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a persistent annoyance, worse at night, and you haven’t noticed any particular triggers. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No rash, like I said. No bumps. Skin feels normal, just…itchy. Maybe a little dry, now that I think about it. It's been hot, hasn't it? But I’ve been using lotion regularly, so… I don’t know. Nothing obvious, really. No redness or swelling. It's just… this maddening itch.
DOCTOR: Alright, no rash, no bumps, skin feels normal aside from the dryness and the itch. We'll need to investigate further. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… No fever, no fatigue. Appetite’s normal, thankfully. No weight loss. Bowels are regular. I haven't noticed anything else, no. Just the itch. It’s funny, because I feel perfectly fine otherwise. That's what makes it so strange. It's just this constant…discomfort. It doesn't feel like I'm sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. It’s good that you haven’t experienced any other symptoms like fever or weight loss. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see... Well, I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. And…I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago. Other than that, nothing major. I’m pretty healthy, really. I used to be a carpenter, so lots of aches and pains over the years, but nothing a bit of rest didn't fix. Is that helpful? And…oh, I’m a widower, you know. Lost my wife, Elena, five years ago. But that’s…not a medical condition, of course. Sorry, rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not rambling at all. It’s good to have a complete picture. So, well-controlled high blood pressure and gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. Thank you. And I'm very sorry for your loss, Brendan. Losing Elena must have been very difficult. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides what you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams a day. And… sometimes, if I have trouble sleeping, I’ll take a melatonin tablet. But not every night, just when I really need it. Maybe once or twice a week, at most. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I get a bit worried about side effects, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and melatonin occasionally. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything. No shellfish, just a personal preference, but not an allergy. And I haven’t had any problems with any medications in the past, either. I’ve had a few antibiotics over the years, like everyone else, but no issues. I consider myself pretty lucky, allergy-wise. It’s my wife, Elena, who had all the allergies, not me. Poor thing. But no, no allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as skin conditions, allergies, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had arthritis, bad arthritis. And… my father had heart problems, I think. But mostly, everyone was pretty healthy. No skin conditions that I can recall. My wife's side of the family, they had… diabetes, I think? Her brother had it. But nothing about skin problems, allergies, or autoimmune diseases, no. It wasn’t a particularly sickly family, thankfully. Both sides, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart problems in your father, and diabetes in your wife’s brother. Thank you. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I live alone now, as I said, lost Elena five years ago. I keep busy, mostly. I do a bit of gardening, read a lot. I used to be very active, carpentry and all that, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to go to church regularly, but… it’s hard now. Too many memories. I try to stay in touch with a few friends, but… it’s lonely, to be honest. But I manage. I keep busy. That’s the important thing. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Brendan. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I think it's time for a quick physical exam. I’d like to take a look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever I can to figure this out. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I'm not a fan of needles, if that helps! But I trust your judgment. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No needles today, I promise. First, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, everything sounds clear there. Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Hmm... Your skin appears generally healthy. No visible rash, redness, or swelling. There’s a little dryness, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of infection or irritation. I don’t see any unusual moles or lesions. Your scalp looks normal as well. I do notice some mild scaling, but nothing too concerning. I’m not seeing anything definitive to explain the itching at this point. It's possible it's a mild form of eczema, dry skin exacerbated by the weather, or even a reaction to something you’re not aware of. But given the persistence of the symptoms, I think it would be wise to run some tests to rule out other possibilities. Would you be agreeable to a blood test?
PATIENT: Yes, a blood test sounds sensible. If it helps figure it out, I'm happy to do it. Better safe than sorry, as they say. What exactly will the test be looking for? And…will it be painful? I really don't like needles. But if you think it's necessary… I'll face it. Just let me know how bad it's going to be. And how long will it take to get the results? I'm trying to plan my week, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Brendan. It’s very common. The blood test will be looking at a few different things. We’ll check your complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or anemia. We’ll also check your liver and kidney function, as skin problems can sometimes be related to these organs. And finally, we’ll do a thyroid test, as thyroid issues can also cause itching. The needle prick is quick – just a small pinch, really. It will be over before you know it. And the phlebotomist is very skilled, so it shouldn’t be too painful. As for the results, it usually takes about three to five business days for the lab to get them back to us. We’ll give you a call as soon as we have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a hypoallergenic moisturizer to help with the dryness. Apply it liberally after showering. Also, try to avoid hot showers, as they can dry out your skin. And avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Hypoallergenic moisturizer, avoid hot showers, harsh soaps… I can do that. I'll try my best. Three to five days for the results… I can manage. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests. It’s good to know we're trying to figure it out. And… thank you for being patient with my rambling. I tend to get a bit anxious when I'm feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. It’s my job, and I’m happy to help. And please, don’t apologize for your anxiety. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're dealing with an unknown health issue. I’m going to write you a prescription for the moisturizer, and the nurse will draw the blood for the tests. We’ll call you as soon as the results are in. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you develop a fever, experience severe fatigue, or notice any changes in your skin – please don’t hesitate to call us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and patience. It's a relief to have a plan, even if we don't know the answer yet. Just… thank you. I'll see you in a few days, then. Hopefully with some good news. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. It was a pleasure meeting you. We’ll be in touch soon. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns in the meantime. The nurse will escort you to the lab now. Take care, and I hope you have a restful few days.
PATIENT: .
