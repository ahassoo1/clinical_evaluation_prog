DOCTOR: Hi Mitchell, it’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My head… back of head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not big pain, but… always there. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache, focused on the back of your head for about three days, and you describe it as a constant weight. That helps me start to get a picture. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Is hard to say… not like a pounding. More… dull. And sometimes, when I move my head… a little sharp pain. Not all the time though. I work with the trains, you know? Lots of looking around, checking things. Maybe that is it? Is okay headache, but… I no like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a dull ache, mostly, but with occasional sharp pain when you move your head. And you’re a train worker – lots of head turning and looking around. That's good information. When you say “no like it,” are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: No, no other things. Just the head. I can see good. I can walk good. I eat good. Sleep good. Just… this head. Is just bothersome. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I am old man, you know? Old men get tired. I not worry about that. Just want the head to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re not having any other symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or trouble walking. And you're right, feeling a bit tired is common as we get older. Let's do a quick exam to get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. Exam is good. I trust you, Doctor. Just tell me what you are doing, okay? I get nervous when I do not know things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just a quick cuff around your arm… and a moment to listen to your pulse. Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 – both looking good. Now, I’m going to gently feel around your head and neck to check for any tenderness or muscle tightness. Let me know if anything feels particularly sore when I press here.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Is good. Ooh. There. That one hurts a little. Back of the neck. Not big pain, but… feels tight. Like a knot. The rest is okay. Not sore anywhere else.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. I do feel some tightness in the muscles at the base of your neck on both sides, but more pronounced on the side you pointed out. It feels like there's a bit of a knot there. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion – just have you gently look up, down, left, and right for me, and then tilt your head towards each shoulder. Just go as far as is comfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can do that. Up… down… left… Ooh, that one… left side is a little hard. Not big pain, but… feels stuck. Right side is okay. Not so bad. Like I said, lots of looking around with the trains. Maybe I pulled something?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You have some limited range of motion on the left side, and you mentioned feeling stuck, which is consistent with muscle tension. It very well could be a muscle strain from the repetitive movements at work. I'm also going to do a quick neurological exam - just to check your reflexes and basic nerve function. I'll use a small hammer to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles, and then I'll touch your face and arms to make sure you feel sensation normally. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. I trust you, Doctor. Reflexes… is that like when they hit your knee with the rubber thing? I remember that from when I was a boy. Go ahead. I want this head to feel better.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly it! Okay, your reflexes are normal on both sides, and you’re feeling sensation normally in your arms and face. Everything seems to be working as it should neurologically. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders from your work. It’s good that there are no other neurological symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Tension… from the muscles. The trains… always looking around. Is good to know is not something bad. So… what do I do about it? Is there a medicine? Or something I can do to make it stop hurting? I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It's good we could figure out what's likely going on. For a tension headache like this, there are a few things we can try. First, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage the pain. I would suggest taking them as directed on the label. I also recommend applying heat or ice to your neck and shoulders – whichever feels better for you. Gentle stretching and massage can also help relax the muscles. I can also write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant if the pain is severe and the over-the-counter options aren't enough. However, those can sometimes cause drowsiness, so we'll need to discuss the risks and benefits. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my knees. Is good medicine. Maybe I will try that first. And the heat… yes, my wife used to put a warm cloth on my neck when I was sore. I like that. I don't want the sleepy medicine. I need to work with the trains. Maybe just the ibuprofen and the warm cloth? Is that enough? I don't want to take too many medicines.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan. Starting with ibuprofen and heat is a great first step. It's good you're mindful of not taking too many medications. I’ll write down some instructions for you, including the recommended dosage of ibuprofen. Also, try to be aware of your posture throughout the day – keeping your shoulders relaxed and avoiding straining your neck. If the pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it gets worse despite these measures, please come back and see me, and we can discuss other options. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You explain very good, Doctor. Thank you for helping me. I feel much better knowing what is wrong. Is good to know it is not something serious. I will try the ibuprofen and the warm cloth. And I will try to remember to not strain my neck. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or you're not feeling better, don't hesitate to come back. Here are those instructions. Take care, and be safe with the trains!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
