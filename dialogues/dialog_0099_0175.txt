DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Way, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Michae Way. But please, call me Michae. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Overgaard, right?
DOCTOR: Ledarius Overgaard will do. Now, Michae, let’s not waste time with pleasantries. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my… my back, mostly. It’s been really painful lately. It’s hard to explain, it’s just… achey, all the time. And sometimes it shoots down my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Achey, shooting pain…vague. How long has this “achey, shooting pain” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Let me think… It started maybe… three weeks ago? It wasn’t too bad at first, just a little stiff after I’d been sitting for a while. But the last week or so it’s gotten much worse. I woke up yesterday and it was really hard to get out of bed.
DOCTOR: And what makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, definitely bending over. And… walking for too long. Sitting for too long isn’t good either, actually. It’s kinda hard to win with this thing, you know? Like, whatever I do seems to bother it. Lifting anything… forget about it.
DOCTOR: Right. So, it’s aggravated by almost everything. And what, specifically, makes it better, if anything?
PATIENT: Well, lying down helps a little. And… I tried a warm bath yesterday, and that felt good for a bit. But it didn’t last long. Honestly, nothing really makes it a whole lot better, just takes the edge off for a short time. Is there something I should be doing?
DOCTOR: You’re sixty-five years old, and relatively thin according to my records. Have you had any injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Nothing major, anyway. I used to play basketball when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. No falls or anything like that. Just… the usual aches and pains from getting older, I guess. I've never been to a doctor about my back before this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… yeah, a little. My left foot feels kinda… tingly sometimes. Not all the time, but it’s been happening more often lately. And… maybe a little weak? Like it takes a bit more effort to wiggle my toes on that foot. I hadn't really thought much of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to be thorough, have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… geez, Doctor. That's a pretty personal question. Let me see… no, not really. Everything seems… normal down there, if you know what I mean. No problems with… holding it, or anything like that. Sorry, that’s kinda awkward to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s all part of the process, Michae. Necessary information. Now, let's have a look. If you don’t mind, lie down on the examination table for me. I'll need to do a quick physical assessment of your back and legs.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. Just let me know if there’s anything particular I should be aware of when you touch… you know, certain spots. It's pretty sensitive right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness is present over the L4-L5 vertebrae. Palpable muscle spasms. Now, let's check your reflexes. Knee reflexes are normal bilaterally. Ankle reflex on the left is slightly diminished. And now, let’s test your strength. Can you lift your left leg straight up while lying on your back?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… not easy. I can do it, kinda, but it really hurts. It feels like a pulling sensation in my back and down my leg. Not as strong as my other leg, definitely. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Diminished strength and a diminished reflex… and now the straight leg raise is positive. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary findings from the physical exam, it appears you likely have a lumbar radiculopathy—a pinched nerve in your lower back. It's not uncommon at your age, really. We'll need to get some imaging done to confirm. I'm ordering an MRI of your lumbar spine.
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh… Okay. That sounds… serious. A pinched nerve? Is that something I can fix? Will I need surgery? I don't really like the sound of surgery. I just thought it was a pulled muscle. Will the MRI tell us how bad it is?
DOCTOR: Let’s not jump to conclusions. An MRI will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Most cases of lumbar radiculopathy do not require surgery. We'll start with conservative management—physical therapy, medication for pain and inflammation. Surgery is only considered if conservative treatment fails. I’m prescribing you a course of naproxen to reduce the inflammation. And I’m giving you a referral to a physical therapist. They'll give you exercises to strengthen your back and core, and improve your flexibility. The MRI is scheduled for August 5th at City Imaging. Do you have any questions about that, or the medication?
PATIENT: August 5th… Okay, I can do that. Naproxen, right? I think I've heard of that. Is that like ibuprofen? And… what will the physical therapist actually do? Will it be really painful? I'm kinda worried about making things worse, you know? And… how long will it take to get better? I really just want to be able to walk without hurting.
DOCTOR: Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, similar to ibuprofen, but stronger. The physical therapist will assess your condition and develop a tailored exercise program. It shouldn't be excruciating, but there will likely be some discomfort. The goal is to gradually strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. As for how long it will take to get better… it varies. Some patients see improvement within a few weeks, others take several months. It depends on the severity of the nerve compression, and how diligently you follow the treatment plan. Here are your referrals and prescription. Follow up with the physical therapist as soon as possible, and we'll re-evaluate in four weeks to see how you're progressing. If your pain worsens significantly, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay. Four weeks… right. I’ll try to get an appointment with the physical therapist right away. Numbness or weakness… I’ll definitely keep an eye on that. I guess I just… kinda hope it doesn’t take too long. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. I think that’s all my questions for now. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow those instructions, and we’ll see how you’re doing in four weeks. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Next. .
