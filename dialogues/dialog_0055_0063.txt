DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, and it’s… well, you know I got the cancer, right? It’s… I think it’s the cancer hurting my back now. It’s hard to explain, but it’s just… a lot of pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your record you were previously diagnosed with cancer. And you're experiencing back pain that you believe may be related. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… not like a sharp pain, you know? More like… a heavy ache. All across my lower back. It’s there all the time, but when I try to… move, or even just sit up straight, it gets much, much worse. Feels like something is… pressing on me. And it goes down my legs a little bit sometimes, like a… tingling. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the fancy words for things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that provides some clarity. A heavy ache, constant, exacerbated by movement, radiating down the legs with tingling… Hmm. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Let me think… the ache, the constant ache… maybe a month now? But it's gotten really bad in the last week. Like, I had to ask my daughter to help me get dressed yesterday. The tingling… that started a few days ago, maybe three or four. It comes and goes, but when it’s there, it’s… not pleasant. I try to ignore it, but it's hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: A month of constant ache, worsening over the past week with recent onset of tingling… And you mentioned difficulty with dressing. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Yes… um… I’m tired. More tired than usual, and I was already pretty tired all the time. And… it’s hard to… go to the bathroom. Like, I have to go more often, but it’s… difficult to get everything out, you know? I don’t want to talk about it too much, but it’s there. And I haven’t been eating much. Everything just feels… tasteless.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, increased urinary frequency with difficulty emptying, and a decreased appetite… I see. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… I have lost some weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven't actually… weighed myself. I don’t really like to. It just makes me sad. But yeah, I think I’m smaller. It’s not like… a lot, but I can feel it. I try not to worry about it, but it’s hard when everything else is… bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve me palpating your back and assessing your reflexes and range of motion. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And… if there’s anything you can do about the pain. It’s just… getting so hard to live. I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please lie face down on the examination table for me. We’ll begin with palpation of the spine. I'm noting tenderness over the L4-L5 region. There is some muscle spasm present as well. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Now, could you please try to bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ow… yeah, that hurts. Right there. It always hurts. I… can’t really. It just… stops. It feels like something is blocking me. And it hurts a lot when I try to go further. Sorry. I'm not very good at this. I used to be able to do this. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with pain upon forward flexion. Tenderness, muscle spasm, and diminished reflexes… These findings, coupled with your history, are concerning. I’m going to order some imaging – an MRI of the lumbar spine – to further evaluate the cause of your pain. This will help us determine if there is any compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots. In the meantime, I will prescribe you a mild pain reliever and muscle relaxant. We'll also need to review your cancer treatment history again to consider potential metastasis. It is important to rule out all possibilities.
PATIENT: Okay… an MRI. That sounds… scary. But if it helps… I guess. And the medicine… will it make me sleepy? I need to help my daughter with things. She’s got two jobs, you know? And… metastasis? That’s… the cancer spreading, right? I don’t want it to spread. I just want it to… stop.
DOCTOR: The MRI is a standard diagnostic procedure, Ms. Meigs. It is not painful, simply… time-consuming. The medication may cause some drowsiness, but we can start with a low dose and adjust as needed. As for metastasis… yes, it refers to the cancer spreading to other parts of the body. However, we won't know anything definitive until we have the results of the MRI. I’m also going to order some blood work to assess your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation. We need to be thorough. I will have the imaging and blood work ordered immediately. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to schedule the MRI and where to go for the blood draw. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… will the nurse call me? I don't like to drive much anymore. I just want to know what’s happening. I feel like… everything is falling apart.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. The nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you are unable to drive, you can arrange for someone to accompany you, or we can explore options for transportation assistance. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Meigs. We will do our best to provide you with answers as quickly as possible. I will have the nurse contact you before you leave with detailed instructions and contact information. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… trying. I just hope… it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
