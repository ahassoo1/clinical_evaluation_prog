DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are eighteen years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, eighteen. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. And I have… a funny heartbeat sometimes. The doctor back home said it was somethin’ with my heart, atrial… fib… somethin’. That’s why I’m here, I think. It's just gotten worse recently.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes. A common arrhythmia. And this leg swelling… when did you first notice that, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It started… maybe a week ago? It was just a little bit at first, but it’s gotten bigger each day. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. It feels… tight, and a bit achy. Not too bad, but noticeable. I was hopin’ it wasn’t serious.
DOCTOR: A week ago, progressively worsening… and localized to the calf. Do you have any pain with walking, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: Not really, no. It doesn't hurt to walk, exactly. It just feels… heavy, you know? Like I’m carryin’ a stone in my leg. And a bit uncomfortable if I stand for too long. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. Kreckel. It's good that it’s not sharp pain, that's a positive sign. But any swelling that worsens over a week warrants investigation. Now, let's get some more information. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the swollen area?
PATIENT: Hmm… I haven’t really checked, Doctor. I just noticed it was bigger. Let me… It doesn't look red, no. And it doesn’t feel particularly warm, not that I can tell. It feels… just normal skin, I suppose. Maybe a bit smoother than my other leg, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Smoother skin… interesting. Alright. And has this swelling been associated with any injury?
PATIENT: No, no injury at all. I haven't bumped it or anything. I've been… mostly just at my computer, workin'. That's why I'm here, I suppose. I did a lot of travel a couple of weeks ago, getting settled for school, but that was before the swelling started.
DOCTOR: Travel… and now sedentary work. Very well. Now, let’s discuss your heart condition. Do you recall what tests were done back home to diagnose the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: Oh… well, the doctor did an… electrocardiogram, I think that’s what he called it. It was the thing with the sticky pads on my chest. And… he listened to my heart with that listenin’ tube thing. That’s all I really remember, to be honest. He just said my heartbeat was… irregular. Is that a bad thing? I don't really understand all of it.
DOCTOR: Irregular is… suboptimal, Ms. Kreckel. We'll need to repeat that electrocardiogram here to get a baseline, and likely perform some bloodwork to assess your overall health. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not takin’ anything at all. Not for my heart, not for anythin’. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. I haven’t really needed to before, until this leg started botherin’ me. I did take some painkillers once for a bad headache, but that was ages ago. Just the over-the-counter kind.
DOCTOR: No current medications. Very well. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Kreckel?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anythin’. My mum always said I was a sturdy child. Though… I am a bit sensitive to bright light sometimes, if that counts? But that's not an allergy, is it? Just… bothers me a bit.
DOCTOR: No, that is not an allergy, Ms. Kreckel. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing serious. I had the usual childhood illnesses, chickenpox and things like that, but that was years ago. I haven’t been to the hospital since I was a little boy and broke my arm falling out of a tree. I’ve been pretty healthy, generally. Apart from this heart thing, and the leg. Is that good or bad? I’m not sure what’s normal, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A relatively unremarkable past medical history is… encouraging, Ms. Kreckel. Now, have any close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – had any significant medical problems, particularly heart disease, blood clots, or leg swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My gran on my mum’s side had… somethin’ with her legs, I think. They were always swollen. She had to wear special stockings, I remember that. And… my dad’s father had a heart attack when he was quite old, but that was a long time ago. He smoked a lot, though. Apart from that… I don’t really know. My family doesn't really talk about health things much.
DOCTOR: History of leg swelling in maternal grandmother, cardiac event in paternal grandfather… noted. Alright, Ms. Kreckel. Now, let’s perform a physical examination. If you don’t mind. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your leg more closely. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds fine, Doctor. I’ll lie down, then. Just tell me if you need me to move anythin’. I hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of work to catch up on later.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kreckel. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, if you’ll just lie flat on your back… good. Heart rate is… irregular, as expected. Some noticeable murmurs present. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Calf circumference is significantly increased compared to the contralateral leg. Skin is warm to the touch, but no significant redness noted. Moderate pitting edema present. Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are present, but slightly diminished in the affected leg. Alright, Ms. Kreckel. The examination confirms your concerns. We need to investigate the cause of this leg swelling and your irregular heartbeat. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a D-dimer to rule out blood clots. We’ll also repeat the electrocardiogram and obtain an echocardiogram to assess your heart function.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood clots? Is that serious? And an echo… is that painful? I just want to know what’s wrong, and if I can get back to work soon. Are these tests expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is simply a blood test, Ms. Kreckel, to assess for the possibility of a blood clot. It doesn’t mean you have one, simply indicates if further investigation is needed. And an echocardiogram is a non-invasive ultrasound of your heart—it won’t cause you any discomfort. As for the cost… that is… a concern, given your lack of insurance. The costs will depend on the laboratory fees and the facility charges. I will have the billing department provide you with an estimate. We can discuss options for financial assistance or a payment plan. I understand this is stressful, Ms. Kreckel. But it’s important to determine the cause of your symptoms, so we can begin appropriate treatment. I’ll order the tests now, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible, and avoiding prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… elevate my leg. I can do that. And a payment plan… that would be good, yes. Um… what exactly are we lookin’ for with these tests? Is my heart… broken? That sounds silly, I know. And… what if it is a blood clot? Will I be okay? I… I get a bit anxious easily, Doctor. Just tell me what the worst-case scenario is, if you don’t mind. It’s better to know, I think.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kreckel, your heart is not “broken” in the literal sense. The tests will help us determine the cause of the irregular heartbeat – it could be a variety of things, and we need to rule out any underlying structural issues. Now, regarding a blood clot… that is a serious, but treatable condition. If a blood clot is present, we would initiate anticoagulation therapy—medications to prevent the clot from growing or traveling to your lungs. The treatment is highly effective, but requires diligent monitoring. The worst-case scenario… with a blood clot, if left untreated, it can lead to pulmonary embolism – a blockage in the lungs – which can be life-threatening. However, we are being proactive, Ms. Kreckel. These tests are to prevent that from happening. And I assure you, we will manage this appropriately. It is important to remain calm. We have a plan. We will obtain the necessary tests, review the results, and discuss the best course of treatment for you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Pulmonary embolism… that sounds very scary. But… you said we have a plan. And you’re going to help me. I… I think I need a moment. Just to… process everything. Is it alright if I just sit here for a bit? And then, maybe I can schedule the tests?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kreckel. Take all the time you need. I will leave you to collect your thoughts. The nursing staff will be available if you require assistance. When you are ready, please let them know, and they will assist you with scheduling the necessary tests. And remember, we are addressing this proactively. It’s best to know what we are dealing with, so we can manage it effectively.
