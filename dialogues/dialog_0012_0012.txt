DOCTOR: Hi Velda, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Yoshino. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information from my doctor. Just a little paperwork, I expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable. Cruise lines often have those requirements. Let me pull up your chart… Alright, Velda Squiers, age 45. And you said this is mostly for paperwork related to the cruise?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Mostly just confirming I’m fit enough to travel, I suppose. I haven’t been seriously unwell in…oh, goodness, must be ten years now. Though I did have a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing a good rest didn’t cure. Is there a specific form they need me to fill out, or are you able to provide a letter?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you've been relatively healthy. I don't see any specific forms faxed over yet. A letter is definitely doable. To make sure it's thorough, let’s just go over a little bit of your medical history. We can cover things like any past illnesses, surgeries, medications you’re taking, allergies, and your family history. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to go through everything with you. I don’t take any regular medications currently, and as far as I’m aware, I don’t have any allergies. Though, my grandmother…her sister was terribly sensitive to shellfish. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? Family history, you said?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the medications and allergies. And yes, family history is helpful, even sensitivities like your grandmother's sister's shellfish allergy. It can sometimes give us clues. So, shellfish allergy noted on the family side. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, heart problems, or anything else along those lines?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite healthy, touch wood. I did have my tonsils removed when I was a wee girl - perhaps seven or eight years old - but that was just a routine thing, the doctor said. And a broken arm when I was in university, climbing a rather silly tree. Nothing serious, and fully healed, of course. No chronic conditions, no. I used to get migraines when I was younger, but they haven't bothered me in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a healed broken arm, no chronic conditions, and migraines that have resolved. Good to know. And how about any surgeries other than the tonsils and the arm?
PATIENT: No, those were the only two. I haven't had any other surgical procedures, not at all. I'm rather… averse to hospitals, if I’m honest. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. Though, I did have wisdom teeth removed, but that was just a quick thing at the dentist. Is that considered a surgery? I suppose it was a minor one.
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth removal does count as a surgical procedure, though a minor one is perfectly fine to note. Okay, wisdom teeth removal noted. Now, let's talk about your family history a bit more specifically. Are there any significant health problems that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stroke, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My father had a touch of high blood pressure towards the end of his life, but he was a very stressed man, always working. And my mother… she had arthritis in her hands, quite badly towards the end as well. And an uncle, on my father’s side, suffered from emphysema, I believe. He was a heavy smoker, unfortunately. Nothing else springs immediately to mind. My family weren't terribly forthcoming about medical things, if I’m honest. Rather private folk.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother, and emphysema in an uncle who was a smoker. We'll note those. Now, just a couple more quick questions. What about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh. Well, I enjoy a brisk walk most days, down by the river. And I’m quite keen on my gardening, if the weather allows. I don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with my supper occasionally, but nothing excessive. And I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though I do have a sweet tooth, I must confess. I’ve always been a fairly active person, I suppose. Nothing too strenuous these days, but I keep myself moving.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy lifestyle overall! Alright, Velda, that gives me a good starting point. Now, just to be thorough, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That would be perfectly fine. I suppose it’s sensible to be thorough. I didn't want to presume I could just stroll in and get a letter without a little check-up. Do let me know if anything seems amiss! I am a little sensitive about my blood pressure, mind you. It does tend to creep up when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be mindful of that. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Okay, a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your nervousness. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me… Sounds nice and clear. And your heart rhythm is regular. Everything sounds good so far. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look fine as well. Alright, Velda, everything seems good. Your physical exam is normal.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very reassuring to hear! I do worry sometimes. That's good news, truly. So, you think a letter confirming I’m fit to travel would be alright? And what sort of detail should it contain, do you think? I wouldn't want to give them something insufficient. Perhaps a mention of the slightly elevated blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. A letter confirming you’re fit to travel is perfectly reasonable. And yes, we will mention the slightly elevated blood pressure, noting it was likely due to exam-related anxiety, and that your overall exam findings were normal. I’ll also state that you have no known chronic medical conditions and no significant limitations to travel. Does that sound comprehensive enough?
PATIENT: That sounds absolutely perfect, Doctor Yoshino. Just lovely. And would you happen to have a copy of that form they mentioned? So I can give it to them. Or perhaps you could fax it directly to the cruise line? I don't even know their fax number, but I can certainly obtain it if necessary. It's just...sometimes these things get lost in the post, you know. I’m rather old-fashioned in that regard.
DOCTOR: I can print out a general medical fitness to travel form for you to complete, which you can then submit with the letter. I don’t have the cruise line’s specific form readily available. As for faxing, I can certainly do that once you provide me with the fax number. It’s usually the most reliable method. Here’s the letter and the form. Please review them to make sure everything is accurate. If you're happy with it, just let me know and we can proceed with faxing the letter if you have the number. And if you need a copy for your records, just ask!
PATIENT: Oh, that is wonderfully helpful, Doctor. This all looks quite… official! Yes, everything seems correct. The blood pressure mention is quite discreet, which is very thoughtful of you. And the form... I can certainly fill this in, no problem at all. I don't have the fax number with me currently, but I can obtain it from the cruise line’s website, I expect. Once I have it, I shall call and give it to your receptionist. Thank you so much for your assistance, Doctor Yoshino. You've put my mind completely at ease. I really appreciate your thoroughness and your kindness.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Velda! I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. Feel free to call when you have the fax number. Have a wonderful time on your cruise! And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your trip. Take care!
