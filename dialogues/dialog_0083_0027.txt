DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let's just get right to it. It's this… stuff. Coming up. Bad heartburn, really. It’s been happening for a while now, and frankly, it's annoying. I tried some of those over-the-counter things, but they don't really do much, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing persistent heartburn and the over-the-counter medications haven’t provided much relief. I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Altine, and we will certainly try to be efficient. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this "stuff" coming up?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… food. Undigested food, mostly. And acid, of course. It just… comes back up. Especially when I lie down. And sometimes after I eat, even if it wasn't that much. It’s unpleasant. Really unpleasant. I don’t need a lecture on what it is, I just want it to stop. Do you need a detailed inventory of every single thing I’ve eaten in the past month? Because I don't have that.
DOCTOR: No, a detailed inventory isn’t necessary, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you’re describing regurgitation, bringing food back up from your stomach, often with acid. The fact that it’s worse when lying down is helpful information. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how frequently this happens?
PATIENT: Frequently? What does that even mean? Look, it’s not every single meal, if that’s what you’re asking. But it's... enough. Several times a week, easily. Maybe more when I’ve had a good dinner. You know, a proper dinner. Not this rabbit food everyone's pushing these days. It’s… disruptive. I can’t sleep properly. My wife complains. Honestly, it’s just… bothersome. Is that specific enough for you? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Altine. “Several times a week” gives me a better idea of the frequency. And I understand it’s impacting your sleep and your wife's as well. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Aside from the regurgitation and heartburn, have you been experiencing any chest pain, difficulty swallowing, unintentional weight loss, or a persistent cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not unless you count the general discomfort of this whole situation. Swallowing… no, it doesn’t hurt to swallow. A little tricky sometimes, maybe, but nothing major. Weight loss? Definitely not. I enjoy my food, thank you very much. And a cough? No, I don't cough. Look, I'm a big, healthy man. Well, I was a big, healthy man before all this… upheaval. Are we getting anywhere or are we just making a list of things I don’t have? Because honestly, my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I appreciate your patience. We are getting somewhere. Ruling out those other symptoms is important. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Honestly, I've been pretty lucky. I've always been strong. High blood pressure, maybe, the doctor mentioned something once, years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt. I mostly ignore him. Diabetes? No. Asthma? Absolutely not. I used to work outdoors, you know? Very physical job. I don't do much of that now, but I still consider myself a healthy individual. A healthy individual plagued by… this. Anything else? I’m really not one for doctor's appointments. They always want to put me on pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of possible high blood pressure, but not actively managed. That’s good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any other medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had a reason. I broke my arm when I was a boy, but that’s it. A simple fracture. Hospitalized? Once. Appendicitis, when I was young. That’s about it. I’m not a delicate flower, you know? I’ve always been… robust. I don’t sit around getting sick. It’s… a waste of time. Look, I’m starting to feel like I'm giving you my life story here. Is this relevant? Are we going to actually do something about this problem?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like I’m asking a lot of questions, Mr. Altine. It’s important to get a complete picture. No history of surgeries and only a childhood appendectomy is helpful information. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter… I tried some of those antacids, like I said. Didn’t do much. Vitamins? My wife makes me take a multivitamin sometimes. She thinks I don’t get enough fruit. And a fish oil pill, for my heart. She’s very insistent. Prescription… no, nothing. I avoid pills whenever possible. They always have side effects. Honestly, I'd rather just deal with the discomfort than feel worse from the… treatment. Is that enough? I really need to get back to work. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a multivitamin and fish oil, as recommended by your wife, and you’ve tried antacids without significant relief. Now, a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it ruined his health. I learned my lesson early. Alcohol? I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Nothing excessive. I’m not a… a drinker. It’s a… a civilized habit. A small glass of red wine with my meal. Is that going to disqualify me from… whatever it is you're trying to determine here? Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, you are not being interrogated. We're simply gathering information to understand the cause of your symptoms. A small glass of wine with dinner isn’t a concern. Finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, cancer, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had… something with her stomach. Ulcers, I think. Spent a lot of time in the hospital. My father, heart trouble, as I said. He smoked, of course. His brother, cancer. It’s… not a particularly healthy family, if you want to know the truth. We all seem to have something. Is that… useful? Look, I'm starting to feel a little depressed just listing everything. I just want to feel normal again. This whole process is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine, and I appreciate you sharing that information, even though it’s not pleasant to recall. A family history of stomach ulcers, heart trouble, and cancer is helpful to know. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me – the heartburn, regurgitation, worsening when lying down, a history of possible high blood pressure, a family history of digestive issues, and the fact that over-the-counter medications haven't provided relief – it sounds like you may be experiencing gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. The regurgitation of undigested food suggests it's not just acid, which could indicate some degree of esophageal dysfunction. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: GERD? Another fancy name for something unpleasant, I presume? Look, I’m not a fan of poking and prodding. I’m a big man, perfectly capable of telling you what’s wrong with me. But… fine. If you must. But make it quick. I have a very important phone call this afternoon. And please, be gentle. I haven't been feeling myself lately. It’s probably nothing. Just indigestion. Honestly, the worry is worse than the symptoms. Just get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. This will just be a brief assessment. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any obvious tenderness or masses. However, I do note some mild discomfort in your upper abdomen when I press here. This supports the possibility of some inflammation in your stomach or esophagus. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I recommend a few tests. We could do an endoscopy to visualize your esophagus and stomach directly, or a pH monitoring test to measure the amount of acid in your esophagus over a 24-hour period. Would you be open to discussing these options?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? You want to… look inside me? With a camera? Absolutely not. That sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. And 24 hours of… monitoring? I have a life, you know. I can't spend a whole day hooked up to machines. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Look, I came here for a quick fix, not a full-blown medical investigation. Are you sure it's not just indigestion? Maybe some stress? I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately. Can't you just give me something for the heartburn? A stronger antacid, perhaps? Something to settle my stomach? I really don’t think all these tests are necessary. It's probably just something I ate. Honestly. I have a very important lunch meeting tomorrow, and I need to be at my best.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Altine. An endoscopy and pH monitoring are the most accurate ways to diagnose GERD, but I respect your wishes. We can start with a trial of a stronger medication. I’m going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. This medication reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces, which should help relieve your heartburn and allow your esophagus to heal. We'll start with a standard dose for eight weeks. However, it’s important to remember that this is just a treatment for your symptoms. We haven’t identified the underlying cause of your GERD. If the medication doesn't provide significant relief, or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to reconsider further testing. In addition to the medication, I recommend making some lifestyle changes. Avoid eating large meals before bed, elevate the head of your bed, and try to identify and avoid foods that trigger your heartburn. Do you have any questions about the medication or the lifestyle changes?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? Avoid large meals? Elevate my bed? Honestly, it sounds like my whole life is about to be dictated by my stomach. But… fine. I suppose I can try. I’m not one for following instructions, but I’m willing to humor you. As long as it doesn’t involve any cameras or machines. What are the side effects of this… PPI? I don’t want to trade one problem for another. And how long before I should start to feel better? I have that lunch meeting tomorrow, remember? I need to be sharp. Honestly, if this doesn't work, I'm finding another doctor. A doctor who doesn’t insist on poking and prodding and subjecting me to unnecessary tests. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Mr. Altine. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I’m committed to providing you with the best possible care. The most common side effects of PPIs are mild and include headache, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. More serious side effects are rare, but can include an increased risk of certain infections and nutrient deficiencies. If you experience any unusual symptoms, please contact me immediately. As for how long before you should start to feel better, most people experience significant relief within two to four weeks of starting a PPI. However, it can take up to eight weeks for complete healing of the esophagus. I’m optimistic that you’ll experience some improvement before your lunch meeting tomorrow, but it’s important to be realistic. I’m going to write you a prescription for omeprazole, 20 milligrams, to be taken once daily in the morning, 30 minutes before a meal. I’ll also provide you with a handout outlining the lifestyle changes I recommend. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s enough for now. Just… please, no more tests. And I hope this works. Honestly, I'm counting on it. I have a reputation to uphold. A lunch meeting to conquer. Just… thank you. I suppose. I’ll see myself out. Hopefully, I won't need to see you again. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand. I’m optimistic that the medication will provide relief, and I’m here if you have any concerns. Here’s the prescription and the handout. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. I wish you all the best with your lunch meeting and hope to see you feeling better soon. Have a good day, Mr. Altine.
