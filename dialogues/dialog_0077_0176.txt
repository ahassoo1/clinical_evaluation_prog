DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… embarrassing, really. I’ve got the hiccups. And they just won’t stop. It's been over two days now.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, hiccups. I know it sounds silly, but it’s really starting to bother me. I manage events, you see, and trying to talk to clients while hiccuping… not a good look. It’s been pretty constant, though they do vary in how strong they are. See?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly disruptive when hiccups persist. Two days is quite a while. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. Perhaps we can start with a little more detail. Can you recall anything that might have triggered them?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggered them. That’s a good question. Let me think. I had a really big event on Saturday – a wedding, actually, very fancy. Lots of running around, a lot of talking… I did drink a fizzy drink with dinner, a kind of orange soda. And… oh! And I laughed a lot. It was a happy wedding, lots of funny things happened. Does any of that sound relevant?
DOCTOR: A wedding on Saturday, orange soda, and a lot of laughter. That gives us a starting point. Have you experienced hiccups like this before, or is this a new occurrence?
PATIENT: This is new. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away pretty quickly. Usually after drinking water, or holding my breath. But this… this is different. It doesn’t seem to matter what I do. I even tried scaring myself! Didn’t work.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’m a little tired, maybe, but that’s probably just from not sleeping properly because of the hiccups. No pain, no trouble breathing, nothing like that. Just… hiccups. And a bit of embarrassment, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No other symptoms, just persistent hiccups and some fatigue. Let me quickly review your chart here… I see your height and weight. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. Nothing at all. And no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My divorce was… a long time ago, and that was the only time I really needed anything prescribed, and that was just for… stress. But that was years ago. I don’t take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: No medications or known allergies. Good. Now, may I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmmm. That’s a bit tricky. My mother, she had… well, she always had a sensitive stomach. Lots of indigestion. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had high blood pressure. That’s about all I can really recall, to be honest. We weren’t a family that really talked about medical things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Okay. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, as I said, I manage events. So it's pretty hectic. Lots of standing, a lot of talking on the phone, late nights sometimes. I try to eat reasonably well, but it’s hard when I'm always on the go. I don’t really exercise regularly, I should, I know. I don't smoke, and I only drink occasionally, usually at events. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Alright, Ivette, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. It's just to rule out anything obvious. If you could just sit up there for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, you won't find anything too alarming! I really need these hiccups to stop before my next event.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Everything sounds clear, good strong heartbeat, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Not tender to the touch. Okay. Everything feels normal here.
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn't too bad. No pain at all. I appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. I just… feel a bit silly, really. It’s just hiccups! But they are very persistent hiccups.
DOCTOR: It's alright, don't feel silly. Persistent hiccups can be quite bothersome, and it's good we've ruled out anything obvious. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it appears you have simple, idiopathic hiccups. Idiopathic means we don’t have a clear cause. Sometimes they just happen. Now, usually, these resolve on their own. However, since they’ve been going on for two days, and are causing you distress, we can try a few things. Have you tried holding your breath for as long as possible, and then taking a slow, deep breath?
PATIENT: Yes, I already mentioned that, I did try holding my breath. It didn’t work this time. Usually that does the trick, but not these ones. I also tried drinking water really quickly, and scaring myself, like I said earlier. Nothing seems to be helping. Is there anything else? Perhaps a medication?
DOCTOR: Yes, there are a few medications we can try, although they aren't always effective and can have side effects. One is baclofen, a muscle relaxant. The other is chlorpromazine, an antipsychotic. However, given the potential side effects, and the fact that your hiccups aren’t associated with any underlying medical condition, I’m hesitant to prescribe them immediately. Let’s try a few more conservative measures first. We can also try a teaspoon of sugar, or a sip of vinegar. Sometimes those can stimulate the vagus nerve and stop the hiccups. If those don’t work, then we can discuss medication. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, conservative measures first sounds sensible. I’d rather not take medication if I can avoid it. Sugar and vinegar… interesting! I’ve heard of the sugar trick, but never tried it. I’ll definitely give both a try. Do you have a preference as to which one I try first? And… how long should I wait before considering medication?
DOCTOR: I’d suggest trying the sugar first, as it’s the more palatable option. A teaspoon of granulated sugar, let it dissolve slowly in your mouth. If that doesn’t work within 30 minutes, try a sip of vinegar – apple cider vinegar is usually best, diluted in a glass of water. If the hiccups persist for another 24 hours after trying both of those, then we can discuss a prescription for baclofen. However, keep in mind that baclofen can cause drowsiness, so it may not be ideal if you have events to manage. We would need to weigh the benefits and risks carefully. Also, if you experience any difficulty breathing or chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense. Sugar first, then vinegar, then we talk about medication if they continue, and definitely see a doctor if I have trouble breathing. I’m writing it all down. Thank you so much, Doctor. I feel much better knowing there’s a plan. I'll give the sugar a try right away. Hopefully, it will work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I sincerely hope the sugar does the trick! If not, we'll explore other options. Best of luck, and please let me know how it goes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that's everything, thank you. I think I'm all set. I really appreciate your patience and understanding. I'll go try the sugar now. Have a good day, Doctor Pirl.
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Ivette. And please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
