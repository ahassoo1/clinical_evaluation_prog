DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit of a bother coming here. I need to get cleared for… well, a little touch-up. My daughter insisted. Says I look “tired.” Humph. It's just some… sagging skin. Nothing serious, I assure you. Let’s just get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Right. A “touch-up.” And your daughter is concerned about… cosmetic changes. Very well. To be thorough, even for something… elective, I need some information. How long have you been noticing this “sagging skin,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. A few years, I suppose. It’s not like it happened overnight. And really, Doctor, I've lived a long life. A little drooping is to be expected. I worked hard, out in the sun, doing terrazzo. Not sitting behind a desk like some folks. It's just… now my daughter thinks she gets to decide how I should look. It's ridiculous. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Terrazzo… right. And have you noticed any other changes along with this… cosmetic concern?
PATIENT: Other changes? What do you mean? I’m eighty-one years old, Doctor, not a blooming flower! Things change. My knees ache more, I get tired quicker… is that what you’re getting at? Honestly, I don’t need a list of my ailments read back to me. I came here for a simple clearance, not a full physical.
DOCTOR: I understand you want to keep this brief, Mr. Orwin. However, a quick assessment is still required to ensure you're a suitable candidate for… the procedure. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Never had a problem with dizziness. I have excellent balance, thank you very much. All those years on my feet… keeps a man steady. I walked all over Europe, you know. Perfectly steady. Look, are we getting closer to being finished here? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Well, yes, a bit. Everything's not as sharp as it used to be. I need glasses for reading, naturally. Been needing those for… oh, must be ten years now. But I manage. I still drive, you know. Perfectly safely. Don't need any trouble seeing to do that. Is this going to disqualify me? Honestly, what’s this all about?
DOCTOR: Alright. And any… difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? Goodness, no. I walked up three flights of stairs just to get to my apartment this morning! Though……I do get a little winded sometimes, especially after exertion. But who doesn't at my age? It's just a little puffing. Nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, this is starting to feel like a waste of my time. I came here to get a signature, not a life story analyzed.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. A small dose. Nothing fancy. And… … I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. A rash, I think. Nothing life-threatening. Look, can we just speed this along? My daughter will be furious if I'm late. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything serious?
