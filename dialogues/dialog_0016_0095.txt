DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this. But my housekeeper insisted. Sudden deafness in one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. It started yesterday morning. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, and it's good your housekeeper encouraged you to come in. Sudden hearing loss and facial droop are definitely things we need to investigate promptly. “Quite inconvenient” doesn’t quite cover it, honestly. Just to be clear, it started yesterday morning – was there anything specific happening at that time?
PATIENT: Specific? No. I woke up, had my usual tea, and then noticed it when I was giving instructions to the staff. It wasn't during anything, if that's what you mean. Honestly, I don’t spend my mornings cataloging every little sensation. It just… was. And now I'm here, wasting perfectly good daylight.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. No need to catalog sensations, of course. Just trying to get a clearer picture of the onset. So it wasn’t linked to any particular activity or stressor. Okay. And you said half your face feels droopy – can you show me exactly which side, and what specifically feels different?
PATIENT: This side. It just… doesn’t move as easily. When I smile, it pulls… less. It's quite noticeable, actually. Do I look ridiculous? Because I really haven’t the patience for a lengthy self-assessment.
DOCTOR: No, you absolutely don't look ridiculous. It is subtle, but I can see what you mean. Okay, and has this drooping been constant since yesterday, or has it changed at all?
PATIENT: Constant. As far as I can tell. It hasn't gotten worse, if that's what you’re asking. It's just… there. It’s profoundly irritating, frankly. I have a board meeting next week, and I can’t very well present looking like this. Do you have any idea how long this is going to take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the board meeting. We’ll try to move as quickly as we can. Constant since yesterday is good to know. Now, let's quickly run through a few questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. No fever, no headache. Taste is… normal. No dizziness. I haven’t had any trouble with vision. Honestly, it’s just the ear and the face. Are you going to ask me about every single bodily function now? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: No, I won't go through every function, I promise. Just trying to rule things out. No fever, headache, normal taste, no dizziness, vision okay – that's helpful. Okay. And have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Never. And I assure you, if I had, I would remember it. I have an excellent memory. This is completely new. I don't appreciate being asked questions with obvious answers, Doctor. It implies I’m… absentminded. Which I am not.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed to imply anything of the sort, Stephane. I assure you, I wasn’t trying to suggest you're absentminded. It’s standard practice to cover all possibilities, and sometimes that means asking what might seem obvious. Okay. Let’s move on to your medical history, then. Do you have any significant medical conditions I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: Honestly, I’ve always been exceptionally healthy. I watch my diet, I exercise, and I have excellent genes. I used to play tennis, competitively, you know. I suppose I had a bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no heart trouble. And absolutely no patience for long medical histories. Is this getting us anywhere?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. Flu a few years back is good to know. We are getting somewhere, gathering information. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I prefer a natural approach to wellness. Vitamins, a good diet, and plenty of rest. No prescriptions for me, thank you very much. I believe in preventative care, not reactive treatment. It’s common sense, really.
DOCTOR: Very good. No medications. And any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Pollen bothers me, a little. Seasonal allergies, nothing severe. A runny nose, perhaps a bit of sneezing. But no serious allergies. Definitely not allergic to any medications, because I don’t take any. Are you keeping notes? Because I do expect a thorough assessment, given the… inconvenience of all this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am keeping detailed notes. Seasonal allergies, mild, good to know. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll need to look in your ears, check your facial nerves, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Must you? Honestly, I was hoping for a diagnosis and a solution, not a full-body inspection. But, fine. Get it over with. Just… try to be quick. And please, don’t poke me unnecessarily. I have a very important phone call in… well, I don’t know how long, but I need to be available.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, I promise. Okay, looking in your ears now… I’m not seeing any obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, can you raise your eyebrows for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that high enough? I’m perfectly capable of raising my eyebrows, if that’s what you were doubting. Honestly, this is rather demeaning. Now, can we move on? I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly capable. Now, can you try smiling for me, nice and wide?
PATIENT: Is that satisfactory? I told you, one side doesn’t work as well. It’s quite obvious. You’re simply confirming what I already know. Is there a point to all this, Doctor? Because I'm beginning to suspect this is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the asymmetry. And I appreciate your patience. This is helping me assess the situation. Now, can you close your eyes as tightly as possible?
PATIENT: Done. Is one side drooping more than the other when I do that, too? Because, frankly, I suspect it is. I’m not blind, you know. Just tell me what you think, and let’s get to a solution. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: You are correct; the left eyelid isn’t closing as completely. Okay. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you're experiencing what we call Bell’s Palsy. This is a condition where there’s sudden weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It’s thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. The good news is that it often resolves on its own, but we'll need to monitor it closely.
PATIENT: Bell's Palsy? Honestly. That sounds… dreadful. And "often resolves on its own"? Is that supposed to reassure me? What do I do in the meantime? Can I still attend my board meeting? And what about the…drooping? Will it become permanent? I expect a detailed explanation, and a clear course of action. I don't appreciate vague assurances. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I apologize if “often resolves on its own” sounded dismissive. It's not meant to be. It's the most common outcome, but we'll take steps to support your recovery. Bell's Palsy is inflammation of the facial nerve, as I mentioned. It can cause weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It's usually temporary, and most people make a full recovery, but the timeframe can vary. To address your concerns: 1. Severity: Given the asymmetry I observed with your smile and eyelid closure, it appears to be moderate Bell's Palsy. 2. Treatment: We'll prescribe a course of oral corticosteroids – Prednisone – to help reduce the inflammation. These are most effective if started within 72 hours of symptom onset, which you're fortunately still within. 3. Supportive Care: We’ll also recommend eye drops to keep your left eye lubricated, as it may not close fully, and a gentle massage of the facial muscles to prevent stiffness. 4. Board Meeting: I understand you want to attend your board meeting. It may be difficult to speak clearly or control facial expressions. I cannot give medical advice specific to your attendance, as I haven't evaluated the specifics of the board meeting, but you must prioritize your health. 5. Follow-up: I’d like to see you back in one week to assess your progress. 6. Prognosis: Permanent drooping is uncommon, but it can happen. It’s important to follow the treatment plan and attend follow-up appointments to minimize that risk. I will write you a prescription for Prednisone and give you detailed instructions on eye care and facial massage. Do you have any questions about any of that?
