DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. You’re 83 years old, and I have patients waiting. Please, tell me, succinctly, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, morning. Blim, you say? Look, I ain’t good with rememberin’… things. Just… gettin’ outta breath, see? And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Real dry. That’s it. Mostly the breathin’ though. Gets worse when I… well, when I do things.
DOCTOR: “Succinctly,” Mr. Guilds, is what I asked for. Getting out of breath… and dry mouth and eyes. When you “do things”?
PATIENT: Well, walkin’, mostly. Or… tryin’ to. Even talkin’ sometimes. Like now! See? Gotta stop and… catch my wind. It weren't like this before, you know? Used to be able to… do a lot more. But now… forget it. It just happened.
DOCTOR: "Happened," you say. Very informative. And how long ago did this "happening" occur?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Long time. Months, I guess? Maybe longer. Time… slips away, ya know? I don't keep track of that stuff no more. It just… got worse and worse. Not all at once, though. Slow and steady, like a leaky… faucet? Is that a good way to put it?
DOCTOR: A leaky faucet. Right. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… let me see. … Nah. Not really. They ain’t lookin’ any different than usual. Always been a little… thick, these feet. But no big puffin’ or nothin’. Why would my feet be puffin’?
DOCTOR: It's a symptom, Mr. Guilds. We establish patterns to determine the cause. Now, have you had any chest pain, or palpitations – that is, a racing or fluttering in your chest – with this breathlessness?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not exactly pain. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes. But not like a hurtin’ kinda tightness. More like… a squeeze? And what’d you say? Pal… pal-a-what? Sounds like somethin’ the doctor checks when you’re… outta breath, right? Look, I ain’t good with these fancy words.
DOCTOR: Palpitations, Mr. Guilds, is a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering. Never mind. Do you have any cough?
PATIENT: Cough? Not much. Every now and then, a little tickle in my throat, but not a real cough. Like… when the dust gets bad. But I live out in the country, it’s gonna be dusty. It ain't like a sickness cough, if that makes any sense. Dry cough, when it happens.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you on any medications currently, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Medications… … I think so. The little white pills. For my… pressure? Blood pressure, I think the lady at the pharmacy said. And somethin’ for my… water works? Gotta go to the bathroom a lot, see. But that’s it. Just those two. I think.
DOCTOR: Let's see… white pill for blood pressure, something for the… urinary frequency. Do you recall the names of these medications, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Names? Goodness no. I ain’t one for rememberin’ names. I just tell the lady at the pharmacy what I need and she gives me the pills. They’re in a little orange bottle, maybe? And the other one… white bottle. That’s all I know, doc. I just take ‘em.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's conduct a brief physical examination. Please sit here and breathe normally. I'll listen to your lungs and heart. And I’ll check your extremities. Don’t interrupt. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though there’s some diminished breath sounds in the bases. Heart rate is regular, slightly elevated at 88. Mild S1 gallop. No murmurs appreciated. No edema present. Pulses are… weak, but palpable. We’ll need to do some bloodwork: a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP to rule out heart failure. I will also order an EKG.
PATIENT: Bloodwork? EKG? Sounds… serious. What’s a BNP? And what does all this… mean? You think it's somethin' bad, doc? I just want to be able to walk to the mailbox again without feelin’ like I’m gonna… keel over, ya know?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Guilds. A BNP is a blood test that helps us assess your heart function. We need to gather data. And while I understand your concerns, speculating without conclusive evidence is unproductive. We’ll obtain the results, and then we’ll discuss appropriate management. In the meantime, I recommend limiting strenuous activity. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Strenuous activity… … So, don’t even try to walk to the mailbox. Right. Limitin’… everything. Doc, with all due respect, you’re talkin’ a whole lotta fancy words and don’t tell me nothin’ I already didn’t know. I’m old. I’m tired. And I'm outta breath. Is this gonna help me, or just… take more outta me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I assure you, I am operating under the highest standards of medical care. The tests are necessary to determine the etiology of your symptoms. The nurse will draw the blood samples and schedule your EKG. I suggest you call if your symptoms worsen, particularly if you experience chest pain or severe shortness of breath. Here are the lab orders and the EKG requisition. And a list of the limitations. I have other patients waiting. I trust you will follow the instructions. If you are having an emergency, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. .
PATIENT: …Emergency room… Right. Limitin’ everything. Well. I guess I’ll go find the nurse. This is just great. .
