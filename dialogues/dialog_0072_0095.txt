DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 59 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's rather obvious, isn't it? I woke up this morning and can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels like it’s going to fall off. Is that detailed enough for you? I don’t have all day to explain the painfully clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, while it seems obvious, a detailed medical history is crucial for proper diagnosis, Ms. Nissenbaum. “Half your face feels like it’s going to fall off” is not a clinical description. But, alright. Let’s start with the ear. When did you first notice the hearing loss?
PATIENT: This morning. As in, when I woke up. Before that, everything was perfectly fine. I don't need to rehash this. It wasn't gradual, it wasn't a slow decline, it just happened. Is that sufficiently detailed? Really, I don't understand why I have to spell everything out.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I assure you, I am not attempting to be difficult. Sudden unilateral hearing loss is concerning, and requires a thorough evaluation. To clarify – did anything cause this?
PATIENT: Cause it? How am I supposed to know what caused it? Did I bang my head? No. Fall into a well? Absolutely not. I simply woke up like this. Perhaps it’s the weather? I haven’t the slightest idea. Must everything be a grand mystery? It just is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned facial weakness. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: It droops. My mouth feels… strange. Like I’m trying to smile, but it won't quite work right. It’s on this side. <points to the right side of her face> Honestly, it’s quite alarming to look at. It’s not subtle, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. This combination of symptoms – sudden hearing loss and facial weakness – is concerning for something called Bell’s palsy, or potentially something more serious. I'm going to need to perform a neurological exam to assess the extent of the weakness and rule out other possibilities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Neurological exam? Oh, wonderful. More poking and prodding. <rolls eyes> Fine. Just… try to be quick about it. I have things to do, you know. What exactly does this involve? I'd prefer to know what indignities await me.
DOCTOR: It involves assessing your cranial nerves – testing your facial movements, sensation, and reflexes. I'll also check your coordination and balance. It’s not an indignity, Ms. Nissenbaum, it’s a necessary part of determining the cause of your symptoms. Please follow my instructions as best you can. If you’ll have a seat, we can begin. I'm going to start with your facial movements. Can you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I still maintain this is excessive. <closes eyes tightly, then opens them again after a moment> There. Done. Are we finished already? I'm quite certain you can see perfectly well that I can close my eyes.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. Now, can you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that satisfactory? It feels… unnatural. And quite frankly, depressing to look at. You’re not exactly inspiring confidence, Doctor. It's crooked, isn't it? I knew it.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is noticeable asymmetry. Now, can you raise your eyebrows?
PATIENT: Is that high enough? Really, this is rather pointless. I can raise my eyebrows. What does that even prove? It’s not like I can’t move my face at all. It’s just… weak. Terribly weak.
DOCTOR: Please stick out your tongue. And now, try to say "blue." <pauses, listening intently> And now, "red."
PATIENT: Blue. Red. Is that to check if I’ve lost all my faculties? Because if so, I find your methods incredibly invasive and needlessly… thorough. It’s all perfectly normal, Doctor. I assure you. I haven’t had a stroke or anything dreadful. Just a bit of… weakness. Is that enough poking and prodding for now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this preliminary exam, the findings are consistent with unilateral facial weakness. The asymmetry is significant, and while your speech appears intact, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order an MRI to get a clearer picture. <pauses> Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Honestly! Now you’re going to pump me full of chemicals? I haven’t had an MRI in… well, ever. And no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but I’d prefer not to find out now, if you don’t mind. Is this absolutely necessary? I haven’t got insurance, you know. This is all becoming rather expensive.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, while I understand your concerns about cost, an MRI is crucial to rule out more serious causes of your symptoms, such as a tumor or stroke. It's not simply a matter of convenience. Without it, we cannot provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. I can discuss options for financial assistance with the hospital billing department, and there may be facilities that offer reduced-cost imaging. However, I cannot proceed with a diagnosis or treatment plan without further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Financial assistance? Reduced-cost imaging? How humiliating. Look, I understand your need to cover yourself, Doctor, but this is all very… inconvenient. Fine. Order your MRI. But I expect you to expedite the process and to do everything you can to minimize the cost. And don’t expect me to jump for joy about it. Is there anything else? Because I truly don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll put in the order for the MRI immediately. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I’ll also have a member of our billing department reach out to discuss potential financial assistance options. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of oral steroids to try and reduce the inflammation. It’s not a cure, but it may help alleviate some of the symptoms. I’ll also recommend artificial tears and ointment to protect your eye, as you may have difficulty closing it completely. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I’ve lived a remarkably uneventful life, medically speaking, until this morning. Just… make sure it doesn't interfere with my sleep. I need my rest, Doctor. And please, no complicated instructions. I’m not a pharmacist. Is that all? Can I go now? I have a rather important appointment.
DOCTOR: Here’s the prescription. It’s a standard dose of prednisone, to be taken once daily for five days. The instructions are straightforward. And yes, you can go now. I will need you to follow up with me in one week to discuss the results of the MRI and assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. One week. Emergency room. I’ve got it. Honestly, you’ve repeated yourself enough times. I’m perfectly capable of remembering basic instructions. Thank you, Doctor. Or, rather, I suppose I should thank you for the inconvenience. <turns to leave> Good day.
