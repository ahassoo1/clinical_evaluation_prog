DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I just… wanted to check things out, you know? Never really been to a doctor much before. Just figured it was a good time, I guess. Everything okay to just… talk?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Demondre. That’s perfectly fine. It’s excellent that you’re being proactive about your health, even if you haven’t been to a doctor much before. We can definitely just talk, and I’ll ask some questions to get a better understanding of how you’re doing. “Checking things out” is a good start. Is there anything specific that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or are you just looking for a general check-up?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really anything specific. I work on boats, you know? Sailor and all that. It’s good work, but… you’re around water and the sun a lot. And sometimes, things just feel… off. Not sick, just… not 100%. Does that make sense? I ain't sure what to tell ya. Just thought I'd see what you think.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Demondre. Being a sailor definitely comes with its own set of potential health considerations – sun exposure, being out on the water, and the physical demands of the job. “Not 100%” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about what “off” feels like?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I feel kinda tired, even when I sleep alright. Not like, fall-down tired, just… heavy. And my skin, especially my arms and face, feels… rough. Like too much sun, even with the sunscreen. And… I forget things sometimes. Small stuff, mostly. Like where I put my keys, or what I was gonna get at the store. It could just be work, I guess. Lots on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, rough skin, and some forgetfulness. That's helpful. Let's explore each of those a little more. You mentioned the fatigue - how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a few months now? It comes and goes, not every day. Some days I feel fine, full of energy. Other days… I just don't wanna do much after work. Before, I'd go out with friends, fix things around the house… now I just kinda sit. Doesn’t happen all the time, though. Like I said, it's not constant. Is that… normal? I ain't never had this before.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these changes, Demondre. Fluctuations in energy levels are common, but it’s worth investigating when they start to affect your daily life. To get a clearer picture, can you rate your fatigue on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no fatigue at all and 10 is the worst fatigue you can imagine?
PATIENT: Zero to ten, huh? Okay… on a good day, maybe a 2 or 3. When I’m really tired… probably a 6 or 7. Sometimes, just getting out of bed feels hard. Not every day, but… yeah. Maybe a 6 or 7 on those days. Is that… bad? I don’t want to make a fuss or anything.
DOCTOR: It's not about making a fuss, Demondre. It's about understanding what's going on with your body. A 6 or 7 is significant enough that we should look into it. Now, you also mentioned rough skin, despite using sunscreen. How often are you applying sunscreen, and what SPF are you using?
PATIENT: I try to put it on every time I go out. Every couple hours too, if I'm still out there. It’s… fifty, I think. Maybe thirty. Something like that. I get it at the store, you know? Just the regular kind. I guess I don’t pay too much attention to the number. I just try to stay covered up as much as I can too. Hat, long sleeves… stuff like that. Even with all that, my skin feels kinda dry and… leathery. Especially my forearms. Is that from the sun? Or somethin' else?
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’re taking precautions with sun protection, Demondre. Sun exposure can definitely cause dry, leathery skin, even with sunscreen use. We'll need to take a closer look at your skin during the physical exam. Before we do that, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Can you give me a specific example of something you've forgotten recently?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. Okay, last week I was supposed to pick up some supplies for the boat. Rope, some cleaning stuff… I went to the store, but I totally forgot what I was supposed to get. Had to go back home and look at the list. And… yesterday I couldn’t remember the name of a friend I haven’t seen in a while. It came to me later, but it was on the tip of my tongue all morning. Small stuff, like that. Nothing big, you know? Just… annoying. Does that make sense? I ain’t gettin’ old, am I? Heh.
DOCTOR: It happens to everyone, Demondre. Forgetfulness can be caused by a lot of things – stress, fatigue, even just getting busy. But it's good you're noticing it, and we'll want to explore it a bit further. I’m just gathering information. Now, let’s talk a little about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been diagnosed with nothin’. I’ve been pretty healthy, knock on wood. . Just the usual colds and stuff. Never been to the hospital, never had any surgeries. My mom was healthy too, and my dad… he was a strong man, worked hard his whole life. He’s… not around anymore. But he was healthy as a horse. Does that… help? I don’t think I got nothin’ to tell ya about that, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Demondre. It’s helpful to have that information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. I don’t like takin’ pills. If I get a headache, I just drink some water and rest. Never needed nothin' else. I stay away from that stuff if I can. My grandma used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I try to live by that. So, no medications, no vitamins, no nothin'. Just… me. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Demondre. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to nothin'. I can eat whatever, take whatever, pretty much. I’ve tried all sorts of things, never had a problem. I've eaten some weird stuff on boats, too, let me tell ya. . Not allergies, no. I think I'm pretty lucky in that department.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Demondre. Okay, one last question before we move on to the physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, huh? Well, I work on boats, mostly. Long days, lots of sun, lots of water. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer every now and then with friends. Don’t smoke. I try to eat alright, but it’s hard when you’re out at sea. Mostly fish, I guess. And whatever we can get in port. I sleep alright, when I can. It's… a simple life, really. Not much excitement. But it pays the bills. Does that… cover it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good picture, Demondre. Okay, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a routine check-up – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I ain’t scared of a little check-up. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I notice some areas of dryness and thickening on your forearms, consistent with sun damage. There are no concerning lesions or growths. The skin feels slightly leathery to the touch. Everything looks okay so far, but the skin definitely shows signs of sun exposure.
PATIENT: Leathery, huh? I told ya. Lots of sun out on the water. So, is it bad? Do I need to… wear more sunscreen or somethin'? I try to stay covered up, but… it's hard sometimes. You can't always hide from the sun. Is there anything else I should be worried about? Do I need some fancy cream or somethin'? I ain't ever dealt with this before.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad yet, Demondre, but it’s a sign that you need to be extra diligent about sun protection. The skin changes are a result of cumulative sun exposure over time. Wearing sunscreen is a good start, but we can also discuss other measures to protect your skin. I'm going to order some Vitamin D levels. Working outdoors and wearing sunscreen can lead to Vitamin D deficiency. I also recommend a high-quality moisturizing cream to help repair the skin barrier and prevent further dryness. We can look at some options at the front desk. Given your work environment, I'd also like to discuss the importance of regular skin checks with a dermatologist. They can identify any early signs of skin cancer that might be missed during a routine exam. We can get a referral set up for you. Do you have any history of skin cancer in your family?
PATIENT: No, no skin cancer in the family that I know of. My grandma had some moles, but they never caused any trouble. Vitamin D levels… okay, that makes sense. I don’t spend much time in the sun when I’m not workin’. So, a cream… and seein’ a skin doctor… that sounds… a lot. Is this somethin’ serious, Doctor? I just came in for a check-up, ya know? I didn’t wanna cause a fuss.
DOCTOR: It’s not about causing a fuss, Demondre. It's about being proactive and taking care of your health. I understand you just came in for a check-up, and that’s great. These are just precautionary steps based on your work environment and the findings during the exam. The skin changes are concerning, but not necessarily serious at this point. Long-term sun exposure increases your risk of skin cancer, so it's important to monitor your skin for any changes. Early detection is key. A dermatologist can provide a thorough examination and advise you on the best course of action. So, to summarize, we’re going to order Vitamin D levels. I’ll write you a prescription for a high-quality moisturizing cream. And I’ll give you a referral to a dermatologist for a skin check. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Vitamin D, cream, skin doctor… . Okay. It's just… a lot to remember. And… honestly, I’m a little worried now. I never thought about skin cancer before. I just figured… get a tan, feel good. Is it gonna be expensive? Seein’ a specialist and all. I don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Demondre. It's perfectly normal to feel worried when you learn something new about your health. And the cost of healthcare is a valid concern. Let me check if the dermatologist we refer to accepts your Medicare insurance. We also have a financial counselor here who can help you explore options for assistance with the cost of care if needed. I also want to assure you that we’ll explain all the results and any recommended treatment options thoroughly before you make any decisions. You won’t be rushed into anything. And remember, early detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment. For now, let's focus on getting the Vitamin D levels checked and starting the moisturizing cream. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it for now. Thanks, Doctor. You explained everything really well. I appreciate it. I’ll… get the blood work done, and see what the skin doctor says. And I’ll try to remember to put on more sunscreen. It's just… hard sometimes when you’re workin’. I guess I’ll see you again soon. Do I need to schedule another appointment? Or will someone call me with the results?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Demondre. I'm glad I could help. The lab will draw your blood, and we'll notify you when the results are back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the Vitamin D levels and any recommendations from the dermatologist. The receptionist will take care of that for you before you leave. Here's some additional information on sun protection and the moisturizers we discussed. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. It was nice meeting you, Demondre. Take care.
PATIENT: It was nice meetin’ you too, Doctor. Thank you for everything. I appreciate it. I think… I’ll be okay. Bye. .
