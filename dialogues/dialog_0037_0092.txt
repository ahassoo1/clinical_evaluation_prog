DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, Doc, right? Yeah. It’s… my breath. Gets short. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. It’s been… a while now. Can’t remember exactly how long. Old age, I guess. Everything’s fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, I understand. Shortness of breath and a dry mouth and scratchy eyes… and you've been experiencing this for a while. It is good you came in to get it checked out, regardless of how long it's been going on. Old age can certainly bring on changes, but we want to make sure there isn't something else going on. When you say shortness of breath, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More? What do you mean more? It's hard to… breathe! Especially when I… walk. Or, uh, do things. Not like I do a lot of things anymore. Used to, you know, work on the traffic lights. Hot work. Lots of climbing. Now… just sitting. It happens more when I’m trying to do something, I think. Not just… being. Does that make sense? It's not like I’m running marathons, Doc.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Guilds. So, it sounds like the shortness of breath is related to activity – it gets worse when you're exerting yourself. And it’s not present at rest. Good to know. And you mentioned a dry mouth and scratchy eyes. Are those constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much. Always feel like I swallowed sand. And my eyes… like somebody blew dust in ‘em. I carry drops, but they don’t do much good. It's just… annoying. Never used to be like this. I drank plenty of water, always did. Don't know what's changed. Maybe it's the air? Everything's different now, isn't it? Not like when I was a kid.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant dry mouth and scratchy eyes, despite using eye drops. You're right, things do change over time. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. The doctor… back in the city… told me my blood pressure was a little high, once. Years ago. Gave me a pill. Didn’t like taking pills, so I… stopped. And I had a bad knee for a while, from falling off the ladder. That's about it, I think. Nothing major. I’m a tough old Cuban, Doc. Always been healthy. Well, relatively. Until now. What are you lookin' for, anyway? You think I got something bad?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Guilds. I just want a complete picture of your health history. It's important to know everything, even things that seem small. You mentioned stopping the blood pressure medication. Do you know what the medication was, or roughly when you stopped taking it?
PATIENT: Ugh. Names… I'm terrible with names. Little white pill. That’s all I remember. Stopped… oh, jeez. Must be… ten years ago? More? I don’t keep track of that stuff. It didn't feel like I needed it. I felt fine. And I don't like being told what to do, Doc. Never have. So I just… stopped. Is that bad? Should I have kept taking it? Now you’re makin’ me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill, stopped about ten years ago because you felt fine. It’s not necessarily bad that you stopped, but it’s good information to have. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can contribute to shortness of breath over time. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… The knee, maybe. They… poked around in there once, when I fell. Didn’t fix it much, though. Just made it hurt more for a while. And… hmm. I think I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Long time ago. That’s about it. Nothing fancy. I try to stay away from doctors, if I can help it. They just poke and prod, and then tell you what you can’t do.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery and an appendectomy as a child. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother, she had… the sugars. Diabetes, I think. Had to watch what she ate. And my father… he smoked too much. Bad cough. Died young. That’s about it. Lots of folks died young back then, from everything. Didn’t have good doctors, like you. Not like now. They just… passed away. Is that helpful? I’m not a doctor, Doc. I just lived a long life.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Guilds. Thank you. History of diabetes in your mother and smoking-related illness in your father. And do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoked? Oh, yeah. Started when I was… sixteen, I think. Everybody smoked back then. Stopped… when I got married. My wife didn’t like it. Good woman. Been gone a long time. Stopped… fifty years ago, maybe? More? It was a long time ago. Didn’t miss it much. It was a bad habit, anyway. Now, what are you gettin’ at, Doc? You think my lungs are bad?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily, Mr. Guilds. I just need a complete picture. Fifty years since you quit smoking is excellent. That significantly reduces your risk. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little. Sometimes. I like a glass of wine with my dinner. Not much. Maybe a glass… two, on a special occasion. Never been a big drinker. My wife didn’t like it much either. She said it made me… grumpy. She was probably right. I don't get drunk, though. Never liked that feeling. Just a little sip, to relax. That's all. What’s this all for, Doc? Are you tryin’ to find out if I’m a bad person?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guilds, I am definitely not trying to find out if you're a bad person! I'm just trying to understand your lifestyle to help me figure out what might be causing your shortness of breath and dry mouth. Just a little wine, occasionally. That's good to know. Now, one last thing for the history portion. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Uh… just the drops for my eyes, I guess. And sometimes I take something for my knee, when it really hurts. Ibuprofen, I think. Little white pills again. That’s it. No fancy stuff. I try to stay away from pills, remember? I don’t like how they make me feel. Everything’s fuzzy enough as it is. Are we done now, Doc? This is a lot of questions. My brain is tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, just eye drops and ibuprofen as needed for your knee. Yes, we're almost done with the history portion. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your eyes and throat. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Ugh. Fine, I guess. Get it over with. But don’t poke too much. And be gentle with my knee. It’s sensitive. And don't tell me I need to lose weight, Doc. I'm a bit… solid, alright? Don't need you tellin' me what I already know. Just get it over with. And hurry up, if you don't mind. My patience is wearing thin.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. I will be as gentle as possible. And I promise, I won’t mention anything about weight. We're just gathering information. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me… 150 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m listening to your heart. It sounds regular… and your lungs… I’m hearing some slight wheezing on both sides, but it’s not overly concerning at this point. Okay, your eyes are a little dry, as you mentioned… and your throat looks a little irritated. No obvious signs of infection. And your knee… yes, it’s tender to the touch. Some swelling present. I’ll be quick with this. Alright, Mr. Guilds, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems consistent with your description of your symptoms. The elevated blood pressure and the slight wheezing are things we'll want to monitor, and your knee shows signs of some arthritis.
PATIENT: Arthritis, huh? Figures. Always knew something was wrong with that knee. So, what now, Doc? You gonna give me a bunch of pills? Or tell me to exercise? Don't tell me to exercise! I'm an old man! I just want to be able to breathe without sounding like a rusty gate. Is that too much to ask? What’s the next step? And how long is this gonna take? I have a ballgame on TV later.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guilds, I'm not going to prescribe a bunch of pills right away, and definitely no exercise orders! We’re not going to jump to conclusions. First, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out anything serious. I also want to do a blood test to check your overall health, including your blood sugar levels and kidney function. And finally, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter to see how well your lungs are delivering oxygen to your blood. That's a quick, painless test we can do right here in the office. These tests will give us a better understanding of what’s going on and help me determine the best course of action. It shouldn't take long—the pulse oximeter is instant, and the blood test will only take a few minutes. The X-ray will require you to go to the imaging center down the street, and that usually takes about 30-45 minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests. More poking and prodding. Alright, fine. But I want you to promise me no running on a treadmill. And no lectures about my diet. I’ve lived a long life, Doc, I think I know what I'm doin'. X-ray… down the street, huh? Is it far? And will it take long? I really don't want to miss the ballgame. And can I have a glass of water afterwards? All this talk is makin’ my mouth even dryer. And who pays for all this, anyway? Medicare, right? I got Medicare. I hope this doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guilds. No treadmill, no lectures. I promise. The imaging center is just down the street, about a five-minute drive. It shouldn’t take long, maybe 30-45 minutes including the wait time. And yes, you can absolutely have a glass of water afterwards. And yes, Medicare should cover the tests, but we will verify your coverage before you go to the imaging center. You will likely have a small co-pay, but we will let you know the exact amount beforehand. Let me print out a referral for the chest X-ray and a lab requisition for the blood tests. I'll also have the nurse draw up the paperwork for the pulse oximetry test we can do here in the office right now. Would you like me to call a ride for you to get to the imaging center?
PATIENT: A ride? No, I’m not helpless! I can drive myself. I still got a good car. And I don't need anyone takin' me anywhere. Just the papers, please. And tell me, Doc… honestly… you don't think it's somethin' bad, do you? Like… my lungs? Or my heart? You're a doctor, you're supposed to tell me the truth. Don’t sugarcoat it. Just tell me straight. And hurry up with those papers. The ballgame starts in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concern. It’s perfectly natural to be worried. Based on the initial exam, I don’t believe it’s anything immediately life-threatening. The wheezing is mild, and your heart sounds regular. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying causes with the tests I’ve ordered. We need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on before we can make any definitive conclusions. That’s why I’m recommending the chest X-ray and blood tests. They’re not about assuming the worst—they’re about being thorough and ensuring we provide you with the best possible care. Here are the papers. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw blood. I will call you with the results as soon as they are available, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ugh. 24-48 hours… that’s a long time to worry. Alright, fine. No, I don’t think so. Just… get those tests done quickly, Doc. And call me as soon as you know somethin'. Don't keep me waitin'. And… thanks. I guess. You seem like a nice enough doctor. Even if you do want to poke and prod me a little. Now, where’s that nurse? I gotta get this over with so I can watch the ballgame. And no lectures, remember? No lectures! .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Guilds. I understand your concern, and I promise to get those results to you as quickly as possible. And absolutely no lectures – you have my word. The nurse is just around the corner and will be with you momentarily. Have a good day, Mr. Guilds. And enjoy the ballgame. .
