DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uhm, hello Doctor. It's my nails, see? They just...changed. Not good changes. I don't really know why they changed. I just noticed it a few weeks back, I think. Maybe a month? Time goes, you know. They look…funny.
DOCTOR: "Changed" is…vague. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, honey, I'm not a doctor, am I? They’re not…smooth anymore. Like, bumpy. And the color...it's kinda yellow-ish. Not a nice yellow, like sunshine. More like…old. Like, old paint. And one of them...it's kinda lifting up, see? Like it’s gonna fall off. It's just…not right. I keep putting polish on, but it doesn't help.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, bumpy texture, yellowish discoloration, and lifting…detachment, you're saying. And this has been going on for roughly a month, give or take?
PATIENT: Roughly. Yes, a month, maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly. I don't pay that much attention to my nails. I get a manicure sometimes, but… not lately. It's probably from washing dishes, I guess. I do a lot of washing. Everything has to be clean, you know? Especially with…well, everything going around.
DOCTOR: Washing dishes…right. Do you use any harsh chemicals when you wash them?
PATIENT: Harsh chemicals? Like…bleach? Sometimes. When they're really dirty. And…that pink stuff. What's it called…Dawn? Yeah, Dawn. It’s good for grease. Does that matter? I don’t see how soap could change my nails. It’s not like I’m stickin’ my hands in poison.
DOCTOR: It can matter. Prolonged exposure to certain irritants…or even repeated trauma…can cause nail changes. Have you noticed this happening on all ten nails, or just a few?
PATIENT: Oh, good gracious. Trauma? I just wash dishes! It's…mostly just this one, see? This one is the worst. A couple of the others are a little bumpy, but nothin’ like this. Mostly this one. And it’s botherin’ me, you know? It catches on everything.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And you haven’t had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…feeling sick? No, not really. I'm always a little tired, but who isn't? And my joints ache sometimes, but that’s just gettin’ old, I suppose. No fever, no cough, nothin’ like that. Just…this nail. And it's embarrassing. You ever try wearin' sandals with a funny nail? It's awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it could be a fungal infection, Ms. Thut. It’s quite common. Or…potentially a psoriasis. We'll need to rule things out. I’m going to take a look at your hands more closely and then we'll likely need to send a sample to the lab.
PATIENT: Lab? Oh, dear. You mean…like, take a piece of my nail off? That sounds awful. I don't like the sound of that at all. Is that really necessary? Can’t you just…give me some cream or somethin'? I don't want nothin’ poked and prodded, Doctor. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, a proper diagnosis requires a sample. We can’t prescribe the correct treatment without knowing what we’re dealing with. It's a small scraping, really. It won't hurt much. Think of it as…preventative care. Now, if you’ll just extend your hand…
PATIENT: Oh, preventative care... Fine. But be gentle. And don't take the whole nail off, you hear? I need that to…well, to do things.
DOCTOR: This will be a quick scraping. Just a small sample for analysis. Try to relax. Note thickening and onycholysis of the right index fingernail. Yellowish discoloration present. Subungual debris collected for fungal culture and microscopic examination.
PATIENT: Ooh! That tickles! And it feels…wrong. Is it gonna bleed? I don’t like that feeling. Just hurry up, please. I have my bingo game tonight, and I don't want to be late. And don’t forget, gentle. You promised.
DOCTOR: There, all done. A tiny bit of pressure, that’s all. It shouldn't bleed for long. We’ll send this off to the lab, and it should take a few days to get the results. Until then, I recommend keeping your hands dry and avoiding harsh chemicals. Will provide patient instructions for nail care.
PATIENT: Harsh chemicals…keeping my hands dry… Easy for you to say. You don’t do dishes all day. And a few days? That’s a long time to walk around with a bandage on my finger. You sure there's no way you can just…guess? It looks like a fungus to me. Everything does these days.
DOCTOR: “Guessing” is not a medical practice, Ms. Thut. We need conclusive evidence before initiating treatment. Now, I've documented everything. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss appropriate options. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… Well, I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven’t been around a cat in years. And I think I got a rash once from somethin’ in the garden, but that was a long time ago too. Mostly I just get…itchy. You know, like when you get old. Does that count? And I don’t like penicillin. Makes my tummy hurt.
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies, except for penicillin. History of mild skin irritation. Alright. We've covered everything for today. The lab will contact you with the results. If you experience any significant pain, redness, or swelling, contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Well, how much is all this gonna cost? Medicare covers everything, right? I don’t want any surprises. And can I still wear sandals? Even with a bandage?
DOCTOR: I wouldn’t be able to give you an exact cost estimate at this moment. Billing will process everything through Medicare. As for the sandals… it's not ideal, Ms. Thut. It could lead to irritation or infection. But…do your best to keep it clean and dry. I've documented your concerns. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Well…are you sure it's not just a fungus? I mean, it looks like a fungus. And my neighbor Mildred had something similar, and they just gave her some cream, and it went away. Just cream. Why do I need a lab?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your concerns. However, a proper diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. A lab analysis will help us identify the specific cause of your nail changes. A fungal infection is one possibility, but it could be something else entirely. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. The nurse will provide you with the aftercare instructions and schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: A proper diagnosis… fancy doctors and their fancy tests… Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Cream would have been easier. .
