DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? Well, it’s about these… episodes. I get confused, you see. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s just… things aren’t always clear, and my wife, she worries. She says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes. It’s… irritating, to be honest. I've always had a good memory. Always.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It’s concerning when things change, especially with memory. And it's good your wife is observant and bringing this to our attention. It’s certainly worth investigating. When did these episodes start, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… hmm. Let me think. It’s been… maybe six months? No, more like eight, I reckon. Around the time the weather started getting colder last year. November, maybe? Yes, November. It was right after we put up the holiday lights. My wife wanted new ones, flashier ones, and I was trying to remember where I stored the old boxes. That’s when I first noticed it, I think. A bit of a blank. Not a complete blank, just… slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, around November. That gives us a starting point. And it seems to have started with some difficulty recalling something specific – the location of the holiday lights. Can you describe what these episodes are like while they're happening?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I just… stop functioning, you understand? It’s more like… a fog. Things feel… distant. Like I’m trying to reach for something just out of grasp. And I repeat myself. Ask the same question five times, maybe. It's not that I can’t remember asking, it’s just… the thought doesn’t stick. It’s like trying to hold water in my hands. Slippery. And I get… agitated. Frustrated. It makes my wife nervous, and that just makes it worse, if you can believe it. She fusses over me. It’s not helpful.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fogginess, difficulty retaining thoughts, repetition of questions, and a sense of agitation. It sounds quite distressing, Mr. Lason, and certainly concerning. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I mean, I sleep alright. Eat regular. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but who isn't these days? My wife keeps saying I'm more… quiet. Less talkative. But I always considered her a chatterbox, so perhaps that’s a blessing. No dizziness, no headaches, no strange visions. Just the… confusion. And the frustration. It’s mostly the frustration, to be honest. It's not me, you see. I've always been sharp as a tack.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other neurological symptoms like dizziness or vision changes, and no significant changes in sleep or appetite. Just the episodes of confusion and increased fatigue, and your wife has noticed you being quieter. Let's go through a quick review of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my prostate acting up a few years back. Had a little procedure for that. Nothing serious. And my blood pressure’s been a bit high, so I take a little pill for that, every morning. Losartan, I think it’s called. Otherwise, I'm a pretty healthy man. Always have been. Worked hard my whole life, you see. Tile and stone setting isn’t easy work. Keeps you on your feet. And I eat reasonably well. My wife, she makes sure of that. She likes to cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of prostate issues and hypertension, managed with Losartan. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries other than the prostate procedure?
PATIENT: No. No other surgeries. Nothing broken, nothing cut open. Just the prostate. A minor thing, really. They went in through… well, I don’t remember exactly how they did it, but it wasn’t a big deal. A quick in-and-out procedure. And I healed up just fine. No complications. I’m a tough old bird, you see. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgical history. Good. Now, thinking about your family… are there any relatives who have experienced memory problems, dementia, or other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she got a little forgetful towards the end, but we just put it down to old age. She lived a long life, you see. Ninety-two years. And my father… he was always sharp as a tack, right up until the day he passed. No, I don’t recall anyone in the family having… well, what do you call it? Dementia? No. Not that I know of. We didn’t really talk about such things. It wasn't common to discuss those issues in my village, you see. Not polite.
DOCTOR: I understand. It wasn’t always common to discuss these things openly. Okay, so no known family history of dementia or significant memory problems. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, you say? Well, I work. Still setting tile and stone, five days a week. Keeps me busy. Keeps me out of trouble. My wife, she keeps the house clean, does the cooking. We watch a little television in the evenings. The news, mostly. Though it's all rather depressing these days. And we go to the temple on Sundays. It's important to maintain our traditions, you see. And I try to stay active. Walk around the neighborhood a little. But I'm not as nimble as I used to be, if you understand. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: That’s good – staying active and maintaining your traditions is important. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Heavens, no. Never touched the stuff. And smoke? I used to, years ago, when I was a young man. A pack a day, maybe. But I quit over twenty years ago. My wife didn't approve. She said it was bad for my health, and she was right, of course. As for alcohol… I have a little glass of rice wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small glass. For digestion, you see. And to relax. It's not every night, mind you. Only on special occasions, or when I'm feeling particularly stressed. A very small glass. My wife keeps an eye on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past smoking history, but quit over 20 years ago, and occasional, small amounts of rice wine. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the Losartan for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not that I recall. Just the Losartan. My wife handles most of the medication stuff, you see. She keeps track of everything. She’s very organized. Sometimes she gives me a little something for my knees, when they're acting up. Some sort of cream, I think. But that’s not a regular thing. Just when they're particularly sore. Otherwise, just the Losartan. I’m pretty sure of that. She’d be sure to tell me if I was taking something else. She’s very particular about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. My wife makes a wonderful fish amok, and I eat it without any trouble. And I've taken all sorts of medications over the years, without any problems. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing. I'm pretty resilient, you see. Always have been. Though my wife always tells me to be careful. She worries about everything. A very cautious woman, my wife. Very cautious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to check your neurological function – your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just get to the bottom of this confusion, you see. It's unsettling. I’m used to being sharp, used to knowing things. It's… disconcerting to feel myself… slipping. So yes, please. Do your exam. I’ll cooperate fully. And if you need anything, just ask. My wife will be glad to help, too. She’s always eager to assist. A very helpful woman, my wife. Very, very helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Lason. And your wife’s willingness to help is greatly appreciated. Now, let's check your temperature. Alright, everything looks within normal limits so far. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. "Good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes." "Normal reflexes bilaterally." "A little unsteady, but within normal limits for your age. Now, could you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can walk. Just a little unsteady sometimes, as you said. Old knees, you see. There. How was that? I’m trying my best, Doctor. Just a little slower than I used to be. And perhaps a bit more cautious. It’s unsettling to feel myself… declining, you see. It’s not a feeling I’m accustomed to. I’ve always been a strong, capable man. A reliable man. A man who knew what he was doing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re being cautious. And it’s understandable to feel unsettled. Your gait is slightly unsteady, as you mentioned, and your balance is a little compromised, but nothing dramatically concerning for your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. "Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally." "Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Sensation is intact." Alright, Mr. Lason, based on this initial exam, there are no obvious signs of a major neurological problem. However, your episodes of confusion and the slight unsteadiness warrant further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. We should also get a brain scan – either a CT scan or an MRI – to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Blood tests and a brain scan… yes, yes, that sounds thorough. Whatever it takes to get to the bottom of this, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, you see. I don’t like feeling… vulnerable. It’s unsettling. A brain scan sounds… serious. Is it something to worry about? My wife will be very concerned. She worries enough as it is. She’ll insist on accompanying me, I’m sure. A very supportive woman, my wife. Very, very supportive.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about a brain scan, Mr. Lason, but it’s important to remember that it's a diagnostic tool, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. We are ordering it to rule out any potential causes for your confusion. It’s a precautionary measure. The most common causes of confusion in patients your age are things like medication side effects, infections, vitamin deficiencies, or early signs of cognitive impairment. The brain scan will help us differentiate between these possibilities. I’ll explain the procedure to your wife as well, and answer any questions she may have. And yes, she is more than welcome to accompany you. Having support is always helpful. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and ensuring you are well-hydrated. Are there any questions I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… well, that’s not a problem. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, anyway. And well-hydrated… my wife sees to that. She’s always reminding me to drink water. A very attentive woman, my wife. Very, very attentive. Just… what if it is something serious, Doctor? What if it's… dementia? My mother… she got a little forgetful towards the end. Is that what’s happening to me? I don’t want to become a burden. I want to be able to care for myself, to help my wife. This is unsettling. Very unsettling. And my wife… she wouldn’t know what to do without me. She’s always relied on me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it's completely understandable to be worried, and it’s good you’re expressing these concerns. However, it’s too early to jump to any conclusions. Many things can cause confusion, and we haven’t ruled out any of the more common and treatable possibilities yet. Even if it turns out to be early signs of cognitive impairment, there are many resources available to help both you and your wife. Medications can help manage symptoms, and there are support groups and therapies that can improve quality of life. And please remember, seeking help early is the best thing you can do. We will work through this together, step by step. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we’ll make a plan that’s right for you. For now, let's focus on getting the tests done and discussing the results. I’m confident we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on soon. And I’ll be here to support you and your wife every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And reassuring. My wife will be glad to hear you say all of that. She worries so much. A very anxious woman, my wife. Very, very anxious. Thank you, Doctor Rakosky. I appreciate your time and your patience. I’ll… I’ll see you next week. And I’ll make sure my wife accompanies me. She wouldn’t miss it for the world. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And it was a pleasure meeting you. I look forward to seeing you and your wife next week. .
