DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a request – a matter of some difficulty, actually – with the requirements at my place of work. It concerns the masks and other protective equipment we are now required to wear.
DOCTOR: Masks, hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's… not that I am opposed to safety, understand. I work with folks who need protection, and I want to do my part. But these masks… they cause me a significant amount of trouble. A physical discomfort, primarily, but also… well, it's difficult to explain. It feels… wrong, somehow. I was hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps a suitable alternative. Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: “Wrong” how, Mr. Knabenshue?
PATIENT: That is… a fair question, Doctor. It's difficult to put into words. It's a sensation, mostly. A feeling of being… constricted. Like something is pressing in, not just on my face, but… deeper. I find it hard to breathe properly, and it triggers a feeling of… anxiety. It reminds me of… difficult times, past experiences. It's not a fear, exactly, but… a strong discomfort, and a feeling of being unwell. I understand it may sound unusual, and I apologize if I’m not explaining it clearly. It's not something I've experienced before these masks were required.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said this is impacting your work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it is. It makes it very difficult to concentrate on the people I am assisting. They need my full attention, and I find myself distracted, anxious, and honestly, a little panicked at times. It’s a strain to remain calm and professional when I’m struggling to breathe and feel… overwhelmed. I worry it’s affecting the quality of care I provide, and that is unacceptable to me. I have tried different types of masks, as they provided, but none of them alleviate the problem.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Knabenshue, I understand you're experiencing distress, but these requirements are in place for the safety of everyone. Have you considered that this might be simply… anxiety about wearing a mask, and perhaps some breathing exercises would help?
PATIENT: Doctor, I appreciate your suggestion, truly. And I have considered that possibility. But I assure you, it's more than simple anxiety. I've spent my life working with folks who are… vulnerable, who need a steady hand and a calm presence. I’m not prone to panic, and I’ve always been able to manage stressful situations. This is… different. It’s a physical reaction, Doctor, coupled with this… unease. It isn't something I can simply “breathe through.” I have been trying, believe me. I wouldn't be here if I hadn't exhausted other options. Perhaps… is there any documentation I could provide? Something from my tribe, perhaps, explaining… cultural sensitivities? I’m not sure if that applies here, but I am trying to understand what avenues are open to me.
DOCTOR: Cultural sensitivities... look, Mr. Knabenshue, I’m a medical doctor, not a… social worker. I need something concrete. Have you had any prior medical evaluations for anxiety or breathing issues?
PATIENT: Doctor, I understand your position completely. I apologize for bringing up something outside of your typical scope. To answer your question, no. I have never been formally evaluated for anxiety or breathing problems. I’ve always been a healthy, active individual. This is a new development, directly related to these mask requirements. I've always taken care of myself, and my health has been excellent. I have been working as a Protective Service Worker for nearly twenty years, and I’ve never encountered a situation like this before. Would it be helpful to bring in documentation from my employer outlining the mask requirements? Perhaps a letter from my supervisor detailing my attempts to comply?
DOCTOR: Before we go any further, Mr. Knabenshue, I need to understand your medical history. Do you have any underlying conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Doctor, absolutely. I should have mentioned this earlier, I apologize for the oversight. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure approximately five years ago. It is well-managed with medication, and my levels are consistently within a healthy range, according to my primary care physician. Other than that, I’m in good health. No allergies, no chronic illnesses, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. I am a non-smoker and I only drink alcohol socially, very infrequently. I believe that's a comprehensive overview of my medical background, Doctor. I do have the contact information for my primary care physician if you require any further details.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure… okay. That could be a factor. Mr. Knabenshue, I’m going to need to examine you. Let's start with your blood pressure, just to confirm it’s within range. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and heart. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am happy to cooperate fully. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please proceed at your own pace. I am ready whenever you are. I am hoping we can determine the cause of this discomfort, and hopefully find a solution that allows me to continue my work safely and effectively.
DOCTOR: 140/90. A little elevated, though not drastically so. Breathing is clear, heart rate is regular… slightly fast, but understandable given your anxiety. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath at rest, or dizziness when you exert yourself?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have not experienced any chest pain, even when I am active. And I do not get shortness of breath when I am resting. I can exert myself normally without any dizziness or lightheadedness. The only time I experience these symptoms – the difficulty breathing, the feeling of constriction – is when I am wearing a mask for an extended period. It's very specific, and it doesn't occur otherwise. Perhaps it is the pressure of the mask itself, restricting airflow? Or perhaps it's a sensitivity to the material? I am merely speculating, of course. I am trusting your expertise to determine the cause.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, with your medical history and these findings, it’s possible your blood pressure is contributing to this feeling of discomfort. The mask may simply be exacerbating it. I recommend following up with your primary care physician to optimize your blood pressure control. In the meantime, I suggest limiting strenuous activity, and… perhaps exploring stress-reduction techniques. As for the mask, unfortunately, there are no readily available alternatives given the current safety protocols. I understand this is not what you want to hear.
PATIENT: Doctor, I appreciate your assessment and your time. However, I respectfully disagree with the implication that this is simply a matter of stress or uncontrolled blood pressure. My blood pressure is controlled, and I maintain a healthy lifestyle. While I will, of course, schedule a follow-up appointment with my primary care physician, I believe the issue is directly related to the mask itself. It's a new phenomenon, coinciding directly with the implementation of the new requirements. To suggest it is unrelated feels… dismissive, if I may be so bold. Perhaps a referral to a specialist, someone familiar with sensory sensitivities or… even the psychological effects of prolonged mask usage? I am simply seeking a solution that allows me to continue serving my community safely and effectively.
DOCTOR: Mr. Knabenshue, I understand your frustration. But I am a medical doctor, and I base my assessment on clinical findings. I don’t practice… subjective medicine. I can refer you to a psychologist, but I highly doubt they will find a physiological reason for this discomfort. Frankly, I believe this is a case of anxiety, and perhaps some cognitive behavioral therapy would be beneficial. As for a referral to a specialist… I'm not convinced it’s warranted. I’ve documented my findings and recommendations. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I find your assessment… concerning. To dismiss my experience as simply "anxiety" without exploring all possible avenues feels… inadequate, and frankly, unprofessional. You are a medical doctor, yes, but you are also a healthcare provider. And part of providing healthcare involves listening to your patients and taking their concerns seriously. I understand you may not have encountered a situation like this before, but that doesn't invalidate my experience. I was hoping for a collaborative approach, a genuine attempt to find a solution that allows me to continue my work safely and effectively. Instead, I feel as though I have been dismissed and labeled. I believe I will seek a second opinion. Perhaps a physician with more experience in sensory sensitivities or the psychological effects of prolonged mask usage would be more receptive to my concerns. I thank you for your time, Doctor, but I do not believe this consultation has been productive. .
