DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Julie, welcome. I’m Dr. Billman. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… Billman, is it? Yes, well, it’s rather… inconvenient, truthfully. I seem to be losing my… faculties. The vision, you see, and the hearing. It’s all quite bothersome. I haven't much time for this, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Losing your “faculties,” you say. Let's try to narrow that down a bit. When did you first start noticing these changes with your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I’m simply dreadful with dates. It was… recently. Perhaps a week? Maybe two? It’s all a blur, really. I just know it’s becoming increasingly difficult to… function. Important meetings, you see. I’m a surgeon. Pediatric, of course. Very demanding. I don’t have time to sit around and decipher when things started to go wrong.
DOCTOR: Right, a pediatric surgeon. That is demanding. Okay, so within the last two weeks, you've noticed a change in both your vision and hearing. Can you describe the changes a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Honestly, Doctor, it’s just… less. Less clear with the eyes, and less audible with the ears. It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t notice. Everything seems… muffled. And blurry. Like looking through a… a dirty window, perhaps. And people are always mumbling, or speaking too softly. It’s incredibly frustrating. Honestly, I find it rather… unprofessional of my body to be failing me at this stage.
DOCTOR: Okay, “less clear” and “muffled.” Does this happen all the time, or are there specific situations where it's worse?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… variable, I suppose. Though I haven’t been keeping a detailed log, Doctor, do you expect me to? It seems to be worse when I’m… tired. And in crowded places, naturally. All the noise, you see. It’s quite overwhelming. I attended a gala last week – a charity event – and it was absolutely dreadful. Couldn’t hear a single word anyone was saying. Honestly, a waste of a perfectly good evening. And the lights were terribly bright, exacerbating the… blurriness. Really quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about other things going on. Have you noticed any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any pain in either of your ears?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No, not particularly. Though I do sometimes feel a bit… off balance, perhaps. But I attribute that to my shoes. Always buying fashionable shoes, you see, and they rarely have proper support. As for ringing… no, I don't believe so. Though, now that you mention it… there was a faint humming last night. But I assumed it was the refrigerator. A new model, quite energy efficient. Pain? No, no pain at all. I certainly would have noticed that. I have a very high pain tolerance, you see. A surgeon needs to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your vision specifically?
PATIENT: Well, as I said, blurry. It's like… looking at a painting that hasn't quite dried, if that makes any sense to you. And sometimes, things seem… dimmed. Not completely dark, mind you, but… less vibrant. And I've had a slight difficulty judging distances recently. Almost bumped into a rather expensive vase at the gallery yesterday, a truly terrifying experience. I pride myself on my coordination, you see, it’s essential for my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other questions, Mrs. Julie. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… I try not to dwell on such things. I lead a very busy life, Doctor. But… I believe I had a bout of the flu a few years ago. Quite unpleasant. And… my divorce was rather stressful, if that counts. As for anything else… I have always been quite healthy, you see. Very active. I exercise regularly, and I maintain a strict diet, when I can manage it amidst my schedule. I suppose I should see a therapist about the divorce, but really, who has the time?
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very common procedure, I believe. And… I had a rather unfortunate incident with a scalpel a few years ago during an operation. A small cut, nothing serious. Required a few stitches, of course. But nothing major. I certainly don’t have the time to be laid up in a hospital. Too much to do. Honestly, it was rather embarrassing. A surgeon cutting herself? Unthinkable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I despise taking pills. Simply dreadful. I take a multivitamin occasionally, when I remember. And I sometimes take an antacid after particularly rich meals. But that's it. I prefer to rely on a healthy lifestyle, you see. And a strong constitution. Medications… they just mask the symptoms, don't they? I prefer to address the root cause. Though, admittedly, I haven’t quite identified the root cause of this… predicament. It's all quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my ex-husband’s family was quite… unremarkable, truthfully. As for my side… my mother lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. Though she did suffer from rather bad arthritis in her later years. My father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. And… my aunt had cataracts, I think. Though I wasn't particularly close to her, so I don't recall the details. Honestly, families are rather complicated, don't you think? Too much drama. I prefer to focus on my career. It’s much more… rewarding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. Smoking is dreadful. And alcohol… well, I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. A very small glass. For medicinal purposes, you see. It helps me relax. But nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! A surgeon needs to maintain a clear head. It’s essential for my profession. Honestly, the thought of it… simply appalling. I pride myself on my discipline, you see. A very strict lifestyle. Though, admittedly, it hasn’t prevented this… situation. It's all quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright Mrs. Julie. I'm going to perform a quick exam. I'll check your ears, eyes, and do a basic neurological assessment. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a meeting scheduled in an hour, you see. A rather important one. And frankly, I find these examinations rather… undignified. But proceed, Doctor. Just be quick about it, if you please. I'm trusting you won't poke and prod too much. Really, I simply haven't the time for this. And be gentle with my hair. It's quite expensive to maintain, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your ears. I gently insert the otoscope into her left ear canal. Hmm. The ear canal appears clear. The tympanic membrane is… slightly dull. I examine the right ear. Similar findings. Slightly dull tympanic membrane. Not much cerumen buildup. I document the findings. Now let's check your eyes. I perform a quick visual acuity test, using a Snellen chart. Can you read the smallest line on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chart? Really? My vision is rather blurry, you see. Squints at the chart, leaning closer and closer. I… I can barely make out the shapes. Perhaps… the top line? Maybe? It’s all rather… indistinct. Honestly, I can usually see perfectly well. This is most peculiar. Frowns. Are you sure this chart is properly illuminated? It seems rather dim. And is this the latest model chart? The older ones weren't particularly accurate, you see. I have a very discerning eye. A surgeon needs to.
DOCTOR: Okay. That confirms what you've been saying, Mrs. Julie. I document “Visual acuity significantly reduced”. Now, let me just check your pupils and eye movements. I shine a light into her eyes and observe her pupils' reaction. They're equal in size and reactive to light, but… somewhat sluggish. And tracking is slightly off. I document “Pupils equal, reactive, but sluggish tracking”. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. I perform a quick assessment of her extraocular movements. It's a bit jerky. I document “Jerky extraocular movements.” Finally, I’ll do a quick balance test. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Balance? Really? I'm not particularly known for my grace, you see. Hesitates, then carefully stands with feet together, closing eyes. Oh dear. Immediately begins to sway. I… I'm feeling rather unsteady. Reaches out a hand for support, almost knocking over a nearby chair. Oh! Takes a small, controlled step, regaining balance. I told you I wasn’t known for my grace! This is most undignified. Opens eyes, looking somewhat flustered. Are you sure this test is necessary? I’m a surgeon, not a dancer! This is all quite… alarming. Sits down heavily in the chair. Honestly, I’m beginning to suspect something serious is amiss. This is most inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Julie. Thank you. That was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam I’ve just performed, your symptoms – the vision changes, hearing loss, balance issues – are concerning. It could be a number of things, and I need to order some further testing to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I'd like to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, and an audiogram to assess your hearing loss more accurately. I'll also order a full blood panel to look for any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? Blood panel? That sounds… rather invasive. And time-consuming, I presume? I have a very busy schedule, Doctor. Are you certain these tests are absolutely necessary? Couldn't we just try a stronger pair of glasses? Or perhaps some ear drops? I’m not fond of hospitals, you see. They're rather… sterile. And the waiting rooms are always full of germs. Honestly, the thought of lying in a machine for an hour… it's quite alarming. And a blood panel? I detest needles! Perhaps we could explore other options? I simply haven't the time for all this… rigmarole. It’s all quite… inconvenient, to say the least. I have important meetings, you see. Very important meetings.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Julie, I understand your concerns, and I assure you I wouldn’t recommend these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. The symptoms you're describing could be caused by something serious, like a tumor or neurological condition. While stronger glasses or ear drops might offer some temporary relief, they won’t address the underlying cause. An MRI is the best way to visualize your brain and identify any abnormalities. And the blood panel will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s important to get a definitive diagnosis so we can start the appropriate treatment. I will write you a referral to a neurologist who specializes in these types of conditions. They can explain the tests in more detail and answer any further questions you may have. I strongly recommend scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any activities that could put you at risk of falling, and to let someone know if your symptoms worsen.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A neurologist? Another specialist? This is becoming rather… overwhelming. Sighs heavily. Very well. If you insist. But I expect a prompt appointment, and I expect the neurologist to be… thorough. And I expect clear explanations, not a lot of medical jargon. Honestly, I haven't the time for ambiguity. And I trust they have comfortable waiting rooms? I simply cannot tolerate uncomfortable seating. Adjusts her posture. Very well. Write me the referral. But I still maintain this is all rather… inconvenient. And if I fall and break a hip, I’m holding you personally responsible, Doctor. This is most unsettling. And I expect a detailed report on the costs involved. I have a very strict budget, you see. Frowns. Very well. Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Julie. I'm writing a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly-regarded neurologist at City General Hospital. I'll make a note to include your concerns about a prompt appointment and clear communication. I will also ask her office to provide you with an estimate of the costs involved. Here is the referral. Dr. Vance's office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe headache, dizziness, weakness, or any other concerning symptoms – please go to the emergency room immediately. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. While I cannot guarantee a specific outcome, I am confident that Dr. Vance will provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No, I believe that is all. Just… please ensure Dr. Vance is aware of my… busy schedule. And my aversion to unnecessary waiting. And uncomfortable seating. Honestly, I simply haven’t the time for all this rigmarole. Stands up slowly, adjusting her coat. I trust you understand. Looks at me with a dismissive air. Very well. Goodbye, Doctor. Turns and begins to walk toward the door, then pauses. Oh, and one more thing. Please send the referral to my assistant. Her name is Beatrice. She handles all my appointments. And she's… very particular. Exits the room without another word.
