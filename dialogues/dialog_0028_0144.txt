DOCTOR: Right. Lilly Calvery, 64. And you’re here today for…?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I don't really need anything, dear. Just thought I’d… pop in. See what all the fuss is about with this newfangled place. Heard it was… different. You Dr. Memmolo? You seem awfully young to be a doctor, no offense.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. And age isn’t… necessarily indicative of competence, Mrs. Calvery. But, alright. If you’re not actively ill, then perhaps we can make this quick. Is there anything at all that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get your feathers ruffled, dear. Just an observation. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. A little creaky in the mornings, you know, but who doesn’t at my age? My Harold… my late husband… he always said I worried too much about nothing. He was the sensible one. I suppose I just wanted to make sure everything was alright, even if I can't put my finger on what "everything" even is. Does that make sense? It's all a bit fuzzy, you know.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. Well, “perfectly fine” and “fuzzy” aren’t typically a chief complaint, Mrs. Calvery. Do you have any… specific concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really. I mean… sometimes I forget where I put my glasses. And I had a bit of trouble remembering the name of that actress… you know, the one from those old movies. Betty… something? It’s right on the tip of my tongue. It’s not like serious forgetfulness, though. Just… senior moments, I suppose. Harold always said I had a terrible memory, even when I was young. Though he was the one losing his keys all the time, if I recall correctly.
DOCTOR: Right. Memory lapses. And how long have these "lapses" been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. A long time, I suppose. Years, probably. It's hard to say. They come and go. Some days I'm as sharp as a tack, and others… well, others I’m wondering why I walked into this room in the first place. It's been worse since Harold passed, I think. Everything feels a bit… disconnected. Though, to be honest, I always had a bit of trouble remembering things. It's just… gotten a little more noticeable, maybe. Does that make sense? It’s not like I’m forgetting everything, you know. Just… bits and pieces.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, with all due respect, “bits and pieces” isn’t a quantifiable medical complaint. Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Let me think. Well, sometimes I feel a little… tired. But who doesn't these days? And my hands ache a bit in the cold weather, but I always attributed that to the arthritis. Harold’s mother had terrible arthritis, you see. Terrible. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel a bit… off. Like something isn’t quite right, but I can't put my finger on it. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m in pain or anything. Just… a general feeling of… blah.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medications?
PATIENT: Oh! Medications… right. Let me see… Well, there's the little white pill for my blood pressure, I think. And a vitamin D supplement. Dr. Lee prescribed that, ages ago. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my… what was it? Oh, bother. For my sleep. When I can’t get to sleep, that is. It’s a little blue one. Though I don’t take it every night. Just when I really need it. Harold used to keep track of all that, you know. He was very organized. I'm afraid I'm not.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once after using a new laundry detergent… but that wasn't a medication, was it? Harold always said I had sensitive skin. He bought me all the hypoallergenic soaps. He was very considerate, that man.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, now you’re asking things I really can't recall. I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. That was… oh, goodness, decades. And Dr. Peterson told me my cholesterol was a little high, but that was years ago, and I think it’s okay now. And I had the flu once, very bad. But chronic conditions… I don’t really know what that means, dear. Harold handled all the medical things, you see. He always knew what to ask, and what to expect. I just… went along for the ride.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your… vagueness, and the fact that you aren't presenting with any acute issues, I think a basic physical exam is in order. Just to get a baseline. It’s quick, and it might rule some things out. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… standard stuff. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. Though I always told Harold I hated going to the doctor. All those cold instruments and poking and prodding. But if you insist, dear. Just be gentle, alright? My skin is rather sensitive. And please, don’t rush. I don’t like being rushed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Blood pressure is slightly elevated. 148 over 86. We'll need to monitor that. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs… there's a slight decrease in breath sounds on the left lower lobe. Could be nothing, but we'll keep an eye on it. Pulse is 72 and regular. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Overall, everything seems… within normal limits, given your age. But we'll need to address the blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh my. Elevated, you say? Is that bad? Harold always had perfect blood pressure. He ate a lot of bananas, I think. And that breathing… decrease, you said? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my lungs? Oh dear, this is exactly why I don't like going to the doctor. You're scaring me now, dear. Perhaps I should just go home.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, please. It’s slightly elevated. And a slight decrease in breath sounds doesn’t automatically mean you have a serious lung condition. It could be a number of things. We need to rule things out, and that requires further testing. We can order a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a better picture. It's standard procedure. Look, you’re 64. Some changes are expected. We're just being thorough. But panicking won't help.
PATIENT: Oh, “changes,” you say? Like what kind of changes? Harold never had “changes.” He was as healthy as a horse right up until… well. This all sounds very complicated and… worrisome. An X-ray? I haven’t had an X-ray since I broke my wrist when I was a girl. Is it dangerous? And blood work… I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, the X-ray involves minimal radiation, it’s perfectly safe. And the blood work… yes, it requires a small needle, but it’s a quick procedure. It helps us assess your overall health and identify any potential issues. Look, I understand you’re anxious, but refusing testing won’t make things better. We need information to determine the best course of action. I’m recommending a chest X-ray and a basic metabolic panel. Would you like me to explain what those tests entail in more detail, or would you prefer I have the nurse go over it with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A panel… like a judge’s panel? Is someone going to be judging my health? And you say minimal radiation… but what if it's too minimal? Won’t they miss something important? Oh dear, this is just too much. I think I need to sit down. My head is spinning. Perhaps… perhaps I should just take some aspirin and go home and rest. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. It's just… one of those things.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, with all due respect, you are not being… helpful. I am recommending these tests because it's my professional opinion that they are necessary to rule out potential problems. Ignoring your health will not make those problems disappear. Look, I can order the tests and schedule them for you. Or, if you prefer, I can document your refusal and send you home. However, I strongly advise against that. It is your health, after all. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. You're scolding me now? Like a naughty child? I just… I don't like doctors. I never have. Harold always took care of everything. He knew what to do. I just want to be comfortable and… left alone, really. Alright. Fine. Order the tests. But please… be gentle. And explain everything very, very slowly. And don't use too many big words. I get confused easily. And... can I bring a friend next time? Someone to… hold my hand?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering a chest X-ray and a comprehensive metabolic panel. The nurse will explain the process to you in detail. She will also schedule the appointments. The lab is located down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. As for bringing a friend… yes, you can bring someone with you. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I suppose. Though I’m still very worried. And… please tell the nurse to be patient with me. I’m afraid I’m not very good with all this medical stuff. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day.
