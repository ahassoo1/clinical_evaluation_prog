DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… let me see. My… well, it’s about my blood, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should come get it… checked. Something about knowing what type it is. I don’t quite recall the reason, truthfully. It’s just… important, she said.
DOCTOR: Okay. So your daughter recommended you come in to have your blood type determined. That’s a good reason to get it checked, especially as we get older. Have you ever had your blood type checked before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a good question. I… I honestly don’t remember. So many years, you know? I used to travel a bit with my husband, back when we were younger… perhaps a doctor somewhere did it then? But it doesn’t ring a bell. I really couldn't say, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright, no worries at all. It's common to forget things over time. We can certainly get it checked now. It’s a simple blood test. Besides your daughter’s concern about your blood type, are you experiencing any symptoms currently – like unusual fatigue, bruising easily, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I do get tired easier these days, that’s true. But at my age, isn't that to be expected? And I… I think I bumped into the coffee table the other night and have a bit of a bruise on my shin, but I’m terribly clumsy, you see. Nothing to worry about, I don’t think. Just old age and a wobbly leg!
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue and a bruise… we’ll keep those in mind. Just to get a more complete picture, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh my… significant? Let me think. My husband, he passed away… that was a very difficult time, of course. As for illnesses… I had the flu a few times, I suppose. And… oh! I had my gallbladder taken out, years and years ago. That was… unpleasant. But other than that, I’ve been fairly lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, and the flu. And I’m sorry for your loss. Any family history of medical problems that you're aware of – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… now that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had trouble with her heart, I think. She was always a bit frail. And my brother… he had something with his… his sugars, maybe? Diabetes, was it? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t terribly involved with their medical things, you see. I just remember… trouble. Yes, trouble with their health.
DOCTOR: Okay, some history of heart trouble and possible diabetes in your family. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… not that I know of, no. I eat almost anything, bless my soul. Though, I do find I can’t tolerate spicy food as well as I used to! But an allergy… no, I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now you mention it… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a while back. And… oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the daughter insisted. Something about the sun, and old bones. And… I think that’s it. Unless… oh, sometimes I take something for my knees when they ache, but I forget the name. It's a little white pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for blood pressure, vitamin D, and something for your knees when they ache. We’ll try to get the name of that knee medication later. Alright Ms. Nini, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. That sounds perfectly fine. As long as it doesn't involve anything… sharp! I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to needles, you see. But listening and checking… that’s just fine. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: No needles right now, I promise. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Nothing alarming at this point, but we’ll note it. Now, breathe deeply again… and out… Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not significantly so. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, Ms. Nini. Strength is good in all extremities. Alright, everything seems generally okay so far. Given your fatigue and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order some routine blood work. This will help us assess your overall health, check your blood count, kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. It will also help rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds very sensible, dear. If it helps figure out why I’m so tired, then yes, absolutely. And if it’s just checking things… well, can't hurt, I suppose. I trust your judgment. Blood work it is, then. Will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Just a little prick, Ms. Nini, nothing to worry about. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It’s very quick, and they’re very good at it. I'm ordering a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Lipid Panel, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I’ll also give you a copy of the lab requisition to take with you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, those are a lot of fancy names! I don’t suppose I need to remember them, do I? The daughter will know, I’m sure. No… I think I’m alright for questions right now. Just… when will I know the results? And will someone tell me what they mean? I worry I won't understand all the medical talk.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to remember the names at all. The lab will send the results to me, and I will be the one to explain them to you, in plain language. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment, usually within a week, so we can discuss everything thoroughly. Here’s the requisition form. You can take this to any lab, but if you’d prefer, the receptionist can help you find a convenient one nearby. I’ll also have my nurse call you to schedule the follow-up appointment once we have the results. Do you have any questions about where to go for the blood work, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to have your nurse call, dear. That takes a load off my mind. No, I think I'm alright for now. I'll let the daughter handle the actual going to the lab. She's much more organized than I am. Thank you very much, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Nini. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate that. You have a good day too, and thank you again for everything. I think I’ll go have a nice cup of tea now.
