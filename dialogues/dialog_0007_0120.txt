DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez, but you can call me Valerie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, hello. Look, I don't have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to...have a baby. And I want it to be easy, you know? No problems. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I don’t want to be old when this happens. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand wanting to get right to it and wanting things to go smoothly – completely reasonable. And I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone is never easy. So, you’re hoping to get pregnant and want to make sure everything is optimized for a healthy pregnancy, and you’re concerned about time. That’s a great starting point. To get a better understanding of what “easy” means for you, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Ugh, medical history. Honestly, it was… a long time ago. I think so? Maybe? It was before everything… you know. Look, it was normal, I suppose. One baby, healthy enough. Nothing special. It wasn't difficult, if that's what you're asking. But I was younger then. A lot younger. Does it really matter? I just want to know what I need to do to make this happen now.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense that you want to focus on now. And you’re right, a previous uncomplicated pregnancy is good information. But things can change over time, so just want to get a full picture. Okay, so one previous pregnancy, delivered without major complications, as far as you recall. Do you remember anything about the delivery itself – was it vaginal or a C-section?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was… messy. A blur, really. I was in pain, obviously, but… I don’t recall specifics. C-section… maybe? I wouldn’t even know. Look, is this going to take all day? I have things to do. I need to know if there's a test, or a pill, or something that will just… make it happen. I don’t want to spend hours talking about things I barely remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. We can focus on what’s important for moving forward. And yes, there are definitely tests and things we can do to optimize your chances. Let's start with some basic bloodwork to check your hormone levels, make sure you’re not deficient in anything, and rule out any underlying conditions that could affect fertility. We’ll also want to do a full physical exam. Have you had one recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, bloodwork. Fine. I had one… a couple of years ago, maybe? For my insurance. Just the usual stuff. Cholesterol, you know? Nothing special. I don't like needles. Is this going to be a lot of blood? And what exactly are you looking for with these “hormone levels”? It sounds complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s standard bloodwork, nothing too extensive. And you're right, it's pretty simple stuff. We’re checking things like your thyroid function, and levels of hormones like Follicle-Stimulating Hormone and Luteinizing Hormone – these play a big role in ovulation. Also, checking your Vitamin D levels, as that can affect fertility as well. It's not usually a lot of blood, maybe two or three vials. Before we order those, let's quickly go over any medications you're currently taking, and any allergies you have. And just to be thorough, have you had any major medical conditions diagnosed – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. I take a vitamin, and sometimes something for my blood pressure, but it's not regular. My mother had high blood pressure, so I get it checked. Allergies… dust, I think. And… I don't know. Nothing major. As for conditions… not really. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s it. Old age, you know? Is that all? Can we just order the tests now? This is… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin supplement, occasional blood pressure medication, dust allergy, and some arthritis. Yes, we can order those tests. Before we do, just one last quick thing. Sometimes fertility can be affected by lifestyle factors. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Good heavens, no. I have standards. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And no, to the other things. I eat reasonably well, I exercise… I take care of myself. Really. I just want to know what's wrong, if anything, and how to fix it. Are we finally getting somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's good to know, and definitely helpful. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, healthy lifestyle – excellent. Okay, I'm going to order those blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in quickly. Once we have the results – which usually takes a few days – we can review them together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend starting a daily prenatal vitamin if you aren't already. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, good. Prenatal vitamin... I'll look into it. Fine. Just get the tests done. Honestly, I have a lot on my mind, and I’d rather not spend the whole day here answering questions. Is there anything else you need to know? Because if not, let’s just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: No, I think we’ve covered the essential information for now. I understand wanting to get this moving quickly, and I respect that. Here’s the lab requisition – just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of the rest. I’ll have my nurse contact you in a few days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… tell your nurse I’m a busy woman and don’t want to wait around. Alright. Thank you. .
