DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Lytisha. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something to do with… checking things. Medicare sent me, you see. A drug test, maybe? I don’t really remember all the details. It’s been a bit of a blur lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Medicare does sometimes schedule routine tests, and it can be easy to forget the specifics. Let me just take a look at your record here… Ah, yes. It seems you're scheduled for a comprehensive metabolic panel and a lipid panel. Those are blood tests, checking your kidney and liver function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. It’s a pretty standard check-up, often done for folks on Medicare. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… sounds a little scary. Kidneys and livers… I don't think I've had those checked before. Is something wrong? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t these days? Cholesterol… is that bad? I eat pretty healthy, I think. Mostly. I do like a good pastry now and then. Is this because of… well, you know… my husband passing? Sometimes things just feel… off, if that makes sense. I'm not sure what all those words mean, though.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel a little anxious when you hear about tests you haven't had before, Lytisha. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong; these tests are often done as preventative measures, just to get a baseline and make sure everything is functioning as it should. "Kidneys and livers" can sound intimidating, but they're really just checking how well your body is processing things – like food and waste. The lipid panel, that's the cholesterol test, and it can be important for heart health. You're right to mention your husband passing. Big life changes like that can definitely have an effect on your overall health, both physically and mentally. Let's break it down a bit. When you say you feel "tired sometimes," can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it's not a bad tired, you know? Just… everything feels a little heavy. Like wading through water. And I don't bounce back like I used to. If I do a bit too much in the garden, I need a good long nap afterwards. It's been… gradual, I suppose. It started after… after Jean-Paul got sick. I used to be able to work all day on the equipment, no problem. Now? I take it a bit slower. I'm still good at it, mind you. Just… slower. Does that make any sense? I’m probably rambling. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Lytisha, you're not rambling. That makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing some fatigue and a reduced energy level, which is understandable given everything you've been through. It's very common to feel that way after a significant loss. So, this fatigue started around the time your husband, Jean-Paul, became ill?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It started then, and… it’s just sort of stayed with me, even after. I thought it was just grief, you know? Everyone said grief comes in waves. And it does. But this… this is more constant. I just figured I was getting old. I'm fifty-one, after all. Maybe my body’s just… wearing out. Is that what happens? Do people just… get tired as they get older?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable thought, Lytisha. It is true that energy levels can change as we age, but it's also important to rule out any underlying medical causes for persistent fatigue. Now, aside from the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been a bit more… forgetful, I guess. Not like, forgetting who people are, but… misplacing things, not remembering appointments. Small things. And my hands ache sometimes, especially in the mornings. I always thought that was just from working the equipment, you know? All the vibrations. And… oh! My appetite comes and goes. Some days I can eat a good meal, other days I just don’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful, Lytisha. So, forgetfulness, hand aches – particularly in the mornings – and a fluctuating appetite. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, there’s the blood pressure medicine, Losartan, I think it’s called. Doctor Moreau prescribed it a few years ago. And I take a multivitamin, just a general one. Oh, and sometimes, when my hands are really aching, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter stuff, you know? Nothing fancy. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Losartan for blood pressure, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed for hand pain. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring, but that's just pollen, I think. Nothing serious. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I used to eat shellfish all the time, and never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, Lytisha, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that's a tough one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And she had arthritis, really bad. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. My father… he was a smoker. He died young, from lung cancer. And Jean-Paul… his father had heart problems. He died from a heart attack when Jean-Paul was a boy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Lytisha. High blood pressure and arthritis in your mother, lung cancer in your father, and heart problems in Jean-Paul's father. That's helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? My hands are a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lytisha. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Thyroid feels normal. I do notice some swelling and redness in your knuckles, and your grip strength feels a little diminished. Everything seems relatively normal on initial exam, but the hand swelling and fatigue are things we need to investigate further. I think it would be a good idea to order some blood work to check your complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid function, and also a complete blood count to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust you. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? All those words… complete metabolic panel, lipid panel… it’s a bit overwhelming. But if it’ll help, then yes, let’s do it. When will I get the results? And will I have to come back again?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be a lot to take in, Lytisha. We'll get to the bottom of this. The lab work should be back in a few days, usually within 3-5 business days. Once I have the results, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like a fever, chest pain, or severe fatigue, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s… nice to have someone actually listen. I guess I'll just wait for the phone call then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lytisha. It's my pleasure. I’ll be in touch soon. And please, don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
