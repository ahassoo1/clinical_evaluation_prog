DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, morning. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I'm Kahrin, by the way. Just want to know what everything means, quickly if possible – I’ve got a pretty tight schedule today.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “quickly” isn’t always feasible when discussing your health, Ms. Kovtun. But we'll try to be efficient. Let me pull up your results here… Alright, it appears we’re discussing the complete blood count and metabolic panel from July 26th. Before we delve into the numbers, can you remind me briefly why your primary care physician ordered these tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Honestly? I barely remember. Just a check-up, I think. He was being…thorough. I was feeling a bit tired lately, maybe that was it. He just wanted to rule things out, I guess. I don’t usually go to the doctor unless something’s really wrong, so I wasn’t really listening to the details. Can we just skip to if anything is wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, a “check-up” involves gathering information to determine if something is wrong. Dismissing the details isn't helpful. However… alright. Your complete blood count was generally within normal limits, with a slightly low iron level. Your metabolic panel… that's where we see a mildly elevated glucose. 112 fasting. That's not alarmingly high, but it is above the normal range. Do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm. 112… okay. Diabetes… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had it, I think. She was really old though, like in her eighties. I didn’t even know her that well. She lived back in Tahiti. But I remember my mom saying something about it. Is that…bad? Is that why you're looking at me like that?
DOCTOR: It's not a matter of looking at you, Ms. Kovtun. It's about assessing risk factors. A family history, even a distant one, is a factor, particularly with an elevated glucose level. And 112 isn’t insignificant, especially considering your age. We need to investigate further. Have you noticed any increased thirst, frequent urination, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. Thirst… I drink a lot of water, always have, it’s hot where I live. And I pee, like, a normal amount. Look, I get it, you need to ask, but I feel fine. Really. I eat pretty healthy, I exercise… I don't know. Is this going to involve more blood tests? Because I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, feeling “fine” doesn't necessarily equate to being healthy. Diabetes can develop insidiously, with minimal early symptoms. And yes, further investigation will involve a blood test – specifically, a hemoglobin A1c. It gives us a better picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past two to three months. It’s far more informative than a single fasting glucose reading. As for the needle… I assure you, it’s a small inconvenience compared to the potential complications of undiagnosed diabetes. We also need to repeat the fasting glucose to confirm the initial result. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, fine. Two tests. But you have to promise it's quick. And the phlebotomist has to be good. Really good. I’m not good with pain. Yes, I consent. Just...let's get it over with. When can I do them?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood for both tests now. I'll need you to fast for at least eight hours before the repeat fasting glucose. We'll schedule that for next week, ideally. As for the A1c, it doesn't require fasting. I’ll have the lab schedule both appointments for you. While we wait, let's review your general health habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I used to, ages ago, when I was in college, but I quit years ago. I mean, I try to eat pretty well – lots of fruit and fish. Not much processed stuff. And I walk everywhere. I live in the city; it's the easiest way to get around. Anything else? Can we just hurry this part up? I have a meeting in a couple of hours.
DOCTOR: "Hurrying" a medical history assessment is not advisable, Ms. Kovtun. However, I understand your time constraints. Let’s move on. Do you consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Socially, yeah. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a drink with friends. Nothing crazy. Definitely not a regular thing. I’m not a big drinker. And I certainly don’t drink every day. Is that what you’re asking? Honestly, I’m starting to feel like you think I’m some kind of… unhealthy person. I just wanted to know what the numbers meant!
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, my role isn’t to judge your lifestyle; it's to gather information. Frequent alcohol consumption can affect glucose metabolism, even in moderate amounts. I need a clear picture of your habits. On average, how many alcoholic beverages do you consume per week?
PATIENT: Look, maybe two, sometimes three, on a weekend? If I’m going out. Honestly, it varies. Sometimes none. I don't keep a log of it, okay? It's not a problem! I'm perfectly healthy. Can we please just get to the results and be done with this? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, your dismissive attitude and reluctance to provide accurate information are hindering my ability to provide you with proper medical care. I understand you have time constraints, but rushing through a medical assessment is irresponsible. I will repeat myself: accurate information is crucial. Given your family history, slightly elevated glucose, and inconsistent responses regarding alcohol consumption, I’m concerned about the possibility of pre-diabetes or early-stage diabetes. Until we receive the results of the A1c and repeat fasting glucose, I recommend a low-carbohydrate diet and regular exercise. I’m also going to schedule a consultation with a registered dietitian to discuss dietary modifications. We will review your results in one week. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A dietitian? Seriously? Okay, fine. Whatever. Low carbs, got it. One week. Look, can we just schedule the tests and be done? I'll try to remember everything, okay? Just...please, let's move this along. I have a meeting, remember? And I really don't want to spend my afternoon talking about carbs. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab orders are here. The lab technician is expecting you. The appointment with the dietitian is scheduled for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. The lab will contact you to schedule the repeat fasting glucose. I expect you to take this seriously, Ms. Kovtun. Ignoring potential health issues will only lead to more significant problems in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
