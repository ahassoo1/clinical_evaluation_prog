DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's been a bit of a rough patch, honestly. I’ve just been feeling so sick to my stomach lately. And I don't eat much before I feel full. It’s… frustrating. I don’t remember when it started exactly, just… gradually. It's been going on for a while now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, "sick to your stomach" and feeling full quickly… I see. And you said "gradually" – so it didn't come on suddenly?
PATIENT: No, not suddenly. It wasn't like one day I just felt sick. It just… slowly got worse. I used to have a good appetite, you know? Always enjoyed my food. But now… even a little bit feels like too much. It's hard to explain. I just… don’t feel hungry like I used to. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A gradual loss of appetite and feeling full sooner than usual. Has anything changed recently, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… Well, let me think. My… my husband passed a little over a year ago. That was a big change. And… I’ve been trying to spend more time with my grandkids, which is lovely, but it’s a lot. I've been doing a bit less with the animals, too. I used to train them all the time, but… it’s hard to get around these days. I don't know if any of that matters. It all just feels… mixed up, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Losing your husband… that's a significant change, certainly. And adjusting to new routines with the grandkids… it sounds like you’ve had a lot on your plate. Okay. Besides the nausea and feeling full quickly, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I’ve been a little tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little bloated, but not always. It’s hard to say what’s causing what, you know? I don't have much energy for much these days, but I figured that was just getting older. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Fatigue and occasional bloating… okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a personal question, isn’t it? Well… everything feels a little off, if I’m honest. I haven't been… regular, let's put it that way. It's been a bit unpredictable. I don't really like talking about this, if you don't mind. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is personal, and it's important information, Ms. Kelder, so thank you for sharing. "Unpredictable" bowel habits... alright. And have you experienced any weight loss recently, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, weight loss… I hadn't really thought about it. I suppose I haven’t been weighing myself much lately. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? And no, no trouble swallowing. Everything goes down okay, it’s just… staying down is the problem sometimes. And not wanting to eat in the first place. It's a mess, really. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: You're not being vague at all, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like you're describing a constellation of symptoms. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool or vomit?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood… No, I don’t think so. I… I haven't checked, to be honest. I get a little queasy just thinking about it. I really don’t like talking about this, Doctor. It's all very upsetting. I’m sorry. Is this… is this something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Kelder. It's perfectly alright to feel upset. We'll take things slowly. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. That sounds… sensible. I’d like to know what’s happening, if you can find out. Just… please be gentle. My stomach’s been a little sensitive lately, as you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Just breathe normally. Okay. I'm not hearing any obvious abnormalities, but there is some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen when I press. No rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. I’m also going to check your vital signs quickly. Blood pressure and pulse are within normal limits. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. I’m going to order some blood work and a stool sample analysis to rule out some common causes of your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Blood work and a stool sample, alright. As long as it will help find out what's wrong. I’m not fond of tests, but I understand they're necessary. Will the blood work tell you if… if it's serious? I’m just… worried, Doctor. It’s just a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us look for signs of infection, inflammation, and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your symptoms. We'll also check your electrolytes and nutritional status. And the stool sample will help us identify any potential issues with your digestive system. It's understandable to be worried, Ms. Kelder. We’re taking things one step at a time. I’m going to order those tests now. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals and staying hydrated. Avoid any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. I’m going to also prescribe a medication to help with the nausea. It's a low dose, and we can adjust it if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Smaller meals and more water, I can do that. And the medicine for the nausea, yes, please. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, Doctor. It's been a while since I felt like someone really heard me. Do you… do you think it could be something serious? I know you probably can’t say for sure yet, but… just a general idea.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, it's difficult to say definitively without the test results. Your symptoms could be related to several things – a stomach virus, gastritis, even something as simple as a change in diet. However, given your age and the gradual onset of symptoms, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, such as a potential ulcer or early signs of a gastrointestinal issue. That’s why we’re doing the tests. I don’t want to alarm you, but it's better to be thorough. I'm going to schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen significantly – severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or feeling very weak – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… sensible. I understand. A week from today. And go to the emergency room if things get worse. I’ll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your honesty, even if it’s a little scary. I just… I want to feel better. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. And you're right to want to feel better. For now, just focus on staying hydrated and eating those smaller meals. Try to get some rest, and manage any stress you might be feeling. I’ve sent the medication order to your pharmacy. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I think that’s all for today.
