DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um... right. My ears. They feel… full. Like something’s blocked, you know? It's been… a while now, I suppose. Not terribly painful, just… annoying. I'd like to get it sorted if possible. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fullness” in the ears. And it’s been going on for a while. Not painful, just bothersome, you said. That’s good to know. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: When… hmm. That's a tricky one. Honestly, it feels like… months? Maybe even longer. It sort of crept up on me, I think. I wasn’t paying much attention at first. My wife… she always used to remind me to get things checked. After she… well, things got a bit blurry, to be honest. I really couldn’t say exactly when it started. Sorry. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Leander. It's very common for things to come on gradually, and life gets in the way. It’s completely understandable that it's hard to pinpoint. So, it's been months, slowly getting worse… Has it been getting steadily worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go, I think. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, today is one of the worse ones. It feels quite blocked. It doesn't really seem to be connected to anything specific. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I do a lot of work outside, with… plants, mostly. But I’ve had it even when I’ve been indoors for days. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, it fluctuates – better some days, worse others – and doesn't seem linked to your outdoor work. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. I suppose… maybe a little bit of ringing? Very faint, and I could just be imagining it. It’s not constant, and it’s not loud. I've always had… a bit of a quiet life, if you know what I mean. So, I might be noticing things I wouldn’t normally. No dizziness, no pain, no discharge… Just the fullness, and maybe a little ringing sometimes. I don’t think I’ve noticed any changes in my hearing, but… I don’t really listen to much music these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fluctuating fullness, possibly some faint ringing, no dizziness or discharge, and no changes in hearing that you’ve noticed. And you haven’t experienced any pain, which is good. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you had any issues with your ears in the past – infections, injuries, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… infections, maybe when I was a boy? I honestly don’t remember much. It was… a long time ago. No injuries, not that I recall. I’ve always been quite careful. I do wear earplugs when it’s really windy, when I'm working with the… machinery. But that’s about it. My wife… she always made sure I had them. She was very good at that sort of thing. I really can't think of anything else, sorry. I'm not much for remembering details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Leander. It sounds like you’ve been pretty diligent about protecting your ears when you can. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… not that I know of. The doctor… the one before… he always said I was… remarkably healthy, for my age. I eat reasonably well, I try to get some exercise… though it’s not as much as I used to. No diabetes, no blood pressure problems… I think. I haven’t really had much reason to see a doctor in… well, a long time. I have private insurance, if that’s helpful? I'm not sure what’s covered, though. Honestly, I don't deal with those things. My wife used to handle everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Remarkably healthy, which is wonderful. And you have private insurance – that’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your history, then I’d like to take a quick look in your ears. Do you take any medications currently – prescription or over-the-counter?
