DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. Just…chest hurt. And my heart…feels funny. Like…bumping. Been happening a bit. Not good. I don't have all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest hurt and a feeling like your heart is bumping… intermittent, you said?
PATIENT: Inter…what? Just sometimes! Not all the time. And blood pressure…wife say it’s high. She always worry. But I feel…okay, mostly. Just this chest thing. It’s annoying. Can we hurry? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll get through this as efficiently as we can. “Intermittent” just means it comes and goes. So, the chest pain comes and goes, and your wife has noticed your blood pressure is high. Can you tell me a little more about the chest pain?
PATIENT: High blood pressure is normal for me! My father had it. Everyone in my family. What kind of questions are these? The pain…it's here. . Feels tight. Like…someone sitting on it. Sometimes it goes to my arm. Left arm. Mostly when I walk. And I get…breathless. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Tightness in the center of your chest, radiating to your left arm, especially with walking, and you experience some shortness of breath. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it new?
PATIENT: New-ish. Maybe…a few weeks? Hard to say. I don't pay attention to everything. Wife notices more than me. Before, I just felt…old. Now it's pain. And the bumping. It's bothersome. Really. Can we get this over with? I'm not a fan of doctors. Too many questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz. We'll try to keep this as streamlined as possible. A few weeks of chest pain and the feeling of palpitations… the “bumping” you mentioned. Has anything specific brought on the pain, besides walking?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Stress. Always stress. Work, family…life! It’s all stress. And sometimes…after eating. Big meals. Heavy food. Not good. Wife tells me to eat less, but…what's the point? You get old, you want to enjoy things. Now, can we do something about the pain? Or are you just going to ask more questions?
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and large meals seem to be triggers. We are getting to a point where we can start to figure out what’s going on, Mr. Sobkowicz. Before we do, I just want to get a quick overview of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Cholesterol…maybe? Doctor told me something years ago. I don't remember. I take pills. Blue pills. And a white one. For…something. I don't keep track of these things. Wife handles all that. Why do I need to remember? It's a waste of time. Let's just fix the chest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be frustrating to keep track of everything, Mr. Sobkowicz. Knowing what medications you’re on is important, though. Do you mind if I quickly check your EHR to see a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: EHR? What is that? Just…look it up. Whatever you need to do, hurry. I have appointments. Important ones. This whole thing is taking too long. I'm a busy man. Not like I have all day to sit around in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me pull up your records here… Alright, it says you are taking Lisinopril 20mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and Aspirin 81mg daily. That confirms the blue and white pills you mentioned. It also shows a history of hypertension – high blood pressure – and hyperlipidemia – high cholesterol. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any problems with pills. Just…sometimes they make me sleepy. And that aspirin…makes my stomach a bit funny. But I take it anyway. Doctor said I have to. Don't ask me why. Look, can we stop with the questions and do something now? I'm getting impatient. Really impatient. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, I understand your frustration. We've gathered enough information for now. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. Then we can discuss some possible causes for your chest pain and what we can do about it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Don't waste my time. And be gentle! I'm an old man. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just take a deep breath for me... Okay. Deep breath in… and out… Again… Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a slight murmur – an extra sound – when I listen to your heart. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is elevated, 160/90. That's consistent with your history of hypertension, but we may need to adjust your medication. I’m also going to gently press on your chest to check for any tenderness. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Tenderness? A little. Right here. . It's always tender. Like…a bruise, almost. But not really. It’s just…sore. And the bumping feeling...it’s happening now. Can you feel it? Feels like a bird flapping in my chest. It's annoying. Look, what does all this mean? Just tell me straight. I don't want a lot of complicated medical talk. What's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Okay, I can feel the palpitations now, it’s a slightly irregular rhythm. And you’re right, you do have some tenderness to the touch. Given your history of hypertension, high cholesterol, the chest pain that radiates to your left arm, the shortness of breath, and now these palpitations, it’s important to rule out a few possibilities. The most concerning possibility is angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It could also be a sign of a more serious heart condition. It's also possible the pain is related to muscle strain or esophageal issues, but given your risk factors, we need to investigate further to be sure. To do that, I'd like to order an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to check your heart’s electrical activity. We’ll also need to do some blood work to check your cholesterol levels and rule out other potential causes. I also recommend a chest X-ray. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: EKG? Blood work? X-ray? More tests? Hmph. This is exactly what I was afraid of. More wasting my time. Look, can’t you just give me a pill? Something for the pain? I don’t need a lot of complicated tests. I’m an old man! I don’t have time for all this. My wife will be furious if I spend all day in a hospital getting tests. She already worries too much. Just…give me something for the pain. That's all I want. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Sobkowicz, and I wouldn't want to cause you unnecessary worry or inconvenience. However, given your symptoms and risk factors, it wouldn't be safe to simply prescribe a pain pill without first determining the cause of your chest pain. A pain pill might temporarily relieve the discomfort, but it won't address the underlying problem. If it is a heart issue, delaying diagnosis and treatment could have serious consequences. The EKG, blood work, and chest X-ray are relatively quick and non-invasive. They will give us valuable information to help determine the best course of treatment. How about this?
PATIENT: How about what? I'm listening. But make it quick. I really don't want to spend all day here. This is a complete waste of my time. And tell your nurse to be gentle with the blood draw. My veins are…difficult. Wife says so. Always complaining about my veins.
DOCTOR: Okay. How about we start with the EKG and blood work today. The EKG can be done right here in the office, and the blood work will take about 15-20 minutes. We can then schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow, so you don't have to spend the whole day at the hospital. I will personally speak with the nurse about your veins and make sure she is as gentle as possible. And I will review the results as soon as they are available and call you with the findings. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. EKG and blood work today. Chest X-ray tomorrow. And make sure that nurse is gentle! I don’t want any bruising. And call me quickly with the results. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Just…get it over with. I'm ready when you are. But hurry. Please. This is taking too long. And don't make me wait. I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. Let’s get started with the EKG right away. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood shortly after. I'll personally make sure everything goes smoothly. If you could just lie down on the exam table, and I’ll attach these electrodes to your chest. It won’t hurt a bit.
