DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what brings me in? That's a good question. It’s just… I’ve been sighing a lot lately. And taking deep breaths, I guess. Not because I’m upset, just… happens, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, I think. Honestly, time… it all blends together these days.
DOCTOR: “Sighing a lot,” you say. And deep breathing, not necessarily related to emotional distress. For how long precisely have you noticed this… increased sighing, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Precisely… You’re asking a lot of an old man, Doctor! Let me think… I’d say… maybe a few months? Could be longer. It just… started happening more and more. I don’t really notice it happening until someone points it out, you see? My wife… she used to tell me. But that was… a long time ago. It's not painful or anything, just… a lot of air moving around. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A few months of increased sighing, not associated with pain. Noted. And your wife…has she been gone long, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. A long time. Twenty years now, come October. It feels like yesterday, sometimes. She was a good woman, my Srey. Always looking after me. Always noticing things… like my sighing, before anyone else. It's quiet now, you know? Too quiet. I miss her terribly, but… time moves on. Not always for the better, though.
DOCTOR: I see. While I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Vantine, we really need to focus on the reason you’re here today. Frequent sighing can be indicative of a number of things, and while your personal history is… relevant, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the sighing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. You’re right, you’re right. Sorry, I just… get lost in thought sometimes. Other symptoms… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. Maybe a little… tired sometimes? But I’m eighty years old, Doctor! I think a little tired is to be expected. My appetite is alright, I eat… okay. No cough, no chest pain, nothing like that. Just… the sighing. And feeling a bit… empty, I suppose. But that’s probably just… old age. Does that help? I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: “Empty” is not a medical symptom, Mr. Vantine. We are attempting to determine if there is a physiological cause for this sighing, or if it is, as you suggest, simply a function of age. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weight, you say? Hmm… I don’t really keep track, to be honest. I think… maybe a little less? But I’ve been eating the same amount, or maybe a little less because… well, cooking for one isn't as appealing as it used to be. Srey… she loved to cook. Everything tasted better with her. Sorry, getting off track again. I’m not sure about the weight, Doctor. I just… feel smaller, maybe. Does that make sense? It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said your appetite is “okay.” Can you elaborate on that, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. “Okay” is… probably not the best word. It means I can still eat, but it doesn't mean I want to. I mostly eat rice, and a little fish when I can get it. Sometimes vegetables, but not much. I used to enjoy a good curry, but… it just doesn’t taste the same without Srey making it. It's not that it doesn't taste good, it’s just… lacks something. I try to eat enough to keep my strength up, but I don’t really look forward to meals anymore. Does that make any sense, Doctor? I’m probably just an old man with no appetite, is all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, you are presenting a rather… vague description of your symptoms. I need concrete information, not reminiscences. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… That’s a good question, Doctor. It's been a long time, and I don't have the best memory these days. I think… I had a little trouble with my heart, years ago. But the doctor said it was just old age, and gave me some pills. I don't remember the name of them. I think… I had some trouble with my blood pressure too, but they gave me pills for that as well. I don't take them anymore, though. I think the doctor stopped prescribing them. It was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. Does that help, Doctor? I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. I really don't remember much.
DOCTOR: You were prescribed medication for both cardiac issues and hypertension at some point, and you no longer take either?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. The doctor said… well, I think he said it wasn't serious, and I didn’t need to take the pills anymore. It was years ago, and I don’t really remember the details. He said… something about my age. He was a nice young man, that doctor. He used to visit Srey a lot. She had… trouble with her legs. I think he stopped prescribing the pills when… well, when she passed away. It just didn’t seem… necessary anymore, you know? I stopped taking them myself, then. It’s been a long time. I don’t even remember what they looked like. Does that help, Doctor? I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful. I really don’t remember much these days.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, with all due respect, this is extremely concerning. You were previously treated for cardiac issues and hypertension, stopped taking medication years ago without any follow-up, and now present with vague symptoms and a poor appetite. I need to perform a physical examination to assess your current condition. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall health. Please remove your shirt so I can listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Remove my shirt? Is… is something wrong? Is it that serious? I just thought it was old age, you know? I haven’t had anyone listen to my heart in… well, it's been a long time. Are you sure it’s necessary, Doctor? It’s just… a little embarrassing, you know? An old man like me… Is there… another way? I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. I just wanted someone to listen to my sighing, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, I understand your discomfort, but a physical examination is absolutely necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Your previous cardiac and hypertensive history requires a thorough assessment. It is not simply about your “sighing.” I need to rule out any potential underlying medical conditions. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic physical examination, I am unable to provide you with any meaningful medical assistance. We are not simply listening for your "sighing". Please, remove your shirt so I can proceed with the examination. A nurse will be in shortly to assist, if you wish.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Alright, I suppose. It’s just… I haven’t had anyone… touch me like that in a long time. Not since Srey… she used to take care of me. I just… I hope it’s not too serious, Doctor. I just want to feel better. And stop sighing, that’s all. Please be gentle, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Take a deep breath. Your heart rate is slightly irregular, and I'm detecting a murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with mild hepatomegaly. Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. Mr. Vantine, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, your heart rhythm is irregular, and I've detected a heart murmur. This requires further investigation. I am ordering an EKG and a complete blood panel. We will also need to schedule a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that doesn’t sound good, does it? EKG… blood panel… chest X-ray… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Is something wrong with my heart? I just wanted to know why I was sighing so much, that’s all. I didn’t want any… tests. Will I be alright, Doctor? Please tell me I’ll be alright. I don’t want to… I don’t want to end up in the hospital. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Vantine, I understand you're anxious, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. It is far too early to make any definitive diagnosis. However, your symptoms, combined with the findings from the physical exam, indicate a potential cardiac issue. While I cannot guarantee you will be “alright,” I can assure you that we are taking appropriate steps to investigate your condition. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm, the blood panel will provide information about your overall health, and the chest X-ray will evaluate your lungs and heart. I’m going to order these tests immediately. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We will schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. I also strongly recommend you avoid any strenuous activity until we have the results of these tests. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
