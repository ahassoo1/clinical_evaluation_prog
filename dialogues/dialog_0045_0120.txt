DOCTOR: Alright, Carmaleta. 43, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Look, can we just get this over with? I have things to do. It’s just… I want to make sure everything’s okay if I, you know… try for a baby. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I’m thinking about it. But I don’t want any problems.
DOCTOR: Right, “everything’s okay.” Well, that's a broad request. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It's good you're thinking ahead, I suppose. But “problems” can mean a lot of things. So, you've been thinking about getting pregnant. Have you started trying yet, or is this just… preliminary planning?
PATIENT: No, not yet! Definitely not yet. I just… I want to know if it'll be hard, you know? I don’t want to bother with… all of that, if it’s going to be impossible. I had no trouble before, with my… with him. But you hear things. Things change. Is that making any sense? Honestly, I don’t really understand all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Look, things do change. Age is a factor, naturally. And having a previous successful pregnancy doesn't guarantee anything. It just means you have been able to get pregnant before. Alright. So, let’s start with the basics. Any medical problems you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Problems? Not really. I mean, I had the usual… colds, flu. Nothing serious. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? My doctor before… he just did yearly checkups. Blood pressure, that sort of thing. Always said I was healthy enough. Honestly, I don’t remember much of what he said, it was all a while ago. It's just… I want a baby, and I don’t want it to be a struggle. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not “too much to ask”, it’s… unrealistic. Look, everything comes with potential struggles. We need information to assess the likelihood of those struggles. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth removed, but that was under… something, so I don’t really count that. Is that important? Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with having a baby. I just want to know if it'll work, and if it will be… easy.
DOCTOR: It all matters, Carmaleta. Everything contributes to the overall picture. Appendectomy is… noted. Wisdom teeth removal, fine. Now. Family history. Anyone in your family – mother, sisters, aunts – have trouble getting pregnant?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had me late, I think. And my sister… she had kids, but I don’t remember how easy it was for her. We didn’t really talk about that sort of thing. Everyone just… had babies. It wasn’t a big deal. Honestly, I’m not much help with this, am I? I just want a straight answer! Can you just tell me if I’m likely to have problems or not?
DOCTOR: “Straight answers” are rarely available in medicine, and frankly, your lack of detail is… frustrating. Look, we’re not conducting an interrogation here. I need information to make an assessment. Alright. Let’s skip the family history for now. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… not really. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes when the flowers bloom, but that's just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. I can eat anything, take any medicine. I'm pretty… normal, honestly. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is subjective, Carmaleta. And frankly, you're not being very helpful. Alright. Medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, sometimes. And when I have a headache, I take… ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Honestly, this is all so pointless if you can’t just tell me what my chances are! I just want a baby, and I don’t want to be disappointed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, you want a baby and you want reassurance without providing any information. That's not how this works. It sounds like you're relatively healthy, which is good. But "relatively healthy" doesn't tell me anything. Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can discuss possible blood tests to check your hormone levels and overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I suppose a quick exam is better than nothing. But please, don’t take too long. I really need to be going. And if you find anything wrong, just… be direct, okay? I don’t need a lot of… explanations. Just tell me what it is, and if I can have a baby or not. Honestly, this is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat and lie down. I’ll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll do a quick abdominal exam.
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up, please. I have things to do. This is all very… undignified, honestly.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Not terrible. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Seems normal. Alright. Everything appears normal on the initial examination, but that’s not enough. We'll need blood work to assess your hormone levels, thyroid function, and overall health. I’ll write you a requisition.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… write the thing. I suppose that’s something. How long will it take to get the results? And what if… what if something is wrong? Honestly, I don’t think I can handle a lot of bad news right now. I just want a straight answer, please. Don't tell me a lot of medical jargon. Just tell me yes or no. Can I have a baby, or can't I?
DOCTOR: The results usually take about a week. And frankly, “yes” or “no” answers are rarely possible in medicine. It’s not that simple. Here. Take this to the lab. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’ll be honest with you, Carmaleta. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, your chances seem reasonable. But that's not a guarantee. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. And please, try to be more forthcoming with information next time. It’ll save us both a lot of time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Or… I suppose you’re welcome. Honestly, this hasn’t been very reassuring. I’ll… I’ll go get the tests done. Honestly, some people just want a miracle, and don’t want to hear about the reality of things…
DOCTOR: .
