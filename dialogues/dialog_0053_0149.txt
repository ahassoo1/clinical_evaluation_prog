DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Gunasekara. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Pitmon, you say? Hmm. Well, to be perfectly honest, I don't really want to be here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to “get this checked.” Checked for what, exactly, she couldn’t really say. Just a lot of fuss, if you ask me. I’ve been a podiatrist for… goodness, decades. I know my own feet.
DOCTOR: Right. Decades, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, decades! Before all this… newfangled medicine, mind you. We treated people then, with proper care and understanding. Not poking and prodding and sending you for endless tests. I just don't see the point of all the… bother. And frankly, I’m not keen on having strangers stickin’ their noses where they don’t belong.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Gunasekara, even experienced professionals benefit from a fresh set of eyes sometimes. It's not about doubting your expertise, it’s about ensuring everything is… optimal. Now, regardless of your daughter’s insistence, something is prompting her concern. Can you tell me specifically what’s bothering you – or what led her to book this appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s always something with that girl. Always worryin’. Honestly, it’s probably just… age. Things wear out, you know? Like a good pair of shoes. She kept goin’ on about my… balance. Said I nearly fell in the garden. A little stumble, that’s all. I recovered just fine. And my feet… well, they’re a little tender, maybe. But who doesn’t have tender feet at my age? It's not like I’m runnin’ marathons!
DOCTOR: Right, “tender feet” and a “little stumble”. And how long has this tenderness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now, let me think… It’s been… a while. Months, I suppose. Everything blurs together after a certain age, you know? It’s not a sudden thing, it's just… gradually gotten a little more noticeable. I mostly just ignore it. Rub some cream on 'em and wear comfortable shoes. That's what I've always done. Honestly, I don't understand why we're makin' such a fuss about it.
DOCTOR: Well, ignoring things isn’t always the best approach, Ms. Gunasekara. It's important to rule out any underlying causes. Now, aside from the tenderness and the stumble, have you noticed any other changes in your feet?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me see… well, they feel older, if that makes any sense. Not as… springy, I suppose. And maybe a little wider? I used to wear some rather nice pumps, you know, back in my younger days. But now… well, I mostly stick to sensible sandals. That’s about all I can comfortably fit these days. And I’ve noticed… oh, this is silly… but my toenails seem a bit thicker. Is that a sign of somethin’ awful?
DOCTOR: Thicker toenails can be a number of things, Ms. Gunasekara. It's not necessarily “awful”, but it's good you mentioned it. And you said "not as springy"?
PATIENT: Yes, not as springy! Like I said, I used to be able to dance all night, you know? Now, just walkin’ to the mailbox feels like a bit of an effort. And it's not just my feet, mind you. My knees ache, my back… everything’s creakin’ and groanin’. It’s just… old age, Doctor. Plain and simple. I don't need a fancy diagnosis to tell me that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, even with “plain and simple” old age, we still need to get a proper assessment. I’m going to do a quick physical examination of your feet and legs. Just to get a baseline, you understand. It won’t take long. Can you please sit up and cross your legs?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to examine me? After all this talk about me knowing my own body? Honestly. Well, alright. But don’t go pokin’ and proddin’ too much. I don’t like being fussed over. And be gentle, please. My skin is… delicate.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's see… I notice some mild swelling in both ankles. And your feet do exhibit some… calluses, as expected. Your toenails are indeed thicker than average, and there’s some slight discoloration. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! A little bit. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. There. And… there. It's a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. I suppose that's what I get for wearin' sensible shoes all the time. They don't offer much support, you know? Just… coverage. Honestly, I think you’re makin’ a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your balance?
PATIENT: My balance? Well, like I said, my daughter made a fuss about a little stumble. Honestly, the garden path is uneven! Any sensible person would have wobbled a bit. I haven’t fallen, mind you. Just… lost my footing momentarily. I’ve always been a bit clumsy, if I’m honest. Not exactly known for my grace, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Gunasekara, based on this brief examination, there are a few things we need to address. The swelling in your ankles, the changes in your toenails, and your reported balance issues… these aren’t necessarily “plain and simple” old age. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like arthritis or peripheral neuropathy. And I’d also like to get some x-rays of your feet and ankles to assess the bones.
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? Good heavens! Now you are makin' a mountain out of a molehill. I told you, it's just old age! I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve had aches and pains for years. I don’t need a battery of tests to tell me that. Honestly, I think I’ll just go home and put my feet up. This is all very… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Ms. Gunasekara, while I respect your experience, it's my professional opinion that further investigation is warranted. These tests aren't about confirming what you already know; they're about ruling out potential problems. If everything comes back normal, fine. But we need to be thorough. It's standard practice. I can refer you to a podiatrist for a more detailed assessment and to arrange these tests. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A different doctor? Now you’re just passin’ me off! Honestly, I came here to see you, and now you want to send me somewhere else? No, thank you. I think I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. I’m not interested in any more tests, or different doctors, or… anything. I just want to go home. This whole visit has been a waste of my time. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Gunasekara. As you wish. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to further complications down the line. I'll document your refusal of testing. If your condition worsens, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. .
