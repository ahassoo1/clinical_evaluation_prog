DOCTOR: Right. Arbin Komarov, 32… So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Ruocco. It's… well, the sun’s been bothering me lately. Not like a sunburn, exactly. More like… everything’s just too bright, and it hurts my eyes, you know? It’s been happening for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: Too bright, you say. Weeks, hmm?
PATIENT: Yeah, weeks. Maybe six or so? It started gradually, I think. At first it was just a little annoying, like when you walk into the sun after being inside. But now… even on cloudy days, sometimes it feels too much. It makes me squint a lot, and I get headaches sometimes too. It's weird because I haven't changed anything, no new soaps or anything.
DOCTOR: Headaches, alright. And… squinting, you said. Do you notice it more at a specific time of day, or is it pretty constant when the light is bothering you?
PATIENT: It's… worse in the afternoons, I think. Like when the sun is highest. Mornings aren’t too bad. And if I'm inside with the curtains drawn, I’m okay. It really seems to be connected to the sunlight, definitely. Does that make sense? I feel a little silly talking about this, honestly. It just feels… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Sensitivity… Yes, alright. Have you had any other changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Everything seems… clear, I guess. No blurry spots or double vision or anything like that. Colors look normal, I haven't noticed anything different there either. Just the brightness, really. It's just… uncomfortable. Oh, wait! Actually… sometimes it feels like little floaters, like dust in my eyes, but those go away pretty quick. They don’t bother me much.
DOCTOR: Floaters... alright. Any family history of eye problems?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother… she wore glasses, for distance, I think. Nothing serious, just normal aging. And my father… he didn't really talk about his health much. I don’t remember him having any eye issues, but I wasn’t very old when he passed. I’m really not sure about that one, sorry. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you on any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. Oh! And I take something for allergies when the pollen count is high, but it's just over-the-counter stuff. Nothing the doctor prescribed. Does that count? I take it when it gets bad in the spring, mostly. Mostly I just try to stay inside when it's bad.
DOCTOR: Allergies… Right. Let’s just do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I just want to figure out what's going on. It's a little worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a seat. I'll check your pupils, some basic visual acuity… and just take a look at your eyes generally. It won't take long. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm ready. Just let me know if anything feels weird. I'm a little nervous about bright lights, but I'll try to hold still.
DOCTOR: Pupils are… normal size, reactive to light. Fundi… some mild pallor of the optic disc, but nothing dramatic. Visual acuity… 20/25 in both eyes. Alright. Seems… unremarkable, frankly. But we can't rule things out. I’m going to check your intraocular pressure, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay. Intraocular pressure… what’s that? Is that normal? It sounds a little scary. I'm happy to do it, I just… like to know what’s happening. I get a bit anxious sometimes.
DOCTOR: It measures the pressure inside your eye. Normal pressure… is good. Most people don’t even notice it. 14 in both eyes. Perfectly normal. Honestly, you’re wasting my time with this. It sounds like you're just sensitive to light. I would suggest getting a good pair of sunglasses. Polarized ones. And try to avoid bright sunlight as much as possible. That’s really all there is to it.
PATIENT: Oh. Just… sensitive to light? But it’s been getting worse, and the headaches… I thought maybe it was something else. And I am trying to avoid the sun, but… I work outside sometimes, you know? Landscaping. So, there’s nothing you can do? No test to figure out why I'm so sensitive?
DOCTOR: Look, it's not always about finding a why. Sometimes people are just more sensitive. It’s a common issue. I can prescribe you some artificial tears if you want, to help with any dryness. But honestly, spending an hour chasing a phantom problem… I have other patients who actually need my time. I'm not seeing any indication of anything serious here. We can refer you to an optometrist if you really want a second opinion, but I doubt they'll find anything different. Do you want the referral?
PATIENT: An optometrist… okay. I guess. If you think it’s best. It’s just… I was hoping for something more. Something to explain why this is happening, you know? And maybe something to help it, besides just wearing sunglasses. But if you’re sure there’s nothing else… then yes. A referral would be good. Thank you, Doctor. .
