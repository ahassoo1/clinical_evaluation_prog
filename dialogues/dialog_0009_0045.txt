DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… uh… I been getting real red in the face. A flushing, you know? Happens sometimes. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, “real red in the face,” a flushing sensation. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Okay. It comes and goes. Not all the time, you see. Sometimes after I eat. Not every time, but… often. And sometimes… when I get a little… worked up. Not angry, exactly. Just… thinking hard about things. It feels… warm. Like a hot flash, maybe? But just in my face. Not the whole body. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like it's connected to certain triggers – eating and when you're mentally engaged. You mentioned it feels warm – is it accompanied by any other sensations, like itching, burning, or tingling?
PATIENT: No, no itching or burning. Just… warm. And red. Very red. My wife… she used to say I looked like a tomato. She… she knew when I was stressed before I did, just from my face. It’s been… longer since it happened after eating, I think. Maybe a few weeks? But the thinking… that still does it sometimes. It's not painful, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it sounds like this has been going on for some time, and your wife was very observant. "Noticeable" is a good way to put it. When you say “thinking,” can you describe what kind of thoughts trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh. Just… worrying, you know? About things. Bills mostly. And… Just… life. Remembering things. It’s hard to explain. Not bad things, not scary things. Just… things I need to do. Or things that did happen. Thinking about the past sometimes does it. It's not like a panic, Doctor. Just… a flush. And red face. It goes away after a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so thinking about current worries like bills, or even reflecting on past events can bring on the flushing. And you emphasized it isn't a panic attack, just the flush itself. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Cooler air helps. If it’s real hot outside and I go inside to the air conditioning… it goes down quicker. And… when I’m busy. If I’m working on something, fixing something… I forget about it. So it doesn't happen as much then. That's about it, I think. I haven’t tried anything special to make it stop. Just… avoid hot weather, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good information – cooler air and being occupied seem to mitigate it. Avoiding hot weather is a reasonable strategy. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh… well. Not much, really. I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, knock on wood. I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And a bad back once, years ago. But nothing serious. No regular medicine, nothing like that. My wife… she was the one who went to the doctor all the time. I just… handled things around the house. She passed away last year. It’s… been quiet since then. I don’t… I don’t have a list of things, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you've been fortunate with your health, and I am very sorry for your loss. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t have a list of medical history readily available. We can piece things together. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure…? No, I don’t think so. She used to check mine sometimes, when I went with her to the doctor. And she said it was… okay. Normal, I think. Diabetes…? No. She didn't say anything about that. I eat a lot of rice, maybe. But not much sugar. She always made sure of that. She liked to cook. Mostly Indian food, you know? Good food. She would get upset if I ate too much sweets.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. So, no known diagnoses of high blood pressure or diabetes. And your wife kept a close watch on your diet, which is good. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never. And… no hospital except for… when I had the flu really bad once, years and years ago. Just a day, really. They gave me some medicine and sent me home. Nothing serious. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. She said I was too stubborn to get sick. She was always teasing me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or significant hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, pretty much. Sometimes a little bit of a stuffy nose in the spring, maybe. But nothing bad. Just a little sneeze. She used to say I was a machine. Could eat anything and never complain. She always took care of me. I never had to worry about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t take anything. Vitamins, supplements… no. I used to take a multivitamin sometimes, years ago. But I stopped. She always said I got all my vitamins from the food she cooked. She knew everything. I just… don’t need anything. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’re not currently taking any medications, vitamins or supplements. That’s helpful to know. To help me understand the flushing better, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, that’s… complicated. My parents are both gone now. And I don't know much about my grandparents. They lived in India, you see. We didn’t see them much. My brother… he lives in another state. He’s okay, I think. He has… some problems with his heart, maybe. But I’m not sure. We don’t talk much. She used to worry about it, about the family history. But I never really paid attention. I just… didn't ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It sounds like the family history isn't readily available, and that’s understandable. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of that. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. She didn't like smoking. And… I drink a little tea sometimes. That’s all. And… no, no drugs. Never. I just… don’t need any of that. I work around the house, you see. Keeps me busy. Keeps me out of trouble. She used to say I was a workaholic.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. You don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. That helps paint a clearer picture. Now, let's get back to the flushing itself. You mentioned it happens when you're thinking about things. Is it accompanied by any other symptoms, like sweating, rapid heartbeat, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no sweating or dizziness. And my heartbeat… feels normal, I think. It just… the face gets red. Warm. That's all. And it happens after a bit. Maybe ten or fifteen minutes. It just… fades away. Sometimes I don’t even notice it’s gone. She used to fan me with a magazine sometimes, when I was getting flushed. She worried a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the primary symptom is the facial flushing and warmth, without any accompanying symptoms like sweating, dizziness or rapid heartbeat. It resolves on its own after about 10-15 minutes. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your face. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. She always said you have to listen to the doctor. She was a smart woman. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your face. I do notice some mild redness in your cheeks and across your nose, but it’s not particularly pronounced at this moment. Your skin feels warm to the touch.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that bad, Doctor? The redness? Is it serious? She used to say I looked like a tomato when I got stressed. But… she was just teasing.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not necessarily "bad," Mr. Withycombe. The redness on its own isn’t automatically a cause for alarm. However, given your description of the flushing occurring with stress or thinking, and the fact that it’s been happening for some time, it's important to investigate a bit further. There are a few possibilities we should consider. One is something called rosacea, which can cause facial flushing, but it usually comes with other symptoms like small bumps or visible blood vessels. Another possibility is something related to your blood vessels reacting to stress. And, less commonly, it could be related to a hormone imbalance or other underlying condition. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. They'll help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Okay… if you think it’s necessary. She always said it’s better to be safe than sorry. But… are they expensive? I don’t have much money, Doctor. I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Withycombe. I understand that not having insurance can make things difficult. Let me explain the tests I'm thinking of. I'd like to do a complete blood count to check your overall health, a basic metabolic panel to look at your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid test to rule out any hormonal imbalances. I'll also check with the lab to see what the cost will be upfront, and we can discuss options if it's a financial burden. There are some programs that can help with lab costs for uninsured patients, and I can help you look into those. We can also prioritize the most essential tests first if that’s necessary. My priority is to figure out what's going on and find a way to help you feel better. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you checking the cost. And… helping me with it. She… she would have liked you. So, you think it’s not… serious? Just something to check?
DOCTOR: Yes, based on what you've told me, it's not likely to be anything immediately serious. It's more likely something we can manage with lifestyle adjustments or, if necessary, medication. But it's always best to rule out any underlying causes, just to be sure. I'll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the street, and you can go whenever it's convenient for you. They’ll need a photo ID and, if you have it, any previous lab results. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like dizziness, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you for being so kind. She always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And I agree – a good relationship with your doctor is very important. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll see you soon.
