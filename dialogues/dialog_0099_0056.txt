DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Schlatterer. Eighty-seven years young. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor… Overgaard, is it? Yes. It’s about the… the place where I work. It’s quite dreadful, frankly. A complete waste of time. All these… students. They haven't the slightest appreciation for a properly catalogued Dewey Decimal system. Honestly. I suppose you want details, but it’s all rather… blurry now. It’s just… stressful. Very stressful. I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: A… stressful workplace?
PATIENT: Yes! Stressful. Utterly. They expect… innovation. Innovation, can you imagine? In a library! It’s preposterous. And the noise! Always chattering. They don’t understand the sanctity of silence. It’s… it’s wearing me down. I used to have such… order. Everything in its place. Now… it’s chaos. I’ve been doing this for… well, a very long time. A long time. And this new generation… they simply don't care.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this… disruption at work is causing you distress. And it's impacting your… overall well-being?
PATIENT: Distress is putting it mildly, Doctor. It's… debilitating. I find myself… agitated. And I sleep poorly. Constantly thinking about misplaced volumes and improperly formatted citations. It’s a terrible burden. Honestly, I haven't felt this… unsettled in decades. I simply want to be left alone to… organize things. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: So agitation and trouble sleeping… and it seems this is directly related to changes at your workplace. Have you noticed any other symptoms, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, dear. Let me think… My appetite is… diminished. I used to enjoy a good plate of… something. Now, everything tastes rather… bland. And I've lost… patience. Terribly impatient with… incompetence. It’s a constant struggle, I assure you. I find myself… snapping at people. Not that they deserve anything less, mind you, but still. It’s unseemly.
DOCTOR: Diminished appetite, irritability… Any changes in your weight, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight? Heavens, I haven’t weighed myself in… well, a very long time. Probably lost some. I’m rather… slight, as you can see. Always have been, of course. But I suspect it's less than usual. It’s all this… worry. It simply drains one's vitality. I really wish they’d just let me manage the library. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Hmm… Now that you mention it… my hands tremble a bit. Always have, truthfully, a family trait. But it’s… worse lately. Especially when I’m dealing with… unruly patrons. And a persistent ache in my lower back. Probably from bending over all these… books. Honestly, it's a physical and mental strain. Is this taking too long? I have a rather pressing engagement this afternoon.
DOCTOR: No, no, we’re getting there. Tremors, lower back pain… Have you noticed any dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Occasionally, yes. A fleeting sensation. Nothing alarming. Probably just… low blood sugar. I haven't been eating properly, as I mentioned. Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I’m… explaining the complexities of the card catalogue system to someone who clearly isn’t listening. It’s rather exasperating, you see. It takes the air right out of one’s lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits, or any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor, are you quite serious? Really! Such… personal inquiries! I hardly think those details are relevant. I assure you, my… bodily functions are perfectly normal. I am a man of routine, you see. Always have been. And I certainly haven’t been experiencing any… chills or sweats. Though I may be a bit flushed from all this… questioning. Honestly, I think I’ve had enough. Is there anything else? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam, then. It'll give us a clearer picture. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh, dear. I haven’t had one of those in… decades. But very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, I am rather… sensitive. And I do dislike being prodded and poked. Please be gentle. And do hurry. I have a very important… indexing project waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. If you could just sit here. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90… slightly elevated. Pulse is 88, regular but a bit weak. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is a bit shallow, some mild crackling in the lower lobes… not alarming, but worth noting. Okay, now I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are diminished… and some slight tremor in the hands. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… and a few simple balance tests.
PATIENT: This is… rather undignified, Doctor. Honestly. I’m a scholar, not an acrobat! It’s all rather… unsettling. Are you finished yet? I feel quite faint. And please, be careful with that… hammer. It looks rather menacing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. That’s enough for now. You're exhibiting some signs of mild weakness, some slight tremor, and your breathing is a bit shallow. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Given your age and symptoms, and the fact that you've not had a check-up in decades, I recommend some further testing. I want to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a chest X-ray. We'll also need an EKG to assess your heart function. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’m also concerned about your agitation and sleep disturbance. It could be related to stress, but we need to rule out any other possibilities.
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… excessive. I simply want to be left alone to manage my library. But very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, I’m not a fan of needles. And I have a rather pressing engagement this afternoon. Can’t these tests be done quickly? And will they interfere with my indexing project?
DOCTOR: The tests are necessary to get a complete picture of your health, Mr. Schlatterer. They will take some time, unfortunately. The blood tests will take about an hour, and the chest X-ray will be another 30 minutes. I can arrange for you to have them done at the clinic lab. As for your indexing project… I understand your concerns, but your health is paramount. I can write you a note for work explaining that you are undergoing medical evaluation. Here are the requisitions for the tests. The lab technician will guide you through the process. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive assessment of your tremors and balance. I want to rule out any neurological issues. We’ll review the results next week, and discuss a treatment plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly, Doctor, this is quite… alarming. I simply want to be left alone to manage my library! But very well. If you insist. Though I must warn you, I’m not a fan of… specialists. And I have a rather pressing engagement this afternoon. I suppose I’ll have to reschedule my indexing project. This is all quite… disruptive. I suppose I should ask… will these tests be expensive? My insurance is… adequate, but I do have a limited budget. And will they require a follow-up appointment? I have a very busy schedule, you see. .
DOCTOR: The costs will depend on your insurance coverage, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll have the billing department contact you with an estimate. Yes, a follow-up appointment will be necessary to discuss the results and formulate a plan. We’ll schedule it for next week, and I’ll try to accommodate your schedule as best as possible. I understand your frustration, but I assure you, these tests are in your best interest. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you next week.
