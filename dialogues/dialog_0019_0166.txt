DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Tarin. Welcome in. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Renzi. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s… well, it’s been a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in the leg. I understand that can be unsettling. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I believe, about two weeks ago. It’s primarily in my left leg, from my thigh down to my foot. It doesn't feel like pain, exactly. More like… a lack of sensation. Like it’s… muffled. Sometimes it feels a bit cold too, even when it isn’t. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Two weeks, primarily in the left leg… muffled sensation and some coldness. Okay. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not always there. It seems to be worse when I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’m particularly focused on something – like when I’m working on a new animation project. Then I don’t even notice it until I sit down and realize my leg feels… off. It usually fades after a bit of resting, but it’s been happening more frequently lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to activity and concentration, and improves with rest. That gives us a little something to work with. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your leg?
PATIENT: Weakness… that’s a good question. I haven’t consciously felt weaker, no. But I do find myself shifting my weight more to my right leg after a while. It’s almost like I’m subconsciously avoiding putting too much pressure on the left one. I hadn’t really connected the two until you asked. I suppose that could be a sign of weakness. I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know – subconsciously shifting your weight. We'll definitely explore that. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you experienced any back pain recently?
PATIENT: Back pain… not really. I had a slight ache in my lower back about a month ago, but it was very mild and went away after a day or two. I just assumed I slept in a funny position. It wasn’t anything debilitating, or even particularly memorable, honestly. Would that be connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: It could be, yes. Sometimes issues in the back can refer pain or sensations down the leg. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions – anything you've been diagnosed with or are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing diagnosed, and I haven't been treated for anything, thankfully. I generally feel quite healthy. I try to eat well, and I stay active, even if a lot of my work involves sitting at a computer. I do get regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and my last one was about six months ago. They didn’t mention anything concerning. I have private insurance, so I am diligent about those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Staying active and diligent with check-ups is excellent. And no family history of neurological issues that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. My mother’s side has a bit of a history with diabetes, but I don’t have that. And my father’s side… mostly just good, sturdy Yupik folk who lived long lives outdoors. No reports of nerve problems, or anything like that, to my knowledge. We don't keep incredibly detailed medical records, if that makes sense. It's more of an oral tradition. But as far as I've heard, there hasn't been anything like this in the family.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Oral tradition is perfectly valid. Alright, Tarin, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, please. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in both legs. We’ll start with your reflexes… could you just let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you go. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm quite tall, so sometimes things are a bit… awkward.
DOCTOR: Okay… reflexes are a little diminished on the left side, but not dramatically so. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hands with your legs. Just like you’re trying to resist my strength. First the left leg… go ahead when you’re ready. Strength is… slightly reduced on the left, as you mentioned, but again, not significantly. Now for sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs with this. Tell me when you feel it, and where you feel it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I'll do my best to be precise.
DOCTOR: Okay… sensation is diminished in the outer aspect of your left lower leg and foot, especially around the top of the foot. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. That’s… interesting. It feels a bit… muted, like you said. It’s not completely gone, but it’s definitely less pronounced on the left side. I notice it most when you touch the top of my foot, you’re right. And it sort of… fades away a bit as you go further down. It’s hard to explain. It's not a sharp difference, just… less there.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Diminished sensation, more pronounced on the outer aspect of the lower leg and foot. Okay. Now, just one more thing. Could you stand up for me, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here you go. I'll try to walk naturally. Let me know if you see anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay… I notice a slight hesitation on the left side, and you are shifting your weight a little more to your right, as you mentioned earlier. It's not dramatic, but it's there. Alright, Tarin. Thank you. You can sit back down. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you may have some mild peripheral neuropathy affecting your left leg. It's not severe, but it's something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… I've heard of that term, but I don't really know what it entails. Is it… serious? And what would cause something like that? Is it related to my work, perhaps? I spend a lot of time sitting at a computer, and I do occasionally get quite absorbed in what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Peripheral neuropathy simply means damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause a range of symptoms, like numbness, tingling, weakness, and pain, as you've been experiencing. In your case, it seems to be mild, and it's primarily affecting the nerves in your left leg. It’s not immediately cause for alarm, but it’s important to figure out the cause. There are several potential causes. Diabetes is a common one, but you said you don't have that. Other possibilities include vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, infections, and sometimes, even just compression of the nerves. In rarer cases, it can be caused by autoimmune diseases. And yes, your work could be a contributing factor. Prolonged sitting and repetitive movements can sometimes compress nerves, or lead to inflammation. But we need to rule out other causes first. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, rule out any underlying infections, and assess your kidney function. We may also consider an electromyography study, which can help us assess the function of the nerves in your legs more precisely. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate that. Blood tests and an EMG study, yes, I'm comfortable with that. I'd rather be sure, and understand what's going on. I'm not particularly fond of needles, but I can manage. And what does an EMG study involve? I've never had one before.
DOCTOR: That’s a good attitude. It's always best to be proactive. An EMG study is a painless procedure, though it can feel a little strange. It involves inserting a small needle into your leg muscles to measure their electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt, but you might feel a slight tingling sensation. It takes about 30-45 minutes. We'll have a technician perform the study, and they’ll explain everything in detail before they start. I’ll write you a referral for the blood tests and the EMG study. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting if possible. Take frequent breaks to stretch your legs, and try to stay active. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with any discomfort, if needed. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. You've been very helpful, Doctor Renzi. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything so clearly, and for not dismissing my concerns. I'll schedule the tests as soon as possible. Is there anything I should specifically mention to the technician when I get the EMG study done? Perhaps a history of… slight discomfort in my left leg? Or is it just a standard procedure?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. It's always best to address concerns promptly. Yes, definitely mention to the technician that you've been experiencing some numbness and slight discomfort in your left leg. And let them know you spend a lot of time sitting. That will help them focus their attention on the relevant areas. It's a standard procedure, but any additional information you can provide will be helpful. I’ll also send the lab a note with my initial assessment. I'll give you a call once I have the results of the tests. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any work restrictions that need to be documented?
PATIENT: No, no work restrictions needed at this time, thankfully. I can adjust my schedule to accommodate the discomfort, and my employer is generally quite understanding. I mostly just want to get to the bottom of this, and make sure it doesn't become a larger issue. I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Renzi. I appreciate your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. That’s a smart approach, and I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
