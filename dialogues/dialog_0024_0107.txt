DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me – and try to be concise – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but when it does, it’s… fast. Real fast. I think it's called… fluttering? My wife, she told me to come. She worried.
DOCTOR: “Fluttering,” you say. Yes, that’s a… common description. How long has this been occurring, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three months now? It started small. Just a few times a week. Now… maybe every other day? Sometimes more if I… work hard. At the plant, you know? Lifting things, being hot. It’s worse then. Not always, but often.
DOCTOR: “Work hard,” alright. And when this “fluttering” occurs, how long does each episode last?
PATIENT: Not long. Maybe… a few seconds? Sometimes a minute. It just… starts, then stops. It's not pain, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable. Like a bird inside my chest, trying to get out. My wife, she says I look white when it happens. I don't really remember, to be honest. It’s over quick.
DOCTOR: A minute is… significant. Do you experience any other symptoms with this “fluttering”?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel… a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… light. And… maybe a little short of breath. Not bad, like I can't breathe, just… I have to take a bigger breath. It all happens at the same time, I think. When the heart flaps, and I feel light, and I breathe more. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: “Important” is relative, Mr. Puder. Let’s move on. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing much. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree. But that was a long time ago. And… I have bad allergies, sometimes. Hay fever, mostly. But nothing… serious. My wife, she goes to the doctor a lot for her blood pressure, but me? I usually just stay healthy. I work hard, I eat good food. Not much trouble, usually.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I take something for my allergies. A little pill. But I don't take it every day. Only when the pollen is real bad. My wife, she has pills for her blood pressure, but not me. I don’t like taking pills, if I can help it. They make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Relax… yes, I can do that. It’s just… this heart thing makes me a little nervous, you know? I don't want it to stop beating.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is… somewhat elevated, even at rest. I hear a regular rhythm, but it's a bit fast. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/85. Now, I'm going to palpate your pulse. Regular, but quick. Do you smoke, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't like smoking. My wife, she used to, but she stopped a long time ago. It's bad for your health, you know? And… it smells bad. I like clean air. Always have. I work outside sometimes, at the plant. Good air is important. Is something wrong? Is my heart bad?
DOCTOR: “Bad” is a strong word, Mr. Puder. Your symptoms, combined with these findings, suggest a possible arrhythmia – an irregular heartbeat. However, it's premature to make any definitive diagnosis without further investigation. I am going to order an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to record your heart's electrical activity. And a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying issues. I will also need to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had heart problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father, he died when I was young. From… something with his stomach, I think. Not his heart. My mother, she's still alive, but she's old. She has some aches and pains, but no heart trouble that I know of. My grandfather… he was strong. Worked in the fields all his life. Never sick, as far as I know. But that was a long time ago. Nobody talked much about sickness, back then. I don’t really know, Doctor. We didn't have doctors much, where I come from.
DOCTOR: Alright. The ECG and blood work will give us a clearer picture. I'm also noting your limited family history. Now, do you consume caffeine or alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Caffeine… sometimes. I drink tea, you know? Maybe two cups a day. Not strong tea, just… regular tea. And alcohol… not much. Sometimes a little beer with my dinner. Maybe one or two. Not every day, Doctor. Maybe on the weekend. I don't drink much. My wife, she likes a little wine, but me? I like tea better. It’s… calmer. Is that important, Doctor? Is tea bad for my heart?
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially important, Mr. Puder. We are gathering information. I am ordering the tests now. The lab is just down the hall. After the tests, return here and we will discuss the results. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Just… Will I be okay? Is it something serious? You said… irregular heartbeat. That sounds scary. I need to work, you know? I have a family. I need to be strong.
DOCTOR: It is too early to determine the severity, Mr. Puder. That’s why we’re conducting these tests. Worrying will not help. Go to the lab, have your blood drawn, and return here. We will discuss the results then. Please. The lab technician is expecting you.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will go to the lab. Thank you. .
