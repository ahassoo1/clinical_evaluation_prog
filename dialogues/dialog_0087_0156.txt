DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not great. I've been having a lot of diarrhea. It's been going on for a while now, and it's just… annoying, really. I can't really remember exactly when it started, but definitely more than a few weeks. I think? It's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea for more than a few weeks. I understand. And you said it’s been…annoying?
PATIENT: Yeah, annoying is a good way to put it. It’s just… inconvenient. And it makes me really tired. I have to keep running to the bathroom, and it's hard to get anything done. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s not… painful, exactly, just really disruptive. I feel kind of weak, too.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Nahrwold. Disruptive and tiring symptoms are very concerning. Weakness as well. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It’s… watery, obviously. And… frequent. Like, a lot. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, sometimes it's… more. The color is usually… normal, I think? Maybe a little lighter sometimes. I don't know. I don’t really look at it, if that makes sense. I just… go. I'm sorry, this is gross. I feel bad talking about this.
DOCTOR: You shouldn’t feel bad at all, Ms. Nahrwold. This is what I’m here for, and it's important information. It sounds like you're experiencing frequent, watery stools. No blood in the stool, correct?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no blood. Definitely not. I… I think so, anyway. I don't remember ever seeing any. I'm really bad at remembering things like that. It just… happens, and then I'm trying to get it over with. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the stool. And you mentioned fatigue. Has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty constant, I think. I just feel… sluggish all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling tired. It’s hard to get motivated to do anything, even things I usually enjoy. My husband keeps telling me I look pale, too. I don't know if that's related, though. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Husband noticing paleness is a good observation. Fatigue and constant tiredness… Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a little bit… nauseous sometimes, but not enough to actually throw up. And… my stomach feels bloated a lot. Like, really uncomfortable and full of gas. I've been trying to eat smaller meals, but it doesn’t really seem to help. And… I think I've lost a little bit of weight, but I haven't weighed myself recently. It's just… my clothes feel a little looser. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It all makes sense, Ms. Nahrwold, and is helpful information. Bloating, nausea without vomiting, and potential weight loss… Let's go over some of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I think I have something with my stomach. Something about… inflammation? The doctor told me a long time ago, after I kept having problems. I think it's called… IBD? Or maybe Crohn's? It’s hard to remember the exact name. And… I think they said something about being sensitive to certain foods. Like, gluten, maybe? My husband does most of the doctor stuff, so I don’t always pay attention. I'm sorry. I should probably know this better.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Nahrwold. It’s perfectly alright. Having a diagnosis of IBD or Crohn's disease, and potential food sensitivities is very important information. Let me pull up your records now to confirm this. One moment, please.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s just… it's been on and off for years, this stomach thing. Sometimes it's okay for a while, and then it flares up. I guess this is just another flare-up. But it’s been going on longer this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with Crohn’s disease approximately four years ago. You’ve had previous flare-ups managed by gastroenterology. Your last appointment with them was approximately one year ago. You do have a documented sensitivity to gluten, and it's noted that you follow a modified gluten-free diet. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your Crohn’s disease?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I was taking something… a pill? But I think I stopped a while ago. My doctor said I could try going off it to see if I felt better without it. And… I haven’t been back to the gastroenterologist since then, so I guess I’m not taking anything regularly now. I just try to avoid foods that bother me. It's all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, currently off all Crohn’s disease medications, following a modified gluten-free diet. And no recent follow-up with gastroenterology. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything that I can remember. My husband always checks the ingredients before I eat something new, just in case. He's very careful. He worries a lot, but I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. My husband, he used to, but he quit a long time ago. He says it was the best thing he ever did. It smelled terrible, anyway.
DOCTOR: Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only occasionally. Like, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on the weekends. I don’t drink very often. It doesn't really agree with me, honestly. It makes my stomach feel worse.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had something with her stomach, too. I think it was… colitis? Or maybe Crohn's? It's hard to remember the details. And my father has high blood pressure, but that's about it. It's not a very healthy family, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of gastrointestinal issues and hypertension. Thank you. Now, Ms. Nahrwold, I'd like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking for tenderness, and taking your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better, you know? Hopefully, you can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem slightly hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit there. It’s not painful exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. It feels kind of… achy. Like a dull pressure. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant. No masses detected, and no guarding. Sounds are normal throughout. Your blood pressure is 128/82, and your pulse is 88. Within normal limits. Lungs are clear, heart sounds are regular. Now, based on your history and physical examination, it does seem likely that this is a flare-up of your Crohn's disease, although we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work and a stool sample to get a better understanding of what's going on. The blood work will check for inflammation, infection, and anemia. The stool sample will look for any bacteria or parasites. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Anything to figure out what's happening. I just want this to be over with. Blood work and a stool sample… okay. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens after that? Will I need to see a specialist again?
DOCTOR: The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I'll review them thoroughly and contact you to discuss the next steps. It's likely we'll need to consult with your gastroenterologist, yes. They are the experts in managing Crohn’s disease and can adjust your medication if necessary. I'll send them a copy of the lab results and my findings. Depending on the results, they may recommend further testing, such as a colonoscopy. I’ll also provide you with some dietary recommendations in the meantime to help manage your symptoms. A low-fiber diet and staying well-hydrated are good starting points. I can also recommend a registered dietitian who specializes in IBD if you're interested. Would you like that information?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. A dietitian sounds really helpful. I feel like I’m always messing up my diet, eating something I shouldn’t. Dietary recommendations, dietitian… okay. And you said 2-3 business days for the results? So I should just wait for you to call me? I don't need to do anything else right now?
DOCTOR: That’s correct. Just wait for me to call with the results, typically within 2-3 business days. The lab will contact me directly with the results. You don’t need to do anything further at this time, aside from trying to stick to a low-fiber diet and stay hydrated. I'll also have the nurse provide you with a requisition form for the stool sample and directions on how to collect it. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. Nahrwold?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything really well. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. I've felt like I haven't been able to explain it properly to other doctors before. It's nice to feel like someone is actually hearing me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Nahrwold. I'm glad I could help. It's my job to listen and provide you with the best possible care. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. I wish you a good day.
