DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is mine. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s… well, it’s concerning enough that I thought I should get it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a little tingling in the right one too.
DOCTOR: Numbness in the left leg, with occasional tingling in the right. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, about three weeks ago. It wasn’t constant at first, just a fleeting sensation here and there. But it’s become more frequent over the last week, and now it’s pretty consistent most days. I'd say it's been a solid week of feeling it regularly.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, progressing over the last week. Consistent most days now. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t a sharp pain, not exactly. It's more like… a loss of feeling. Like my leg is… distant. Sometimes it feels cold, even when it isn’t. And occasionally, like I mentioned, just a sort of prickling sensation. It’s hard to explain. It doesn't really hurt, just… isn’t quite there. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: A loss of feeling, a “distant” sensation, sometimes cold, occasional prickling. Not painful, but a lack of sensation. Yes, that’s helpful. Is the numbness isolated to the leg itself, or does it extend anywhere else – your foot, your hip, your back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Mostly it’s the leg, Doctor. From about the thigh down, I’d say. Though, now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a slight ache in my lower back, on the left side. It’s not constant, and it's easily dismissed as just… being tired from work, I suppose. But I do notice it more on days when the leg numbness is particularly bad. I hadn’t consciously connected the two until you asked.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Lower back ache, correlating with the leg symptoms. We’ll need to explore that further. Now, Mr. Kinjerski, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Of course. I’m a special effects artist and animator. It's a fairly physical job, actually. A lot of time spent standing, moving equipment, setting up shots… occasionally lifting heavier things. I do a mix of practical effects – building sets and props – and digital animation, so it’s not always physically demanding, but a good portion of it is. I'm often on my feet for ten or twelve hours a day.
DOCTOR: Ten to twelve hours on your feet, physical work… that could certainly be a contributing factor. Do you recall any specific incident that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… not a single incident, no. But about a month ago – so right before this started – I was helping move a rather large piece of equipment – a camera rig, quite heavy. I didn't think much of it at the time, just a bit of a strain, but it did require a lot of effort. I did feel a twinge in my back then, now that I recall it, but it went away fairly quickly. It wasn't anything debilitating, or even particularly painful, just… a muscle ache. I figured it was just from overexertion. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: Possibly. A strain a month ago, followed by this… We must consider all possibilities, of course. Now, Mr. Kinjerski, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I've always been fairly healthy. I don't take any regular medications, and I haven’t had any serious illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant. My family doesn't have a strong history of neurological issues, as far as I'm aware. I do have private insurance, so I've had regular check-ups, but nothing major has ever been flagged.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history, no medications, regular check-ups… satisfactory. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: None that I know of. I haven't ever had a reaction to any food, medication, or insect bites. I can eat pretty much anything without issue, and I've never had any skin rashes or breathing difficulties after being exposed to anything unusual. My mother always said I was remarkably resilient, and I suppose that's held true so far.
DOCTOR: No allergies, remarkable resilience… very good. Now, Mr. Kinjerski, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll need to assess your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to do whatever you need to help figure out what’s going on. Just let me know what I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just lie down on the table, please. We’ll start with your reflexes. Please relax, and let your legs go limp. I will be tapping specific points on your knees and ankles. Alright… Patellar reflex on the right is 2+, normal. Patellar reflex on the left is also 2+, normal. Achilles reflex on the right… 2+. Achilles reflex on the left… 2+. Good. Now, let's assess your strength. Can you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm lying down. That's no problem at all. And yes, I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that enough? Let me know if you need me to squeeze harder. I'm trying to give you a good, firm grip.
DOCTOR: Good, good. 5/5 on both sides. Strength is adequate. Now, I’m going to test your leg strength. Could you please point your toes and pull your feet up towards your shins?
PATIENT: Okay, I’m pointing my toes, and now pulling my feet up as high as I can. I’m trying to do it nice and slowly and deliberately. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything or if you want me to repeat it.
DOCTOR: 5/5 bilaterally. Adequate strength there as well. Now, we'll assess sensation. I’m going to lightly touch different areas of your legs with this cotton ball. Please tell me when you feel it, and where you feel it. Close your eyes, please. Can you feel this on your outer thigh?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. Right there… on the outer side of my thigh. It feels… normal, I suppose. Just a light touch. It’s not painful, and it’s not numb. It feels like a normal sensation.
DOCTOR: And how about here… on the inner thigh?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. Same as the other one – a light touch. I can definitely feel it on the inner thigh. No difference in sensation between that and the other side, as far as I can tell. It feels… regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, let's check the lower back. I’m going to palpate your spine and the surrounding muscles. Please tell me if you experience any tenderness. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit. Right there… where you’re pressing. It's not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It’s the same area I mentioned earlier, where I sometimes feel a little discomfort. It's not excruciating, but it's definitely tender to the touch. It's a bit more noticeable when you apply pressure like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this brief examination, Mr. Kinjerski, I don't find any gross neurological deficits – your reflexes and strength are normal. However, you do report some tenderness in your lower back, and you describe a loss of sensation in your leg, which, while not complete, is concerning. Given your work history and the timeline of your symptoms, it’s possible this is related to a muscle strain or nerve irritation. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine – to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. An MRI sounds like a good idea. I’d like to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. If that's what you recommend, then absolutely, I’m happy to go ahead with it. Will you be handling the scheduling, or should I contact someone?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, I’ll go ahead and submit the order for the MRI. My staff will contact you shortly to schedule an appointment at the imaging center. They’ll also need to verify your insurance information. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your symptoms. I'll also recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, lifting, or prolonged standing as much as possible. Here are your prescriptions. Please take them as directed. We'll review the MRI results once they’re available and discuss the next steps at that time. Do you have any questions for me before you leave, Mr. Kinjerski?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you very much. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running these tests. No, I don’t think I have any immediate questions right now. I think I understand everything you’ve explained. I'll be sure to follow your instructions regarding the medication and activity restrictions. I’ll wait for my staff to contact me about the MRI. Thank you again, Doctor Eaddy. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns before your MRI appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results. .
