DOCTOR: Right. Tasmia Dudney, 26 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t even know why I’m here. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Your husband called about elevated blood pressure readings…Yes, well. I see. And you don’t feel you have any particular concerns yourself?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I work, I take care of the house, I don’t sit around feeling sorry for myself. It’s probably just stress from…everything. He reads things online, you know? Always finding something new to worry about.
DOCTOR: “Everything?
PATIENT: Just…life. Work’s busy. The kids are…kids. It’s nothing a little rest wouldn’t fix, probably. Honestly, I don’t have time for this. Can we just get a prescription or something and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Well, simply dismissing it as “stress” isn’t…ideal. We need to understand the readings. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with hypertension before?
PATIENT: No! Never. This is a new thing. He bought one of those machines for home, and now he's obsessed. Numbers go up, he panics. It’s ridiculous. I don't feel sick, so I don't have anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And what are these numbers, specifically?
PATIENT: He's got it written down somewhere. Ugh. Hold on… Okay, here. It says…145 over 92. And then a few days later, 150 over 95. Something like that. He kept bothering me about it, so I stopped paying attention. It was always high, apparently.
DOCTOR: Those are elevated. We really should take a more thorough history. Do you have any family history of heart disease, kidney problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: My grandpa, on my mom's side, he had…something with his heart. He wasn't very healthy. Smoked too much. That's about it, I think. Everyone else is fine. Look, is this going to take long? I have things to do. Honestly, I don’t understand why we need to know all this. A number is a number.
DOCTOR: It’s not just a number, Ms. Dudney. It indicates a potential problem. And family history is relevant. Alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had them. I’m perfectly healthy, I told you. I eat whatever, I don’t react to anything. Are we done yet? I’m starting to feel like I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: We are not “done yet.” Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No! Just a multivitamin. My husband thinks I don't get enough nutrients. He worries about everything. Look, this is getting silly. I came here because he made me. Can we please just get this over with? I really don't have time for a long conversation about my husband's anxieties.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s at least do a quick physical exam. Blood pressure, heart rate, lungs…standard things. Please sit back and relax. Though, I suspect relaxing will be difficult for someone.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Don’t expect me to be grateful. I have better things to do than sit here listening to you tell me I'm perfectly fine, but need to worry about numbers. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: 152 over 98. As expected. Heart rate is…slightly elevated. Normal rhythm. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft. Alright. Now, I'm going to order some basic blood work and a urinalysis. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Rule what out? Look, is something actually wrong with me? Because if it's nothing, I'm not spending money on tests just to satisfy my husband. This is ridiculous. Honestly, I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration. But elevated blood pressure is not something to dismiss. The tests will help determine if there's an underlying cause or if it's simply stress-related – which we still need to address, even if it is stress. We need to know if your kidneys are functioning properly, check your cholesterol, and rule out other possibilities. It's for your health. Now, I'll have the nurse draw the blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I want you to try and get some rest. And please, try to monitor your blood pressure at home, but don't obsess over it. We'll discuss the results when they come back. .
