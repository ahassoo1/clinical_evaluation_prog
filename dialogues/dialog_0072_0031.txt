DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kreckel. I’m Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, my left leg… it’s gotten quite swollen. And I’ve been told before I have a… a funny heartbeat sometimes. It’s not new, but the leg is worse now.
DOCTOR: I see. Swelling in the left leg, and you’ve been told about an irregular heartbeat previously. Can you describe the swelling for me?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle is puffy too. It feels… tight. Not painful exactly, just… uncomfortable. And heavier than my other leg, naturally. It started a few days ago, but it's gotten bigger each day.
DOCTOR: Okay, calf and ankle swelling, tightness, and heavier than the other leg. And it’s progressively worsening over the past few days. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the touch in that leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven't really looked closely, if I'm honest. I can feel it's warmer, maybe? But it’s summer, so… I don't know if that's normal. Would it be very obvious if it was red, Doctor? I haven’t noticed anything bright.
DOCTOR: It can be subtle. We’ll take a look in a moment. And you mentioned a funny heartbeat – can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes it feels like it's… skipping a beat, or going too fast. It doesn’t happen all the time, just now and then. And it doesn't last long, usually. It’s… unsettling, more than anything. I've not been properly checked for it, only told it feels wrong. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. And it's good you're bringing this to my attention now, especially with the leg swelling. Before we proceed, can you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: I... honestly, I don’t have much. Just the usual childhood things, I suppose. Nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalised, if that helps. And… no, I don’t take any medication regularly. I try to stay healthy. Would you like a list of my immunisations? I have a little booklet.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Immunisations aren’t immediately relevant, but if you feel strongly, yes, we can glance at them later. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any heart problems, blood clots, or significant swelling issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Family history. My… my grandfather on my mother’s side, he had a weak heart, I think. He was very old when he passed. And… my aunt, she had a blood clot in her leg once, a long time ago, after an operation. She recovered, thankfully. Does that matter, the operation part? I barely knew her.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does matter. Both the heart condition and the history of a blood clot are pertinent. And, just to complete the picture, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m a computer science teacher, so I spend a lot of time sitting. I try to walk when I can, but it's not as much as I’d like. I eat… reasonably well, I think. Not many takeaways. And I don't smoke. I don't drink very much alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Does that sound alright? I'm not very active, if I'm being truthful.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you don’t smoke and limit your alcohol intake. The sedentary lifestyle is… concerning given your symptoms and family history. Now, before we move onto a physical examination, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never knowingly had an allergic reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things, and used all sorts of cleaning products… nothing has ever bothered me. I think I’d know if I was allergic, wouldn’t I? Is there anything in particular I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: Most people would. Alright. Let’s have a look at your leg. Please lie down on the examination table, and we'll start with a basic assessment.
PATIENT: Right, very well. I hope this won’t take long. I get a bit nervous with doctors, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Let’s start with a visual assessment. As I suspected, there is some noticeable edema – swelling – in your left calf and ankle. And, yes, the skin does feel slightly warmer to the touch compared to your right leg. I'm also noting some tenderness when I palpate here, along the calf muscle. Is that consistent with what you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly where it’s uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… tender, as you say. It’s a bit better if I move it around, but it’s definitely there when you press. And it does feel… tighter than my other leg, like something is squeezed.
DOCTOR: Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your left leg compared to your right. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are… irregular. I’m hearing some arrhythmias – an irregular heartbeat – as you described. And your lungs are clear. Alright. Based on my initial assessment, there are a few possibilities here. Your symptoms and family history are concerning. We need to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: Oh. Rule out things? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I thought it was just a swollen leg. What sort of things do you need to rule out? And what will that involve?
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Ms. Kreckel. A swollen leg can be a sign of several issues. The most concerning possibilities are deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot in a deep vein – or a pulmonary embolism – a blood clot that has travelled to your lungs. However, it could also be something less serious, like cellulitis or a muscle strain. To rule these out, we need to order some blood work to check for clotting factors and inflammation. And we'll need an ultrasound of your leg to look for any evidence of a blood clot. I'm going to order those tests now. Do you have any known issues with blood tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood clots… that sounds very frightening. I've never had blood tests before, not that I recall. I think I might be a little… faint. I usually don't like needles. But… I understand it needs to be done. Is the ultrasound… painful? And how long will all of this take? And will I need to be admitted to hospital?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Kreckel. The blood tests are fairly routine. It will be a small amount of blood drawn from your arm. As for the ultrasound, it is non-invasive. A technician will simply apply a gel to your leg and use a wand to create images of the veins. It shouldn't be painful, although you may feel some pressure. We will start with the blood tests and ultrasound. We'll review the results as soon as they are available. If the results are concerning, we may need to consider further investigation, such as a CT scan. In that case, you may need to be admitted to the hospital for closer monitoring. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and ultrasound now. Do you have any questions before I do so?
PATIENT: One step at a time… yes, that sounds better. A CT scan… that sounds… complicated. Is it very expensive? I don’t have insurance, I’m afraid. And… will the results be sent directly to you, or will I have to arrange it myself? And… is it alright if I bring someone with me when I get the results? I think I’d feel better with another person there.
DOCTOR: The cost is a concern, I understand. I will write a note to the lab and imaging centre requesting that they provide you with a detailed breakdown of the costs before any procedures are performed. You can then decide if you want to proceed. Regarding the results, both the lab and imaging centre will send the results directly to my office. And yes, absolutely, you are welcome – and encouraged – to bring someone with you when you receive the results. It's always helpful to have support. Here is the referral form. It contains the contact information for the lab and imaging centre. Please schedule the tests as soon as possible. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased pain, swelling, shortness of breath, or chest pain – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, even though it's a bit frightening. I’ll schedule the tests as soon as I can. And I’ll bring someone with me for the results. I suppose… I’ll see you again soon. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Kreckel. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And as I said, seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen. I will expect to hear from you regarding the test results. Goodbye.
