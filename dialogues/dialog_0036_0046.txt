DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Bacy. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been having some… well, pressure in my bladder. It’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It’s not painful, not usually. More like a constant feeling of needing to go, even when I’ve just gone. It’s… distracting, I suppose. And sometimes, especially at night, it feels like I can’t quite empty my bladder completely. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant urge and incomplete emptying. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around six months ago, maybe a little less? It wasn’t constant at first, just now and then. But in the last month or so, it’s become much more frequent. I’d say almost every day now.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, worsening over the last month. And is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I've noticed it seems a bit worse when I drink caffeine, definitely. And if I get really busy and forget to drink enough water throughout the day, it feels more uncomfortable. I haven’t really found anything that consistently helps, to be honest. Just trying to stay on top of my water intake.
DOCTOR: Alright. Caffeine and dehydration seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, or any blood in it?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. The color seems normal, no unusual smell, and definitely no blood. I’ve been paying attention to that, just in case. It's just the constant pressure and feeling like I don’t empty everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes to your urine itself. And have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and no back pain. It really is just this bladder discomfort. It hasn’t been affecting my overall health, just… annoying and a little worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay. No systemic symptoms, that's good. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had any bladder infections, kidney problems, or other urinary issues in the past?
PATIENT: I had one bladder infection when I was in college, I think. It was quite a while ago, maybe fifteen years? I needed antibiotics for it, and I haven't had one since. Other than that, no, no kidney problems or anything like that. My doctor always said my routine check-ups looked good. I have Medicare, so I get those done regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, one bladder infection fifteen years ago, otherwise no known urinary issues. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not currently taking any medications. I try to avoid them if I can, honestly. Just a daily multivitamin, nothing else. And I don't really take any supplements regularly. Just… sometimes vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications or supplements. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My husband always checks when we go to restaurants, just to be safe, but I’ve never had an issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And lastly, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandmother on my father’s side had diabetes. Aside from that, nothing really stands out. No history of kidney problems or urinary issues that I’m aware of, on either side of the family. We don't have a very extensive medical history, to be honest. Mostly just the usual things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hypertension in your mother and diabetes in your grandmother. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Marialena. It sounds like we've covered a lot of ground. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I want to figure this out, and I trust your judgment, Dr. Bacy.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, I’d like you to lie down on the table. I'll start by listening to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick palpation – just feeling for any tenderness. Then, I’ll likely need a urine sample to check for infection. It's a standard procedure. I’ll start with listening to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Normal bowel sounds. No masses palpated. Mild tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region, but no guarding. Okay. Now, if you could provide a urine sample, that would be very helpful. There’s a collection cup in the restroom. I'll give you a few minutes to do that, then we can discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Just a little tenderness, you said? I'll go ahead and get a urine sample for you then. Is there anything specific I need to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a mild tenderness. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything, but it’s good to document. Just a clean catch – start urinating, then collect the mid-stream sample in the cup. Try to avoid getting any skin cells in the sample. And please wash your hands thoroughly afterwards. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. Clean catch, mid-stream, avoid skin cells. I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, I'm going to send this off to the lab for a urinalysis. That will help us rule out an infection and check for other abnormalities. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. In the meantime, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing some symptoms of an overactive bladder, or possibly interstitial cystitis. However, we need the lab results to be sure. Have you ever experienced any pain in your pelvis, lower back, or abdomen that isn’t related to your bladder symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, the discomfort has been mostly focused on the bladder itself—that feeling of needing to go, and not emptying completely. No pain in my pelvis or lower back. I haven't had any pain at all, honestly, just that… constant awareness of my bladder. It’s good to know you're thinking about overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis. I’ve heard of overactive bladder, but I don’t know much about either condition. Are they common?
DOCTOR: They are fairly common, yes. Overactive bladder affects millions of people, and interstitial cystitis, while less common, is also something we see relatively frequently. Overactive bladder typically causes a frequent and urgent need to urinate, often accompanied by involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. Interstitial cystitis, on the other hand, is a chronic bladder condition that causes pain and discomfort in the bladder and pelvic region, along with frequent urination. The cause of both conditions is not always clear. While we wait for the lab results, I want to ask you a few more questions. Have you noticed any patterns to your symptoms?
PATIENT: That's helpful to know. No, I haven’t really noticed any specific patterns, but now that you mention it… maybe it is a little worse when I'm stressed. I work as a graphic designer, and deadlines can be… intense. It’s not a direct correlation, but I’ve definitely noticed myself needing to go more when I’m feeling anxious about a project. And I think… sometimes after I eat something spicy? It’s hard to say for sure, but it feels like it irritates things a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Stress and spicy foods are both known bladder irritants. Okay, so stress and spicy foods as potential triggers. Ah, good. Let’s take a look. Okay, the urinalysis came back negative for infection. No blood in the urine, and the pH is normal. The only slightly abnormal finding is a small amount of epithelial cells, which is not uncommon and doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Based on these results, and your symptoms, it's most likely that you’re experiencing an overactive bladder. However, given that your symptoms have been worsening over the last month, I think it would be prudent to start with a trial of conservative management before making a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable to me. No infection, that’s good to know. I’m happy to try conservative management first before jumping to anything more… involved. What does that entail, exactly? What would I be doing?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Conservative management involves several lifestyle modifications and bladder training techniques. First, we'll focus on fluid intake. You should aim for about 6-8 glasses of water a day, but try to avoid drinking large amounts of fluid all at once. Spread it out throughout the day. Second, we'll avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. You've already noticed some triggers, which is a good start. Third, we’ll try timed voiding. That means going to the bathroom on a regular schedule, even if you don’t feel the urge. We can start with every 2-3 hours and gradually increase the interval as your bladder control improves. Fourth, we’ll work on pelvic floor muscle exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises help strengthen the muscles that support your bladder and can improve your ability to control urination. I can give you some handouts with detailed instructions for these exercises, and I can also refer you to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: That all sounds very manageable, and very sensible. Avoiding caffeine and spicy foods won’t be too difficult. Timed voiding and the pelvic floor exercises… I can definitely give those a try. Yes, I think a referral to a physical therapist would be wonderful. Having someone to guide me through the exercises properly would be very helpful. And the handouts would be great too, so I can remind myself of everything. Thank you, Dr. Bacy. I feel much better already just knowing what’s going on and having a plan of action.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Okay, I’ve sent the referral to a local physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m also printing out some handouts with detailed instructions for timed voiding and Kegel exercises. Here you go. These handouts have everything you need to get started. I’d like to see you back in about 4-6 weeks to see how you’re doing with the conservative management. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they worsen, we can discuss other treatment options, such as medication. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Dr. Bacy. I really appreciate your time and patience. I'll get started on the exercises and the lifestyle changes, and I’ll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
