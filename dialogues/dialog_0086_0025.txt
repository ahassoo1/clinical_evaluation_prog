DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I want to know more about where my family come from, long time ago. I hear you can do tests, with spit, to find out? My mama, she always talk stories, but… stories get lost, you know? I want to know for sure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I am a doctor, Mr. Scobie, and while I appreciate your… family history interest, genetic ancestry testing isn’t typically within the scope of a routine internal medicine visit. We focus on your health here. However… there are companies that offer those kinds of tests, analyzing DNA from a saliva sample, as you mentioned. But before we go down that road, are you experiencing any current health problems?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I didn't know. I thought… maybe you do all kinds of tests here. Sorry. No, no problems really. Old man things, you know? Little aches, but nothing bad. I eat good fish, walk around a bit… just want to know about my ancestors, that’s all. Is that… can you still help me find a place to do the test?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, focusing on ancestry when you haven’t even had a basic check-up… it's not the best use of my time, or your health resources. I can point you toward some commercial DNA testing companies, but I won’t be directly involved in the process. First, though, let's just quickly go through a few things. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You are right. I forget sometimes… old man forget. No, no other doctors. Just you, if that's okay. I… I just moved here last year, from Majuro. Used to have a… someone, but not anymore. That's why I came to you. You were recommended. I want to be sure I’m okay, before I… chase my family history.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That's sensible. Majuro, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Majuro. It’s… a small island. Very small. Beautiful, but small. I lived there my whole life, until last year. My sister… she live here now, so I come to be near her. She says you good doctor.
DOCTOR: Well, I do my best. So, since you've recently moved and haven't seen a doctor in a while, let’s just do a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No surgeries. Never needed them. I got sick when I was young, with the fever, like everyone gets. But I got better. Just the fever. And… I broke my arm once, when I was fishing. But it healed good. That's all I remember. Mostly healthy, I think. I eat lots of fish.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take nothing. I don’t like pills. Maybe… sometimes, when I get a bad headache, I take the little white ones. You know, for pain? But not often. Mostly, just fish. And water. Very important, water.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don't think so. I eat all kinds of fish, all kinds of fruits… never had a problem. Maybe… the mosquitos like me a lot. But that's not an allergy, is it? They just… bite me. I get itchy. But everyone get itchy from mosquitos, right?
DOCTOR: Right, mosquitos aren’t an allergy. Okay, Mr. Scobie. Now, before we continue, I’d like to quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, okay. That's good. I let you check. Long as it's not too long. I got things to do, you know? My sister, she make good coconut cream pie. I promised to help her. But… I want to know about my family first. Is that… will you still help me with the test? After the checking?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, let's focus on the medical examination first, and then we can briefly discuss resources for genetic testing. I’m not able to provide the testing directly, but I can give you some websites and information. Now, if you'll please roll up your sleeve…
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sleeve up. Here. Just… quick, yeah? I really like coconut cream pie. And my sister, she get angry if I late.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little high, Mr. Scobie. We'll need to discuss that later. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breath. Is that… bad? That crackling? My sister, she say I cough a lot at night sometimes. Maybe it's just the dust here. Majuro, it's very clean. No dust. But here… lots of dust.
DOCTOR: The crackling sound could be due to dust or other environmental factors, but it's something we need to investigate further. It’s important to rule out anything more serious, like a possible lung infection or early signs of congestion. Do you have any history of asthma or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? No. Never had asthma. Bronchitis? I don’t know. Maybe? I get cough when it’s cold. Everyone get cough when it’s cold, right? I never go to doctor for cough. My mama, she give me hot tea. Hot tea always fix it. It’s just… old man things, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. Just to be safe, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. That will help us determine the cause of the crackling sound and rule out any potential problems. We should also do a basic blood test to check your overall health and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood test? Oh… that’s… a lot. Will it take long? My sister, she make good pie. And I promised. And the family history… you still help me with that? After all the… checking and the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand your concerns, and I assure you, these tests are important for your health. The X-ray and blood test should only take about an hour total, including waiting time. And yes, after we have the results, we can briefly discuss resources for genetic ancestry testing. But right now, our priority is to make sure you're healthy. I want to know about your family history as well, but it is secondary to your current health. Do I have your permission to order the chest X-ray and blood test?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. You are right. Health first. My mama always say that too. Health is important. Yes. You can do the tests. Whatever you think is best. Just… quick, please? My sister… she get angry very easy. And the pie… it's a very good pie. But health first, you are right. Do the tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is next door. They'll give you further instructions. After the tests, please come back to my office, and we’ll discuss the results when they’re available. In the meantime, try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. And… maybe you know a good place to buy coconut? Majuro coconut is very good. But I don’t know where to buy it here. And… thank you again for helping me with the family history. Even if it’s just a little bit. That's okay.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Scobie. As for coconut, there's a small grocery store on Elm Street that sometimes carries fresh coconuts. I’m not sure about the quality, but it's worth checking out. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please let my nurse know if you experience any discomfort or have any concerns. And, Mr. Scobie… try not to worry too much about the pie. Your health is the priority. .
