DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a time. I just want to know what it is and be done with it. Not much time, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand you’ve been experiencing a sore throat for some time now. We'll certainly try to get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It… hurts when I swallow. Like sandpaper. And it feels… swollen. I don’t know. It just hurts, Doctor. Is that good enough? I separate things all day, you know. Don’t have time for… feelings.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ottaviani. It sounds quite uncomfortable. "Sandpaper" is a very helpful description, thank you. And I appreciate you coming in despite a busy schedule. When did this sore throat begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Maybe… last month? Or was it before that? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of these things. Work is busy. Things need separating. It all blurs together, you see? Is it serious? Just tell me if it's serious.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to recall exact dates, Ms. Ottaviani. "Last month" is a good starting point. It’s helpful to know it’s been ongoing for some time. To help me determine if it’s something serious, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don't feel feverish. Body aches… I ache all over from work, always. Separating heavy things, you know. Is that what you mean? Everything aches. It’s just… life. I don’t know what you want me to say.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Ottaviani. You work very hard, and it sounds like you experience a lot of physical strain. I was simply trying to rule out other possible causes for the sore throat. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or nasal congestion?
PATIENT: A little sniffly sometimes. Dust at the factory, you know. Always dust. Not a bad cough, just… a sniffle. Nothing important. Can we please just get to what is wrong with my throat? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I apologize for the seemingly endless questions. I just want to gather as much information as possible. Now, have you noticed any difficulty breathing or swallowing, beyond the pain when you swallow?
PATIENT: Difficulty… breathing? No! I breathe just fine. I wouldn't be here if I couldn't breathe, would I? And swallowing is… painful. You already asked me that. Are you even listening? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Ottaviani. My apologies. I am listening, and I understand your frustration. I am simply trying to be thorough. Let me quickly review what we've discussed so far. You’ve had a sore throat for approximately a month, it’s painful when you swallow, you experience some mild sniffles related to dust at work, and you haven't experienced any fever, chills, or difficulty breathing. Now, would you mind if I took a quick look at your throat?
PATIENT: Look at it, then. Get it over with. But be quick. I have a schedule, you know. Things don't separate themselves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. Please open your mouth and say "Ah." Okay. I see some redness in the back of your throat and your tonsils appear slightly swollen. There's no visible pus or exudate at this time. Do you have any pain when I gently touch the sides of your neck, near your lymph nodes?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, it hurts. There. And there. Those little bumps… they always hurt when touched. Is it something bad? Is it… cancer? My husband… he… never mind. Just tell me what it is. And if I need a lot of tests. I don't have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Ottaviani. It's perfectly reasonable to be worried, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. The swollen lymph nodes are likely a response to the inflammation in your throat. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, it's most likely a viral pharyngitis – a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, to be certain and rule out other possibilities, such as strep throat, I would like to perform a rapid strep test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Another test? Really? Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… make it quick. And tell me how much it costs before you do it. I don't want any surprises. I'm a widow, you know. Things are… tight. Just tell me what I’m looking at, cost-wise.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand your concerns about the cost. The rapid strep test is relatively inexpensive – it typically costs around $30 - $50. I will confirm the exact price with the billing department before proceeding. This will only take a moment. We should have results in about 5-10 minutes. While we wait, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I don’t take anything. Waste of money. Never needed anything. Just… get on with it. I have things to separate, you know. And a house to clean. Time is money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ottaviani, the rapid strep test is negative. That’s good news. It suggests your sore throat is likely caused by a virus, as we discussed. Given your symptoms and the negative strep test, I recommend supportive care at home. This includes: Rest Drinking plenty of fluids Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain relief Throat lozenges or gargling with warm salt water to soothe your throat Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: Just… rest and drink water? That’s it? After all those tests? And touching my throat? That’s all? Is it… contagious? Will I get everyone at the factory sick? I need to know. And what if it doesn’t get better? Will I need… more tests? You’re sure it’s not… anything serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Ottaviani. It's frustrating when the answer isn't more definitive, and I want to assure you that we’ve taken appropriate steps to rule out the most concerning possibilities. Viral pharyngitis can be contagious, but it’s typically spread through respiratory droplets – coughing, sneezing, etc. Maintaining good hygiene – handwashing, covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze – can help prevent its spread. As for it not getting better, most viral sore throats resolve on their own within 7-10 days. However, if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after that time, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please return to see me or seek medical attention immediately. In that case, we may consider further investigation. To be absolutely sure, and given your concerns, I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Another appointment? Fine. But make it quick. And I need a detailed breakdown of the costs. Beforehand. No surprises. I’m a widow, you remember? I have bills to pay. And things to separate. Just… schedule it. And let’s be done with this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. I understand completely. I've scheduled a follow-up appointment for you next Thursday at 10:00 AM. The billing department will contact you with a detailed cost estimate for the visit. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please prioritize rest and hydration, Ms. Ottaviani. Thank you for coming in today. .
