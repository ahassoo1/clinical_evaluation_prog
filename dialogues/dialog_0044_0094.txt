DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, my husband... he say I need to come. Something about... learning? I don't really remember. Just… things. He worries too much, you know?
DOCTOR: It sounds like there might be some things going on that you'd like to discuss. That’s perfectly alright. Sometimes it helps to have someone listen and sort through things. Your husband is thoughtful to bring you in. Let’s take our time. When you say “things,” can you tell me a little bit more about what those things are?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's… hard to explain. Everything feels… fuzzy. Like old TV. I work with metal, you know? Sheet metal. It’s… physical. I don't sit and think about things. Mostly I just... do. My hands know what to do. But he keeps saying I forget things. Like… appointments. Or what he told me five minutes ago. It’s not important stuff, I think. Just… little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some memory difficulties – little things slipping your mind, appointments, recent conversations. And you feel like it's impacting things at home, with your husband noticing these slips. It’s good he's observant and looking out for you. You mentioned you work with sheet metal—that’s a physically demanding job. And you don’t typically spend a lot of time focusing on mental tasks. That’s helpful information. To get a better understanding, could you tell me when you first started noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s hard. Maybe… six months ago? Or a year? Everything blends together. I just… noticed he was repeating himself more. Like, I’d ask him something, he’d tell me, and then ten minutes later I’d ask the same thing. He gets… frustrated. And I don't like when he gets frustrated. It makes me feel… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly six months to a year ago is when you started noticing the repetitions—your husband repeating information because you’d forgotten. And it’s understandably causing some friction between the two of you. It’s tough when communication becomes difficult. To help me get a clearer picture, besides repeating questions, have you noticed any other changes in your memory or thinking?
PATIENT: Thinking… changes? I don’t know. I get… tired. Really tired. Even after sleeping. And sometimes… sometimes I feel like the words… they don't come easy. Like I’m searching for them. It’s not always, but… yeah. It happens. It's annoying. Makes me sound… dumb.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like you're sounding dumb at all, Airam. It sounds like you're describing some very real difficulties. Fatigue and difficulty finding the right words can definitely be connected to memory issues. To clarify, how would you rate your fatigue on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no fatigue and 10 being the worst fatigue you can imagine?
PATIENT: Ten. Maybe not always ten. But… a lot of days. Like, I finish work and just… collapse. No energy to do anything. Even just watching TV is… hard. My husband, he says I sleep too much. But I'm still tired. He doesn't understand. Working with metal is hard. Physical. It wears you out. It's not like sitting in an office.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out – working with metal is incredibly physically demanding. It’s important to consider that when assessing your energy levels. A ten out of ten fatigue is significant. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Not really. Just… the usual. Colds. Flu. Nothing serious. I don't go to the doctor much. I just… rest and get better. My mother always said rest is the best medicine. And I don't like doctors. They poke and prod and ask too many questions. This is already enough questions, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. Your mother was wise - rest is important. Since you haven't been diagnosed with any other conditions, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Not even… tonsils. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Can we stop now? This is making my head hurt. All these questions about… things. I just wanted to learn something. My husband said I needed… education. But this isn’t… helpful. It's just… stressful.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. I'm pushing too hard, and it's clear this is causing you stress. I apologize. We can absolutely stop. Before we do, just a few quick questions about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, grandparents – has been diagnosed with memory problems, or conditions like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Alzheimer’s…? Dementia…? My grandmother… on my mother’s side… she… she got old. Very old. And… confused. She didn't remember things. My mother always took care of her. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t… I don’t remember the details. She just… wasn’t herself towards the end. Is that… bad? Am I going to be like that?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Airam. Knowing your family history can be helpful, and it's good you remembered that. It's entirely possible there’s a genetic component, but it doesn’t mean you will develop those conditions. Given your fatigue, memory issues, and your family history, I think it would be wise to run some basic tests to rule out any underlying medical causes. We can check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and do a simple cognitive assessment – just a few short questions to get a baseline. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests…? More poking and prodding? I really don’t want to. But… my husband… he’ll be upset if I don’t. He worries so much. Fine. Okay. But quick, please. And no needles. I hate needles. And explain everything first. Don't just… do things to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No needles, I promise. And I will explain everything clearly before we do anything. The tests are quite simple. We'll start with a blood draw – that checks your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic blood counts. These things can all affect your energy levels and cognitive function. The cognitive assessment is just a series of short questions and tasks—it helps us assess your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It’s not a diagnosis, just a baseline for comparison. It will take about 20 minutes, maybe a little longer. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes… Okay. As long as you explain everything first. And no surprises. And… will it hurt? The blood draw, I mean. I always get dizzy when I see blood. My husband has to hold my hand. This is all so… stressful. I just wanted to learn something. Not… this.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're feeling stressed, Airam. And you're right to ask questions. The blood draw might feel a little pinch, but it's very quick. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – is very skilled, and they’ll be gentle. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. If you feel dizzy, just let me know, and we'll stop immediately. Your husband is welcome to hold your hand, absolutely. Before we start, let's just take a few deep breaths together, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breaths. Like my mother taught me. But… my hands are sweating. And my heart is racing. This is awful. Can we just… skip the blood part? Please? I'll try the questions. Just the questions. I really hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. We can absolutely skip the blood draw for now. Your comfort is my priority. We'll start with the cognitive assessment. It's a series of questions and tasks – it won't involve any needles or poking. Before we begin, just know that there are no right or wrong answers. I'm simply trying to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Questions… okay. No needles. That's good. But… what kind of questions? Will they be… hard? I didn't do very well in school. My husband always said I was better with my hands than my head. Just… please don’t make me feel stupid.
DOCTOR: They’re not hard at all, Airam. They’re more about everyday things – remembering words, naming objects, simple calculations. It’s not about intelligence; it’s about how your brain is functioning right now. I promise you won’t be asked anything that requires specific knowledge. We'll start with something easy. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today…? August…? Is it the 2nd? My husband… he tells me these things. But… I always forget. August 2nd, 2025. I think. Is that right? I’m terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. You got it right—it is August 2nd, 2025. Dates can be tricky. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Here…? In… the doctor’s office? Your office? It’s… white. And… there are pictures on the wall. Is that enough? I don’t remember the name of the place. My husband drove me. I'm really bad at remembering places.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Airam. It’s perfectly normal to forget details sometimes. We’ll move on to the next question. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? What words? You didn’t say any words. This is confusing. My head is starting to hurt. Tell me the words first, please. Don't just… expect me to know them.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I apologize—that was my mistake. I should have given you the words first. Okay, let's try this. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay. Ready. But… what if I forget? What if I can't remember? Just… say the words slowly, please. And don't get mad if I mess up.
DOCTOR: I won’t get mad, Airam. I promise. There are no right or wrong answers. It’s just a quick test. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: … Apple… table… uh… hmm… something with money…? Penny? Is that right? I think… apple, table, penny. But I’m not sure. Did I get them right?
DOCTOR: You got two out of three, Airam. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll move on to the next question. Now, I’m going to ask you to name as many animals as you can in one minute. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Animals…? In one minute…? Oh dear. That’s… hard. I work with metal. Not animals. One minute…? Um… dog…? Cat…? That’s it. I can’t think of any more. Is that bad? This is too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam, that’s enough for now. You’ve done very well. We don't need to continue if you're feeling stressed. It's clear that you are experiencing some difficulty with memory and recall. Let’s talk about what’s been happening. Given your fatigue, memory issues, and the results of this brief assessment, I think it would be a good idea to get some further testing done. Would you be open to a referral to a neurologist—a doctor who specializes in brain and nerve disorders?
PATIENT: No more questions? Thank goodness. A… neurologist? What does that doctor do? More poking and prodding? I just want to feel normal again. My husband… he always wants me to get more tests. But I don’t like doctors. What will the neurologist do? Will they find something bad? I'm scared.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be scared, Airam. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about seeing a new doctor, especially when you're not sure what to expect. A neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They'll be able to conduct a more thorough assessment to determine the cause of your memory issues and fatigue. The assessment might include some further cognitive tests, as well as some imaging scans—like an MRI or CT scan—to get a better look at your brain. The tests aren't necessarily unpleasant, and they're a valuable tool for figuring out what's going on. We want to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’m going to recommend Dr. Lee—she's a very experienced and compassionate neurologist. Would you like me to provide you with her contact information and a referral form?
PATIENT: Dr. Lee… okay. But… will it be expensive? We don’t have a lot of money. And I don't have insurance. My husband… he worries about the bills. I don’t want to cause more problems for him. This is already too much.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Airam. I understand your financial worries. Unfortunately, medical care can be expensive, especially without insurance. I’ll have my assistant look into options for financial assistance programs and sliding scale fees at Dr. Lee’s office. They may be able to offer a reduced rate or payment plan. There are also some local charities that can help cover medical expenses. I will provide you with a list of resources. Before you leave, I also want to emphasize the importance of taking care of yourself. Prioritize rest, eat a healthy diet, and stay hydrated. If you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or anxious, please don't hesitate to reach out to a trusted friend or family member for support. Here’s Dr. Lee’s contact information and the resources I’ve compiled. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Thank you… I guess. It’s a lot to think about. And… I still don't understand why this is happening to me. I just want to feel normal again. No… I don't think I have any more questions right now. I just want to go home. My husband is probably waiting. He'll be upset that it took so long. Thank you for trying to help… even if I don't understand everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Airam. I understand this is a lot to process, and I’m here to support you in any way I can. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help. Take care of yourself, and give my regards to your husband. I hope you both have a peaceful evening.
