DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I reckon I’m here for a check-up, mostly. My wife – bless her heart, passed on last year – she always kept me on top of things. Now that she’s gone, I figure I ought to make sure I stay on top of things, you know? It's this “Men’s Health Optimization Visit” the office called it. Just want to make sure everything's still tickin’ right, so to speak.
DOCTOR: Right. A good idea, Londell. It’s sensible to be proactive. And my apologies for your loss. It’s…difficult, adjusting. So, this “tickin’ right” business…are there any specific concerns you have?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is…quiet now. Mostly quiet. No, not really concerns, exactly. Just…getting a bit slower, I suppose. Not as much pep as I used to have. And I’ve been havin’ a little trouble sleepin’ some nights. Just layin’ there, thinkin’. Nothing major, though. And my memory…well, it ain’t what it used to be, but I mostly remember the important stuff. Like yesterday, I had beans for lunch. Though sometimes it takes me a minute to recall a name.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some fatigue, difficulty sleeping, and…occasional forgetfulness. And you said yesterday you had beans for lunch. Good. That’s…helpful. Let's try to be a bit more precise, if you don't mind. When did you start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem. It's hard to say exactly when. It didn’t just happen overnight, you know? But… I reckon maybe six months or so ago? After…after Martha got sick, things just felt…heavy. And it's just kinda stayed that way, a little bit. Not all the time, mind you. Some days are better than others. But it’s enough to notice, that’s for sure. It takes more effort to get things done, that's what I'd say. Used to be able to just do things, now I gotta…think about doin’ them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Londell. It does. Fatigue developing over about six months, coinciding with your wife’s illness. That’s…understandable. Grief can manifest in many ways. And this difficulty sleeping…is it trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: Mostly stayin’ asleep, I think. I can usually get off to sleep alright enough. But I wake up…a couple of times a night. Sometimes just once, sometimes three or four. And then I just…lay there. Thinkin’. About Martha, mostly. Or just…things. And it’s hard to get back to sleep after that. I used to be able to sleep through anything, like a log. Now…not so much. And I don’t really feel tired enough to just…knock out, you know? Even when I am tired.
DOCTOR: Interrupted sleep, waking several times a night, difficulty returning to sleep. And you don’t feel particularly fatigued even when you are tired. Alright. Now, you mentioned some memory issues. Can you give me an example, beyond recalling yesterday’s lunch?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly names, like I said. Folks I’ve known for years, sometimes the name just…won’t come. And I'll be talkin’ to someone, and I’ll forget what I was sayin’ mid-sentence. It’s not like I’m losin’ important memories, like where I live or who my children are. It's just…little things. Like, I was at the store last week, and I went in for milk and came out with…a new bird feeder. Don't even have birds. It's embarrassing, mostly. And I worry about it, you know? Getting older… it’s a funny thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Difficulty with recall, particularly names, occasional forgetfulness during conversation. And purchasing items you don’t need. It’s…not uncommon with age, but we should investigate further. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had high blood pressure for a while, but I was on medication for that for years, and the doctor took me off of it a few years back. Said I was doin’ well enough. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old. Arthritis in my hands, mostly. And I had my appendix taken out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Martha kept track of all the specifics, bless her heart. She always was the organized one. I haven’t been to a doctor much in the last few years, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of hypertension, now resolved with medication. Arthritis in the hands. Appendectomy as a child. And you haven’t been to a doctor regularly recently. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Martha always asked me that when I got a new prescription, and she always said no. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by a few bees, but that just hurt. Never broke out in hives or anything. Nope, no allergies, to the best of my knowledge.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for my hands, when they’re really achin’. And I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. Martha got me started on that years ago, said it was good to keep me healthy. Other than that… nope, nothin’ regularly. I don't like takin' pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for hand pain, and a multivitamin. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had diabetes, type 2 I think it was. And her mother… my grandmother… she had heart trouble. She didn't live to be very old. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never a sick day in his life, as far as I know. Martha's family… her father had high blood pressure, like I did. And her sister had arthritis, just like me. Seems like a lot of aches and pains run in both our families, if you want to know the truth. That's probably why I got 'em.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history of diabetes, heart trouble, hypertension, and arthritis. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Nope, never have. My father smoked a pipe for a while, but he quit when I was a boy. Always smelled like cherry tobacco. Never appealed to me, though. I always liked the smell of fresh air better. And Martha… she didn't care for smokers much, so I never started.
DOCTOR: No history of tobacco use. Good. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer with the boys when we get together. Nothing much, though. I don't really care for it, to be honest. It doesn't really agree with me. Martha used to enjoy a glass of sherry before bed, but I never got into it much. I mostly drink water. Keeps me regular, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional alcohol consumption. Now, let's talk about your activity level. How would you describe your typical day?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be pretty active. Worked in a shop, buildin' things with my hands. But I retired a few years back. Now, I mostly putter around the house. Do a little bit of gardening, when the weather’s nice. I walk to the store sometimes, if it's not too far. And I like to sit on the porch and watch the birds. Not as much as I used to, though. Martha and I used to take long walks together every day. Now...I mostly just keep myself busy. Try to, anyway. It gets lonely, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reduced activity level since retirement. And I understand it can be isolating after a loss. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I get a little bit nervous at the doctor’s office, always have. Not scared, exactly, just… anxious. And I tend to ramble, like I have been. Martha always said I could talk the ears off a donkey. So, if I start goin' on and on, just let me know. And… well, I guess that’s about it. I’m just hopin’ everything's still workin’ alright. Gettin' older ain’t for the faint of heart, you know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you telling me, Londell. It’s perfectly alright to be anxious, and I won’t interrupt you unless I need clarification. And rambling is fine – it helps me get to know you. Now, if you're comfortable, let's do a quick physical exam. Just routine things – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen…nothing to worry about. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Just get it over with, I reckon. I've had doctors poke and prod at me my whole life. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? And if I start talkin', just ignore me. That's what Martha used to do. Let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 82 beats per minute. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, with normal vesicular breathing. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Next, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Finally, I'll check your pulses. Pulses are 2+ bilaterally, equal and regular. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. Do you know what your usual blood pressure is, or have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: Well, Martha used to check it sometimes. Said it was usually around 120 over 80, give or take. But that was a while ago. I haven’t really kept track of it since she passed. She always handled those things. I reckon I should've paid more attention, now that I think about it. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is somethin' wrong?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you relied on Martha, and don’t feel bad about that. A blood pressure of 148/88 is mildly elevated compared to your usual 120/80. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong right now, but it does mean we need to investigate further to understand why it's elevated. There are several possible reasons for an increase in blood pressure – stress, diet, lack of exercise, underlying medical conditions… It could be something as simple as needing to reduce your salt intake, or it could indicate a more serious problem. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel will give us information about your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. I also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood work and an EKG, alright. As long as it helps figure things out. Will it be painful? I don't like needles, never have. But do what you gotta do. I'm just glad you're lookin' into it. Martha always said it was better to be safe than sorry. What’s the next step after that? When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: That's a good attitude, Londell. And don’t worry, the blood work is relatively quick and painless. It’s just a small prick in your arm. As for the EKG, small stickers will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn't hurt at all, and takes only a few minutes. I'll order the tests right away, and the lab should be able to schedule you for tomorrow morning. We’ll get the results back within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Depending on the results, that might mean lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction. Or, it might mean medication to help lower your blood pressure. Is there anything else I can answer for you at the moment?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers it. Diet, exercise, stress… Martha always told me I needed to walk more. I guess she was right, as usual. So, tomorrow morning for the blood work and the stickers, alright. That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little, just knowin' you're lookin' into it. I appreciate you takin' the time. I guess I’ll see you after the results come back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. And you're right - your wife sounds like a very wise woman. Yes, I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are available. We’ll discuss them together and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Here's a copy of the lab requisition form and the instructions for tomorrow's appointment. Take care, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And I will remember about the emergency room. Bye bye to you too.
