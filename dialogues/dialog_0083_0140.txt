DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. It's something in my mouth. A white coating. It's quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright, please don't feel embarrassed. Many things can cause a white coating in the mouth. We'll get to the bottom of it. When did you first notice this white coating, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Oh, I suppose… about a week ago? Maybe a little longer. It’s not something I pay much attention to, normally. I just… noticed it was getting worse, and my wife insisted I come. She worries too much, frankly. It’s not life-threatening, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s good of your wife to encourage you to get it checked out. Most causes aren’t life-threatening, but it’s always best to investigate. A week ago… okay. Is it painful at all?
PATIENT: Painful? Not exactly. It's… irritating. Especially when I eat. Things don't taste quite right, and it feels… rough. Like sandpaper, almost. It's more bothersome than painful, if you understand. I eat a pretty normal diet, mostly. Steak, vegetables… the usual.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Irritation and altered taste are helpful clues. And it's good to know it's impacting your eating. Let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other symptoms along with this coating – fever, difficulty swallowing, any weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Definitely no fever. Difficulty swallowing… not really. I mean, I’m not choking or anything. And weight loss? Look, I’m a faller. It’s a physical job. I fluctuate, alright? Sometimes I eat more, sometimes less. It’s not a… consistent weight loss. I'm perfectly healthy otherwise. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And you mentioned you're a faller – do you work in construction, or what sort of physical labor do you do?
PATIENT: I cut trees, Doctor. I'm a faller. Professional tree felling. It's… demanding work. We work outdoors, obviously. Lots of sawdust, sometimes dirt. I’m careful, of course, but it's not a clean environment.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. That information is very helpful. Now, have you noticed this white coating happen before, or is this a new issue?
PATIENT: No. Never before. Not like this. I've had a sore throat now and then, a bit of a cold, but nothing that looked like this. It just… appeared. And frankly, I don't have time for illnesses.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to take a look at your mouth, if you don’t mind. Could you please open wide and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I really don’t see what good this is going to do. It’s just… white stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a fairly uniform white coating on your tongue and the inner cheeks. It doesn't appear to be scraped off easily, and there's no sign of underlying redness or sores. It could be a mild case of oral thrush, or possibly something called leukoplakia. Both can be caused by various factors, including dryness, irritation, and sometimes even smoking. Do you smoke, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me. It’s a perfectly respectable habit, cutting trees, but smoking… that’s just foolish. And ‘dryness’? I drink plenty of water. Look, I work hard, I eat well, I stay hydrated. I hardly think that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. You seem to take good care of yourself, which makes it more puzzling. Since the coating doesn’t scrape off easily and doesn’t appear to be related to dryness, I'd like to take a swab of the area to send to the lab for a more definitive diagnosis. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A swab? You mean… you don't know what it is? All this fuss for… a swab? Look, I have a crew waiting for me. This is costing me money. Is it contagious, at least? I can't afford to get my men sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and your crew, Mr. Schieber. It's not that I don't know what it is, it’s that I want to be certain. The swab will help us rule out any underlying infections or other conditions that require specific treatment. As for contagiousness, oral thrush can be mildly contagious, but it's unlikely to spread easily through casual contact. It’s more common in individuals with weakened immune systems. Since you appear to be healthy, the risk is very low. The swab is a simple procedure; it will take only a few seconds. Would you allow me to proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full refund of my time. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. That wasn't bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, it wasn't bad. It was… unnecessary. Now, how long will this ‘lab’ take? And will it affect my work? I need to know.
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return results. We'll contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining good oral hygiene – brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and staying well hydrated. As for your work, it shouldn’t be affected. However, if you experience any difficulty swallowing, pain, or fever, please contact us immediately. I’m going to write up a brief summary of our conversation and the plan for the lab results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get the results back quickly. And don't expect me to come back for another ‘swab’ if it’s something trivial. This has been a waste of my time, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber, and I apologize for any inconvenience. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. If you do experience any changes or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. Have a safe day, and I wish you all the best with your work.
