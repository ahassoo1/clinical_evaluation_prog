DOCTOR: Good morning, Tammie. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time. My throat… it hurts. Just hurts to swallow. That is all. Can we just… get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll try to be quick. Just your throat, though?
PATIENT: Just my throat. It started… a few days ago, I think. It’s not… a bad pain, exactly. More… irritating. Like something is stuck. And I’ve been trying to drink more water, like my mother always said, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am. A few days, irritating… like something stuck. Any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose with it?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh… I don't know. I haven’t checked. I don’t really… bother with that. Chills? No. And a cough… maybe a little, but it’s just… a normal cough. I get those sometimes. It's not… connected, probably. I just want to know what I can take for this throat.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever that you're aware of, a little cough not necessarily related... Hmm. Do you have any trouble breathing, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I can breathe just fine. Ears… sometimes they feel a little… full, maybe? But that happens a lot, honestly. I’ve always had… sensitive ears. Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do. Really important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just take a quick look, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But be quick about it. I really don’t like people poking around.
DOCTOR: Okay, just open wide for me… and say “Ahhh”. Don't worry, it'll be fast. Okay… throat’s a little red, some mild swelling. No obvious signs of anything serious, thankfully. Lymph nodes feel a little tender, but nothing alarming.
PATIENT: Lymph… what? Look, I don’t understand all that fancy talk. Is it bad? Just tell me what I need to do. Is it a bug? Do I need pills? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Lymph nodes are just… small glands in your neck. They can get a little swollen when your body is fighting something off, like a cold. It looks like a mild sore throat, likely viral. So, it's not serious, thankfully. It’s probably not a bug, more like a common cold virus. For now, I'd recommend plenty of fluids – you were right to try the water. Also, gargle with warm salt water a few times a day. And over-the-counter throat lozenges or pain reliever like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with the discomfort. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Salt water? Like, for cleaning wounds? I don't know… is that safe? And what were those other… names you said? I don’t keep pills around. Look, just give me something simple. A spray, maybe? I don’t like swallowing things. This is all very… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, salt water for gargling. It helps reduce inflammation. It's safe – just a teaspoon in a glass of warm water. The acetaminophen or ibuprofen are just over-the-counter pain relievers… like Tylenol or Advil, you can find them at any pharmacy. A throat spray might help temporarily, but it won’t address the underlying inflammation. If it doesn’t improve within a few days, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please come back, or see another doctor. We don't want this to worsen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Salt water, pills… I’ll see if I can find someone to go to the shop. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. Just a sore throat. Is that everything? I really must go. Thank you… I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a note summarizing what we discussed. Drink fluids, gargle, pain reliever if needed, and come back if things worsen. Have a good day, Tammie. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
