DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my skin. It’s…discolored. Not everywhere, thankfully, but enough to be bothersome. It’s really quite unsightly, and I’d like to know what’s causing it. I noticed it a few weeks ago, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Discolored” is a little vague, unfortunately. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Honestly, I expected you to ask more specific questions, Doctor. But fine. It’s… patches. Sort of brownish, a little bit red around the edges. Mostly on my arms, and a little bit on my chest. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, but it just…looks off. Like someone took a paintbrush to me. It’s terribly distracting, especially when I’m cataloging delicate historical documents.
DOCTOR: Right. “Patches.” And you said a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Approximately three, I’d say. Give or take a day or two. I keep very precise records, you understand. I catalog everything. It started subtly, and has… progressed. It’s not dramatically worse, but it’s definitely noticeable. I've been using my usual moisturizer, but it hasn’t made a difference. Naturally.
DOCTOR: And you haven't tried anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, I wouldn’t dabble in… home remedies. Absolutely not. I considered a very mild exfoliating scrub, but then I thought better of it. One doesn't simply experiment with one’s skin, Doctor. Especially when one has important work to do. It's perfectly understandable that I'd come to a professional. It's a delicate situation, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s take a look. Please, have a seat on the examination table, and I'll need you to wear a gown. We’ll start with a physical exam, and then we can discuss possibilities.
PATIENT: A gown? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, Doctor, it's simply discoloration. Not… a contagious affliction. But fine. If you insist. I do hope this won't take too long. I have a rather important shipment of 18th-century parish records to inventory this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Bartock. It allows me to properly assess the areas of concern. Just a quick look. We’ll be efficient.
PATIENT: Efficient is good. Very good. Honestly, the fuss over a few patches…
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back, please. I’m going to examine your arms and chest.
PATIENT: Do be gentle. My skin is rather sensitive. And please, try not to linger. I’m not particularly fond of being…exposed. It’s simply unprofessional, really. Are you sure this is necessary? Perhaps a photograph would suffice?
DOCTOR: It’s better to see it in person, Ms. Bartock. It allows me to assess texture and depth, which a photograph wouldn’t capture. I see some mild scaling as well. Have you noticed any itching?
PATIENT: Itching? No, not precisely itching. More…a slight irritation, perhaps. A faint prickling sensation. It’s hardly noticeable, honestly. It’s more the appearance of it all that’s troubling. I mean, look at this! It’s simply dreadful. It clashes terribly with my complexion. Honestly, I've seen better preservation on medieval manuscripts.
DOCTOR: Hm. And have you been using any new soaps, lotions, detergents… anything different lately?
PATIENT: Different? Let me think… well, Mrs. Petrova brought me some homemade lavender soap from her garden. Quite fragrant, actually. But I only used it once. It smelled…rather strong. And I did switch to a new fabric softener for my linens, a “botanical blend,” but that was weeks ago. Surely that couldn’t be it. I only use the finest products, Doctor. I have standards, you know. It's unlikely to be anything mundane. Perhaps a rare fungal infection? Or a skin reaction to the ink in the parish records? It is quite old.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, while I appreciate your attention to detail, it’s important to rule out simpler explanations first. It could be contact dermatitis from the soap or fabric softener. Or a mild fungal infection. We'll start with a skin scraping to be certain. It’s a quick, painless procedure. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: A scraping? Doctor, are you suggesting I have some… common ailment? I assure you, my hygiene is impeccable. I catalog sensitive historical materials, for goodness sake! Still… If it will expedite things, I suppose. But be gentle. And please, explain the process. I don’t like surprises. Is it… messy?
DOCTOR: It’s very quick and minimally invasive, Ms. Bartock. I’ll gently scrape a tiny sample of the affected skin—it will feel like a light scratch—and we’ll examine it under a microscope to identify any fungus or bacteria. It's not messy, I assure you. I’ll clean the area afterward. It’s just a precaution. Just relax, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Very well. But if I experience any discomfort, you will stop immediately. I have a rather important appraisal scheduled for next week, and I cannot afford any…distractions. Proceed, but with the utmost caution. And tell me exactly what you are doing, step by step. I find it… reassuring.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve collected a sample. Now I just need to add a drop of solution to examine it under the microscope. It won’t take long. There. That will protect it. Just a little irritation is normal afterward. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. A perfectly good archivalist subjected to a… scraping. It's simply appalling. I do hope it yields some useful information. Otherwise, this whole exercise has been a complete waste of my time. And my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. The scraping revealed the presence of Malassezia yeast. It's a common fungus that lives on the skin, and it's often the cause of a condition called pityriasis versicolor. It causes discoloration, like the patches you described. It's not contagious, and it's easily treatable with an antifungal cream.
PATIENT: A fungus? On me? I assure you, Doctor, my environment is meticulously maintained. Dust-free, climate-controlled… it’s hardly conducive to fungal growth. Are you certain? Perhaps a secondary analysis is in order? It sounds… rather unsanitary. And what kind of cream are we talking about? I certainly won't be slathering anything on my skin without a full list of ingredients. I have sensitivities, you know. And what caused this… outbreak? It must be traced to the source. I need to know what I need to change to prevent this from happening again. The archival climate, perhaps? I’ll need to consult with the preservation specialist immediately.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, Malassezia is very common. It thrives in warm, humid environments, even meticulously maintained ones. It doesn’t indicate poor hygiene. It’s simply an overgrowth of a naturally occurring fungus. The cream is a topical antifungal called ketoconazole 2%. It’s applied twice daily for two weeks. It’s generally very well tolerated, but I understand your concerns about sensitivities. Here's the prescription, and this handout contains information about the condition and potential side effects. As for the source, it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific cause. It can be triggered by stress, heat, or humidity. I recommend avoiding excessive sun exposure while you're treating it. As for changes to your archival climate, I don’t believe that’s necessary. It’s a relatively harmless condition, easily managed with the cream. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: “Relatively harmless,” you say. Well, that’s reassuring, I suppose. But still…a fungus. Ketoconazole…hmm. I’ll have to have my pharmacist review the ingredients carefully. And two weeks? That seems rather… prolonged. Very well. I’ll try the cream. But if I experience any adverse reactions, I’ll be contacting you immediately. And I still maintain that a thorough investigation into the source of this… affliction is warranted. I can't risk a recurrence, especially with the upcoming appraisal of the Bishop collection. It's a matter of historical importance. Do I need to schedule a follow-up appointment to confirm the efficacy of this treatment? And…will this leave any scarring? I have standards, you know. This is all terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: A follow-up isn't strictly necessary, Ms. Bartock, but if you're not seeing improvement after two weeks, please schedule an appointment. The cream rarely causes scarring, but if you experience any irritation or unusual skin changes, discontinue use and contact me. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that pityriasis versicolor is a common, easily treatable condition. I believe the cream will resolve the issue. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that will be all. Though I still find it… disconcerting. A fungus. I suppose I’ll be going then. Thank you, Doctor. Though I remain skeptical. A perfectly cataloged life, disrupted by a fungus… honestly.
