DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… um… I keep getting very red in the face. Like, a flush. It happens sometimes, and it’s… not nice. It just comes on me. I don't know why it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing sensation that comes and goes. That doesn't sound very comfortable at all. Can you tell me a little more about when this started happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh… maybe six months ago? Around April, I think. Yes, April. My wife… she passed in March. Maybe it started after that. I don’t remember exactly, but that feels about right. It wasn’t right away, but soon after, yes. I was very sad, of course. Still am, some days.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry for your loss, Enrique. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult. It's not uncommon for grief to manifest in physical ways. So, this flushing… does it happen at any particular time of day, or is it random?
PATIENT: It feels… random, yes. It can happen anytime. I was making tea yesterday, and it just… happened. Before that, I was sitting and reading. It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. Sometimes it’s a little bit after I eat, but not always. And… sometimes, it happens when I talk to people. Not always, but… more often when I do. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered sometimes by activity, sometimes by eating, and sometimes by social interaction. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… um… when I sit down, and just… quiet. When I’m not doing anything. It goes away after a little bit. Maybe ten minutes? And if I drink cool water, it helps a little bit. Not a lot, but… a little. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Enrique. Okay. And besides the flushing, are you experiencing any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes… my heart beats a little fast. Not racing, but… faster. And… I get a little bit warm, all over. Not a fever, just… warm. And my hands… sometimes they shake a little bit. Very small shake, you probably wouldn’t even notice. But that's it, I think. No headache, no dizziness. Just the red face, fast heart, a little warm, and shaky hands sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Enrique?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I try to stay away from them if I can. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter, because I don’t get much sun. But that's it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with that. I eat everything. My wife… she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, mostly. I always made sure to keep the windows closed during pollen season, for her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… I haven't been to the doctor in many years. I was always healthy, very strong. My wife, she took care of most of the doctor visits. I had… um… a bad cold when I was a child, very high fever, but that was many years ago. And I broke my arm when I was young, playing cricket. But nothing serious. No heart problems, no diabetes, no high blood pressure. That I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a little hard. My family… they are mostly in India. I haven’t seen them in many years. My father… he had problems with his stomach, but I don’t know what kind of problems. And my mother… she lived to be a very old age, very healthy, but… I don't know much about her medical history either. We didn’t talk much about those things. It was… different then.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That's not uncommon. Let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol either. My wife… she liked a little wine sometimes, with dinner. But I never did. And… no, no recreational drugs. Never have. I like my tea, that’s it. Green tea mostly. A few cups a day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your work and social life?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am a counselor. I help people with… problems. Substance abuse, mostly. And mental health. It's… a lot of talking. I work at a small clinic, out in the country. Not many people. And… my social life… it’s not very big. Since my wife passed… I mostly stay home. I have a few friends, but I don't see them very often. It's… lonely sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Enrique. That gives me a good starting point. Given your history and the description of your symptoms, and the fact that this started around the time of your wife’s passing, it's important to consider a few possibilities. It could be related to anxiety, a vasovagal reaction, or something else entirely. I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll check your heart rate and blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If you think it will help, please do. I just want to know what’s going on. It's… unsettling, this flushing.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. Okay, your heart and lungs sound good. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety or just the fact that you're in a doctor's office. Now, I'm just going to check your neurological reflexes. Okay, everything seems normal on the neurological exam as well. Now, I'm going to quickly palpate your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels normal as well. Given the findings of the exam, and your history, I’m leaning towards anxiety and a possible vasovagal reaction, potentially triggered by emotional stress or social interaction. However, a slightly elevated blood pressure warrants further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel would be a good starting point. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… wise. If you think tests will help, please do them. I want to know what’s happening. Blood tests are okay.
DOCTOR: Great. I’ll get the order entered now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw some blood, and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some strategies to manage your anxiety. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist or counselor?
PATIENT: That’s… ironic, isn't it? I am a counselor. I help other people. But… yes. I have thought about it. It’s… hard to ask for help when you spend your life giving help. But… perhaps it is time. Maybe a different perspective would be useful.
DOCTOR: That’s a very insightful point, Enrique. It’s often harder to apply our professional skills to ourselves. There are some excellent therapists in the area that specialize in grief and anxiety. I can provide you with a list of referrals. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I recommend practicing some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. And try to get enough sleep and eat a healthy diet. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that's all very helpful. A list of therapists would be good, yes. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… a little less worried now. Just knowing what to look for. I think that is all, for now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll print out a list of therapists for you now. Here you go. These are all reputable providers with experience in grief counseling and anxiety. I'll also send the lab order to the front desk. They’ll let you know when it’s ready. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of yourself is just as important as taking care of others. We’ll follow up in a few days once we have the lab results. Do you have any work or school restrictions I should note?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No restrictions. My work is… flexible. I can adjust my schedule as needed. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. And your help. I will call if I need anything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. I’m glad I could help. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: It was good to meet you too Doctor. Thank you again. .
