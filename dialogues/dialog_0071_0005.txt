DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Or… Lennie, if you prefer?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Galena. Lennie is just fine. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I appreciate you taking the time to see me. It’s about getting things settled for the Willow Creek facility, you understand.
DOCTOR: Willow Creek… yes, of course. A bit of paperwork for the facility, right?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. They need a doctor to say I’m… suitable, I suppose is the word. I bake a good loaf of bread, but that doesn’t mean I’m suited for… well, living with others again. It’s been a long time. A very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly reasonable to want a thorough assessment before making such a change. So, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about why you're considering Willow Creek now, after… a long time?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not that I want to, exactly. My niece, Sarah, she’s been… concerned. She lives a good distance away, and it’s getting harder for her to manage things here with my… with everything. She worries about me being alone, and she’s right to, I suppose. I’m a strong man still, but… things slip your mind, you know? Not important things, mind you, but… enough to make a young woman worry. And Sarah is a good woman. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Sarah… a concerned niece. That’s good of her, and it sounds like she’s looking out for you. And you're right, it is important to be realistic about these things. “Things slipping your mind…” Could you give me an example of what you mean by that?
PATIENT: It’s not forgetting who people are, Doctor. Never that. I remember every face I’ve ever met, every conversation. But… dates, sometimes. Or what I went to the store for, five minutes after I walk back in the door. Things like that. Small things. I used to be able to recall every ingredient in a recipe after one taste. Now… now I write them down. And sometimes I double-check the list. It used to be disrespectful, to need a list. A baker should know his ingredients. Old age, I suppose. It catches up to you.
DOCTOR: Perfectly normal changes as we get older, Lennie. It's good you're aware of these things. And writing things down is very smart. Now, besides the memory slips, have you noticed any changes in your mood, your sleep, or your appetite?
PATIENT: My mood… well, I get lonely, of course. But I’ve always been a quiet man. I don't bother folks much, and they don’t bother me. Sleep is… mostly good. I sleep through the night, usually. Though I wake up earlier than I used to. And my appetite is fine. I still enjoy a good meal. I still bake, you see. Makes me feel… useful. I haven’t lost my taste for bread, thankfully. That would be a tragedy.
DOCTOR: So, mostly good sleep and appetite. Enjoying baking, which is wonderful. And feeling useful is important. Now, have you experienced any falls recently, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No falls, Doctor. Not yet. I’m careful. I move a little slower than I used to, that's all. And sometimes… sometimes I feel a little unsteady on my feet when I stand up too quickly. But nothing that’s caused me to fall. I have good instincts, I think. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve learned to pay attention to my body.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Lennie. Paying attention to your body is excellent. Just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. For my arthritis. It’s in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to knead the dough sometimes. It's called… let me see… Sarah fills it for me, usually. I believe it’s called… Celebrex? Yes, that’s it. Celebrex. One a day. And sometimes, when it’s really bad, I’ll take… I’ll take something else. But Sarah makes sure I don’t overdo it. She’s a good woman. A very good woman.
DOCTOR: Celebrex, one a day. And something else occasionally, managed by Sarah. Excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. I've eaten everything put in front of me, more or less. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. And she was usually right about things. I even tried those… those strange new fruits Sarah brings sometimes, the ones with the prickly skins. No problems. Never had a reaction to anything. I’m a fairly simple man, you see. Don't need much to keep me going.
DOCTOR: No allergies, cast-iron stomach. Wonderful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you need. I understand it’s part of the process. Just let me know if it will… require me to remove my coat. It gets a little chilly in here, you know.
DOCTOR: Just take off your coat when you're comfortable, Lennie. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs as well. Then we’ll check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. And sensible. I appreciate you taking your time. My balance… well, as I said, it's not what it used to be, but I can stand, if that’s what you need. Just… be gentle. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at your age. Heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but common in older adults. Lungs are clear, breathing is normal. Reflexes are a little diminished, as expected. Now, if you could just stand up and close your eyes for a moment… A little unsteady, but you maintained your balance. Alright, Lennie. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits for your age, with some expected changes.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… good to know I’m not falling apart just yet. Although, I’ve felt a little unsteady for a while now, so it’s not entirely unexpected. But still… good to hear it’s nothing serious. So, what does this mean for the facility? Are they likely to… accept me?
DOCTOR: Well, Lennie, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, you appear to be in reasonably good health for your age. The unsteadiness is something to keep an eye on, and we might consider a referral to physical therapy to help with balance and strength. As for Willow Creek… They’re looking for residents who can still maintain a degree of independence, and who don't require extensive medical care. Based on my assessment, I believe you would be a suitable candidate. I’ll write a note stating your overall health status and recommending you for admission. However, it’s also important to consider your emotional well-being, and whether you feel comfortable making such a change. Do you have any questions about the facility itself, or what to expect if you’re admitted?
PATIENT: That… that is very good news, Doctor. Truly. And thank you for being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. I hadn't really thought about my emotional well-being, to be honest. I’m… a fairly stoic man, as you may have noticed. But Sarah… she’s worried about me being lonely. And I suppose… I suppose she has a point. Do you… do you think they have a good cook at Willow Creek? It's a silly question, I know, but a good meal can make all the difference. And… and are there other Lakota folks there? It would be… comforting to have someone to speak with, someone who understands. A simple question, I suppose. But important.
DOCTOR: Those are not silly questions at all, Lennie. Very important considerations. I don’t have specific information about the cook, but I can certainly inquire for you and get that information before your admission. As for other Lakota residents… Let me see… according to their resident roster, there are currently two other Lakota individuals at Willow Creek, both women. I can provide you with their names and, if they are willing, arrange for a meeting before you make a final decision. It’s important to feel comfortable and connected, and having a support network within the facility would be very beneficial. We can also discuss resources for emotional support, should you need them. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: That… that is wonderful news, Doctor. Truly. Two Lakota women… that would be… a great comfort. If they would be willing to speak with me, I would be… immensely grateful. It’s… a small world, and it’s rare to find folks who understand. And the thought of a good cook… well, that's just a bonus. Thank you for looking into all of this for me. You’ve… eased my mind considerably. What is the next step, then? Is there paperwork I need to fill out? Or do you handle that directly with the facility? I just want to make sure everything is… taken care of.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lennie. I’m glad I could help. The next step is I’ll write a formal letter to Willow Creek outlining your health assessment, recommending your admission, and mentioning your preferences regarding meeting with the other Lakota residents. I will also include a request for information about the dietary options. I'll send that electronically today, and they'll likely contact you directly to discuss the admission process, required paperwork, and scheduling a tour. I’ll also provide you with a copy of the letter for your records. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfect. Absolutely perfect. And thank you again for your time, and for your kindness. You’ve been… a great help. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man's worries. I believe that is all, then? Unless you have any further questions for me? Perhaps… perhaps I should give you Sarah’s number, in case they need to contact her directly?
DOCTOR: That would be excellent, Lennie. Sarah’s number would be very helpful. And truly, it was my pleasure. I enjoy getting to know my patients, and addressing their concerns is the most important part of my job. Here’s my card. Don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I wish you all the best with your transition to Willow Creek. I have a feeling you’ll be very happy there. It was a pleasure meeting you, Lennie.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Galena. And thank you again for everything. You’ve… given me a great deal of peace of mind. I believe I'll be on my way, then. Good day to you, Doctor. .
