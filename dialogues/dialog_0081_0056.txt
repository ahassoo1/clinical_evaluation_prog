DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s… the young people. The students. It’s just… exasperating. They have no respect for books, no discipline. And they certainly don't listen. It's making it difficult to… to function. I've been a teacher for a very long time, you understand. A long time. It wasn’t always like this.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're experiencing… difficulty functioning due to stress related to your work environment, specifically interactions with students?
PATIENT: “Stress” is a rather… modern term, isn’t it? It’s simply a lack of respect. A decline in standards! But… yes, I suppose you could call it that. It's… wearing me down. I find myself quite tired, and… less enthusiastic. Though I shouldn't have to explain this to you. It's obvious, isn't it?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… perspective, Mr. Schlatterer, simply stating it’s a decline in standards doesn’t give me much to work with medically. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you first start noticing this tiredness and loss of enthusiasm?
PATIENT: Specifics… Hmm. That’s difficult. Time… it all blurs together after a while, you know? Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It’s been gradual. They started… questioning everything. Every rule, every assignment… it was endless. Honestly, I’ve lost track. Is it really necessary to pinpoint the exact date? It’s the principle of the matter, Doctor, not the calendar.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. However, for medical reasons, a general timeframe is helpful. Six months, then. And has this… lack of enthusiasm and tiredness been constant over those six months, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Worse during the semesters, naturally. When I’m actually teaching them. It’s… draining. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. Though I suppose that’s just a modern inconvenience. It flares up then subsides a bit during the breaks… though even then, I find myself… restless. Unable to truly relax. It's… irritating. Do you need me to describe every single nuance of my schedule, Doctor? I have other commitments, you know.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, I don't need a detailed account of your schedule. But understanding the pattern is important. You mentioned restlessness during breaks. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s… an inability to settle. I find myself pacing, rearranging things… then rearranging them again. I can’t focus on reading, can’t enjoy my hobbies… it’s just… a general feeling of unease. Like something is… unfinished. Or… wrong. It’s very unpleasant. Honestly, I haven’t experienced anything like it before. It's… undignified. Really. Is this all necessary, Doctor? I thought you were a medical doctor, not a… a life coach.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I assure you this is medically relevant. These symptoms – tiredness, loss of enthusiasm, restlessness – could indicate a number of things. To properly assess the situation, I need a more complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? What is there to say about sleep? I sleep when I’m tired! It’s… adequate. Though it’s not as restful as it used to be. I wake up several times a night. Thinking… mostly about… well, about the state of things. About the students, about the curriculum… about the general decline of… everything. It’s hardly a secret, Doctor. Though I doubt it requires a medical degree to diagnose a troubled mind. Can we please get this over with? I have a… appointment. A rather important one.
DOCTOR: Frequent awakenings, thinking about work… alright. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? It fluctuates. Sometimes I have no desire to eat at all. Other times… I might have a small snack. I haven't been particularly hungry, I suppose. Food just doesn't seem… appealing anymore. Honestly, Doctor, I am not a child. I know when I've had enough to eat. Is this really necessary? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, but these questions are important. Loss of appetite, along with the other symptoms you've described—tiredness, loss of enthusiasm, restless sleep, frequent awakenings—could suggest a number of possibilities. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… my clothes are a bit looser, I suppose. I hadn't really noticed. Or, rather, I hadn't considered it significant. I’ve been… preoccupied. With more important matters. Really, Doctor, I am not here to discuss my wardrobe. I believe I’ve answered your questions sufficiently. Can we please conclude this… examination? I have a… commitment. And frankly, I’m wasting my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
