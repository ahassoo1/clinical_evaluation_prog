DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I received a letter suggesting I inquire about… what did they call it? An Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks I should have one. Honestly, I find the whole thing a bit morbid, but she insists. I suppose I’m here to understand what exactly these documents are and if I truly need one.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly understandable. It can feel a bit… daunting to think about these things. Your daughter is quite right to encourage you to explore this, though. An Advance Directive, or a POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—essentially outlines your wishes for medical care should you ever become unable to speak for yourself. It’s about your choices, ensuring they are respected. Perhaps we can start with the Advance Directive. Do you have any initial questions about what that involves?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… rather dramatic, doesn't it? "Unable to speak for myself." I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself, thank you very much. But… if it’s simply a formality, a written statement… what sort of things would I even need to state? I mean, surely the doctors would know what to do in any event. They are, after all, doctors. Is it a very long document? I haven’t much patience for paperwork, to be frank.
DOCTOR: It can seem overwhelming, I agree. And you are right to question it. It’s not about anticipating a specific event, but rather about being prepared. It’s also not about taking away the doctors’ judgment, but guiding it. The document itself isn't terribly long, usually a few pages. It covers things like whether you’d want aggressive life support—like a breathing machine—if you had a serious illness, or if you’d prefer comfort care, focusing on pain management. It also allows you to name a healthcare proxy—someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you can’t. Do you have any thoughts on who that person might be?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… so, someone to speak for me if I am… incapacitated? Honestly, it feels a bit… defeatist, even discussing this. But if I must, it would be my husband, naturally. He’s a practical man, though sometimes a bit… rigid in his thinking. I only hope he’d listen to my wishes, even if he doesn’t entirely agree with them. He tends to think he knows best. But aggressive life support… that sounds unpleasant. I would certainly not want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope. Though, defining "no hope" seems rather difficult, doesn't it? The doctors could always say there's a chance…
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid point, Marija. Defining "no hope" is incredibly difficult, and it’s something we’d discuss extensively with your husband and your medical team. The document isn't a rigid set of rules, but rather a framework for those conversations. It’s about expressing your values and preferences as clearly as possible. And it’s good you’ve thought about who your healthcare proxy would be. Having your husband in mind is a good starting point. We’ll need to ensure he understands his role and your wishes, and that he’s comfortable advocating for you. Before we delve further into the Advance Directive, perhaps we could quickly review your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my medical history… it’s rather unremarkable, truthfully. I’ve always been quite healthy, despite my… stature. I’m tall, you see. Very tall. It sometimes causes a bit of back pain, but nothing serious. I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, but I manage it with over-the-counter remedies. And I had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but I recovered fully. I don’t take any regular medications, and I don’t have any allergies. I’ve never had any major surgeries or hospitalizations, thank goodness. I suppose that’s all rather boring, isn’t it? No dramatic tales to tell.
DOCTOR: Not at all boring, Marija! A healthy history is excellent news. It’s good to know you’ve generally been well. It’s important to have that baseline information, even if it’s uneventful. You mentioned arthritis in your hands. Is that causing you any significant difficulty with daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, it’s more of a stiffness, really. Particularly in the mornings, and after I’ve been gardening. I do enjoy my garden, you see. Roses, mostly. They require a delicate touch. It makes it a bit… challenging to prune them sometimes. I can manage, of course, but it’s not as easy as it once was. I use a cream, as I said, and I try to avoid doing too much at once. But a beautiful rose is worth a little discomfort, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A beautiful rose is definitely worth a little discomfort. And it sounds like you’re managing it well. Just to clarify for my records, are you using a topical cream, or are you taking any oral medications for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, just the cream, Doctor. A simple ointment from the pharmacy. I am not one for taking pills unless absolutely necessary. They always have such unpleasant side effects, don't they? I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A warm bath and a bit of gentle stretching usually do the trick. Honestly, I believe half of the discomfort is simply… getting older. It happens to the best of us.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Marija. And you are right, sometimes a little self-care is all that’s needed. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. She lived to be quite old, though, nearly ninety. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away suddenly when I was quite young. And my sister… she had a touch of asthma as a child, but she grew out of it. Nothing terribly serious, really. No history of cancer, thankfully. I suppose we are a relatively healthy family, all things considered. Though, my aunt, on my husband's side, she had… I believe it was Alzheimer's. But that’s rather distant, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Marija. That’s helpful. And yes, your aunt’s history is something to be aware of. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can circle back to the Advance Directive if you'd like. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I have never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, years ago, but he quit thankfully. It’s a dreadful habit, quite unhealthy. I find the smell absolutely repulsive. I always encouraged him to stop, and eventually, he did. A much better life without it, I assure you. I prefer a good cup of mint tea, myself. Much more civilized.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, both about your own habits and your husband's successful quit. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A nice red wine, preferably. I am not a heavy drinker, certainly not. It’s more of a social thing, really. When we have guests, or a special occasion. I don’t drink every day, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. A civilized indulgence, nothing more. My husband enjoys a beer sometimes, as well. But we are both quite moderate in our habits. We prefer good food and good company, rather than indulging in strong drink.
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. I am quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take any medication without issue. It makes life much simpler, doesn't it? Some people are so sensitive, they have to be so careful. I am quite robust, thankfully. A strong constitution, I believe. No, no allergies whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That completes my questions regarding your medical history. It sounds like you’re generally a very healthy individual, which is wonderful. Now, would you like to return to the topic of the Advance Directive?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s get this over with. Honestly, it’s all a bit morbid, but if my daughter insists… perhaps you could explain it to me again, in simpler terms? What exactly would I be stating in this document? And what would happen if I didn’t have one? It all seems rather… dramatic. I am perfectly capable of making my own decisions, you understand. I just want to be clear on what I am signing, and what the implications are. A simple explanation, if you please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a clear explanation before making any decisions. Think of the Advance Directive as a safety net, Marija. It comes into play only if you are unable to speak for yourself—for example, if you were in a coma after an accident, or had a severe stroke. The document has two main parts. The first is your healthcare proxy—the person you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf. We've already discussed that—your husband, in this case. The second part outlines your wishes for treatment. Specifically, you can state whether you’d want aggressive life support—like a breathing machine or feeding tube—if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. You can also state whether you’d want comfort care only, focusing on pain management and quality of life. If you didn't have an Advance Directive, your family would make those decisions for you. But they might not know your wishes, and it could lead to disagreements or decisions you wouldn’t have wanted. It’s really about ensuring your voice is heard, even when you can’t speak for yourself. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… so, it’s not about deciding now what treatment I want, but rather giving my husband permission to make those decisions if I am incapacitated? That sounds… slightly less dramatic, I suppose. But what constitutes “no reasonable hope of recovery”? That seems rather subjective, doesn’t it? The doctors could always say there’s a chance, even if it’s a very slim one. And I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was truly no hope, but… defining that is difficult. I suppose the healthcare proxy part makes sense. I trust my husband, though he can be rather… stubborn. But he is practical, and he would likely consult with the doctors. Still, I wouldn’t want him to make decisions that I wouldn’t have agreed with. It’s all rather complicated, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, it is complicated. And you've hit on a very important point about "no reasonable hope of recovery"—it is subjective. That's why the document isn't a rigid set of rules, but rather a framework for conversation. Your husband, as your proxy, would work with the medical team to determine what a reasonable hope of recovery means in your specific situation. They would consider your overall health, your prognosis, and your quality of life. And you’re right to be concerned about him understanding your wishes. We can document those wishes in detail—for example, stating that you wouldn't want to be kept alive on a ventilator indefinitely, or that you prioritize quality of life over prolonging life at all costs. The more specific you are, the better. We can also discuss these wishes with him directly, ensuring he understands and is comfortable advocating for you. Would you like me to arrange a meeting with him?
PATIENT: Yes, a meeting with my husband would be wise. He needs to understand my wishes explicitly. He has a tendency to… interpret things his own way. And I would like to see this document before signing it, of course. I need to know exactly what I am agreeing to. And I want to be very clear that I do not want to be kept alive artificially if there is truly no hope of recovery. That is paramount. And… could you explain this POLST form as well? You mentioned it earlier, and I don’t want to be confused about the difference. Is it the same thing as this Advance Directive? Or is it something else entirely? I’d like to understand all my options before making any decisions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'm happy to explain the POLST form and ensure you understand all your options. The Advance Directive, as we've discussed, outlines your overall wishes for future care. The POLST form—Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is a bit more specific. It’s a medical order, signed by a doctor, that outlines your wishes for current treatment. It's typically used for people with serious illnesses or frailty, who are at risk of a medical crisis. It outlines things like whether you want CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. Unlike the Advance Directive, which is a general statement of wishes, the POLST form is a legally binding order that medical professionals must follow. Think of it this way: the Advance Directive is your long-term plan, while the POLST form is your immediate plan. You don't necessarily need both, but they can complement each other. For you, at this time, we can focus on completing the Advance Directive. We can discuss whether a POLST form is appropriate later, if your health situation changes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies things somewhat. So, the POLST form is for when I am already… unwell, while the Advance Directive is more of a preventative measure? That sounds… reasonable. I still think I prefer to focus on the Advance Directive for now. And regarding the healthcare proxy… what if my husband is unavailable when a decision needs to be made? Does it need to be a specific person, or could it be another family member? And what if we disagree with the doctor’s recommendation? Does the proxy have the authority to override their judgment? I’m just trying to anticipate all possible scenarios, you understand. It’s best to be prepared, even if it’s all rather… dramatic.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to anticipate those scenarios, Marija. It's always best to be prepared. Regarding your healthcare proxy, it can be a specific person, and you can also name an alternate proxy in case your husband is unavailable. An alternate could be another family member, a close friend, or anyone you trust to make decisions on your behalf. And yes, the proxy does have the authority to override a doctor’s recommendation, within reason. They are legally obligated to act in your best interests, based on your wishes. However, they can't demand treatment that is medically inappropriate or harmful. If there's a disagreement with the doctor, they can seek a second opinion or consult with an ethics committee. The goal is always to make the best possible decision for you, based on your values and preferences. We can document all of this in the Advance Directive, including contact information for your alternate proxy and instructions for handling disagreements with the medical team. Would you like me to bring some sample forms for you to review?
PATIENT: Yes, sample forms would be helpful. I like to see things in writing, before committing to anything. And… could you also explain the process for updating or changing the Advance Directive later? What if my wishes change? Or what if I simply want to add more details? I want to be sure I can easily modify it, if necessary. It’s all rather… complicated, but I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It’s reassuring to know I have options, even if it’s all a bit… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's good to be informed, and you're right to ask about updating the document. The Advance Directive is not set in stone, and you can change it at any time. All you need to do is create a new document, revoke the old one, and inform your doctor and healthcare proxy of the changes. We can also help you with the process, if you'd like. We can provide you with the necessary forms, review your changes, and ensure they are properly documented in your medical record. I’ll bring some sample Advance Directive forms, along with information on updating and changing the document. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment with you and your husband, so we can discuss your wishes in more detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… satisfactory. A follow-up appointment with my husband is wise, and the sample forms would be helpful. Thank you, Doctor. I still find the whole thing a bit… morbid, but I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. Perhaps, with a little luck, we can get this all sorted out without too much drama.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll take it one step at a time, and we'll ensure your wishes are respected. I’ll have my nurse bring those forms to you shortly. And I look forward to seeing you and your husband at your follow-up appointment.
