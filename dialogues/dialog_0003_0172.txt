DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, well. A visit, really. I just moved here, you see. Social thing, I suppose. Medicare requires it. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why they require it. It feels rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, Medicare has its… protocols. A “welcome to the area” visit, as it were. Regardless, we need to establish a baseline. It's standard procedure. So, let’s focus on your health. Are you currently experiencing any medical issues?
PATIENT: Issues? Well, at my age, one always has something. But nothing… pressing. Just the usual aches and pains. I’m not one to complain. It’s simply part of growing older, don’t you think? And frankly, I’m not entirely sure what you expect me to report. I feel… adequately functional. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: “Adequately functional” is… not a diagnosis, Ms. Engelhaupt. We need specifics. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… Oh, dear. Let me think. My back bothers me sometimes, getting up from chairs. And my knees, naturally. Everyone’s knees ache, don't they? It's hardly a revelation. I wouldn't trouble you with such trivialities, but you insist. Is that… all you’re going to ask about? Because truly, I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: We are attempting to establish a medical history, Ms. Engelhaupt. Back and knees… and anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Well, my eyesight isn't what it used to be, obviously. Hence the glasses. And I get… a little breathless sometimes, walking up hills. But really, I haven't been ill in years. A touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I pride myself on my constitution. Honestly, I suspect this whole thing is rather unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathlessness and declining vision noted. Any chest pain with the breathlessness?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Good heavens, no! I’d certainly remember chest pain. No, no chest pain. Just… a little winded. It’s hardly alarming. Really, doctor, are you quite sure you need to document all of this? It feels terribly… bureaucratic.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary for accurate record-keeping, Ms. Engelhaupt. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Diagnosed…? Oh, dear. Let me think. A touch of… high blood pressure, perhaps, years ago. But it was never anything serious. They put me on a little pill for a while, but I stopped taking it. It gave me such dreadful headaches. Honestly, I prefer to manage things… naturally. Is that satisfactory? I don’t recall any other… diagnoses. Not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Discontinued antihypertensive medication… noted. And your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, that’s a complicated question. My mother lived to a good age, I believe. Ninety-something. But she was a very… private woman. Didn’t share much. My father… well, he passed away when I was quite young. I don't recall much about his health, truthfully. A lot of… vague recollections. Is a lack of information… acceptable? I’m afraid I’m not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: Acceptable, but not ideal. Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t care for beets, but that’s a matter of taste, not allergy. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. It’s rather… fashionable, isn’t it? Is that all? Because I really must be going. I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: One final question, Ms. Engelhaupt. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Oh. Um. Well… sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis. A small dose, really. Just when it flares up. I believe it’s… Ibuprofen? Or Naproxen? Something like that. I get it at the drugstore. Honestly, I can’t recall the precise name. It’s all rather… unimportant, isn’t it? I can hardly remember what I had for breakfast. Are we quite finished now?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. It will be quick. Please sit back and relax. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and reflexes. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Must you? Honestly, I find doctors’ offices so… clinical. Very unsettling. But, very well. Get it over with quickly, if you please. And try not to poke too much. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Blood pressure… 140 over 88. Slightly elevated, not surprising given your history. Reflexes… Diminished, as expected for your age. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Alright. Everything appears… within reasonable limits for your age.
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. Does that mean I’m… healthy? Honestly, I didn’t expect a thorough examination. It was rather perfunctory, wasn't it? Is there anything else? I have a bridge game at three. Really, doctor, I’m quite pressed for time. .
DOCTOR: Given your age and reported history, everything appears stable. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I recommend lifestyle modifications: reduce salt intake, regular exercise, and stress management. I'm also noting the discontinued antihypertensive medication. I'm ordering a basic blood panel to assess kidney function and rule out any underlying issues. I will also need a copy of your medical records from your previous physician, if you have them. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to review the results and discuss further management. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. The nurse will provide you with the lab orders and instructions. Stop.
