DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I need a card so I can keep driving folks around for a ride-share company. They require a medical check-up, you see. It’s for a commercial driver thing. I hope it’s not too much trouble. I’d like to get it done and over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Right, a DOT physical. Yes, well, it is a requirement. It’s not trouble, exactly… it’s just thorough. We need to make sure you're fit to operate a vehicle safely. Alright. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like heart problems, diabetes, or anything that might affect your driving?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had a bit of arthritis in my knees for a while, but it’s mostly managed with some cream and stretching now. Nothing that stops me from working, thankfully. And… oh! Years ago, maybe twenty years back, my doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high, but I don’t take any pills for it. It seems to stay okay on its own, I think. I go for check-ups every so often, but honestly, I don’t remember all the details. Is that okay? I’m 70, you know. Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, age does have its… challenges. We’ll need to verify those details, of course. It’s important to have an accurate picture. So, no regular medication for blood pressure currently?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Not a single pill. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. And I walk every day, if the weather’s good. My daughter keeps telling me I should see a specialist, but… well, I feel fine. Really. I haven't had any problems driving, and I've been doing it for years. But I understand you need to be sure, Doctor. Do what you have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! I had my gallbladder out, ages ago. Must have been… thirty years or more. It was a simple procedure, and I recovered just fine. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major. I broke my wrist once, when I was a child, but that healed perfectly. I'm generally a healthy person, you know? I’ve been lucky, I guess. I don’t even get a bad cold very often.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not a one. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, I try to avoid taking medicine when I can, but I haven’t ever had a reaction to anything. My daughter always worries about that too, but I’m a pretty open book. Everything agrees with me, thankfully. It's one less thing to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your vision, hearing, blood pressure – just to get a baseline. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological check. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have a few rides scheduled for this afternoon, and I don’t want to keep my customers waiting. I’m a bit of a stickler for punctuality. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. First, let’s check your vision. Can you read this chart for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s a bit blurry. Let me adjust my glasses… Alright, let me see… is that… E? No, wait… F? It’s hard to tell. The letters seem to be dancing a bit. I think I need a stronger prescription, honestly. But I'll try my best. Is that a P? I'm really not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll definitely need to get an updated vision exam. Now, can you cover your left eye and read me the first line?
PATIENT: Oh, alright… Let me see… That’s… D, C, B, A… is that right? They’re still a bit fuzzy, but I think those are the letters. Yes, I’m quite sure. It's getting harder and harder to see up close, you know. I used to have such sharp eyesight. But I suppose everyone slows down eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Ms. Sciarotta. 148 over 92. We’ll want to monitor that.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad? I haven’t had it checked in a while, you see. My daughter always tells me I should go more often, but… well, I feel fine. Is it something I should worry about? Perhaps it’s just the stress of the exam. I don’t usually get so worked up. But I really need this card to drive. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: It’s not immediately alarming, but it’s higher than we’d like to see. Consistent elevated blood pressure can lead to more serious health problems, Ms. Sciarotta. And frankly, it does affect your ability to safely operate a vehicle. It's not something to dismiss. We’ll need to repeat the reading in a few minutes to confirm. And I strongly recommend you follow up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation and potential treatment. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. My daughter is going to be so worried when she hears about this. She always says I should be more careful. But I just want to keep working, you see? It keeps me active, and I enjoy it. I hope this doesn't mean I can’t get the card. Is there anything I can do… right now… to lower it? Perhaps some deep breathing exercises? I do yoga sometimes, though I haven't been going lately. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm willing to try.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are normal, but I’m hearing a slight wheeze in your lungs. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath or coughing?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I have been a little more breathless lately, especially when I’m walking uphill. And I’ve had a bit of a cough, mostly in the mornings. I just assumed it was allergies, you know? The pollen has been terrible this year. I haven't bothered with any medication for it. It's never usually this bad, but it's just a little tickle in my throat. Nothing to worry about, I thought. But… perhaps it is more than just allergies? Oh dear. What does this mean now? Is this going to affect the card?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sciarotta, with the elevated blood pressure, the wheezing, and your reported shortness of breath, I cannot clear you for a commercial driver’s license at this time. It would be unsafe for you and others on the road. I understand this is frustrating, but it’s my professional responsibility to ensure your health and safety. You need to see your primary care physician immediately for a full evaluation, including a possible chest X-ray and lung function tests. They can determine the cause of the wheezing and recommend appropriate treatment. Until you have a medical clearance from your doctor, you will not be able to obtain the DOT card. I can provide you with a list of primary care physicians in the area, if you would like.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I knew it. I just knew it. My daughter is going to say “I told you so.” This is terrible. I rely on that card for work! What am I going to do? This is… this is just awful. Yes, please. A list of doctors… anything. Just… help me figure this out. I really need to keep driving. Is there anything at all I can do in the meantime? Even just a temporary fix? I just… I don’t know what I’m going to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sciarotta. Unfortunately, there is no temporary fix for these conditions. Driving with elevated blood pressure and undiagnosed respiratory issues is too risky. I would be putting your safety, and the safety of others, at risk by clearing you. I strongly urge you to schedule an appointment with one of these doctors as soon as possible. They can assess your condition, provide appropriate treatment, and determine if you are fit to drive. Until then, I advise you to refrain from driving. I can also provide you with information on transportation alternatives in the area, if you would like. I realize this is not the news you wanted to hear, but I am prioritizing your health and safety. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… I need to process this. Thank you, Doctor. For your time. And… for being honest. I suppose I should call my daughter. She was right, as usual. .
