DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won't stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Hiccups lasting over two days – that can certainly be disruptive. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well, they’re pretty normal hiccups, I guess. You know, the kind where your chest jumps and you make that “hic” sound? They aren’t painful exactly, just…annoying. And they come pretty frequently, maybe every few minutes. I’ve tried holding my breath and drinking water, like everyone says, but nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent hiccups, not painful, and you’ve already tried some common remedies without success. Have you noticed anything that triggers them?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I honestly haven’t noticed anything specific. I was gardening on Monday, but I hiccup all the time, not just when I’m gardening. I ate a pretty spicy meal on Tuesday night, but that didn't seem to be it either. It just…started, and hasn’t gone away. I was having tea with my friend, Leila, yesterday afternoon, and they were happening then, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers that you've identified so far. And it started spontaneously, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It just…began. No particular event, no big shock or anything. Just…hiccups. It’s really quite strange, actually. I’ve never had them last this long before.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see in your chart your height and weight are noted as 153 centimeters and 73 kilograms. And you are currently uninsured. Do you have any other medical problems that you are aware of, like diabetes or heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m generally healthy, Doctor. A little overweight, perhaps, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart trouble, no allergies…just these pesky hiccups! I used to walk a lot more, but it's been so hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. Just a bit of chamomile tea sometimes to help me sleep. That's it. I really don't like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen to make sure everything feels normal. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want these hiccups to stop! Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in…and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal here as well.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s…reassuring, I suppose. It’s just so strange. It feels like something should be wrong, but you’re saying everything seems fine? I'm just a bit worried, honestly. Sometimes these things can be a sign of something serious, can’t they?
DOCTOR: You are right to be cautious and ask those questions, Ivette. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. While persistent hiccups can be a sign of underlying issues, it’s less common, especially given what you’ve described and the normal findings on the exam. However, since this has been going on for over two days, and you’ve tried some home remedies without success, it would be prudent to rule out some potential causes. I'd like to order a basic blood workup. This will include a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a kidney function test. It will give us a baseline and help us to identify any underlying issues, such as electrolyte imbalances or kidney problems, that might be contributing to the hiccups. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help rule things out, I'm happy to have some blood work done. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Where do we go from there?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send you to the lab just down the hall. They'll draw a small amount of blood, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe a medication called baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help to calm the diaphragm and stop the hiccups. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. If it doesn't work, we can adjust the dosage or consider other options. Does that sound like a reasonable plan, Ivette?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. A muscle relaxant… I suppose that makes sense. I hope it works. I’m really starting to get tired of hiccuping! What are the side effects of this baclofen? I want to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it's important to be informed. Common side effects of baclofen include drowsiness, dizziness, and weakness. You might also experience some nausea or constipation. It's important not to drive or operate heavy machinery if you feel drowsy. Less common but more serious side effects can include confusion, seizures, or changes in your mental state. If you experience any of those, please stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I'll write out clear instructions with the prescription, and the pharmacist can also answer any questions you may have. We'll start with a low dose of 5 milligrams three times a day, and we can adjust it as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing like that. 5 milligrams three times a day…okay, I can manage that. I'm just hoping it doesn't make me too sleepy. I still need to get some gardening done, when I can! And I really don't want to feel confused, honestly. Alright, well, let's give it a try. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I’m glad I could help. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy now. To summarize, we've ordered some blood work to rule out any underlying causes, and I’ve prescribed baclofen 5 milligrams three times a day. Please call the office if your symptoms worsen or you experience any concerning side effects. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check on your progress and review the blood work results. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. One week, to check on everything. Thank you again, Doctor Giganti. I really appreciate your patience and help. I’ll go get the prescription filled and hopefully, these hiccups will be gone soon!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I certainly hope so too. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. The nurses will be happy to help you with any questions regarding lab locations and paperwork. Have a good day, and please, try to rest and stay hydrated. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
