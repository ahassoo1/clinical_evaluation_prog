DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This is a waste of my time, but my insurance company made me come. It's...well, it's my stomach. Been having a lot of trouble with it. Just…constant diarrhea. And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested.
DOCTOR: Diarrhea, you say. And you've tried over-the-counter remedies with no relief. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about this “constant” diarrhea?
PATIENT: Constant is…constant. What do you mean? I go to the bathroom a lot. Like, several times a day. More than a normal person, obviously. And it's not just a little bit, if you get my drift. It’s…watery. And it's been going on for weeks now. I’m just…tired of it. And frankly, embarrassed to even talk about it.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say. And several times a day… more than usual. Watery, you mentioned. Any blood in it?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need to know everything? Look, I’m not a doctor. No, there isn't blood. I would know if there was blood. It's just…really bad diarrhea. Is that what you need to hear? I'm a busy person. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. However, I need to ask these questions to get a clear picture of what’s going on. It’s important to rule things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm tired, if that counts. And hungry, because obviously I’m not keeping much in. Honestly, it’s just…discomfort. A lot of discomfort. And I'm losing weight. But what else do you expect when you're running to the bathroom all day? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Weight loss… that is concerning. And fatigue. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I haven't felt hot. I mean, I'm generally cool-bodied, if that makes sense. I'm Tlingit, you know? We run cold. But no, no fever. Look, I don’t have time for a full medical exam. Just…what can you give me to make it stop? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. Where would I even go? I haven’t left the city in months. I’ve got commitments here, a business to run. It's not like I'm jet-setting around the world. This is just…happening. I'm starting to get a headache, if you want to know. From all this questioning.
DOCTOR: Any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? What kind of question is that? I eat what I always eat. Mostly fish, some berries when they’re in season… you know, normal food. I haven't been experimenting with exotic spices or anything. I'm not some tourist looking for a new culinary experience. Look, is this getting us anywhere or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve tried over-the-counter remedies… can you tell me specifically what you’ve tried?
PATIENT: Oh, for crying out loud. I told you! What part of "everything the pharmacy suggested" didn’t you understand? Immodium, I think? Something with bismuth, pink stuff… I don’t memorize medication names. They didn’t work. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm wasting my whole morning on this.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given the persistent diarrhea and associated weight loss, despite trying over-the-counter remedies, I’m going to need to order some tests. We need to rule out any underlying infections or conditions. I’d like to do a stool sample analysis and some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Seriously? More wasted time. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. The faster we find out what's wrong, the faster I can get back to my life. But I'm not happy about this. And I expect quick results. I don't have time to sit around waiting. Send the paperwork or whatever, just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab assistant come in to draw the blood and give you the container for the stool sample. It's important to follow the instructions carefully for the sample collection to ensure accurate results. I’ll also have my nurse provide you with a list of foods to avoid temporarily, to help minimize the diarrhea. It’s important to stay hydrated as well. We’ll get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ugh, more instructions. Fine. I'll do it. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just something I ate. This whole thing is… unnecessary. I understand. Fever, pain, blood. Got it. Just…hurry up with the blood draw. I have things to do. .
