DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop! Started a few days ago, and they’re…persistent, to say the least. Not painful, just…annoying! It's getting a bit much, really.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups, okay. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Started on…let me think…Tuesday, I believe. It was after I had lunch with Lani. We went to that new cafe down on Harbour Road, the one with all the flowers. Lovely little place, but these hiccups started shortly after. Coincidence, maybe? I don’t know. It’s just…odd. I haven't had hiccups this long in years!
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday after lunch with Lani at the cafe on Harbour Road. Good detail, thank you. And just to be clear, they’ve been continuous since then, or are they coming and going?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not continuous, thankfully. They come and go. Mostly after I eat, but sometimes just…randomly. Like just now, actually! See? It’s not a big deal, just…vexing. I’m just hoping you can figure out what’s causing it. It’s not like it’s life-threatening, but it's tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent hiccups, triggered by eating, but also happening randomly. And you said it started Tuesday. Have you noticed anything specific about what you ate on Tuesday, or anything else different about that day?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… We both had the fish and chips, I think. And a lemonade. Oh! And Lani was telling me some rather upsetting news about her grandson… he's having some trouble at school. I was quite concerned for her. Could that be it? Getting all worked up about her troubles? I've heard stress can do funny things to the body.
DOCTOR: Stress certainly can cause a lot of different symptoms. Okay, so fish and chips, lemonade, and a stressful conversation. Let's get a bit more information. Besides the hiccups, have you noticed anything else different lately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I've been a little bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am 86, you know. It’s probably just old age creeping up on me! And…my appetite hasn’t been quite as good. Not bad, just…smaller portions. I used to really enjoy a good meal, but these days I'm not as hungry. But honestly, Doctor, could all this be from hiccups? They seem like such a silly thing to cause all that.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing those things. And no, hiccups themselves don't usually cause fatigue or appetite loss, but they could be a symptom of something else going on. Let’s do a quick physical exam just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Anything to get rid of these pesky hiccups! Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just have a seat here, and we'll start with listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll take a look at your abdomen. Just relax, and breathe normally. I’ll need you to remove your shoes and socks if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. I’ve always liked doctors who take their time and listen properly. It makes you feel…cared for, you know? Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing deeply for me, please. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, although slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases, which is common with age. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful.
PATIENT: Alright. No pain here, Doctor. Just…a little bit soft, I suppose. I haven’t been as regular with my walking lately, being preoccupied with these hiccups and all. Everything feels…normal, as normal as can be for an old lady, anyway!
DOCTOR: Okay, just tapping lightly now. Doesn’t that sound odd?
PATIENT: It is a bit odd, yes! Like someone gently drumming. But not unpleasant. Everything feels…okay. No sharp pains or anything. Are you looking for something specific, Doctor? I don’t want to bother you if this is just a waste of time. I’m sure it’s just…old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Not a waste of time at all, Mirriam. I'm just trying to rule things out. Your abdomen is soft, no masses or tenderness. That's good. Now, just one quick neurological check. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions and have you do a few simple movements. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Questions and movements, no problem. I keep my mind active, you know. I do the crossword every day. Fire away, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy! Today is August 2nd, 2025. A lovely day, isn't it? Though a bit too warm for my liking. Though sometimes I get my days mixed up... is it really August already? Time flies when you're old!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s very common. And yes, it is August 2nd. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… we are in Doctor Morenomartinez’s office. A very nice office, I must say. Clean and bright. And you have lovely pictures on the wall! Is that Ethiopia? I think I’ve seen pictures of Ethiopia before.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are pictures of Ethiopia. You're doing very well. Now, could you squeeze my hands, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. Is that strong enough, Doctor? I used to do a lot of gardening, you know. Builds up the strength. Though not so much lately… these hiccups just sap all my energy!
DOCTOR: Very good, strength is good. Just going to check your reflexes now. This might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A little tap, you say? Yes, I felt that. Is that normal? My legs aren't as springy as they used to be, you know. Everything’s slowing down!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Mirriam. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Overall, the neurological exam is normal. Okay, based on everything, it sounds like you have a case of persistent hiccups without any obvious underlying cause. It’s likely that the stress you experienced with Lani, combined with eating, triggered them. While they're annoying, they aren't usually dangerous. We can try a few things to see if we can get them to stop. Would you like me to explain some options?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear it’s not anything serious! Yes, please, Doctor. I would be very grateful if you could explain some options. Anything to get rid of these pesky hiccups. I’ve tried holding my breath, you know. And drinking water upside down! Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. There are a few things we can try. First, we can try some simple maneuvers. Have you tried gargling with water?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I haven’t tried gargling! That sounds…interesting. I haven't gargled since I was a little girl, I think. I suppose it’s worth a try. Is there anything specific about how I should gargle? And what if it doesn’t work? Will I need some medication? I don’t like taking too many pills, you know. They always make me feel so drowsy.
DOCTOR: No worries about the pills, we’ll start with the simplest things first. For the gargling, just take a big sip of water and gargle for about 30 seconds, trying to get the water to the back of your throat. It can sometimes stimulate the vagus nerve and stop the hiccups. As for medication, there are a few options if the maneuvers don’t work, but they’re generally reserved for more persistent cases. We can discuss those if needed. Another thing that can sometimes help is a teaspoon of sugar. It also stimulates the vagus nerve. Would you be willing to try either of those?
PATIENT: Oh, sugar! Now that I can do. I always keep a little sugar bowl for my tea. Tea and sugar… a much more pleasant remedy than gargling! I’ll try a teaspoon of sugar right now, if you’d like. And if that doesn’t work, I suppose I could try gargling. But only as a last resort!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Give the sugar a try, and see if that helps. If the hiccups persist for more than 24 hours despite trying these methods, please call the office and we can discuss further options. We can also consider a referral to a gastroenterologist if they’re truly persistent and bothersome. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mirriam?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. Thank you for not dismissing my hiccups as just “old age.” I appreciate your time and patience. I’ll try the sugar and see what happens. Hopefully, this will do the trick.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, if they don't resolve, give us a call. Here's a summary of our discussion and instructions to take home with you. Get some rest, and hopefully, those hiccups will be gone before you know it. Have a lovely day!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye now.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mirriam. Take care!
