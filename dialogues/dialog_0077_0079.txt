DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, it’s about my bruising. It’s just… been worse lately, and I’m on a blood thinner, so it's a bit worrying, you know? I don’t wanna end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. Bruising, particularly while on a blood thinner, does warrant investigation. Could you tell me a bit more about this bruising?
PATIENT: Sure. It's… everywhere, kinda. Like, I bumped my arm the other day, just a little bump against the doorframe, and got a bruise the size of my hand. And I haven’t even done anything to my legs, but they’ve got these dark spots appearing. It’s not like… constant, but it seems to happen with the smallest things now. Or sometimes, even without bumping into anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Hainley, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. "Everywhere" is a bit vague, but the ease with which it’s happening is concerning. And you said it’s been worse lately… approximately how long have you noticed this increasing bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? Definitely within the last six weeks. Before that, it was normal, you know? A little bruise if I really whacked myself, but nothing like this. Now, it feels like I’m covered in a roadmap. It's just… annoying, but also scary, ‘cause of the blood thinner.
DOCTOR: A month ago, and a noticeable change. Okay. And you mentioned being on a blood thinner. May I ask what blood thinner you are currently taking, and what condition it is prescribed for?
PATIENT: Oh, right. It’s… Warfarin. And it’s for… atrial fibrillation. That's what the doctor told me, anyway. My heart flutters sometimes, and that's supposed to prevent a stroke. It’s been about two years now since they put me on it. I try to remember my levels, but honestly, I just let the doctor handle that part.
DOCTOR: Warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Alright. And you’ve been on it for two years. Has the dosage changed at all recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I get my blood tested every month, like they tell me to, and the doctor always adjusts it then if she needs to. But I haven’t had to go in for a special appointment or anything to change the dose. Same routine for ages. I just… this bruising is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent dosage, regular monitoring. And this bruising is the new development. Now, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I've been a bit more tired lately, but honestly, who isn't tired? And maybe a little more dizzy when I stand up fast, but that’s happened before too. Nothing I’d think was connected, you know? No nosebleeds, no blood in my pee or anything scary like that. Just… the bruising. And the tiredness, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, no nosebleeds, no hematuria… just increased bruising and some fatigue. Now, Ms. Hainley, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to take a look at some of these bruises. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I just… hope it's nothing serious. This Warfarin stuff worries me sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. We’ll do our best to determine the cause, Ms. Hainley. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Alright, let’s take a look at these bruises. This one appears to be a fairly recent hematoma, consistent with a minor impact. And this one seems a bit older, fading in color. No signs of infection. They do appear to be… numerous, and varying in stages of healing, as you described. Now, I'd like to order some routine blood work, including a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your Warfarin levels and rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… when will I get the results? I don't wanna wait weeks, you know? I've got stuff to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. We usually get those results back within 48-72 hours. We can either call you with the results, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: A phone call would be great. I really don't have time to come back again so soon. Hopefully, it's just a little adjustment to the medication. Okay, yeah, a phone call is best. Thanks, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hainley. I'll make a note to have the nurse call you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding—unusual nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, or prolonged bleeding from cuts—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No nosebleeds or anything like that, but I'll definitely watch out. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. I appreciate you checking me out. Hopefully, it's nothing.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hainley. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before the results come in. Have a good day, and please, take care.
