DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Fitness check. For… referee. I need paper for this, yes? To say I am okay. I want to finish quick, if okay.
DOCTOR: A referee physical, right. Yes, we have the form. But a quick check isn’t really how medicine works, Mr. Shanor. We need to go through some things to make sure you are okay. It’s for your safety, and frankly, the safety of others. Still, we can be efficient. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… yes. Work. Many small cuts, burns. Repairing… the insides of the furnaces. Hot. Not big, though. No broken bones. Illness… maybe flu, many years ago. Nothing… serious. I have insurance, private. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Insurance is helpful for billing, yes. The cuts and burns... are these recent?
PATIENT: Recent? Uh… always. It is the job. Last… maybe last month, small burn on arm. Nothing needing doctor, just… cream. Always careful. I wear gloves, mostly. It’s hot work, you understand. I try to be fast.
DOCTOR: "Mostly" careful isn't exactly reassuring, Mr. Shanor. We need to document everything. So, a burn on your arm last month that you treated yourself with cream. Any other injuries, even minor ones, in the past year?
PATIENT: Uh… twisted ankle. Six months ago. Stepped wrong. I rested it. Walked okay after a few days. No… no doctor for that either. I… I don’t like doctors if not needed. Is this okay? Can we just say I am fit? I have games soon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, with all due respect, repeatedly dismissing medical attention for work-related injuries is concerning. It's not about liking doctors; it's about making sure there isn't underlying damage that needs to be addressed. A twisted ankle could indicate ligament damage, and repeated burns, even small ones, can lead to infection or scarring. However… alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I think. I take nothing. Never needed. Sometimes, when I was small, my mother gave me… something for cold. But I do not remember. I eat everything. No problems. Is that okay? Can we do… the running test now? I want to finish.
DOCTOR: "Sometimes" is not a helpful answer, Mr. Shanor. We need to be certain about allergies. It's a basic safety precaution. Fine. Let's proceed, but I still need to conduct a basic physical exam. We need to check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. And yes, we will do a running test, but only after I've determined it's safe for you. Please, sit up straight on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Straight. I sit. Fast, yes? Quick check of heart, lungs, and then running. I have games. Very important games. I am a good referee. But need this paper.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Shanor. Now, I need you to stand up and walk for me. Then we'll assess your range of motion. And then we'll discuss the running test. Please, walk a few steps forward, and then back.
PATIENT: There. Done. Quick. It is okay. My ankle… a little stiff. But okay. Can we… test running now? I am faster when I warm up. This room is cold.
DOCTOR: "A little stiff" is an understatement, Mr. Shanor. And I noticed your limited range of motion. Before we even consider a running test, I need to examine your ankle more closely. Please, lie back down on the table. We're going to check for ligament stability. This isn’t optional. And frankly, your insistence on rushing this evaluation is raising my concerns.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Do what you need. But… be quick. And… gentle. My ankle… it is just old. Many years of… stepping. Refereeing is hard work, you know. A lot of running. A lot of… standing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tell me where it hurts, Mr. Shanor. Be specific. And I need you to be honest, even if it's just a slight discomfort.
PATIENT: There. On the side. When you push there. Not… bad, but… feels wrong. Like something is loose. I twisted it… six months ago, like I said. Just… didn't feel right after. But I kept working. Games to referee. Important games.
DOCTOR: That indicates possible ligament damage, Mr. Shanor. Specifically, I suspect a sprain of the anterior talofibular ligament. You really should have had this evaluated six months ago. Continuing to work on an unstable ankle can lead to chronic pain and further injury. Given your history and my examination findings, I recommend an X-ray to rule out a fracture and assess the severity of the sprain. And frankly, you are not fit to referee games in your current condition. You need to rest, ice, compress, and elevate your ankle. We can discuss a referral to a sports medicine specialist for further evaluation and treatment. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray? Specialist? No. No time. Games are… starting. I just need the paper. Say I am okay. I will be careful. I always am. I cannot miss these games. Please. Just say I am fit enough. I will sign something saying I take responsibility. Anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand you are eager to return to work, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your safety – and the safety of others. Providing you with a medical clearance when I know you have an unstable ankle would be irresponsible – and potentially dangerous. I cannot and will not do that. I'm documenting my findings: suspected ATFL sprain, refusal of recommended imaging and specialist referral. I will, however, provide you with a written report outlining my findings and recommendations, including instructions for rest, ice, compression, and elevation. You can take this to another physician if you choose. But I will not sign off on a fitness-for-duty form in your current condition. I strongly advise you to reconsider your decision and seek proper medical attention. Continuing to work on an injured ankle could lead to permanent damage. .
