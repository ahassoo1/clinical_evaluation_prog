DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… well, it's the weight. I’ve gained a considerable amount, and I simply can’t seem to explain it. It’s been happening for several months now, and it’s quite concerning. I haven’t changed my diet, and I’m as active as I usually am.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Several months, you say. And no changes to your usual diet or activity level?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I prepare most of my meals at home, and I walk my dog, Stefan, every day – about three kilometers, usually. It’s quite perplexing, to be honest. I really don’t understand what could be causing it. I’ve tried to be mindful of what I eat, but… nothing seems to make a difference.
DOCTOR: Three kilometers daily is… reasonable. And you’re certain there haven’t been any dietary changes?
PATIENT: Positive, Doctor. Absolutely certain. Perhaps a slightly larger piece of cake on my birthday in June, but that was… a single instance. Otherwise, the same meals as always. Chicken, potatoes, vegetables… the usual Lithuanian fare. My husband, Darius, confirms it as well; he eats everything I prepare. It’s truly baffling. I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable, and it worries me.
DOCTOR: Right. A single piece of cake… well, we’ll note it. And your husband’s eating habits are…relevant, I suppose. Let’s try to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me see… no, not really. My sleep has been…restless, perhaps. I wake up a couple of times a night, but I wouldn't say it’s terribly disruptive. And I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the warmer weather. Nothing significant, Doctor. I don't feel unwell, just…heavier. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Restless sleep and slight fatigue… common complaints, really. Are you experiencing any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Actually, yes. Now that you mention it, my ankles have been a bit puffy in the evenings. I thought it was simply due to being on my feet a lot during the day. It's not severe, but it is noticeable. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as it seemed minor. Does that mean something, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It could. Let’s move on to a more comprehensive review. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That is…a personal question, Doctor. No, not really. Everything is…regular, shall we say. No changes in that regard. I apologize for the…indiscretion, but I’m not accustomed to discussing such things. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: It's necessary to rule out certain conditions, Ms. Selbitschka. We are simply gathering information. No need to apologize. Any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes in…urination? Doctor, I assure you, everything is as it always has been. No increased frequency, no difficulty, no pain… I find these questions rather unsettling. Is there something specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you could explain why you are asking, I could be more helpful. I just want to understand what's going on with my weight.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed to a physical examination, then. It seems a direct assessment is required. Please step onto the scale for me, Ms. Selbitschka. We'll start there.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it is necessary. I do hope you find something, honestly. This is becoming quite distressing.
DOCTOR: 83 kilograms… and your height is 155 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. 155 centimeters. Is that…a lot, Doctor? I haven’t weighed myself in quite some time. Darius usually discourages me from it, says it only causes unnecessary worry.
DOCTOR: It puts your BMI at 34.5. Which is classified as obesity, Ms. Selbitschka. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit back.
PATIENT: Obesity… I knew I’d gained weight, of course, but…obesity. I simply want to understand why. It's not as if I've been indulging in unhealthy habits. This is…concerning.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138 over 85. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please lie back.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do hope you find something to explain this. It is all rather frightening, to be honest. I've never had any serious health concerns before.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Slight hepatomegaly noted. No splenomegaly. Now, let's check your extremities for edema. Please turn over onto your back.
PATIENT: Edema… you noticed swelling earlier, didn’t you? It’s worse at the end of the day, usually. Is hepatomegaly serious, Doctor? That sounds… alarming. I’ve never heard of that before. Please, explain it to me. Darius will be very worried if I come home with a list of unfamiliar medical terms.
DOCTOR: Moderate pitting edema bilaterally. Hepatomegaly means an enlarged liver, Ms. Selbitschka. It can be caused by a variety of factors, some more concerning than others. Given your weight, diet, and recent symptoms, I suspect it may be related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, we need further testing to confirm this. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, liver function tests, and a lipid panel. We’ll also need to rule out any underlying thyroid issues, so I’ll include a TSH test.
PATIENT: Fatty liver disease…because of my weight? So, it’s not something else, something…serious? And thyroid issues? This is quite a lot to take in. Blood work… that sounds reasonable, I suppose. Will it take long to get the results, Doctor? And what happens after that? I just want to know what I’m dealing with. Darius is waiting for me, you know. He’ll be beside himself.
DOCTOR: It can be caused by a number of factors. The blood work should take about three to five business days. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. For now, I recommend a modest caloric restriction and increased physical activity. We can discuss a referral to a registered dietitian if you’re interested. .
