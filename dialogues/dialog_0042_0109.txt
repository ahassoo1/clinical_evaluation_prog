DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but… yeah. Feels like a tight band, maybe? I don't know the names for things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, primarily at the back of your head. You describe it as a tight band. That’s helpful. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More… hmm. It's not a bad bad pain, you understand? Not like when I break a bone when I was younger, working on the trains. More… annoying. It comes and goes. Sometimes when I bend over, it gets worse. And… maybe when I get excited, talking about things? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Brum. So, it’s not a severe, debilitating pain, but rather a bothersome, fluctuating headache. It worsens with bending over and possibly with excitement. Does anything relieve the pain – lying down, perhaps, or taking anything for it?
PATIENT: Relieve… well, when I sit very still, it gets a little better. Lying down… not so much. I tried some… pills. My daughter, she gave me some, for regular headaches. They didn't do much, honestly. Little white ones. I forget the name. She always tells me to take them with food, though. I did that. Still didn't help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so resting quietly provides some relief, but the over-the-counter headache pills haven’t been effective. You mentioned little white pills – do you happen to remember anything else about the packaging, or what your daughter told you they were for, specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… the box was… blue, I think? And had pictures of people on it. Smiling people. She said they were for… tension headaches? That's what she called them. Regular headaches. Not… the bad ones. She worries about me, you know. Always has. She says I don’t take care of myself. Maybe she's right. It's hard to remember everything these days.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Brum. Tension headaches, taken as directed. It's good your daughter is looking out for you. Now, let's talk a little bit more about you and your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past – anything diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. When I was a young man, working on the rails, I broke my arm. Bad break. Took a long time to heal. And… I had a touch of pneumonia once, a long time ago. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve been a pretty strong man, all my life. Worked hard, ate good food. Mostly. No… no big illnesses. Just getting old, I guess. And this headache. It’s new.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm as a young man and a bout of pneumonia in the past. Otherwise, you’ve generally been healthy. And this headache is a new development. Have you ever had any surgery, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Surgery… no. Never had surgery. Not once. I always said, if I could avoid it, I would. My father… he had a bad experience with a doctor, a long time ago. Made him very wary. I always tried to heal naturally, if I could. Rubs and rests… that's what my mother taught me. Mostly worked, you know. Until now. This headache… it's different. It won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you’ve generally relied on natural remedies. Now, can you tell me about your family – do any of your relatives have similar headaches, or any other medical problems that run in the family?
PATIENT: My wife… she had migraines. Terrible things. Would have to lie down in a dark room for hours. But she's… gone now. Been gone a long time. My daughter, she doesn't get headaches much. Just the regular ones, sometimes. My son… he has high blood pressure, I think. The doctor told him to watch his salt. Other than that… not that I know of. We didn't talk much about illness, back in my day. Just tough it out, mostly. It was different times.
DOCTOR: Okay, your wife suffered from migraines, and your son has high blood pressure. Now, Mr. Brum, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. My father smoked, and it didn't do him any good. I always said I wouldn't touch it. Alcohol… I used to have a beer, sometimes, with my wife. Just one, maybe two, on a Saturday night. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, maybe ten years? Since she passed. It didn't seem right, drinking without her.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking and very limited alcohol consumption. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the headache pills your daughter gave you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just those little white pills. And I don't take them often, because they don’t do much. I tried one a couple of days ago, but it didn’t help. I mostly just try to rest when the headache gets bad. And drink water. My daughter keeps telling me to drink more water. She worries so much. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just those over-the-counter headache pills occasionally. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else – foods, pollen, animals?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat most things. Sometimes my eyes get a little itchy in the spring, when the flowers bloom, but that's just the pollen, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife, she was allergic to bees. Had to be careful around them. But me? No allergies. I’m a pretty simple man, you know. Don’t ask for much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, my bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 86, but not dangerously so. Your pulse is regular at 78, and your temperature is normal. Your heart and lungs sound clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. There's some mild tenderness in the back of your neck, and the muscles feel a bit tight. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and it does seem to reproduce some of the headache pain when you turn your head. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are intact. Everything seems normal neurologically.
PATIENT: That… that sounds about right. My neck does feel tight, especially when I’m thinking hard, or excited. And it hurts more when I turn my head. I didn't really think much of it, just figured it was old age. Is it… serious, Doctor? Is there something wrong? I don't want to worry my daughter. She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in to get it checked, Mr. Brum. Based on the exam, it doesn't sound like anything immediately serious, but it’s important to figure out what's causing the pain. It sounds like you’re experiencing what we call a tension headache, likely exacerbated by some muscle tightness in your neck. The elevated blood pressure is something we’ll want to keep an eye on, as well. Given your age and blood pressure, and to rule out anything more concerning, I'd like to order a few simple tests. A basic blood panel to check your overall health, and a CT scan of your head to make sure there’s nothing else going on. The CT scan will give us a clear picture of your brain and surrounding structures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… hmm. A CT scan… that sounds… complicated. Is it painful? And expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. I don’t want to be a burden. The blood panel… that sounds easier. But the scan… I don’t know. I just want this headache to go away. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe some stronger pills? Or a rub, like my mother used to make? I'm not sure about all this… complicated stuff.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Brum. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about cost and discomfort. The CT scan is painless – you simply lie on a table while the machine takes images. It’s a very quick procedure. Regarding cost, let's see what options we have. I’ll speak with the billing department and see if we can arrange a financial assistance program or a payment plan. We don’t want finances to be a barrier to getting you the care you need. As for the headache itself, stronger pills might provide temporary relief, but they don’t address the underlying cause. And while a rub might feel good, it’s unlikely to be a long-term solution. The CT scan will help us determine if there’s anything more serious going on, and if not, we can focus on managing the muscle tension with physical therapy and other conservative treatments. Would you be comfortable with me ordering the CT scan, with the understanding that we’ll explore financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Well… if you think it’s necessary. And if you can help me with the cost… alright. Order the scan. But please, Doctor, do what you can to keep the bill down. My daughter… she helps me, but she has her own family to worry about. I don't want to be a burden. And tell me, is it going to take long to get the results? I don't like waiting. It makes me anxious. Maybe… maybe I can take some of those little white pills in the meantime? Just to get through it?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. I’ll do everything I can to minimize the cost and will work with the billing department to explore all available options. And I understand your concerns about waiting – I’ll expedite the scan and have the results back to you as quickly as possible, usually within 24-48 hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, it’s perfectly safe to continue taking those over-the-counter headache pills as directed. They may not eliminate the pain completely, but they can help manage it while we wait for the scan results. I'll also give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, a low dose, to help with the neck tension. It's important to follow the instructions carefully, as it can cause drowsiness. To summarize: we’ve ordered a CT scan of your head, a basic blood panel, and a prescription for a muscle relaxant. We’ll schedule the scan for tomorrow morning. And I’ll call you as soon as we have the results. Do you have any questions at all, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Muscle relaxant… I’ll be careful with that. Don’t want to fall asleep while I’m trying to eat. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And please, really… do what you can about the bill. I appreciate it. Now… I suppose I should go home and rest. And maybe take one of those little white pills. If that’s alright? .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. Take it easy, and please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I’ll certainly do my best regarding the bill. We'll see you tomorrow morning for the scan. Take care of yourself, and rest well. .
