DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um, let me see... It’s about a letter. A letter for… a pet, I think? My daughter, she asked me to come get something signed. Honestly, she handles most of these things, and I just… forget. It’s something to do with owning one, isn’t it? A little fluffy thing. She said it was important.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding a pet, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A pet. Though I don't really do much with it, to be honest. My granddaughter mostly. It's a small dog, I think. A yappy one. Not my favorite, but what can you do? My daughter is very keen on these things, and she said I needed a letter from a doctor to… prove something? Honestly, it all sounds a bit silly to me. I’ve never had to get a doctor involved with a dog before.
DOCTOR: Right. A letter…perhaps related to emotional support animal registration, or something of that nature?
PATIENT: Emotional… what now? Look, I just need the letter, alright? Is that something you can do? My daughter said something about needing it for… renting, maybe? I don’t know, honestly. She's the one who researches all these things. I just show up when she tells me to. It’s a lot of fuss over a small animal, if you ask me. People used to just… have pets. No letters needed.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye, I understand it can be a bit confusing. It appears your daughter has requested a letter regarding an Emotional Support Animal, potentially for housing purposes. These letters are sometimes required by landlords to allow animals in properties that typically don’t permit them. To properly complete this letter, I'll need to ask you a few questions about your relationship with the animal and how it impacts your daily life. Do you mind if we proceed that way?
PATIENT: Oh, housing? See, she didn't tell me it was for housing! Always leaving out important bits, that girl. Fine, ask your questions, I suppose. But I'm warning you, I won’t remember much. And don't expect a long story. It's a dog. A small, yappy dog. What exactly do you need to know? It doesn't impact my life, if that’s what you're getting at. I see it when I visit my daughter. That's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wrye. We’ll take it slowly. Perhaps we can start with how often you visit your daughter and, when you are there, what interactions, if any, do you have with the dog?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I visit… maybe once a month? Sometimes two, if I’m feeling generous. And when I’m there… well, I try to avoid it, to be honest. It jumps on my legs, you see. Very excitable. My daughter tells me to pet it, to “bond” or something. So I pat its head a few times, quickly, just to be polite. It’s a bit much, all the fuss. Does that count as an "interaction"? I mostly just sit and watch television. Much more peaceful.
DOCTOR: Once a month, and you pat the dog briefly when prompted by your daughter. Do you notice any change in your mood or feelings when you are around the dog, even briefly?
PATIENT: Change in my… mood? Honestly, Doctor, I'm usually just trying to find a comfortable chair. It's a bit of a distraction, all that barking. And the jumping, as I said. It doesn't improve my mood, if that’s what you mean. It’s a bit… chaotic. I prefer a quiet afternoon, really. No small animals bouncing around. Is this really necessary? All this questioning over a dog… I just don't understand it. It’s making me a bit anxious, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye, and I apologize if these questions are causing you anxiety. We need to determine if you have a qualifying condition that would necessitate an Emotional Support Animal, and the letter is simply documentation of that. To clarify, have you ever been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, or any other mental health condition?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about my conditions? Honestly! What is this, a personal interrogation? Look, I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I get a bit tired, maybe. And I worry about my daughter, of course, every mother does. But a diagnosis? No. Never. I don't go around collecting diagnoses. My daughter might have mentioned something, she’s always going on about… wellbeing and therapy and all that. But that doesn't mean I have a problem. I just want the letter so she’ll stop pestering me! It’s all very unnecessary, if you ask me. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit insulting.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wrye. It seems your daughter may have suggested this letter based on her own observations. However, for me to complete this documentation ethically and legally, I need to assess if you personally experience a benefit from the presence of the animal that alleviates symptoms of a qualifying condition. Given that you’ve stated you don’t have a diagnosed condition and don’t perceive a significant benefit from the animal’s presence, I am unfortunately unable to provide this letter. It would be inappropriate to document a benefit that you do not experience.
