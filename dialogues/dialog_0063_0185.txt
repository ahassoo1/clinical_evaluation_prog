DOCTOR: Good afternoon. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Ms. Ambris, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it's my breath. It smells bad. Really bad. Honestly, it's embarrassing. I just… I need it fixed. Is that what you do here? Fix problems?
DOCTOR: “Fixed” is a rather… imprecise term, Ms. Ambris. We address medical concerns. And yes, halitosis – bad breath, as you put it – can be a medical concern. Though often it’s simply a matter of… hygiene. Now, tell me, how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh, great. Here we go with the hygiene lecture. Look, I shower. Okay? I really do. It's not like I live in a barn. It's been... a while, I guess. Maybe a couple months? It comes and goes, but lately it’s… consistently awful. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: “Consistently awful,” you say. Hmm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Like… what kind of changes? My job's the same. Highway maintenance, still picking up trash and patching potholes. My divorce is… still a divorce. It happened six months ago, if that's what you mean. Don't see how that would affect my breath. Honestly, the whole thing was a disaster. But, no, nothing different different. I eat the same stuff. Sleep the same amount. Maybe less, actually, since… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: We must consider all possibilities, Ms. Ambris. Even those you deem… irrelevant. Has your diet changed at all?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Look, I eat. Sometimes it's sandwiches, sometimes it's takeout. I don't sit around analyzing every single thing I put in my mouth. I'm busy. It's not like I'm a food critic. Is this going somewhere or are we just going to talk about what I had for lunch three days ago?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us attempt a more… direct approach. Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… am I coughing? No. Do I have a fever? No. Look, my breath smells bad, okay? That's the symptom. I don't get stomach aches or anything. I just... I'm tired a lot, but that's probably the job. And… well, my mouth feels kind of dry sometimes. But that’s probably just because I'm always outside in the sun. Does that help? Honestly, I'm not a doctor. I just want you to fix it.
DOCTOR: Dry mouth… that is potentially relevant. And fatigue… while likely attributable to your occupation, we shouldn’t dismiss possibilities. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Never have. I don’t like taking pills. Always felt like they just make things worse. I'd rather just deal with it, honestly. Look, I'm really not a fan of this whole… questioning process. Are you going to actually do something or just keep asking me about my life? Because I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Very well. A brief examination is in order. Please open your mouth. I’ll need to assess the oral cavity. And no, Ms. Ambris, I assure you I have more efficient uses of my time than to merely “question” patients.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. And try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Tongue appears slightly coated. Gums are… unremarkable. No obvious signs of decay, though hygiene could certainly be improved. Throat is clear. No visible inflammation. Now, Ms. Ambris, I’m going to document my findings. It appears we have a case of… rather persistent halitosis. While a definitive cause isn’t immediately apparent, several possibilities exist.
PATIENT: Possibilities? Like what? What’s wrong with me? And what are you going to do about it? I don't have time for a list of "possibilities", I need a solution. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, as I explained, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation. However, based on this preliminary examination, the most likely cause is a bacterial imbalance in the oral cavity. This can be influenced by factors such as diet, hydration, and… oral hygiene practices. It is unlikely to be a serious condition, but persistent halitosis can be indicative of underlying issues. I will prescribe a therapeutic mouthwash containing chlorhexidine. Use it twice daily for one week. Increase your fluid intake. And… improve your oral hygiene.
PATIENT: Chlorhexidine? Is that a pill? Because I told you, I don't do pills. And "improve my oral hygiene"? That's it? You're sending me home with a bottle of mouthwash and a lecture? Look, I work a hard job, I'm tired, and frankly, I don’t have time for a complicated routine. Is there anything else you can do? Honestly, this is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, I understand your… frustrations. However, I am a physician, not a magician. If the chlorhexidine mouthwash, used as directed, does not alleviate the issue after one week, I recommend consulting a dentist. They can assess for more complex dental problems, such as cavities or gum disease. I can also suggest a referral to a specialist, but that would involve additional costs and… appointments. Ultimately, the responsibility for your health rests with you. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. This has been a complete waste of time. Don't bother calling me. I'll just go to a dentist. .
DOCTOR: As you wish. Good day, Ms. Ambris. .
