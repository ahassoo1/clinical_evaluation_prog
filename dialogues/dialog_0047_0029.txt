DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Press. Now, you've come in today… what brings you to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it's… it's mostly my stomach, I guess. I just get full awful quick now. Used to be able to put a plate away, you know? Now, a few bites and I feel like I ate a whole feast. It’s been happening for… oh, I don’t know, a couple of months now, maybe a bit longer. Not much changes it, either.
DOCTOR: Right. Fullness quickly, for a couple of months. And it doesn’t seem to be related to what you’re eating, specifically?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve tried eating lighter things, heavier things… doesn’t seem to make a huge difference. Soup, steak, salmon… all the same. I get that full feeling pretty fast. It's just… uncomfortable, mostly. Not pain, just… stuffed. My wife keeps saying I’m not eating enough, and she’s probably right, but I just can’t seem to get much down.
DOCTOR: I see. And aside from the quick fullness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired, but I'm 88, Doctor! I figure some tiredness comes with the age, you know? No heartburn, no nausea… nothing like that. I haven't lost any weight, either. My wife weighs me now and then, makes sure I'm keeping on track. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. Well, they’re… regular enough. Not much different than usual, I suppose. Maybe a little… softer, now that I think about it. But nothing drastic. I don't like to dwell on those things, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, have you had any previous medical problems that I should be aware of, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist a few years back, fell off a ladder while fixing the roof. Nothing major, though. And the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, but nothing a bit of rest and a hot bath couldn’t fix. Oh, and I had a bit of a scare with my heart maybe ten years ago, but they said it was just a flutter and gave me some pills. I don’t take them anymore. Doctor told me to watch my salt, mostly. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anyone in your family have any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother lived to be 92, and she was pretty healthy for most of her life. My father… he had some trouble with his stomach, I remember that. Always complaining of indigestion. And my sister, bless her soul, had diabetes. She passed away a few years back. Other than that… not that I recall. We weren’t much for talking about medical things, back then. Mostly just dealt with it as it came.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Mr. Obarr, do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, the wife gets it for me. Says I need it for my bones. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when it’s really acting up, but that’s just ibuprofen, you know? Nothing regular. I try to avoid pills if I can. Don’t like the way they make me feel. Mostly just try to stay active and eat well. Well, try to eat, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, you said you haven't had any allergies to medications in the past?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asks when they give me something new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had any trouble. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don’t take much to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Obarr. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll feel your abdomen to see if there’s anything unusual. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to poking and prodding, you know? Been to doctors plenty of times in my 88 years! Just be gentle, if you would. My ribs are a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale… good. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit of a murmur, which is common at your age, nothing concerning. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just lie back and relax. Hmm… your abdomen is soft, not particularly tender. I don't feel any masses or enlarged organs. A little bit of… fullness, understandably, but nothing alarming. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's just… well, it feels full, like I said. Like I ate a big meal, even when I haven't. It doesn't hurt, just… uncomfortable. Feels a bit bloated, maybe. You know, like when you eat too much gas-producing food? But I haven’t eaten anything like that lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bowel sounds are present, though a little… sluggish. Not absent, but not as active as I'd like to see. Given your age and the fact you haven’t had any significant weight loss, and no pain, I'm not overly concerned about anything serious right now. However, the quick fullness, the bloated feeling, and the sluggish bowel sounds suggest we might be dealing with a bit of… functional dyspepsia – that’s just a fancy way of saying indigestion that isn’t caused by a specific disease. It can be quite common. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Functional… what now? Indigestion? Just… regular indigestion? After all this talking? Well, I suppose that’s good news, if it is. I just… I’m used to being able to eat a good meal, you know? It’s frustrating, not being able to enjoy my food. So, it’s not anything… serious? Not something I need to worry about getting worse?
DOCTOR: No, it's not something you need to worry about getting seriously worse. Functional dyspepsia isn't life-threatening. It’s more of a chronic discomfort than a disease. It's often related to how your stomach and intestines process food. Sometimes it’s triggered by stress, or certain foods, or even just a change in your routine. The sluggish bowel sounds could be contributing to the feeling of fullness. To rule out anything else, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your iron levels, and a stool test to rule out any infection. It's just routine, to be on the safe side. And I’m going to recommend a trial of some dietary changes and a medication called a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to help reduce stomach acid. It can help with the indigestion and bloating. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and… stool tests? Well, I suppose if you think it's necessary. I’m not a fan of giving samples, if you know what I mean. But alright, I’ll do it. If it helps figure things out. And medication… is it one of those with a lot of side effects? I don't want to be trading one problem for another. I just want to be able to enjoy my food again, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Obarr. The stool test is a fairly simple procedure, and we’ll provide clear instructions. As for the PPI, the side effects are generally mild – sometimes a little bit of nausea or diarrhea, but they're usually temporary and go away on their own. We’ll start with a low dose to minimize any potential side effects. The aim is to see if reducing the acid helps to alleviate your symptoms. If it does, we can continue the medication for a few months, and then potentially taper it off. If it doesn't help, we can explore other options. I'll write you a requisition for the blood and stool tests, and a prescription for the PPI. I’d also like you to keep a food diary for a week, noting everything you eat and drink, and any symptoms you experience. It can help us identify any potential triggers. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A food diary… That sounds like a bit of work, keeping track of everything. But alright, I’ll try. I always did like a good record, I suppose. And the PPI… what if it doesn’t work? Are there other things you can do? And… will the tests cost a lot? I'm on a fixed income, you know. My wife handles the bills, but I don't want to cause her any extra trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Obarr. We can discuss the potential costs with the clinic’s billing department. They may have some programs available to help with the cost of testing, especially given your fixed income. I'll make a note of that in your chart to ensure they reach out to your wife. As for other options, if the PPI doesn’t work, we could consider things like dietary changes – avoiding fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods – and over-the-counter remedies like antacids. We can also explore the possibility of a referral to a gastroenterologist if your symptoms persist or worsen. In the meantime, let’s focus on the blood tests, the stool test, and the food diary. Give those a try for a few weeks, and then we can reassess. If your symptoms are getting significantly worse before your next appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We can always schedule an earlier appointment if needed. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. And thank you for checking on the cost of the tests. My wife will be glad to hear that. I’ll give the food diary a try, and see if I can figure out what’s causing all this trouble. Hopefully, it’s just something simple. Thank you again, Doctor Press. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. Remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And I hope you find some relief soon. Take care, and have a good day.
