DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. It’s not like I feel sick.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Well, high blood pressure isn't always something you feel, that's true. But it's still important to address. It can cause problems down the road, even if you’re feeling perfectly fine now. The nurse did mention something about a recent reading, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. At the pharmacy. Said it was…high. Look, I work outside, it was hot. Probably just from that. I don’t sit around all day, you know? I’m a civil engineer tech – I’m doing things. Not everyone just…lets themselves get unhealthy.
DOCTOR: I understand you're active, and that’s excellent. But heat and activity can temporarily raise blood pressure, yes, but it shouldn't be consistently high. We still need to get a better idea of what's going on. Do you have any history of high blood pressure in your family?
PATIENT: My grandma, on my mom’s side, maybe. She was…old. Lots of things were wrong with her when she got old. And my uncle smokes. Does that count? He doesn’t take care of himself at all. But nobody young, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about you?
PATIENT: What about me? What do you mean? I just told you, I work. I’m healthy. I eat…fine. I don’t sit around eating junk food all day, if that’s what you’re getting at. My husband cooks. He’s pretty good.
DOCTOR: I simply meant, do you have any medical conditions yourself?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that’s it. Honestly, I think people make too much of this whole doctor thing. You just tell them everything, and they poke and prod. It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Dudeney, even if you feel perfectly healthy, a check-up is important. It’s not just about what you feel now; it’s about preventing problems later. Now, I’d like to get a few more details about your typical diet. When you say your husband cooks, what does that usually consist of?
PATIENT: Look, he cooks normal food. Meat, potatoes, vegetables…sometimes pasta. He’s not one of those fancy chefs. He makes a good steak. And chili. Is this really necessary? I’m wasting my whole morning here.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Dudeney. We need to establish a baseline. Let’s just take your blood pressure again, and then we can talk a little more about your lifestyle. It'll only take a moment. Then, if it is elevated, we'll discuss some further steps.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. Honestly, I don’t understand why I even bother with this. It's probably just stress from work. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Try to relax. Deep breaths. Hmm. 148 over 92. That is elevated. As I suspected. Now, tell me about your stress levels at work. What specifically is causing you stress?
PATIENT: Elevated? See? I told you it was work. We're behind schedule on the new highway project, the budget keeps getting cut, and the foreman doesn't listen to anything I say. It's a whole mess. I'm the one who has to make everything work, and nobody appreciates it. It's frustrating, okay? It's extremely frustrating. I haven't even had a day off in weeks.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, work-related stress, long hours, feeling unsupported... That certainly contributes. Now, are you taking anything for stress?
PATIENT: No! What do you mean, taking something? Like pills? I don't take pills. I handle things. I don't need medication to deal with a little stress. That's ridiculous. I drink coffee, if that's what you’re asking. Lots of it. Keeps me going. But pills? No. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Coffee, okay. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Not every weekend. And I definitely don’t get drunk or anything. My husband drinks beer, mostly. He likes his sports. It's not like we have a problem or anything. Honestly, you're asking a lot of personal questions. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I'm gathering information to get a complete picture of your health. It's all relevant. Now, let's move on to physical activity. You mentioned you work outside. Could you describe a typical day?
PATIENT: Look, I walk around all day. I check on the progress of the construction, I look at blueprints, I talk to the crew. I climb hills, sometimes. I lift things, not heavy things, but things. It's physical work, okay? It’s not like I sit at a desk all day. I'm always on my feet. It's not like I need to join a gym or something. I get plenty of exercise. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, your blood pressure is elevated, and while your activity level is good, the stress and coffee consumption are likely contributing factors. I’d like to start you on a low-dose medication to help control it. We can also discuss some stress management techniques, although I suspect you won’t be overly enthusiastic about those.
PATIENT: Medication?! Absolutely not. I am not taking medication. You’re trying to put me on pills for a little high blood pressure. I told you it’s the stress! Fix the stress, and the blood pressure will go down. I don't need pills. This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, please. We can discuss alternatives, but ignoring a consistently elevated blood pressure is not an option. It can lead to serious complications. I understand you’re reluctant, but I am recommending treatment. If you absolutely refuse medication, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a second opinion and further evaluation. But I strongly advise against simply hoping it goes away on its own. Would you like me to write a referral?
