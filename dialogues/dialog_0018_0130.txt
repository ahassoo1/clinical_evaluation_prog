DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re 73 years young. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well… it’s my family, you see. Lots of… trouble with hearts. My mother, she had a bad heart. And my brother… he wasn’t so lucky. I just want to make sure I’m okay. Get some peace of mind, you know? I don’t feel bad now, but… it’s always in the back of my head.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. Family history is very important, and it's wise to be proactive about your health, especially given your concerns. So, you’re coming in today primarily due to a family history of heart problems – your mother and brother, if I understand correctly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mother, and my older brother, Thomas. He… he was too young when it happened. I don’t want… I don’t want the same thing. I just want to know if I need to worry. Are there tests… to see if I’m gonna have problems? I don’t even know what to ask, really. It's all kinda new to me.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schwer. It’s natural to feel unsure when navigating these concerns. We can certainly discuss some tests to assess your risk and provide you with peace of mind. First, let's delve a little deeper into your family history. Could you tell me a bit more about your mother's heart condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, she was always tired. Just… tired. And she had trouble breathing when she walked. Even just to the store. The doctor said it was her heart, something about… being too big? I don’t remember the words. She was on pills for it, for many years. And then… then it just stopped. She was in the hospital. It was quick. And your brother… he had chest pains, I think. But he didn’t go to the doctor soon enough. He was a stubborn man, Thomas. Always said he was fine.
DOCTOR: I see. So your mother experienced fatigue and shortness of breath, and was diagnosed with a heart condition involving enlargement of the heart, and she was on medication for years. And your brother experienced chest pain but unfortunately delayed seeking medical attention. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, turning to you, have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or palpitations – a feeling of your heart racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: No, not really. No chest pain. Sometimes I get a little winded walking up hills, but I’m not a young man anymore, you know? I work hard, I’m a salesman… lots of driving. So I get tired sometimes. But it’s just… normal tired. Nothing like my mother. And my heart feels… normal. It beats, I guess. I don’t pay much attention to it, to be honest. Never had reason to, before now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schwer. It's helpful to understand that you haven’t experienced any concerning symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath. Given your family history, I would like to perform a physical exam, including listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your pulses. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. You're the doctor, right? I just want to make sure everything’s okay. And maybe… get a little peace of mind, like I said. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schwer. If you'll please have a seat and lie back. Your blood pressure is 142/88. Pulses are regular and strong in all extremities. I'm hearing no murmurs or extra sounds with your heart, and your lungs are clear. I do note a slight asymmetry in the strength of your pulses, a bit weaker on the left side compared to the right, but not alarmingly so. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol, diabetes, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High cholesterol… I don’t think so. I had a doctor once, a long time ago, tell me to watch my weight, but he never said anything about cholesterol. Diabetes… no, never been told that. I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit maybe twenty years ago. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy. Other than that… not much. I’m pretty healthy, for an old man, I guess. I try to eat right, mostly. And I walk when I can. Work keeps me busy, too. Lots of driving, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schwer. That's helpful. So, no history of high cholesterol or diabetes, you had your appendix removed in childhood, and you’ve quit smoking twenty years ago – excellent! Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands sometimes, when they get really bad. It's… ibuprofen, I think. The white pills. And sometimes a little something for my stomach, if I eat something bad. But that's it. Nothing regular. Just when I need it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. My wife… she was always taking pills. I don't want to end up like that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's wise to be mindful of medication use. Given your family history and your current health status, I recommend a few tests to further assess your cardiovascular risk. We should start with an electrocardiogram to check your heart’s electrical activity. A basic metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. I'd also like to order a chest X-ray to get a visual of your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. ECG, blood tests, chest X-ray… I trust you. I just want to know if I'm gonna end up like my brother. If there’s something wrong, I want to know. So, yes. Go ahead and order those tests. When do we do them? Can we do them today?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Schwer. I’m glad we’re on the same page. Yes, we can certainly get those tests done today. The ECG can be performed right here in the examination room; it only takes a few minutes. Then, our phlebotomist, Maria, will draw blood for the basic metabolic panel and lipid panel. And we'll send you over to radiology for the chest X-ray. It should all be completed within the next hour or two. While we wait for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty clearly. Just… hope it's nothing bad, I guess. My wife… she always said worrying was half the battle. But it's hard not to worry, you know? Especially with my family history. Okay. Let's get those tests done, then. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. It helps just talking about it, you know?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Schwer. And you are right – talking about it is often the first step. I understand your anxiety, and we will do everything we can to get you answers and a plan to manage your health. Alright, let’s get started with the ECG. I will just place these electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. It won’t be uncomfortable at all. Maria will be along shortly to draw your blood, and she'll direct you to radiology after that.
