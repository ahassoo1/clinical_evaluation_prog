DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my skin, you see. It's been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be very bothersome. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks now. Maybe a month? Time gets away from me these days. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs, even my back. Not my face, thankfully. And it’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it’s been about a month, all over your arms, legs, and back, but thankfully not your face. And it’s worse at night. Does anything seem to trigger the itching, or make it better?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I haven't really noticed anything specific starting it, no. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn’t help. Cool showers do feel good for a little while, but it comes back pretty quickly. Nothing really makes it stop, you know? It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific trigger you’ve identified, you switched detergents without relief, and cool showers offer temporary comfort. And it’s pretty constant, despite the cool showers?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty constant. It’s not like, a sudden flare-up then nothing. It's just…always there, a little bit. Sometimes stronger, sometimes weaker. It’s just…annoying is what it is. And I’m starting to get little bumps, too. Not big, just tiny little red bumps where I scratch. I don’t want it to get infected or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itching is very frustrating, and you’re right to be concerned about potential infection from scratching. Let’s take a closer look at your skin. Could you please roll up your sleeves and lower the back of your shirt so I can examine your arms, legs, and back?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. Here, let me just… Be careful, dear, it’s a little chilly in here. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if it feels cold. I’m not used to doctors poking and prodding!
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some small papules – those are the little bumps you mentioned – and a bit of redness, consistent with irritation. It doesn't look like anything acutely alarming, but we’ll want to figure out the cause. I'm also going to check your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, dear. Lymph nodes? Are you looking for swelling? I don't know much about all this medical stuff, you see. I just want it to stop itching!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Lymph nodes are small glands that can swell if your body is fighting an infection or reacting to something. It’s a routine check. Okay, your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. That’s good. Now, have you been using any new soaps, lotions, or perfumes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really new, new. I always use that Palmolive soap, the green one. And that Aveeno lotion, for dry skin. But… oh! My granddaughter, Elena, she brought me a new hand cream from her trip to Mexico. It smells really nice, like… citrus? I’ve been using that on my hands a lot. Maybe that's it?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information! A new hand cream could certainly be a possible trigger. Sometimes fragrances or ingredients in those products can cause a skin reaction. Do you remember the name of the hand cream?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, I am terrible with names. It had a pretty label… flowers and stuff. Elena said it was made with some kind of natural oils. I think she said "aloe" was in it… and something else… oh, it's on the little jar in my purse! Here it is! "Manos de Oro" – Golden Hands. That's what it says. See? It smells lovely, but maybe it's causing all this trouble.
DOCTOR: “Manos de Oro,” alright. Looking at the ingredients here, it does contain some fragrance components, and also some essential oils. While natural, essential oils can sometimes cause allergic reactions in sensitive skin. It’s very possible this is the culprit. Now, have you ever had any allergies before – to foods, medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I don’t think so, not that I remember. I used to get a little itchy sometimes when I was a kid, playing in the grass, but my mother just used calamine lotion. Nothing serious. I’m not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. The doctor always asks, and I always say no. I don’t feel like I have allergies, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. So, no known allergies, and this itching is different from anything you’ve experienced before. Based on what you’ve told me, and the fact that it started around the time you started using the “Manos de Oro” hand cream, my suspicion is that you’re experiencing contact dermatitis – an allergic reaction to something that’s touching your skin. To be sure, we could do a patch test, but given the timing and your description, I think it’s likely this hand cream is the cause. My recommendation is to stop using the “Manos de Oro” hand cream immediately. And for now, we’ll treat the itching with a mild topical corticosteroid cream – that will help reduce the inflammation. I'll write you a prescription for hydrocortisone 1% cream. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Hydrocortisone… okay. Topical… that means I rub it on, right? Not take it? And it will help with the itching? That sounds good! No, I don't think I have any questions… it sounds pretty straightforward. Stop the cream, rub on the other cream… Is there anything else I need to do? Like, should I wash all my clothes?
DOCTOR: Yes, topical means you rub it on your skin. It's a mild cream that will help reduce the inflammation and itching. You don't need to wash all your clothes, but it's a good idea to wash the clothes you were wearing when you first started using the hand cream, just in case there’s any residue. And try to avoid anything with strong fragrances or harsh chemicals while your skin is healing. I'm also going to recommend a bland moisturizer – something like Cetaphil or Eucerin – to help restore your skin's natural barrier. Use that several times a day, even after you wash your hands. Let's see how you do with this for the next two weeks. If the itching doesn't improve, or if it gets worse, please call the office, and we can discuss other options, such as a referral to a dermatologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, dear. Stop the cream, wash my clothes, use the bland moisturizer… I can do that. Cetaphil… I think I've heard of that. Two weeks… okay. And if it doesn't get better, I call. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I was getting so worried. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? Or should I just pick up the prescription?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your worries. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at the moment. The prescription is being sent to your usual pharmacy. Just pick it up when you have a chance. Here's a little handout summarizing everything we discussed – the instructions for the hydrocortisone cream, recommendations for the moisturizer, and when to follow up. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, Carla!
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been a lifesaver! I will, and I will definitely call if things don't improve. Have a good day to you too, dear. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. Take care! .
