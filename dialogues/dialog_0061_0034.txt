DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Emileigh. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too. I, uh... I just moved here. For work, I think? I'm… new to the area and, well, I gotta get all the healthcare stuff sorted, you know? Like, check-ups and… things. I have Medicare. Does that make sense? I don't really remember much about setting things up.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh! Moving is a big undertaking, and getting your healthcare established is definitely important. Medicare is great, we can definitely work with that. And don’t worry about remembering everything, that's what I'm here for. So, besides getting things "sorted" with Medicare, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I mean, I feel okay. A little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? Work is… busy. Lots of machines and… fixing things. Mechanical stuff. I'm a technician. Honestly, I don't really think anything's wrong. I just figured I should, like, get checked out since I'm here and new. It's probably nothing. Does that help? I forget if I'm explaining this right.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's good you're thinking proactively about your health, even if you're not feeling particularly unwell. It's always good to establish a baseline. "A little tired sometimes" is a good place to start. Can you tell me a bit more about that tiredness?
PATIENT: Um... it's just... like, at the end of the day. Really tired. Not like, can't-stay-awake tired, just... want to lay down. And sometimes in the mornings it takes a bit to, uh, wake up. Not every day though. It's hard to explain. I work long hours, so maybe it's just that? I dunno. I keep kinda forgetting things too, but… I always have, kinda. Is that important? I don't want to bother you with stuff if it's not.
DOCTOR: No, you're not bothering me at all, Emileigh. It's my job to listen, and everything you tell me is helpful. Okay, tiredness at the end of the day, some difficulty waking up… and you’ve noticed some forgetfulness. You said you've always been a bit forgetful, is it worse recently, or about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe a little worse? Like, I forgot where I parked the car yesterday, and that’s… usually not me. Small things like that. And I had to ask my husband what day it was last week. He thought it was funny, but… I don’t really like forgetting things. It makes me feel… off. Sorry, I’m rambling. I just… don’t remember things clearly. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all. It's completely understandable to be frustrated when your memory isn't cooperating, and it's good you're noticing these changes. Okay, so a recent increase in forgetfulness – misplacing things, difficulty recalling dates. To get a better picture, let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. No fever, I don’t think. No cough. Maybe a little headache sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? I eat okay… my husband cooks mostly. And I drink water. Not much soda. I think. Oh! My vision gets blurry sometimes, when I’m looking at screens for too long. I do a lot of work on computers. Does that count? Sorry, I’m probably telling you too much.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing great, Emileigh. It's helpful to have all this information. Okay, no fever or cough, occasional headaches, good diet and hydration, blurry vision with screen time... We're building a good picture here. Now, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… maybe? I haven’t really been paying attention, to be honest. My husband says I’m not eating enough, sometimes. He worries. I kinda just… eat when I remember. I’ve been busy with work, so… I don’t really have a lot of appetite, I guess. I don’t think I’ve lost a lot of weight. But I'm not sure. It’s hard to keep track. Sorry. I'm really bad at this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Emileigh, don’t apologize. It's perfectly fine to not have all the answers. We can figure things out together. Okay, possible decreased appetite and weight, or perceived weight loss. Just a couple more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um... I don't think so. My mom had... something with her heart, I think. But I don't have that. I've never really been sick, honestly. I had the flu once, a long time ago, but that's about it. No high blood pressure or… anything. I don't remember ever being told I had anything. I've gone to the doctor before, for check-ups, but they always said I was healthy. Or at least, they didn't say I wasn't. Does that make sense? I'm probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Emileigh. Knowing what hasn't happened is just as important as knowing what has. Okay, no known medical conditions, mother had heart issues. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Um… no. Never. I’ve never had to have surgery. I mean, I chipped a tooth once when I was a kid, and the dentist fixed it, but that wasn’t… a surgery, right? I don’t like hospitals. Or doctors, really. But… I know I need to come. So, no. No surgeries. I think. I'm pretty sure. I'm trying to remember everything, I promise. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emileigh. No surgeries. And it’s completely normal to feel anxious about doctor's appointments. Okay, and just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Um... let me think. No. Not really. Sometimes I take… ibuprofen for headaches, if they're really bad. But that's about it. My husband has some stuff for his blood pressure, but I don’t take any of that. No vitamins or… anything. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t really need vitamins, I think. No, nothing regular. I promise. It's just ibuprofen sometimes. Is that okay? Am I forgetting something?
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for headaches only. That’s good to know. You are not forgetting anything that I can tell right now. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Besides your mother's heart condition, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um... my grandpa on my dad's side... he had... something with his brain, I think. Like, he got confused a lot towards the end. But I don't know what it was. And my aunt… she has diabetes, I think. But that’s about it. Mostly everyone’s pretty healthy, I think. Or at least, they don’t talk about being sick. It’s hard to remember everything, sorry. I feel like I’m just rambling and not making any sense. Is this helpful? I really want to help, I just… I don’t have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Emileigh. This is helpful. Knowing about your grandfather’s confusion and your aunt’s diabetes is good information. It’s okay if it’s not perfect; we’ll piece everything together. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Um... no. Definitely not. I don't smoke. My husband drinks beer sometimes, on the weekends. But I don't. And no, no drugs. Ever. I don't like any of that stuff. I drink water. And… sometimes tea. Is that okay? I think I’ve answered everything. I'm probably forgetting something important, aren't I? I just… I don't have a very good memory. Sorry. I hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not wasting my time at all, Emileigh. And no, you're not forgetting anything crucial. It’s perfectly alright to not have a perfect recollection of everything. Okay, one last thing, and this might seem personal, but it’s important. Are you currently experiencing any significant stress or anxiety in your life?
PATIENT: Um... yeah. Actually, yeah. Work is... stressful. A lot of responsibility. And... moving here, away from my family... it’s been hard. I miss them a lot. And... I worry about things a lot. Like, forgetting things. And... not being good enough at work. I try not to think about it, but... it's hard. I guess I'm anxious. Is that okay to say? Sorry. I don't normally talk about this. It's just... hard. I feel like I’m rambling again. And I’m probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to say that, Emileigh. And it’s completely understandable to feel stressed and anxious with a new job and a move. It takes a lot of adjustment. It sounds like you're under a lot of pressure. Okay, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a really good picture of what’s going on. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Yeah, that’s okay. If I have to. I don’t really like doctors, but… I know I need to. What do you have to do? Just… tell me what's going to happen, okay? I get nervous easily. Is there anything I need to do before? Like, should I empty my bladder? I always forget these things. Sorry. I really hope this doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. I understand. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as we go. It won't take long, and you don't need to do anything specific beforehand. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Then, I’ll take your blood pressure and temperature. After that, I’ll do a quick neurological exam—basically, I’ll check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. And finally, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Um... yeah. That sounds... okay. If you're going to explain everything. And you won't… poke me too hard? I bruise easily. And... is it okay if I close my eyes while you listen to my heart? It makes me less nervous. Sorry. I just… get anxious easily. I hope I'm not being a bother. I really hope this doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. We’ll go very gently, and you can close your eyes whenever you feel comfortable. It's perfectly okay to be anxious, and you're not a bother at all. I'll explain each step as I go, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and rest your arm on the armrest?
PATIENT: Okay. Um... is it going to hurt? Or feel… tight? I don't like things being tight. And... what if it's high? Does that mean something is wrong? I always worry about things. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I hope this doesn't take too long. My arm feels a little numb sometimes. I hope that’s not important.
DOCTOR: It might feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t hurt. It’s just like a squeeze. And it’s okay if it’s a little high; we'll check it again if needed. A single reading isn't always accurate. It just gives us a starting point. Okay, just relaxing your arm for me. And don’t worry about the numb feeling, it’s likely just from the position of your arm. Okay. Your blood pressure is 130/85. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Everything looks good so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Um… okay. What are you listening for? Does that mean something is wrong if you hear something? I always worry about bad things. And… is it going to be cold? The stethoscope feels cold. My chest feels a little tight sometimes. I hope that’s not important. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. Is this going to take much longer? I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: It’s just a routine check, Emileigh. I’m listening to make sure your heart and lungs are clear. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but the stethoscope is cool, you're right. Okay, take another deep breath for me... And again... Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. There’s no wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m just going to shine a light in your ears and look in your throat. Can you open your mouth for me and say “Ah”?
PATIENT: "Ah..." Um… is something wrong if my throat looks red? I always get sore throats when I'm stressed. And… is it going to be bright? I don't like bright lights. My eyes are sensitive. And… is it going to be cold? The light feels cold. I hope I'm not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. Is this almost over? I have to get back to work later. I really hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: It's just a quick look, Emileigh. Your throat is slightly red, but that's not unusual with stress and a little dryness. And yes, the light is a little bright, I apologize. It's just to get a better view. Okay, everything looks good so far. Now, for the neurological exam, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don’t move your head, just your eyes. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Like this? Is that right? I always feel dizzy when I look around. And… is something wrong if I can’t follow it perfectly? I always worry about bad things. And… is it going to take much longer? I have to get back to work later. I really hope everything is okay. I hope I'm not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. You're doing great. Your eye movements are good. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and hold out your hands. Good. Now, can you push your hands up against mine?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Like this? Is that right? I always feel weak when I’m nervous. And… is something wrong if I can’t push very hard? I always worry about bad things. And… is it going to take much longer? I have to get back to work later. I really hope everything is okay. I hope I'm not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. You're doing great. Your strength is good. Okay, now let’s check your reflexes. I'm just going to tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Can you sit with your legs dangling down?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Is it going to hurt? I always bruise easily. And… is something wrong if my reflexes aren’t very strong? I always worry about bad things. And… is it going to take much longer? I have to get back to work later. I really hope everything is okay. I hope I'm not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. My legs feel a little numb sometimes. I hope that’s not important. I really hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: It might feel a little surprising, but it shouldn’t hurt. Just relax your legs. Okay, good. Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Emileigh, that's the end of the physical exam. You did great. Now, let’s talk about what we've found.
PATIENT: Um… okay. Is everything okay? Is something wrong? I always worry about bad things. And… is it going to be expensive? I don’t have a lot of money. And… can I go back to work now? I really hope everything is okay. I hope I’m not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I really hope everything is okay. I really hope I’m not making this difficult. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh, take a deep breath. Everything appears to be okay, but I want to be thorough. Based on the exam and what you’ve told me, you're experiencing some fatigue, a little forgetfulness, and some stress. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Your neurological exam was normal—your reflexes, balance, and coordination are all good. The good news is, I don't see any immediate cause for concern. However, because of the fatigue and forgetfulness, I'd like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. It's just a precaution. Regarding cost, we'll submit the blood work to Medicare. They will cover a large portion, and we have options if there are any out-of-pocket expenses. We can discuss that with the billing department. And yes, after we discuss the blood work order, you can go back to work. But I’d also recommend taking some time to manage your stress and get enough rest. We can talk about resources available to help with that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Um… okay. Blood work? That sounds… scary. Will it hurt? And… what if something is wrong? I always worry about bad things. And… how long will it take to get the results? And… will I have to come back here? I really hope everything is okay. And… can you explain everything again? I think I forgot what you said. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I really hope everything is okay. And… can you explain everything again? I think I forgot what you said. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh, let's take it one step at a time. The blood work is very simple. It just involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. It will feel like a quick pinch, like a mosquito bite. A phlebotomist—a trained professional—will do it, and they're very good at making it as comfortable as possible. As for what we're looking for, we’re just checking for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and anemia—common causes of fatigue and forgetfulness. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, it’s just a routine check to rule things out. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If everything is normal, we'll talk about strategies for managing your stress and getting enough rest. If we find anything that needs attention, we’ll discuss the best course of action. So, to summarize: we're ordering some blood work as a precaution, it involves a quick pinch, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Um… okay. A quick pinch? That sounds… okay. And… you’ll explain everything again? And… you’ll tell me what it means? And… you’ll be here? I don’t like going to doctors by myself. And… can I write down everything? I forget things easily. And… can you explain everything one more time? I think I forgot what you said. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I really hope everything is okay. And… can you explain everything one more time? I think I forgot what you said. Sorry. I just… I get nervous easily. I really hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh, absolutely. Of course, I’ll explain everything again. And yes, I’ll be here for the follow-up appointment, and I’ll make sure you understand everything. So, to recap: you've been experiencing some fatigue and forgetfulness. To rule out any underlying causes, we're ordering some basic blood work. A phlebotomist will take a small sample of blood from your arm—it will feel like a quick pinch. The results usually take 3-5 business days to come back, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. At the follow-up, we'll go over the results together, and I’ll explain what they mean. If everything is normal, we’ll talk about stress management techniques and ways to improve your sleep. If we find anything that needs attention, we’ll discuss the best course of action. You are welcome to write everything down, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have at any time. I’m here to support you, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Now, let’s get the blood work order written up. Are you comfortable with that?
