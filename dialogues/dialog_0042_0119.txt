DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. Well, it's a rather delicate matter, really. It’s about… a discharge. A penile discharge, as the receptionist so bluntly put it. It's quite embarrassing, if I'm honest. I haven’t… experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I understand, Jinnie. It is understandably embarrassing to discuss, and you’ve done the right thing by coming in to get it checked. Many things can cause a discharge, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. To start, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… yellowish, mostly. Not a large amount, thankfully. It started… oh, about a week ago, I suppose. Maybe a little longer. I hadn’t been… with anyone recently, if that makes a difference. I've always been… careful. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it's… uncomfortable. A bit of stinging, sometimes, after… using the facilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge for about a week, no recent sexual activity, and some stinging during urination. That’s helpful. You mentioned you've always been careful – that's good to know. Just to be thorough, can you describe the color and consistency a little more?
PATIENT: Consistency… hmm. It's not… thick, certainly. More watery, I suppose. And the colour… well, it’s not a bright yellow, more of a… faded yellow. Like old butter, perhaps? Is that helpful? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at describing these things. It's all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it perfectly, Jinnie. “Old butter” is actually a very good description. Don't worry about being precise – I appreciate you sharing what you’re experiencing. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, thankfully. No pain in my… lower abdomen. Though I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, now that you mention it. Just a general sort of… sluggishness. And I’ve had to… use the facilities more frequently, if you understand what I mean. It's not painful, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or abdominal pain, increased fatigue, and more frequent urination. That gives us a bit more information. Now, thinking about your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, or had any similar symptoms in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I have never had anything like this before. I've always been… very particular about my health. And I’ve certainly never been diagnosed with anything… unsavory, as my mother would say. I've had the usual things, you know – a cold now and then, the occasional bout of indigestion. But nothing serious. I'm on Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And yes, your Medicare information is helpful. I see here you haven't had any significant medical issues reported recently. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Have either of your parents, or any siblings, had any sexually transmitted infections or urinary problems?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. My family is… quite respectable, if you understand. My mother would never tolerate anything like that. My father was a very proper gentleman, a lawyer, you know. And my siblings are both married with families, very upstanding citizens. No, there's no history of anything… like this in the family. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel quite foolish discussing all of this.
DOCTOR: You’re not foolish at all, Jinnie. It’s important to gather all this information, and I appreciate you being so open with me. It's good to know there’s no family history of similar issues. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! I wouldn't dream of it! I'm a very sensible woman. No smoking, no drinking, and certainly no… recreational drugs. I have a cup of chamomile tea with my biscuits in the evenings, that's all. I lead a very quiet life, really. I enjoy my gardening, and I volunteer at the library. Nothing… scandalous, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jinnie. A quiet life with gardening and volunteering sounds lovely. Now, I think it's time for a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose so. I’m not particularly happy about it, but if it's necessary… I trust you’re a professional, Doctor. But please, be as… gentle as possible. And do explain everything as you go along, if you don’t mind. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. I promise no surprises. I'll need you to change into a gown, which the nurse will provide. Once you’re changed, I’ll just have a look at your abdomen, and then I'll need to collect a small urine sample for testing. It’s a standard procedure, and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, that I understand. A gown… oh dear. Is it a… full gown? I do try to dress modestly. And will I need to… lie down? I have a rather bad back, you see. And what exactly will you be… looking at? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor, but I am rather… apprehensive.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jinnie. It’s good to ask questions. Yes, it's a full gown. And you won't have to lie completely flat, we can adjust the examination table so you’re at a comfortable angle. I'll be gently palpating your abdomen – that means feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. It's a quick and painless examination. The urine sample will help us rule out any infection. The nurse will guide you to the changing room and explain everything. Are you ready to proceed, or would you like a few more minutes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A few more minutes, I think. My… composure is rather fragile at the moment. Perhaps if you could just… reiterate what you're hoping to find out with all of this? What exactly could be causing this… discharge? I don’t want to be overly dramatic, but is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious. There are several things that can cause a discharge, Jinnie, and most of them aren’t serious. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, which is easily treated with antibiotics. It could also be a sexually transmitted infection, though you’ve said you haven't been sexually active recently, so we’ll consider that less likely. There are also some non-infectious causes, like irritation or inflammation. The urine sample and physical exam will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. It's important to get it checked out so we can rule out anything serious, and get you feeling better as soon as possible. Does that help to ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Well… a little, perhaps. A simple infection… that sounds manageable. But a sexually transmitted infection, even if unlikely… the thought is rather distressing. And what if it’s something else entirely? Something… serious? I really do wish I hadn’t come. It’s just stirred up a great deal of anxiety.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel anxious, Jinnie. It's always unsettling when something unexpected happens with your health. We're going to take things one step at a time. The most likely scenarios are easily treatable, and we won’t jump to conclusions until we have the results of the tests. The purpose of these tests is not to scare you, but to give us information so we can make the best decision for your health. I want to assure you that I will explain everything thoroughly, and we will discuss all your options. We'll address each possibility as we learn more. Would you like me to call the nurse now, or would you like a few more minutes to compose yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Call the nurse, I suppose. It’s best to get it over with, isn’t it? Though I do wish I had brought my reading glasses. I can’t see a thing up close anymore, and I’m sure the instructions will be… microscopic. And please, be gentle. I cannot stress that enough.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll make sure the nurse brings you a pair of reading glasses. I will also read the instructions aloud with you, if you wish. Nurse, could you please come to room three?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that is very kind of you. I do appreciate your patience. Honestly, I haven't felt this flustered since… well, never mind. It's a long story. I just hope this doesn't take too long. I have my biscuits waiting for me, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jinnie. I understand it’s unsettling, and I’m happy to help in any way I can. We'll be as efficient as possible, and I promise not to keep you from your biscuits for too long. I believe the nurse will be here momentarily. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: I do hope so, Doctor. I really do. This whole ordeal is… most unpleasant. And I do hope it isn't anything contagious. I volunteer at the library, you know. And I wouldn't want to… pass anything on to the children.
DOCTOR: That’s a very considerate thought, Jinnie. Contagious infections are always a concern, and we’ll take all necessary precautions to rule that out. In the meantime, it’s unlikely to be contagious. Most causes of discharge aren’t easily spread. We’ll have more information after the tests. Ah, I believe the nurse is here now. Let’s focus on getting you comfortable, and we’ll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, I am rather particular about my modesty. And I do hope the gown is clean. Honestly, one can never be too careful these days.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Nurse Anya. Could you please assist Jinnie with changing into a gown?
PATIENT: Please, be gentle. And do make sure the gown covers everything properly. I do have my reputation to consider, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, absolutely! I understand your concern. I’ll make sure you’re completely comfortable and covered. We have gowns that tie securely in the back, and I’ll help you get it on and adjusted. Don't worry, everything will be perfectly discreet. Let me just show you to the changing room, and we’ll take things at your own pace.
PATIENT: Very well. But if I find the gown… inadequate, I shall have to insist on wearing my own cardigan. I do have a rather nice one with pearl buttons. Honestly, one can never be too prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course! That’s perfectly acceptable. If you prefer to wear your cardigan, we can absolutely do that. Your comfort is our priority. We just want to make sure you’re feeling safe and relaxed. Let’s go ahead and get you changed, and if the gown doesn’t meet your needs, we’ll find your cardigan. The changing room is just here, and there’s a comfortable chair inside if you need to sit down. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Pearl buttons… always the best choice. One can never trust these modern fabrics. They simply don’t provide adequate coverage. Honestly, it’s a scandal… a scandal, I tell you!
DOCTOR: Alright, let's see… no significant allergies, Medicare coverage… and she likes biscuits. Good to know. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this quickly and get her back to enjoying her afternoon.
PATIENT: It's… adequate, I suppose. Though the fabric is rather… scratchy. And I do hope no one has worn this before. Honestly, one can never be too careful about hygiene these days.
DOCTOR: You look lovely, Jinnie. And it’s perfectly alright that you’re wearing your cardigan – your comfort is what matters most. We always use freshly laundered gowns, but I understand your concerns. We can absolutely provide a different one if you prefer. If you’re comfortable, let’s have you sit on the table. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently examine your abdomen. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, and I’ll explain everything as I go along. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please, be gentle. I have a rather delicate constitution, you know. And do explain everything beforehand. I do not like surprises. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jinnie. Gentle is my top priority, and I will explain every step before I do it. I promise not to touch your cardigan. It sounds very precious, and I completely respect that. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. It involves placing this instrument on your chest and back. It won't be cold or uncomfortable. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Is it… cold? I do not like cold instruments on my skin. And will it hurt? I have a very low tolerance for pain, you know. And please, do not press too hard. I have sensitive ribs. Honestly, this is quite distressing.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Jinnie. It can be a bit cold. Let me warm this up for you first. I completely understand your concerns, and I promise to be as gentle as possible. I won’t press hard at all. I'm just listening to your heart now. Take a few deep breaths for me, if you could. It sounds perfectly clear so far. Now, I'll just listen to your lungs. This may involve taking a few deeper breaths, and I will ask you to say 'ninety-nine' as you exhale. Just to make sure you can breathe normally.
PATIENT: Ninety-nine… is that necessary? I do not understand why I have to say anything. It’s quite undignified, you know. And please, do not press so hard. I feel as though my ribs will crack. Honestly, this is quite alarming.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Jinnie. It’s not necessary at all. I apologize – I was just following standard procedure, but we can skip that part entirely. And I’m so sorry if I pressed too hard. I’ll be much more gentle. Everything sounds clear on both sides. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen – that means feeling your tummy. I’m just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won’t be painful, I promise. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Would you like me to explain how I’ll do it first?
PATIENT: Explain, please. I do not like surprises. And please, do not press too hard. I have a very sensitive tummy, you know. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this is quite stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I will explain everything. I'm going to use my fingertips to gently press on different parts of your tummy. I’m just checking for any tenderness or lumps. I will start gently and slowly, and if you feel any discomfort at all, please tell me immediately. I promise not to touch your cardigan. I’m starting here, on your upper abdomen. Does that feel okay?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. Please, do not press so hard. I feel as though my insides will come out. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this is quite alarming.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Jinnie. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to cause any discomfort. It seems your tummy is quite sensitive, and it's clear that a full abdominal exam would be too stressful for you right now. That's perfectly alright. We can stop here. It seems like further examination would cause you more anxiety than benefit. We can focus on getting some tests done and go from there. Would you like me to sit down?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? And please, do not ask me to lie down. I have a bad back, you know. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this is quite distressing. And do you have any biscuits? I’m feeling rather faint.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I completely understand. Let’s talk about the tests. I’d like to order a urine analysis to check for infection and a few other basic things. It’s a simple test – you just provide a sample in a cup. No lying down required at all. And yes, we do have biscuits! I will ask the nurse to bring you one immediately. I apologize again for causing you any discomfort. I want you to feel safe and comfortable, and it's clear that a full examination is not the right approach right now. We can take things slowly and focus on getting these tests done. Would you like me to explain the urine analysis procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Biscuits… that would be lovely. A digestive, if you have one. And please, explain the urine analysis. But do not expect me to provide a large sample. I do not have a large bladder, you know. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this is still quite stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course, a digestive biscuit – perfect. I will ask the nurse to bring one right away. And a small sample is perfectly fine, Jinnie. We don’t need a large amount at all. The nurse will provide you with a sterile cup. You’ll simply need to provide a small urine sample in the cup. There's a restroom just down the hall. It’s a very simple procedure, and you can take your time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Will it be… cold? I do not like cold instruments near that area. And will anyone else see it? I do not want anyone else handling my… private fluids. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this is still quite alarming.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Jinnie. The cup itself is sterile and won't be cold. And no, absolutely no one else will see the sample or handle it. The nurse will provide you with a sealed container, and she’ll take it directly to the lab herself. It’s completely confidential and private. We take your privacy very seriously, Jinnie. I want you to feel as comfortable and safe as possible. Is there anything else I can do to reassure you?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please hurry with the biscuits. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, this whole ordeal is quite… taxing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I'll let the nurse know to bring the biscuits right away. And I promise, I won’t touch your cardigan. I apologize again for the stress this has caused you. Let's focus on getting you a biscuit and then getting the sample collected. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Nurse, could you please bring a digestive biscuit and a sterile urine collection cup to room three as soon as possible?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That would be lovely. And please, do make sure it's a proper digestive. I do not care for the cheap ones. Honestly, one can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. A proper digestive, absolutely. I will make sure it’s a good one. You deserve it after all of this. Now, just try to relax, and we’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse should be here shortly with the biscuit and the cup. Is there anything else I can get you while we wait?
PATIENT: No, thank you. Just… the biscuit. And please, do not touch my cardigan. It’s a family heirloom, you see. Honestly, I’m rather exhausted.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. Just the biscuit. And I promise, I won’t touch your cardigan. I understand you’re exhausted, and it’s perfectly alright to rest while we wait. I’ll just sit here quietly and give you some space. Let’s hope the biscuit arrives soon. And let’s hope it's a proper digestive.
PATIENT: Pearl buttons… always the best choice. Honestly, one can never trust these modern fabrics. They simply don’t provide adequate coverage.
DOCTOR: Pearl buttons… a woman of refined tastes, indeed. Let’s hope everything goes smoothly from here on out.
PATIENT: Nurse Anya: Good morning, Jinnie. Here’s your digestive biscuit, and this is the cup for your sample. Please let me know if you need any assistance. Jinnie: A digestive… excellent. Thank you, Nurse.
DOCTOR: Excellent indeed. I'm glad the biscuit arrived safely. Thank you, Nurse. If you’ll excuse us, Jinnie and I will just give her a moment of privacy. Take your time, Jinnie. No rush at all. And please, let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Excellent texture… a proper digestive, indeed. This is… most satisfactory. Pearl buttons… always the best choice. Honestly, one can never trust these modern fabrics.
DOCTOR: Pearl buttons… a woman of steadfast principles, it seems. Perhaps a small talk about her cardigan later would be appropriate, if she's feeling up to it. For now, let's just let her enjoy her biscuit and focus on getting the sample collected.
PATIENT: There. All finished. It wasn't… entirely unpleasant. Nurse Anya: Excellent. I'll take this to the lab right away. Jinnie: Now what, Doctor? Will I need to lie down? Please, not for too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent work, Jinnie. You did wonderfully. Thank you, Nurse. Please let me know when the results are available. No, you absolutely won't need to lie down. Now that we have the sample, we can discuss the next steps. It will just take a few minutes for the lab to analyze it. In the meantime, is there anything you’d like to talk about?
PATIENT: Well… perhaps you could tell me about yourself, Doctor? Do you have any… interesting hobbies? And do you prefer pearl buttons or… other types of fasteners?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jinnie. I'd be happy to. I’ve been practicing internal medicine for fourteen years now – I find it very rewarding to help people feel their best. As for hobbies, I enjoy gardening and reading – though I must admit, I’m not much of a craftsman myself. And as for buttons… well, I have to say, I’m a firm believer in the timeless elegance of pearl buttons. They just exude a certain sophistication, don’t they?
PATIENT: Excellent! A woman of discerning taste! I knew I could trust your judgment, Doctor. Pearl buttons are simply the best – they add a touch of refinement to any garment. You know, Doctor, I used to be a seamstress myself. I made all of my own clothes, and I always insisted on using the finest materials and the most exquisite pearl buttons. It was… a very satisfying profession.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Jinnie! A seamstress, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor! For twenty years, I ran a small tailoring shop in my village. I specialized in custom-made dresses and suits, and I was known for my impeccable craftsmanship and attention to detail. It was… a very fulfilling life. I used to say that every stitch tells a story. And every pearl button… adds a touch of magic.
DOCTOR: That’s beautiful, Jinnie. "Every stitch tells a story…" I love that. It speaks volumes about your dedication and passion for your craft. It must have been incredibly rewarding to create something beautiful with your own hands. I imagine you must have created countless treasured garments over the years. Do you still have any of your creations?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor! I still have a few of my creations tucked away in my wardrobe. A silk evening gown, a tailored suit, and a few custom-made dresses. They’re… precious memories, really. Each garment represents a special occasion, a cherished client, and a testament to my love for the art of tailoring.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Jinnie. They sound like treasured heirlooms. It's lovely that you have those memories preserved. You clearly have a remarkable talent. Just a moment, Jinnie. I believe the nurse has the preliminary results now. Let’s see what they say…
PATIENT: Oh, dear. What did they find? Please, tell me it’s nothing serious. And please, do not use any complicated medical terminology. I do not understand those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jinnie. Let’s see… The preliminary results indicate a mild urinary tract infection. It’s quite common, and easily treatable with antibiotics. No cause for alarm at all. It explains the stinging you were experiencing, and the increased frequency of urination. The good news is, it’s nothing serious, and we can get you feeling better in no time. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness! A simple infection… that’s… manageable. I was so worried it was something more serious. Antibiotics, you say? Will they make me sleepy? And will they interfere with my biscuit consumption? I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea.
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Jinnie. A simple infection is easily treated. And no, the antibiotics shouldn’t make you sleepy, and they won’t interfere with your biscuit consumption at all! The usual side effects are mild – perhaps a slight upset stomach, but that can easily be managed with food. I’ll write you a prescription for a seven-day course of antibiotics. Just take them as directed, and drink plenty of water. Do you have any other concerns about the antibiotics?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly manageable. Seven days… I can certainly handle that. And no interference with my biscuits… excellent! Will the antibiotics affect my sewing? I do have a custom order to finish, and I wouldn’t want to compromise the quality of my work.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Jinnie! No, the antibiotics shouldn’t affect your sewing at all. As long as you’re feeling well, you should be able to continue with your work as usual. Just make sure to get enough rest, and drink plenty of fluids. And if you experience any unusual side effects, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Let me write you this prescription, and then we can discuss any other concerns you might have.
PATIENT: Excellent! That’s… most reassuring. I do enjoy my sewing, and I wouldn’t want anything to interfere with my work. Do you have any recommendations for a good tea biscuit? I do enjoy a variety of flavors, and I’m always open to trying new things.
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful question, Jinnie! As for tea biscuits, I’m rather partial to a classic digestive myself. But if you’re looking for something a bit different, a shortbread biscuit with a hint of vanilla is always a good choice. Or perhaps a ginger biscuit for a bit of warmth and spice. It really depends on your personal preference. I’m sure you’ll find something you enjoy. Here’s the prescription. Just take it to your local pharmacy, and they’ll take care of the rest. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Excellent! A shortbread biscuit with a hint of vanilla… that sounds… divine! I shall certainly try that. And a ginger biscuit for warmth and spice… excellent! No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been… most helpful. And you clearly have excellent taste in biscuits. Thank you again, Doctor. You have… restored my faith in humanity. And my biscuit consumption.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Jinnie. It was my pleasure. And I’m glad I could restore your faith in humanity – and your biscuit consumption! Just remember to take the antibiotics as directed, and don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. It was lovely meeting you, Jinnie. I wish you all the best, and I hope you enjoy your biscuits.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor! You have been… most kind and considerate. And you have excellent taste in buttons! I shall certainly enjoy my biscuits. And I shall think of you fondly every time I take a bite! Goodbye, Doctor! And thank you again for everything. You have… restored my faith in humanity. And my biscuit consumption!
