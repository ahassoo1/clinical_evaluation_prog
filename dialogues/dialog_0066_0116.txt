DOCTOR: Hi Genette, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... nice to meet you too. My legs, you see. They bother me at night. Cramping, mostly. It’s been going on… well, a good while now. I don’t rightly recall when it started, but it keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg cramping at night… that’s certainly something we can look into. And it's been going on for a while, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Not recently gotten worse, not that I recall. Just… always there, when I’m trying to sleep. It’s a sharp pain, usually in the calf, I think. Though sometimes… it’s hard to say where exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Genette. Memory can be tricky. So, mostly in the calves, but sometimes it's hard to pinpoint?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It comes and goes. And it doesn’t happen every night. Some nights I sleep just fine, and others… well, I’m up and walking around to try and stretch it out. It helps a little, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent cramping, mostly in the calves, relieved somewhat by walking around. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse – like certain activities during the day, or maybe a particular time of year?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… I don’t know if anything makes it worse. I try not to overdo it with the gardening, but I do enjoy puttering around out there. And… I suppose in the winter it’s a bit more frequent, but that could just be because I’m inside more. It’s hard to say for sure. I don’t keep track of such things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It’s helpful just to get a general sense. Now, have you tried anything already to help with the cramping – like stretching before bed, or any over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, she tells me to stretch. I try to do that… before I forget, you understand. And… I’ve taken those little salts sometimes, for my feet. Epsom salts, I think they are called? It helps a little, but not much. Mostly, I just try to ignore it and hope it goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, stretching and Epsom salts with limited relief. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a complicated question, Doctor. Let me see… I had a touch of arthritis in my hands years ago, but it doesn’t bother me much anymore. And… my blood pressure, the doctor used to say it was a little high, but I haven’t been to see a doctor in… well, a long time. I don’t recall anything serious though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis and a history of high blood pressure. And you haven’t been to the doctor recently. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my eyes sometimes, Doctor. The doctor gave it to me a while back. For the dryness. And… occasionally, an aspirin for a headache. That’s about it, I think. I don’t take many pills, you see. I try to stay natural.
DOCTOR: Okay, eye drops and occasional aspirin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don't think so. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything in… well, as long as I can remember. My daughter always asks me that, but I usually tell her no. I’m a pretty simple woman, you see. Don’t eat anything fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a hard one. My mother, she lived to be quite old, but I don’t recall her having any particular illnesses. My father… he worked hard all his life, but he passed away when I was young. I don’t remember much about his health. There were lots of brothers and sisters, but we’ve all gotten so… scattered. It’s hard to keep track of everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, no need to worry if you don’t have a lot of information. It sounds like a limited family history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Just checking your legs, feet, and maybe listening to your heart and lungs. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look… I’m noting some mild swelling in your ankles, Genette, and your skin is a little dry. Now, I’m going to feel your pulses… Your pulses are a little weak, but present. And now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Those are a bit diminished. Now, can you point your toes and flex your feet against my resistance?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well, that’s… a lot of information, Doctor. Weak pulses… diminished reflexes… it doesn’t sound good, does it? I try to move my feet, but they feel a little… stiff sometimes. There. Is that alright? It’s not as easy as it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Genette, it's good you're able to do that at all. It does take a little effort, and that's helpful information. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have some peripheral artery disease, which is narrowing of the arteries in your legs. The weak pulses and diminished reflexes support that, and the cramping could be a symptom of reduced blood flow. It could also be related to some nerve issues. Now, I want to be clear, this isn’t a definitive diagnosis, but it gives us a place to start. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels, and also an Ankle-Brachial Index to measure the blood pressure in your legs compared to your arms. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Peripheral artery disease… That sounds… serious. And blood tests… I haven't had blood tests in… goodness, I don't even remember. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes. I suppose it's best to know, even if it's not good news. But… are you sure it's that serious? I just have leg cramps, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Genette. Leg cramps alone aren't necessarily serious, but given your age and the findings on the exam, it's important to rule out any underlying issues. Peripheral artery disease can lead to more serious problems if left untreated, like pain at rest, ulcers, and even amputation, but it’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and medication. The blood tests and ABI will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, given your insurance situation, the lab may require payment upfront. We can discuss options for assistance if that’s a concern. And, I'd also like to talk about some things you can do at home right now, like regular walking, elevating your legs, and staying hydrated. Would you like to go over those first?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Amputation… That sounds… dreadful. I just want the cramping to stop, Doctor. Payment upfront… yes, that might be difficult. I don’t have much saved, you see. Yes, please. Tell me what I can do at home. Walking… I can manage that. And elevating my legs… I suppose I can do that too. What about the drinking? What should I drink?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Genette, and I want to assure you that amputation is a last resort scenario, and not what we're expecting. We're doing this to get a clear understanding of what's going on so we can prevent that from happening. Now, for things you can do at home, regular walking is excellent – even just 15-20 minutes a day can help improve blood flow. Try to walk on a flat surface, and if you experience pain, stop and rest. Elevating your legs when you're resting can also help reduce swelling and cramping. Aim to elevate them above your heart level for about 15-20 minutes several times a day. As for drinking, water is best. Aim for at least 8 glasses a day – staying hydrated helps with overall circulation. You can also drink herbal teas or diluted fruit juice, but avoid sugary drinks. And, it's important to avoid smoking, if you smoke, and try to manage any underlying conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure, if you have them. Does that sound manageable, Genette?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds manageable, Doctor. Walking… I can do that. And the elevating… I can prop them up on pillows. Eight glasses of water… that’s a lot, but I can try. I don’t smoke, thankfully. My husband… he used to, but he quit years ago. It’s just… I’m so tired all the time. Is that… is that related to the cramping, do you think? Or is that just old age?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you’re able to manage those things, Genette. And it's great your husband quit smoking – that’s excellent. As for your fatigue, it could be related to the cramping, especially if the reduced blood flow is affecting your muscles. It could also be related to other factors like sleep disturbances, underlying medical conditions, or simply the natural aging process. Given your history of high blood pressure, it’s important to rule out any underlying causes. I’m going to order those blood tests and the ABI, and once we have the results, we’ll have a better understanding of what’s going on. In the meantime, if your cramping gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like pain at rest, skin changes, or sores on your legs or feet, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Genette?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… the tests… and then we’ll see? Thank you, Doctor Condray. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. We’ll get the tests ordered, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and she’ll give you instructions for the ABI. It was my pleasure meeting you, Genette. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
