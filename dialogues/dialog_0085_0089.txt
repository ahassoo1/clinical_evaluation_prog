DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It’s been… troubling me again. I believe that’s the right word. It comes and goes, but when it is here, it’s quite severe. I apologize, I’m not very good at remembering details these days.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. We’ll take our time and figure it out together. “Troubling” is a very good word. When you say “down low,” could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Specific… hmm. It’s… around here, Doctor. More towards the center, I think. And sometimes it feels like it radiates… spreads out a bit on both sides. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly, honestly. I do know it's not in my back, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. Radiating pain is good to know. And you said it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. It’s not constant, thankfully. There will be days, sometimes weeks, where I feel perfectly fine. And then… it will just start again. Usually without any warning. It’s just… there. And it can be quite intense. I suppose it varies in intensity each time, but it’s always unpleasant. I’ve been trying to keep track of when it happens, but my memory… well. It’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. We can work with what you do remember. So, when it is happening, can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It’s… a cramping sensation, mostly. Like a very tight squeezing. And sometimes… it feels like a sharp, stabbing pain on top of the cramping. It’s hard to sit still, and lying down doesn’t always help. It’s just… a deep ache, really. A very uncomfortable deep ache. I find myself just trying to breathe through it.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping with a sharp, stabbing component. And it’s making it difficult to sit. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes – certain foods, activity, stress, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I haven’t been able to find a clear pattern, to be honest. I’ve tried to keep an eye on what I eat, but it doesn’t seem to be related. Stress… well, who doesn’t have stress these days? But I can’t say for certain that it makes it worse. Activity… no, I don't think so. It seems to just… happen. Perhaps it's random. I truly wish I could pinpoint something, but I’ve been trying for quite some time. Do you think it’s possible it just comes and goes on its own?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible, Ms. Glymph. Sometimes these things do happen without a clear trigger. We'll investigate to try and find out more. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if that's alright. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Bowel habits… Hmm. Now that you mention it… I suppose I have been a little more… irregular lately. Not drastically, but not as regular as I usually am. Sometimes a bit constipated, other times… well, the opposite. It’s been rather unpredictable, I’m afraid. It hasn’t been severe enough to cause me much worry, but it has been noticeable. Does that matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, Ms. Glymph. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood… no, I don’t believe so. I always check, and I haven’t seen anything. Vomiting… no, not recently. I did feel a little nauseous a few times during the worst of one episode, but I didn’t actually vomit. Just a bit queasy, really. It passed quickly. I'm trying to remember everything accurately, I apologize if I'm rambling. This is all a bit… disconcerting.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Glymph. You’re doing a wonderful job. It’s helpful for me to have as much information as possible. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, I have been diagnosed with… SLE, I believe it’s called. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It’s been… under control for many years, thankfully. I see a rheumatologist regularly for that. And… I had my gallbladder removed several years ago. Other than that… I don’t recall anything significant. I’m afraid my memory is quite patchy. Does the lupus… could that be related to this pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, lupus can sometimes cause abdominal pain, although it’s not always the primary symptom. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. And the gallbladder removal is helpful information too. Do you recall when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… it was… quite a while ago now. Perhaps… fifteen years ago? Maybe more. I was in the hospital for a few days. It was a rather unpleasant experience, but I recovered well. It wasn’t related to the lupus, as far as I know. It was just… a gallbladder issue. I apologize for being so vague. I truly wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Ms. Glymph. It’s alright if you don’t remember the exact dates. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Let me see… I take… hydroxychloroquine, for the lupus. And… a low dose of aspirin, just as a preventative measure. And occasionally, ibuprofen for aches and pains. But that’s only when needed, of course. I believe that’s all. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. And I don’t have any food allergies that I’m aware of. I’m rather fortunate, in that regard. I’ve always been able to eat just about anything. Is that unusual, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly normal to not have any allergies. Now, one final question for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. No one in my family has ever had lupus, or any other autoimmune diseases. And I don’t recall anyone having any major abdominal issues. It’s a rather unremarkable family history, really. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Ms. Glymph. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if you don’t mind. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and gently pressing on it to check for tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I understand it's necessary. I just hope it doesn't… aggravate the pain too much. But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you feel any significant discomfort, please let me know immediately. I'm going to start by listening to your bowel sounds. Okay, bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, though a little…hypoactive. That means they’re a little quieter than usual. And now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I do notice some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, particularly in the center. It doesn't seem to be sharply localized, but it’s definitely there. No rebound tenderness or guarding.
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not terribly painful, but I can definitely feel it. Especially when you press… around here. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. The same ache I’ve been experiencing. It doesn’t radiate, as far as I can tell. And no, I don’t think it’s getting worse with the pressure. Just… noticeable. Does that tell you anything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. The mild tenderness in the center, without rebound or guarding, is helpful. Given your history of lupus, the irregular bowel habits, and the mild tenderness, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be related to a flare of your lupus, or it could be something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood tests and a urine analysis… yes, please. Anything that might help us figure out what’s going on. I trust your judgment completely. When can I expect the results? And… will these tests be painful?
DOCTOR: The blood tests are fairly routine – a small sample will be taken from your arm. There will be a brief pinch, but it shouldn't be painful for long. The urine analysis is also straightforward – you’ll simply provide a sample. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the lab to process them. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please don't hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very reassuring. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… one thing. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods I should avoid? Or any activities I should limit?
DOCTOR: For now, I wouldn’t worry too much about restricting your diet or activities. Continue to eat a balanced diet, and stay hydrated. Try to manage your stress levels as much as possible. And most importantly, listen to your body. If an activity causes you pain, then avoid it. We'll have a better idea of what's going on once we have the results of the tests. And then we can discuss a more specific plan. Do you have any other concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been wonderfully thorough and kind. I truly appreciate your time and attention. I feel much better knowing that we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're here for you. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the urine analysis. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
