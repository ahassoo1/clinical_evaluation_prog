DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Right, well… it’s these headaches, see. They come on pretty strong, and then… I get really sweaty, and my heart kinda races. It’s… not fun. Honestly, I don’t really remember when they started, exactly. It feels like it’s been a while, though. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go with sweating and a racing heart… that sounds unsettling. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. You said you don't recall exactly when they started, which is alright. Roughly, would you say it's been weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… longer, I think. Definitely longer than a few weeks. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s hard to say, honestly. Things kinda… blur together, you know? I don't keep track very well. It's not like every time it happens I write it down or anything.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s perfectly normal not to keep a headache diary! Six months to a year… okay. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: They’re… just really bad. Like a really tight band around my head, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it's behind my eyes, too. It's not like a throbbing pain, more… a squeezing? And it makes me feel kinda sick to my stomach sometimes, but I haven't actually been sick. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That does make sense. A tight, squeezing sensation, sometimes behind the eyes, and nausea without vomiting… alright. And when these headaches happen, how long do they usually last?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. That's a good question. They… vary, I guess? Sometimes it’s just a few hours, and then they’re gone. Other times… it feels like all day. Or, like, most of the day. It's hard to tell, because I'm usually just trying to get through it, and time kinda… slips away. I'm not very good at keeping track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, varying duration from hours to most of the day. That's helpful. Now, when these headaches start, do you notice anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, not really. That's the frustrating thing. It just… happens. I haven't noticed any pattern, like after certain foods or if I'm stressed or anything. I mean, I get stressed, like everyone does, but that doesn't seem to be it. Sometimes it's when I'm just sitting around, doing nothing. Other times, I'm busy and it hits then. It's pretty random, I think.
DOCTOR: Random onset… alright. And what about other symptoms with the headache, besides the sweating and racing heart?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, maybe? And like I said, nauseous. Not actually sick, just feeling like I might be. And… I guess I get kinda tired afterwards. Really wiped out. Not like a normal tired, more… drained. Yeah, drained is a good word. It’s hard to explain. I don’t see anything weird, or have any trouble speaking or anything like that. Just… tired and drained.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, nausea, and a significant feeling of fatigue afterward. Let’s move on to a quick review of other body systems. Have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Vision? Uh… not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I wear glasses, so things are always a little blurry without them. But no, I don't think my vision's gotten worse. No floaters or anything like that, or seeing double. Just my normal blurry vision when I forget my glasses. I'm pretty forgetful, you see.
DOCTOR: I do see. Okay, good. And what about any neck stiffness or pain, especially when you get these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my neck feels a little tight, yeah. I work… well, I do production work, so I’m always moving around, lifting things. I just figured it was from that. It’s not like a bad pain, just… kinda stiff. It's not usually with every headache, though. Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn’t. Hard to say, really. I don’t pay much attention to it unless it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent neck stiffness. Okay. Have you had any fevers, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don't think so. No fever, no chills. And I haven’t really been losing weight, or gaining any, for that matter. I eat… okay, I guess. Not the healthiest, but not terrible. I haven’t noticed any big changes in my weight. No, definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… chickenpox when I was a kid, of course. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. Other than that… not really. I don’t think so. No, I don’t think I've ever been told I have anything… serious. I've been to the doctor before for colds and stuff, but nothing… long-term. I think. It’s hard to remember, honestly. I don't really keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history besides childhood illnesses and a broken arm. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm, and they put a cast on it. No cutting or anything. It healed up fine. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Haven't needed anything like that, thankfully. It's been a good run, so far. Other than these headaches, of course. They're a bit of a pain. Literally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't really had any bad reactions to anything. I can take most medications okay. I’ve taken painkillers for headaches before, and they help a little, but not completely. Other than that, I don’t think I have any allergies. No, definitely not. I eat pretty much anything. Well, except for maybe olives. I don’t really like olives. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a dislike of olives doesn't count as an allergy. Okay. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. I take painkillers when my head's really bad, like ibuprofen or something. But that's about it. I don't take anything regularly. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I just try to get through the day. And when I can't, I pop a painkiller. But that's about it. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. And finally, do you have any family history of headaches, migraines, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uhh… that’s a tough one. My mom… she used to get headaches sometimes, I think. But not as bad as these. And my grandad… he had something with his memory when he got older, I think. But I don't know what it was. Nothing else really comes to mind. My family's pretty… average, health-wise. No big neurological issues, if that makes sense. I’m not really close to a lot of them, so I don’t really know their medical histories.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and do a quick neurological assessment. Just want to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I’m pretty relaxed, so just go ahead. I’m happy to help out however I can. Just… try not to make it too complicated, okay? I get a little flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, perfect. If you could sit up there for me, that would be great. Okay, everything looks normal so far. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Still good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay. And finally, I’ll do a quick fundoscopic exam to look at the back of your eyes. Okay, everything appears normal on the initial exam. Your neurological function is intact, and your heart and lungs sound clear. However, a blood pressure of 138/82 is slightly elevated. Given your history of headaches with sweating and a racing heart, and the intermittent neck stiffness, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. It will check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and complete blood count. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Blood work? Uh… yeah, okay. If you think it’s necessary. Sounds… thorough. I’m happy to get it done if it’ll help figure things out. I don’t really like needles, but… I’ll manage. Is it a lot of blood? And will it cost a lot of money? I don’t really have a lot of insurance, as you know.
DOCTOR: It’s not a huge amount of blood, just a couple of vials. And I understand your concerns about the cost, as you mentioned you don’t have insurance. We can see if the lab offers a cash price or if there are any assistance programs available. We’ll explore those options together. The cost shouldn’t be exorbitant, but I don't have the exact figures at the moment. Let me write you a requisition. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I’d like you to keep a headache diary. Just note the date, time, duration, and any triggers you notice, even if you’re not sure they’re related. Also, any medications you take for the headache, and how much relief they provide. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, a diary… okay, I can try that. I’m not very good at remembering things, but I’ll do my best. Date, time… triggers… medication… I’ll need a pen, I think. And maybe a little notebook? This sounds like a lot to keep track of. But I’ll try. I really just want to figure out what’s going on, so I’m willing to give it a shot. A pen and a notebook would be great, though. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. And don't worry about being perfect with the diary. Just do your best, and we can review it at your next appointment. Now, based on your history and the initial exam, it's difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause for your headaches. They could be tension headaches, but the sweating and racing heart are concerning. Given the slightly elevated blood pressure, we need to rule out secondary causes. The blood work will help us with that. In the meantime, if you experience any of the following symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately: a sudden, severe headache unlike any you've had before, fever, stiff neck, changes in vision, weakness or numbness on one side of your body, or difficulty speaking. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, okay. Sudden headache… fever… stiff neck… vision changes… weakness… difficulty speaking. That sounds… scary. I’ll try to remember all that. It’s a lot to take in. But yeah, I understand. If anything like that happens, I’ll go to the emergency room. I’ll try to be careful, and I’ll keep an eye on things. Thank you for telling me all that. It’s… reassuring, I guess. Even though it sounds a bit frightening. Do you think… is it anything serious? I’m probably just worrying too much.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking, and it's natural to worry. The symptoms I mentioned are signs that something might be more serious, but it doesn't mean you will experience them. We’re simply being cautious and thorough. We need to rule out the less common, more serious causes before settling on a diagnosis of something more benign like tension headaches. Given your history, I’m also going to recommend a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist to assess your blood pressure and rule out any underlying cardiac issues. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Uh… okay. Another doctor? This is… a lot of doctors. But yeah, if you think it's necessary. I guess I trust your judgment. I just… I don't really like going to doctors, if I'm honest. But I want to figure out what's going on, so I'll do it. Just… try to keep it brief, okay? I get a little anxious in medical settings. And… is it going to be expensive? I really need to know. I’m starting to worry about the cost of all this.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety and concerns about the cost. I will provide you with a referral to a cardiologist who is known for being thorough and efficient. I will also see if we can explore options for financial assistance or a lower-cost provider. We can discuss this further with the cardiologist’s office. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done and keeping that headache diary. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything. Just the blood work, the diary, and the cardiologist. It's a lot to remember. But thank you. Thank you for listening, and for not dismissing it. A lot of people just tell me to take some painkillers and get on with it. You seem… thorough, like you actually care. I think that's all I need for now. I'll get the blood work done as soon as I can. And I'll try my best with the diary. Thank you again, Doctor Rosanova. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. I'm glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
