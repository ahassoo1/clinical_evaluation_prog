DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Alzoubi. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s… about a surgery I’m considering. I believe I need to get cleared for it first, a pre-surgery check-up, you could say. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. I'm still processing a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-surgical clearance exam. That's perfectly reasonable. Let's start with what surgery are you considering, if you don't mind sharing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… a facial reconstruction. Or… something along those lines. It’s… difficult to recall specifics. My late husband… he arranged a lot of it. It was after… well, after the accident. I apologize for being so vague; it’s just… hard to piece everything together sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. A lot happened, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed. So, a facial reconstruction after an accident. Do you remember roughly when this accident occurred?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I think it was… last year? Or maybe the year before? It feels… a long time ago now, but also… very recent, if that makes any sense. It was definitely before… before he passed, that much I remember clearly. I wish I could be more precise; I feel awful putting you in this position.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mackenzi, we’ll sort through it. It’s more important that you’re comfortable. "Approximate date of accident: prior to husband's passing." Okay. And roughly how long ago did your husband pass?
PATIENT: Oh… about six months ago, I believe. Yes, six months. It was… January, I think. A very cold January. It all feels like a blur, truly. I am so sorry for being so unhelpful. I do remember wanting the surgery… he felt it would help, you know, with… with everything. But the details… they just aren’t coming to me easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago in January. That gives us a timeframe. Let’s try to focus on the reason for the surgery, if you’re able. What was your husband hoping to correct or improve with the reconstruction?
PATIENT: He… he said my face. That it was… damaged. And that it would help with… confidence. To feel like myself again. Honestly, I don’t recall the specifics of what was damaged, only that he was very insistent it would be beneficial. I trusted him implicitly, so I agreed. I just… want to be healthy enough to proceed, if it’s possible. And if not… well, I suppose I need to know that, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, facial reconstruction to improve confidence following damage to the face. Before we proceed further, can you tell me about any medical conditions you currently have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… another difficult question. I believe I have… mild hypertension, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. And… I had pneumonia a few years ago, but I recovered fully. Honestly, I struggle to remember everything. My primary care physician is Dr. Ramirez, perhaps you could contact her? I'm terribly sorry for being so forgetful. It's a side effect of… everything, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. We can certainly contact Dr. Ramirez. Knowing you have mild hypertension is helpful. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I… I really can’t say for certain. I take a small, white pill… once a day. I have it right here… Here! It says… Lisinopril, 10mg. Is that helpful? I truly apologize; I rely on my husband for managing these things. It’s been very difficult adjusting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril 10mg is very helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. No known allergies, no. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. Though, I did have a rather bad reaction to a mosquito bite last summer, but that wasn't a medication, of course. I really wish my memory were better, Doctor. I'm afraid I'm not a very good patient.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable to be a bit scattered after everything you’ve been through. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never. My husband… he always discouraged such things. I don't smoke, drink alcohol, or use any… recreational substances. Never have, never will. I prefer a quiet life. I lead a very healthy lifestyle, aside from the blood pressure, of course. I enjoy gardening, walking, and reading. Nothing… excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I’m ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140/90… a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally, normal breath sounds. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, I'd like to take a look at the area where the reconstruction is planned, if you're comfortable with that. It’s just a quick visual assessment.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Please, proceed. It’s… around my cheeks and nose, mostly. My husband arranged for several consultations with the surgeon, but… I don’t recall the specifics. It feels very strange, not knowing. I trust your examination; please, don't hesitate to point out anything concerning. I just want to be sure I'm a good candidate, and that it's safe.
DOCTOR: I see some mild asymmetry, and some subtle scarring around the cheeks and nose. The skin feels generally healthy, but there is some evidence of prior trauma. Alright. Based on this quick examination, and the information you've provided, I recommend we order some blood work to get a better baseline of your overall health. We’ll want to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. That will give us a clearer picture of whether you're a good candidate for surgery. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems prudent. Whatever you deem necessary to ensure my safety. I trust your judgment implicitly. I just… want to be sure. And if it's not safe… I need to know that as well. Please, proceed with the blood work at your earliest convenience. Do I need to do anything specific beforehand? Fasting, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. No food or drinks, except for water. I'll send the order to the lab. They'll contact you directly to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s… unsettling not knowing, but you’ve put my mind at ease somewhat. Thank you for taking the time to assess me. I will await the lab’s contact and schedule the blood work accordingly.
