DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. Very painful, actually. I work with fences, you see. Erecting them. It has been hurting for some time now.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And you mentioned you work with fences, erecting them… that sounds physically demanding. For how long has it been hurting, roughly?
PATIENT: About… three months, I believe. Perhaps a little longer. It started slowly, a dull ache after a long day. Now… now it’s there most of the time. Even when I am resting. It makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Three months, okay. And it’s progressed from a dull ache after work to being present even at rest. That’s definitely something we need to look into. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… a deep ache. Like a weight is on my lower back. Sometimes it shoots down my leg, a little. Not always, but sometimes. It is worse when I bend over, or twist. Lifting anything is… difficult. I try to avoid it if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep ache with some radiating pain down your leg… and worsened by bending, twisting, and lifting. That gives us a good starting point. Does the pain radiate all the way down to your foot, or just part of your leg?
PATIENT: Just to my calf, mostly. Not to the foot itself. It feels… tight, in the calf when the pain is bad. Like a muscle is always pulled. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. Tightness in the calf with the radiating pain. Have you noticed anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Warm baths help a little. And… lying flat. Just being still. But those don’t last long. It always comes back. I also use a cream… a rubbing cream. Not much help, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm baths and lying flat provide some temporary relief. And the rubbing cream isn’t doing much. Have you tried any over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: Yes. The white pills. Acetaminophen, I think? They take the edge off, but not for long. And I worry about taking too many. I don't want to harm myself.
DOCTOR: That's a good concern, Lakiya. It’s always smart to be cautious with medication. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on your back for me on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can do that. Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Just let me know if anything causes you pain. Okay, can you bend forward and touch your toes, or as close as you can get?
PATIENT: Ooh… that hurts. Right there. I can't go much further. It feels like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. And I feel some tenderness right there. Alright, can you lift each leg up while lying flat?
PATIENT: This one is… hard. And this one… … also hard. They feel… heavy. And my back hurts more now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some difficulty lifting both legs, and increased pain with that movement. Alright, everything sounds clear. Now, just to rule things out, do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs, feet, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes my feet feel… cold. But that happens anyway. I have poor circulation, the doctor told me once. But no tingling, no numbness. Just cold feet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness or tingling, just cold feet, which you’ve been told is due to circulation. Alright, Lakiya, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a lower back strain, possibly with some nerve involvement, contributing to the pain radiating down your leg. It's not alarming, but it’s definitely something we need to address. I want to get an X-ray just to rule out anything more serious, like a fracture. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. An X-ray is good. I want to know what is happening. If it is just a strain… then that is good. But I need to know. Yes, please. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’ll have the technician take some X-rays. It shouldn’t take too long. After that, we can discuss treatment options. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any heavy lifting, twisting, or bending. We can also talk about some pain relief options while we wait for the results. Would you prefer to discuss medication or other ways to manage the pain, like physical therapy?
PATIENT: Medication… I don’t like taking too many pills, Doctor. Physical therapy… that sounds better. If I can learn how to move… how to not hurt myself… that would be good. If that is possible.
DOCTOR: That's a great idea, Lakiya. Physical therapy is often very effective for back strains. I can write you a referral to a good physical therapist in the area. In the meantime, while we wait for the X-ray results, I can prescribe a muscle relaxant for a few days to help with the spasms and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen, to reduce the inflammation. We can start with a low dose of both and see how you tolerate them. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A low dose… yes. That sounds… acceptable. I don't want anything too strong. Just enough to take the edge off. And the physical therapy… I want to start that as soon as possible. If the X-ray is okay, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, I’ll get those prescriptions sent to your pharmacy. And I’ll write the referral for physical therapy. The technician will be in shortly to take the X-rays. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you have covered everything. I am just… anxious to know what is happening. But I trust you. Thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lakiya. That’s good to hear. We’ll get those results as quickly as possible. I'll check back with you after the X-rays. Just relax and let me know if you experience any sudden increase in pain while you wait. .
