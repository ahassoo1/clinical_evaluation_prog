DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor... Pirl, right? Well, it's my ear, you see. Feels… blocked. Full, like. Been that way a while now, I suppose. Not terribly painful, just… annoying. I’d like to get it sorted if possible. Don’t have time for this, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, a blocked ear. I understand. And you say this has been going on for a while… could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm. A while… weeks, maybe? Months? Honestly, it all blurs together. It wasn't sudden, that's for sure. Just… gradually got worse, I think. I don't really keep track of these things. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to have a timeframe, yes, but don't worry if you can’t be precise. It helps me to understand what might be going on. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the blocked sensation?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little… ringing sometimes? Very faint. And… I feel a bit off balance now and then, but I put that down to getting older, to be honest. It’s probably just me. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ear, or tinnitus, and occasional dizziness… alright. Have you experienced any pain, discharge, or fever associated with your ear?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And definitely no discharge… That sounds unpleasant. No fever either. Just this… fullness. It's more of a nuisance than anything, really. I just want it to go away. Is it something serious? I have a lot on my plate, you see.
DOCTOR: We'll determine that together, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any recent colds, sinus infections, or changes in air pressure – perhaps from flying or diving?
PATIENT: Ah, now… A cold… I think I had something a few months ago, a bit sniffly, but nothing bad. Didn’t pay it much attention. Flying… no, not recently. And diving… goodness, no. I’m not one for all that. Air pressure… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I mostly stay around here, on the farm.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I'm aware of. I mean, I get hay fever sometimes, in the spring, with all the pollen. But that's just sneezing, isn't it? Nothing serious. My wife used to handle all those details. I just don’t really keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just some vitamins, I suppose. A general multivitamin. And… I take something for my knees, occasionally, when they act up. But that's all, I think. Nothing regular. My doctor back home… well, he used to keep track of all this. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your ear with an otoscope. This will just allow me to see if there’s anything obvious causing the blockage. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just get on with it, if you would. I have things to do, you see. The sooner we figure this out, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. I do see some cerumen – earwax – buildup in both ears, and it appears to be quite impacted in the right ear. This is often the cause of a feeling of fullness and blockage. There's no sign of infection or anything else concerning at this time.
PATIENT: Earwax, you say? Is that… bad? I mean, I’ve never really paid much attention to cleaning my ears. My wife used to do it, but… So, it’s just earwax? Can you just… take it out? Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. GuerreroloLopez, it’s very common. And often easily resolved. We can certainly remove the earwax. There are a few ways to do it. We can try irrigation with warm water, or I can use a small instrument to gently remove it. I usually prefer irrigation first, as it’s less invasive. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Irrigation… sounds… less scary than an instrument. Yes, let’s try that. Just get it done, please. I really need to get going. The sooner this is over, the better. Is there anything I need to do? Any preparation?
DOCTOR: No special preparation is needed. I'll use a syringe to gently squirt warm water into your ear canal. It may feel a little strange, and you might hear some bubbling. If you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. I'll start with the right ear, as that's where the buildup is most significant. We'll take it slow. Now, just relax, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… get on with it. I haven’t got all day, you know. Quick as you can, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m seeing some wax coming out now. We'll continue for a few more seconds. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. There we go. It looks much better now. I’ve removed the bulk of the earwax. Let’s switch to the left ear now. Alright, that ear looks clear as well. How do you feel now?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… better. Definitely better. Not completely gone, maybe, but a lot less… blocked. A bit of pressure, maybe? But much more comfortable. Yes, much improved. Thank you. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can certainly go now. The pressure you’re feeling is normal after irrigation; it should subside within a few hours. I’m going to give you a prescription for some ear drops – ceruminolytics – to help dissolve any remaining wax and prevent buildup in the future. Use them as directed on the label. I also recommend avoiding using cotton swabs in your ears, as they can push the wax further in and cause impaction. If the blockage returns, or if you experience any pain, discharge, or fever, please schedule another appointment immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. I appreciate it. I really must be going now. A lot to do. Thank you again. Good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. GuerreroloLopez. Have a good day as well. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
