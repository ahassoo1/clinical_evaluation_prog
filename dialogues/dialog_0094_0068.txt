DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… my leg. It's been swelling up. After the cancer treatments, you see. It’s not painful painful, just… big. And it worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in your leg after cancer treatment is certainly something we want to investigate. Just to clarify, when you say “cancer treatment,” could you tell me what type of treatment you received, and when you finished it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It was… radiation. And some pills. They gave me a lot of pills. I finished… oh dear. It was last year, I think? Maybe… six months ago? It feels like a long time, but… time goes so fast, no? I had it at the hospital, of course. The big one downtown.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Queener. It’s common to have trouble remembering exact dates, especially with everything you’ve been through. Radiation and pills… okay. And you finished treatment about six months ago, roughly?
PATIENT: Yes, about six months. Maybe a little more, maybe a little less. It’s hard to say exactly. It was… a lot of appointments. And I was so tired.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That sounds exhausting. And the swelling… where exactly on your leg is it?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my right leg. The calf, I think that’s what it’s called? The back of my leg, below the knee. It's… all puffy. And sometimes it feels a little tight, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in the right calf, mostly below the knee, sometimes feeling tight. Has the swelling come on suddenly, or has it been gradually getting worse over the past few months?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t boom like that, you know? It just… got bigger and bigger. I didn’t really pay attention at first, but now it’s hard to ignore. I had to get new shoes!
DOCTOR: I see. New shoes because of the swelling… that tells me it’s definitely noticeable. And has anything specific made it worse – like standing for a long time, or flying, or any particular activity?
PATIENT: Hmm… standing, yes. That makes it worse. And… hot weather. When it’s very hot, it gets much bigger. I was gardening last week, and it was really bad afterwards. I had to sit with my leg up for hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, standing and hot weather seem to exacerbate it. And you elevate your leg when it gets worse, which is good. Have you noticed any changes in the skin on your right leg – any redness, warmth, or sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. The skin… I think it looks normal. Maybe a little… darker than my other leg? But I’m not sure if that’s just because of the sun. I try to be careful, but I do like to be in the garden.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. A little darker skin could be from the sun, as you said. Alright, Ms. Queener, I'm going to do a quick physical exam of your legs to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out. It worries me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noting some mild discoloration on your right lower leg compared to your left. There is some mild swelling, and when I press on it, I do see some indentation - what we call pitting edema. It doesn’t seem severe, but it’s definitely present. Your pulses feel normal in both legs, and the temperature is the same on both sides. I'm also checking the skin for any signs of infection, and I don't see anything concerning at this time. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, the most likely cause of the swelling is lymphedema. This can happen after cancer treatment, especially after radiation, and it involves a buildup of fluid in the leg tissues. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, like a blood clot. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound to check the blood flow in your leg. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymp-what? Oh dear. Is that… bad? A blood clot sounds scary. Ultrasound… okay, if you think it’s necessary. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Lymphedema, it's a build-up of fluid, like I said, and it isn't necessarily bad, but it can be uncomfortable and, if left unmanaged, can lead to other issues. It’s very common after radiation, and we can often manage it effectively with compression and other therapies. A blood clot is something we always want to rule out, though, because that is serious. That's why the ultrasound is important – it will give us a clear picture of what's going on in your leg. I'm ordering the ultrasound now. The clinic will call you to schedule an appointment. It's usually a quick and painless test. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend that you elevate your leg as much as possible, especially when you're resting, and wear compression stockings. Do you have any compression stockings?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I don’t think so. My daughter sometimes wears them, but… they’re very tight, aren’t they? I’m not sure I could manage those.
DOCTOR: They can be a bit snug, yes. We can start with a lower compression level. The clinic can help you get fitted for a pair that's comfortable. They'll measure your leg and make sure they're the right size. In the meantime, just continuing to elevate your leg whenever you can is a good start. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I mean, I'm a little sensitive to… strong perfumes, sometimes. But that's not a medicine, is it? Nothing serious. I can take most things, I think. My stomach is okay with most things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and your stomach generally tolerates medications well. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a small pill for my blood pressure. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. And sometimes I take… a vitamin D pill, in the winter. It’s very dark where I live, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pill for your blood pressure, and Vitamin D occasionally in the winter. Do you know the name and dosage of the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see if I can remember… I have the box upstairs. It’s… Lisinopril, I think. And… 10 milligrams. Yes, 10 milligrams.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10 milligrams. That's helpful. And do you have any family history of blood clots, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My… my grandfather, he had something with his legs. Very bad swelling. He had to go to the hospital. I don't know what it was exactly. And my mother… she had heart problems, a long time ago. But that's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandfather with leg swelling and a mother with heart problems. That’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Oh… Well, I live alone. I like to garden, as I said. And I enjoy reading. I try to walk a little, but my legs get tired easily. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing exciting, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone, enjoy gardening and reading, try to walk when you can, don't smoke, and have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That sounds like a perfectly reasonable lifestyle. Alright, Ms. Queener, I think we have a good understanding of your situation. We're going to get that ultrasound done to rule out a blood clot. I'm also recommending compression stockings and continued elevation. Once we have the ultrasound results, we can discuss further treatment options, which might include physical therapy or other interventions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. Thank you for listening. I was very worried, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. I'm glad I could help ease your worries, even a little. It's completely understandable to be concerned, and we'll work through this together. The clinic will contact you to schedule the ultrasound. In the meantime, if you notice any sudden increase in pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you develop any shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That's very thorough, Doctor. Thank you again. You've been very kind. I think… I think that’s all. I should probably go home and put my leg up now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. And yes, putting your leg up is a great idea. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again once we have the ultrasound results.
PATIENT: It was lovely to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you.
