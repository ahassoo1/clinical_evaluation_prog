DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something… for checking things. My… someone told me I needed to come in for a screening. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can’t recall exactly why. It had something to do with… making sure I’m okay to keep doing my job, I believe.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It sounds like you may be referring to a work-related screening. That's perfectly alright – many patients find it difficult to recall all the details. According to your records, your employer requested a general health screening with a focus on cardiovascular health and pulmonary function, as you work in a physically demanding role. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds right. Paving… it is hard work, you know? Lots of… vibrations. And dust. Dust everywhere. Cardiovascular… is that my heart? And pulmonary… is that my lungs? It's all a bit much, honestly. I just want to make sure I can keep working. It's… important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely right. Cardiovascular refers to your heart and blood vessels, and pulmonary refers to your lungs. We're going to do a thorough check of both, just to ensure everything is functioning as it should, given the demands of your profession. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a long time ago. Let me see… I was married, a long time ago. My husband, bless him, passed away a few years back. I don’t… I haven’t had many serious illnesses, I don’t think. Just… the usual aches and pains, you know? Old age creeping up on me. I have Medicare, if that helps. Honestly, I’m drawing a blank. I went to the doctor regularly with my husband, so… maybe they have records from that time?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to recall everything. Medicare does help us access some previous records, and we can certainly look into that if needed. For now, let's focus on what you remember. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High…blood pressure? Hmm. I don't recall anyone ever telling me I had that. I get a little dizzy sometimes, standing up too fast, but… is that the same thing? Diabetes… no, I don't think so. I enjoy a sweet treat now and again, but my doctor never mentioned anything about that. And… cholesterol? Oh goodness, I have no idea what that even is. It all sounds very serious. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It's alright. We're just gathering information at this stage, and it's perfectly normal to not remember specific medical terms or diagnoses. Feeling dizzy when standing up quickly can be related to blood pressure, but it can also be caused by other things. No, nothing is necessarily wrong, but it’s important to rule things out to ensure your continued health and ability to work safely. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. That was… scary. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. That wasn't too bad, just a cast for a few weeks. Other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major, anyway. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I don’t really go to the hospital unless absolutely necessary. Hospitals… they smell funny.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Tonsillectomy and a fractured wrist are helpful details. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… something with her heart, I think. She was always tired. And my father… he smoked a lot, and he had trouble breathing towards the end. I have a brother, but we haven't spoken in years. I don't know anything about his health. Honestly, we weren't very close. It’s all a bit… hazy. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. Family history can be difficult to recall, and it’s common for details to be hazy, especially over time. Knowing that your mother had heart issues and your father had breathing problems is helpful. Do you currently take any medications, or have you had any recent vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I take a little something for my arthritis, just when it flares up. It’s a small, white pill. And… that’s it, I think. Nothing else regularly. As for vaccinations… I had a flu shot last winter, I believe. The nurse came to the community center. I'm not good with names, so I don’t remember who gave it to me. I’m just… not a big fan of needles, if you know what I mean. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand. A medication for arthritis and a flu shot last winter is good to know. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything and everything. Though… I got a little itchy once after eating strawberries, but I just thought it was a rash. It went away on its own. I've never had a serious allergic reaction, thank goodness. No bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, all things considered. Does that make sense? I sometimes forget things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. A mild reaction to strawberries is good to note. Alright, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to get back to work, you know. Paving waits for no one! But yes, go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, at 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to your recent activity or just a bit of nervousness. I hear a slight wheezing in your lungs, but it's subtle. We'll need to investigate that further. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/90. That’s a bit higher than we’d like to see. We’ll monitor that closely. Overall, you appear to be in generally good health, but these findings warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear… is that bad? 142/90… what does that even mean? And wheezing… I have been a little more breathless lately, especially when I’m working. I thought it was just getting old, you know? I didn’t realize it was something… serious. What kind of investigation? Will I have to take more tests? I really need to get back to work… my crew is counting on me.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Hughston. Let’s take things one step at a time. 142/90 means your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Ideally, we want it to be below 130/80. Elevated blood pressure, over time, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke, which is why we want to address it. The slight wheezing in your lungs suggests some narrowing of your airways, which could be caused by a number of things. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. We will also want to perform a spirometry test to assess your lung function. These tests are relatively quick and non-invasive. I understand your concern about getting back to work. We can schedule these tests for as soon as possible, and I'll provide a note for your employer explaining that you're undergoing some routine health assessments. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a lot of tests. A complete… what-was-it… and a chest… X-ray. And my lungs… Okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long, and you can give me a note… that would be wonderful. I really don't want to lose my job over this. My husband… he always took care of these things. I’m not very good with… doctor stuff. So, a note… and quick, you said? And will I know what all these tests mean? I don’t want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I understand this can be overwhelming, and you're absolutely right to want to be informed. We'll schedule the tests for tomorrow morning at the lab across the street. They’re usually completed within an hour. I'll personally review the results with you as soon as they’re available – typically within 24-48 hours. I will explain each test and what the results mean in plain language. We’ll go through everything together. I will also provide a note for your employer, stating that you are undergoing routine health assessments at my recommendation. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend avoiding strenuous activity for the next 24 hours, and stay well-hydrated. We’ll discuss this further once we have the test results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Tomorrow morning… the lab across the street… avoid strenuous activity… and a note. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s just… a lot to take in. But I appreciate you explaining things. And the note… that’s a big help. I think… I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I'm glad I could help. My staff will contact you to schedule the tests. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. We're here to support you. Have a good rest of your day, and please take it easy.
