DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… in my chest, I think. It’s hard to remember exactly why I came… getting old, you know. Makes things foggy.
DOCTOR: Yes, it certainly can. That’s perfectly alright, we’ll figure it out together. So, this pain in your chest… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Oh… when did I notice it? Gosh… that’s a good question. Not recently, that’s for sure. Maybe… a few weeks? A month? It comes and goes, you know? Not all the time. It’s just… when I try to take a good, deep breath, like when I’m lifting something… or sometimes just walking up a hill. It’s… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month, comes and goes, worse with exertion… that gives us a starting point. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s not… a sharp pain, not like getting cut. More like… a tightness? A pressure, maybe? Right here… …it feels like something’s squeezing. Not really bad, but enough to make me stop and catch my breath. It doesn't go up to my arm or anything.
DOCTOR: Tightness and pressure, not sharp, localized to the chest… good. And it doesn’t radiate anywhere, like to your arm, neck, or back?
PATIENT: No, no… doesn’t go anywhere else. Just stays right here. It’s… well, I used to be able to lift a lot, you know? Construction work. But now… even carrying groceries feels harder sometimes. Not because of the weight, but because of this pain. Makes me nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, and it’s good you’re paying attention to that. Any other symptoms you’ve noticed along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think… I do get a little… breathless sometimes, even when I’m not doing much. Just tired, I guess. And I cough a little now and then, but I’ve always coughed a bit, especially in the winter. Nothing new, really. I don't have a fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some breathlessness and a chronic cough… nothing new there. And no fever. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. I thought it was just from being on my feet all day, you know? Old age. But yeah, a little bit of swelling, especially at the end of the day. It goes down when I put my feet up.
DOCTOR: Okay, some ankle swelling that improves with elevation. Alright, Mr. Ruocco, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get to the bottom of it. If you could just sit back and relax… Okay, taking some deep breaths for me… good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs sound a little bit diminished on both sides, with some mild wheezing. And your ankles do have some slight swelling, as you mentioned. Blood pressure is 140/90. Let's get a quick look at your oxygen saturation with this pulse oximeter. Oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little low.
PATIENT: 92%… is that bad? I don't even know what that means. Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I get worried easy, you know. This reminds me of my… well, never mind. Just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be worried, Mr. Ruocco. 92% is a little bit lower than we’d like to see, but it doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong right now. It suggests your lungs aren't getting as much oxygen as they should. The diminished sounds and wheezing I heard, combined with your history of breathlessness and the swelling in your ankles, make me think we need to investigate further. Given your age and symptoms, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including possible heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to check your heart. We’ll also do some blood tests to look at your kidney function and to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood tests… oh dear. It sounds serious. Heart failure… COPD… I don’t even know what that is. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then do it. I just want to know what’s going on so I can… well, so I can get back to doing things. I don't want to be stuck in bed. Can I still do my gardening, if… if it’s not too bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking. Those tests will help us figure out what’s going on and make a plan. We’ll take it one step at a time. Regarding your gardening, let’s hold off on any strenuous activity for now until we have the results of these tests. Light activity, like a short walk, might be okay, but anything that makes you significantly breathless or causes chest pain should be avoided. I’m going to have my nurse draw the blood now. Then we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. It usually only takes a few minutes. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… will I be able to go home after the tests? I live alone, you know, and I don't want to worry my neighbors. And… will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll be able to go home after the tests. They're both non-invasive procedures. The blood draw will feel like a quick pinch, and the X-ray doesn't involve any pain at all. It's just like getting a picture taken. I’ll make sure the nurse explains everything clearly before she starts the blood draw. And the technician performing the X-ray will also walk you through the process. We'll have the results back within a few days, and I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds good. A few days… okay. I appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. It makes me feel a little bit better. I guess… I guess I’m ready for the blood draw, then. Just… try to be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll let the nurse know to be as quick as possible. She’s very skilled and gentle. I’ll step out while she takes care of you, but I’ll be right nearby if you need anything at all. Just ring the call bell if you have any questions or concerns, and she’ll be right in. Thank you for being so patient, Mr. Ruocco.
PATIENT: .
