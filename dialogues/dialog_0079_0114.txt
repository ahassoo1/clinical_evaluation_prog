DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Vanderwiele. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 71 years old, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Seventy-one come October. Now, if you don’t mind, I have an appointment with my granddaughter later this afternoon and I’d like to be done when we are finished.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my breathing. It gets… difficult when I lie down flat. Like trying to breathe through a small straw. It doesn’t bother me so much when I’m sitting up, or even leaning back a bit, but flat? No. Just no. It started… oh, maybe a month or so ago. It's been getting worse, just a little at a time.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty breathing when lying flat, worsening over the past month. And it’s easier when you’re sitting or reclining. Do you experience this shortness of breath at any other time?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said, sitting up is fine. Walking is fine, even going up the stairs isn’t too bad. It’s just when I try to lie flat. Sometimes I have to sleep in my chair, which isn’t ideal, but better than feeling like I’m suffocating. Do you need to know what kind of chair? It’s a recliner, if that makes any difference.
DOCTOR: No, the specifics of the chair are not particularly relevant, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Though I appreciate your thoroughness. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it, my feet have been a little puffy lately. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest. It’s been so warm this August. But yes, a bit. Not terribly, but noticeable if I take my shoes off. I usually wear support hose, so it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: Support hose, good. And do you cough at all?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. A little. Mostly in the mornings. It’s not a deep, hacking cough, more of a… clearing of my throat, really. I thought it was just from lying down flat. Everything sort of settles when I sleep, or try to sleep. It doesn't bother me enough to take anything for it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. A morning cough, not severe enough to warrant medication. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve seen doctors regularly, of course. Had my checkups every year. They always listen to my heart and tell me it’s “fine.” But I haven’t been told I have any… conditions. Is that what you’re asking? I don't have a fancy list of illnesses, if that's what you mean. Just the usual aches and pains for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had high blood pressure for a little while, maybe ten years ago? They put me on a pill for it. I took it for a while, and then the doctor said my numbers were good, so I stopped taking it. As for diabetes… no, never. I like sweets, but I don't have the sugar sickness. I get my bloodwork done every year, like I said.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, Doctor. The doctor said it was good for my circulation. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that’s it. Nothing else. Honestly, I don’t like taking pills. They always make me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, and never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach. And I’ve never been one to wear perfumes or lotions, so I don’t think I’m allergic to anything like that either. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, and then I’d like to examine your lower extremities. If you’d be so kind as to lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose I must. But it's a bit high for me, isn’t it? I may need some help getting up afterwards. It’s a bit difficult these days, you see.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out. Hmm. Any chest pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just a little tired. Taking deep breaths always makes me a bit winded, but no pain. Is something wrong, Doctor? You're frowning. I'd prefer a straightforward answer, if you please. I have an appointment, remember?
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say anything definitive, Mrs. Vanderwiele. Your lungs are somewhat congested, and your heart rate is a little elevated, but these findings are not conclusive. Now, if you'll allow me, I need to examine your lower extremities for edema. Please point your toes downwards.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m pointing my toes. They do feel a little puffy, as I said. It's hard to tell if it’s more puffy than usual. It’s just… soft. And warm. Is that bad? I always have warm feet. My husband used to say they were like little heaters. He’s gone now, you see.
DOCTOR: There is some mild pitting edema bilaterally. It’s not severe, but it’s present. Now, could you please sit up slowly?
PATIENT: Alright. Slowly, you say? There. Is that alright, Doctor? I may need a moment to catch my breath. I’m not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that will do. Now, based on what you've told me and the findings of this preliminary examination, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of congestive heart failure. However, it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need to order some further tests. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a BNP test, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure? That sounds… serious. And tests? More poking and prodding? Is this going to take long, Doctor? I really must get home. My granddaughter is expecting me. Is it possible to hurry things along? I don’t want to be a bother, but I have plans. What exactly is a BNP test?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to rule out serious conditions and determine the best course of action. A BNP test is a blood test that measures a hormone released by the heart when it's under strain. It helps us assess the severity of your symptoms. As for "hurrying things along," I assure you, the laboratory will process the tests as quickly as possible. It will likely take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend you limit your salt intake and fluid consumption. And, if you experience any worsening of your shortness of breath or swelling, you must go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here is the requisition form for the tests. Please take it to the laboratory, and they will draw your blood. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. My. Goodness. Limiting salt… fluid… emergency room… It’s all so much. I… I suppose not, at the moment. Just… this all sounds rather frightening, Doctor. And I really did want to spend the afternoon with my granddaughter. Is it possible to get a ride to the laboratory? I don’t drive anymore. And what if something is seriously wrong? .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, I understand your anxiety. However, I am a physician, not a transportation service. You will need to arrange your own transportation to the laboratory. And as for what if something is seriously wrong, that is precisely why we are ordering these tests. I cannot speculate on the outcome until we have the results. I'm afraid that is all I can tell you at this time. If you have any urgent concerns, please contact your primary care physician or go to the nearest emergency room. I have other patients waiting. Thank you for your time.
