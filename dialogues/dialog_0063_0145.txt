DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste any time, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. I understand this is regarding… assistance at home? My daughter explained it, but I confess, the details… slipped my mind a bit. It is about knowing if I qualify, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, “qualify” is… a term. Your daughter scheduled this appointment, indicating concerns regarding your ability to manage independently at home. We need to ascertain the extent of any difficulties you may be experiencing. Now, let’s start with the present. What specifically brought you in today?
PATIENT: Ah. Yes, my daughter, Sophie, she worries, you see. She is very… thorough. As for specifically… well, I had a fall, just last week. Not a bad fall, thankfully. Just a little stumble in the garden while I was tending my roses. But Sophie insisted I be evaluated. She believes this is… prudent. I do not disagree, precisely, but I am perfectly capable, generally. It just… sometimes requires a little more effort than it used to.
DOCTOR: A fall. And you say it was “just” a stumble?
PATIENT: Yes, “just” a stumble. I caught myself, really. Bruised my hip a bit, that is all. I did not break anything, and I finished tending the roses afterward. I assure you, Doctor, I am not one to exaggerate. But Sophie… she has a vivid imagination, and a strong sense of protection. She sees a small bump and imagines a catastrophe. It is… endearing, in its way, but… perhaps not entirely accurate.
DOCTOR: “Patient reports fall, minimal injury.” Now, Mr. Bahta, let’s clarify. When you say you “caught yourself,” can you describe how you did that?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. Well, I tripped over the watering can, you see. It was a bit hidden amongst the rose bushes. I instinctively put my hand out to steady myself, and I managed to… brace against a trellis. It was a rather sturdy trellis, thankfully. It prevented a complete tumble, but it did rather jolt my hip. I believe I also… flailed a bit. But truly, it was not a dramatic event. I was upright within moments.
DOCTOR: And after this… incident, did you experience any pain, dizziness, or confusion?
PATIENT: Pain, yes, a bit of a throb in the hip for a day or two. Nothing a little liniment couldn’t handle. Dizziness, no. Confusion… perhaps a momentary startle, but not… confusion, no. I remember everything perfectly. I watered the roses after the stumble, you see. And I pruned the dead heads. I even deadheaded the ‘Peace’ rose, which is a rather delicate operation. My memory is quite sharp, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Aside from this fall, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. That is… a broad question, Doctor. I am 54 years old, naturally there are some changes. My hair is… thinning, for instance. And my knees occasionally ache in the cold weather. But I assume you are referring to changes in… functionality? If so… I find I tire more easily, perhaps. And I sometimes… misplace things. My spectacles, usually. Or my pruning shears. But these are minor inconveniences, really. Nothing that prevents me from leading a… reasonably normal life.
DOCTOR: Misplacing things… how often would you say this occurs?
PATIENT: Ah, that is… difficult to quantify precisely, Doctor. Perhaps… two or three times a week? It is usually something small. My spectacles, as I mentioned. Or the remote control. Yesterday, I could not find my car keys for a good ten minutes. Sophie did find them, eventually, under a cushion on the sofa. She seemed… triumphant. But it is not a regular occurrence, I assure you. Just a little absentmindedness. A common affliction, I believe.
DOCTOR: “Occasional misplacement of objects.” Now, Mr. Bahta, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, my medical history. Let me see... I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, a rather unpleasant affair. And I had a bout of pneumonia several years ago, but I recovered fully. I also suffer from… mild hypertension, which is managed with medication. Otherwise, I am quite healthy, Doctor. I walk daily, I eat a balanced diet, and I avoid excessive indulgence. I do enjoy a glass of red wine with dinner, occasionally. But nothing… excessive.
DOCTOR: Medication for hypertension. May I ask what medication are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. Let me think... It is… Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once daily. I have been taking it for… oh, approximately five years now. My general practitioner, Dr. Dubois, prescribed it. He monitors my blood pressure regularly. It is usually… well managed, with the medication. Sometimes it fluctuates a bit, but nothing… alarming. I assure you. Dr. Dubois is very good.
DOCTOR: "Lisinopril 10mg daily." Now, Mr. Bahta, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. None at all, to my knowledge. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to any medication. I have taken various antibiotics over the years, various painkillers… everything, really. And I have never had any… untoward effects. I assure you, allergies are not a concern. My daughter… Sophie, she is allergic to pollen, terribly so. But I, thankfully, am not.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Bahta, I'm going to need to do a brief physical assessment. Please stand up and follow my instructions. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am quite happy to comply. Just… please be gentle with my hip. It is still a little tender, you see. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Please follow my finger with your eyes… and don't look away. Now, squeeze my hands. Both of them. Blood pressure is… adequate. Now, stand on one leg. Which leg feels more stable?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am following, Doctor. Quite clearly, I believe. I am squeezing, Doctor. As firmly as I am able. Oh… a little unsteady, I confess. The left leg feels… more stable, I believe. Though neither is particularly… robust at the moment. The hip, you see. It throws one off balance.
DOCTOR: “Mild imbalance, favors left leg. Reports hip discomfort.” Now, please walk a few steps for me, heel-to-toe. Slowly.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. One… two… three… four… A little… precarious, I confess. I am not accustomed to walking in such a… deliberate manner. It feels rather unnatural. And I do believe my hip is protesting somewhat. Is this satisfactory, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, Mr. Bahta, I'm going to need to review your medical records in more detail. Please wait here. This will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall wait here. Please, do not trouble yourself unduly on my account.
DOCTOR: Your records indicate a recent Vitamin D deficiency, Mr. Bahta. And your daughter, Sophie, has reported concerns about your memory and ability to manage everyday tasks. Considering the fall, the imbalance, and your overall presentation, I believe a referral to a neurologist is warranted. We need to rule out any underlying neurological conditions.
PATIENT: A neurologist? A neurologist, Doctor? I confess, I am rather… taken aback. I assure you, my memory is perfectly fine. A little forgetfulness, perhaps, but nothing… concerning. And the fall was simply an accident. A momentary lapse in balance, that is all. Are you certain this is necessary, Doctor? It seems… rather drastic. Perhaps a second opinion? Or a course of physical therapy?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, with all due respect, your daughter’s concerns, coupled with the objective findings from my examination, necessitate further investigation. I am obligated to ensure a thorough assessment. While a course of physical therapy may be beneficial eventually, it is premature to initiate it without a clear understanding of the underlying cause of your imbalance. I understand your reluctance, but I must prioritize your safety and well-being. This is the contact information for Dr. Moreau, a highly respected neurologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. I will also prescribe a Vitamin D supplement to address the deficiency. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is… prudent. Though I maintain it is a rather excessive precaution. Dr. Moreau… I suppose I can schedule an appointment. And the Vitamin D… yes, certainly. Perhaps Sophie was right to worry. Just… how long will this process take, Doctor? And will it… interfere with my gardening? That is, naturally, my primary concern.
DOCTOR: The duration of the assessment will depend on Dr. Moreau’s schedule and the necessary investigations. As for your gardening, that will depend on the findings. I advise you to refrain from any strenuous activity until after your initial consultation. Here is the prescription. I suggest you follow the dosage instructions carefully. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe… that is all. Though I confess, I am not entirely reassured. Very well. I shall schedule an appointment with Dr. Moreau and… refrain from strenuous gardening. Thank you for your… attention, Doctor. I believe I shall take my leave.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please ensure you follow up with Dr. Moreau promptly. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, do not hesitate to contact my office. .
