DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me in… well, that’s a bit difficult to recall precisely. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather frequently, if I understand correctly. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. A few weeks, perhaps? It’s just… a lot of trips.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. A few weeks, you said. That's helpful. To get a better understanding, could you describe what "frequent" means to you?
PATIENT: Frequent… well, let me think. It's not constantly, you understand. But… before, I might have gone, oh, three or four times a day. Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Perhaps even more often if I drink a good deal of water. It’s… disruptive, I suppose. I don’t quite recall a time when it wasn't like this, but my daughter mentioned it seemed excessive when she last visited. She’s… quite observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a noticeable increase from three or four times a day to every couple of hours, especially with increased water intake. And your daughter has noticed it as well. That’s good information. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I… I don’t believe so. No pain, thankfully. No… burning sensation. Just… the frequent need to go. Perhaps a little… thirstier than usual, now that you mention it. But I always enjoyed a good glass of water. I can’t say for certain if it’s more than usual, or simply that I’m noticing it more because of the… other issue. Is that… a symptom?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know there’s no pain or burning. Increased thirst can be related, yes. It's helpful you're able to distinguish if it's a new symptom or something you normally experience. Now, I’d like to ask a bit more about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or any prostate issues?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh dear. That's… a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. I… I believe I had something years ago, a minor ailment, but I cannot recall the specifics. My general practitioner at the time handled it. I've always been… relatively healthy, I think. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses that I’m aware of. I do have Medicare, of course, but I haven’t… utilized it much. As for the conditions you mentioned… diabetes, high blood pressure… no, I don’t believe so. And prostate issues… I don’t recall ever being told I had any problems in that area.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common for details to be a bit fuzzy. No major surgeries, no chronic illnesses, and no known history of diabetes, high blood pressure or prostate issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. I… I seem to recall a brief stay, many years ago. A minor… incident. I tripped and fell, broke my wrist, I believe. It was quickly resolved, a simple cast. Nothing… serious. No other hospitalizations that I can recall. Surgeries… just the wrist, I think. A very straightforward procedure. I was quite young at the time, actually. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken wrist many years ago, repaired with a straightforward procedure. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… ah, that's… complicated. My parents are both… gone now, unfortunately. They lived a long life, both of them. As far as I am aware, they didn't suffer from any… major illnesses. My mother… she had some trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis, I think. My father… he was a very robust man, remarkably healthy for his age. No… no history of diabetes, heart problems, or anything like that that I can recall. I don’t believe anyone in the family had… similar complaints to my own, but I wasn’t particularly close to many of my relatives.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your parents lived long lives, your mother had some arthritis, and your father was robust. No significant family history of diabetes or similar complaints that you're aware of. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. I’ve always… disapproved of smoking. My parents were very strict about that, and I’ve simply never had the inclination. I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I… indulge excessively. Perhaps a glass or two a few times a week. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet… well, I try to eat a balanced diet, I suppose. I enjoy cooking, mostly traditional Czech dishes. Lots of soups, stews… potatoes, certainly. I eat a fair amount of meat, though I’ve been trying to cut back a bit lately. And vegetables, of course. I’m not a particularly fussy eater, thankfully. I do enjoy a good sweet treat now and then, a pastry or a piece of cake. But nothing… excessive, as I said before. I find comfort in food, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a traditional Czech diet, with soups, stews, potatoes, and meat, with attempts to cut back. That sounds quite reasonable. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me see. No, not currently. I haven’t required any regular medications for quite some time. I did take something for… a minor cold a few months ago, but that was a temporary thing. As for vitamins or supplements… no, I don’t take anything regularly. I believe in getting my nutrients from a balanced diet, as I said. No pills, no powders, nothing of the sort.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. That’s good to know. Now, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76, respiration rate is 16, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Those are all within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical, strength is 5/5 in all extremities. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but smooth and symmetrical. No nodules or tenderness detected. Based on the physical exam, the slightly enlarged prostate is a notable finding. Now, to help narrow down the cause of your frequent urination, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A slightly enlarged prostate, you say? Hmm. Well, that’s… concerning, naturally. I suppose it’s good to know what’s happening, though. A urine analysis and a PSA test… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Please, proceed with those tests. Whatever is necessary to determine the cause of this… inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood for the PSA test and collect a urine sample. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to keep a voiding diary, noting how much fluid you drink and how often you urinate. This will help us get a better understanding of your pattern. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol for a few days, as these can irritate the bladder. And make sure to drink plenty of water, even though you're trying to reduce your intake. It sounds counterintuitive, but staying hydrated is important. Once we have the test results, we can discuss the next steps. The slightly enlarged prostate could be a sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is a common condition in men your age, or it could be something else. We need to rule out other possibilities, such as a urinary tract infection or diabetes. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A voiding diary… yes, I can certainly do that. Keep track of the fluids and the frequency… it seems a bit tedious, but if it helps, I will. And avoiding caffeine and alcohol… well, that shouldn’t be too difficult. Benign prostatic hyperplasia… it sounds… complicated. And you mentioned ruling out infection and diabetes… yes, that makes sense. Hmm… let me see. Yes, I do have a question, Doctor. If it is this… hyperplasia… what are the… typical treatments? Is it something serious? And… will it affect my… quality of life?
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Mr. Verbose. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, isn’t cancer, so it’s not life-threatening. However, it can cause bothersome symptoms, like frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak stream, and feeling like you haven’t completely emptied your bladder. You’re already experiencing some of those symptoms. The treatment options depend on the severity of your symptoms. For mild symptoms, we might start with lifestyle changes, like limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and regular exercise. We could also discuss medications to help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, or to shrink the prostate gland. In more severe cases, we might consider minimally invasive procedures to remove some of the prostate tissue. These procedures are generally very effective and have a relatively quick recovery time. As for affecting your quality of life, untreated BPH can interfere with your daily activities and sleep. But with proper treatment, most men are able to manage their symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. It’s important to remember that we don’t have a diagnosis yet. We need to wait for the test results to get a clearer picture. But I want to assure you that there are many effective treatment options available, and we’ll work together to find the best one for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, Doctor. Knowing there are options is… helpful. Minimally invasive procedures… that sounds… preferable to more drastic measures. Hmm. I believe that answers my immediate concerns. Thank you, Doctor Andraca. You’ve been… very thorough. I appreciate your patience. I will follow your instructions regarding the voiding diary and the fluid restrictions. I suppose I shall wait for the test results then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verbose. I'm glad I could address your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or experience any worsening of your symptoms while you’re waiting for the test results. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results back. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You as well. I believe I shall take my leave then. Goodbye.
