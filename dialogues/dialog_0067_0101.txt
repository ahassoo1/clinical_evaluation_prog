DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been havin’ this headache at the back of me head. Right here, . It's been botherin’ me for a little while now, on and off. Not terrible, but enough to make me notice it, y'know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A headache at the base of your skull. And you said "a little while now," could you tell me roughly how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’d say… maybe three weeks now? Started off just every other day, feelin’ it after I’d been on me feet all day at the salon. Now it’s almost daily, though it’s not constant, if that makes sense. Some days it’s just a dull ache, other days it’s a bit sharper.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. So, about three weeks, started with activity, and now it’s more frequent, varying in intensity. You mentioned being on your feet all day at the salon – is that your occupation?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. I’m a manicurist and pedicurist. Been doin’ it for… oh goodness, almost fifty years now! It keeps me busy, but all that bendin’ and stretchin’… it can take a toll on you, y'know? Not complainin’, mind you. I love me work. But I reckon it could be somethin’ to do with the headache.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me. Fifty years is wonderful! And yes, that physical demand certainly could be a factor. Besides the headache itself, have you noticed any other symptoms that happen at the same time, or that seem related?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Now that you mention it, sometimes me vision gets a little blurry when I’m workin’. Not all the time, just occasionally. And… now I think about it, I’ve been feelin’ a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. But I figured that was just from bein’ an old man! I’m 87, after all. Everything starts to creak a bit, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Popova, it does. But it’s still important we investigate. Blurry vision and increased fatigue along with the headache – that’s good information. When you say blurry vision, is it in one eye or both?
PATIENT: It's both eyes, Doctor. Not a major blur, mind you. Just... like lookin' through a bit of fog, or after I’ve been readin’ for a long time. It goes away pretty quick once I rest me eyes. And it doesn’t happen every time I read, just sometimes. These old eyes aren’t what they used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, both eyes, intermittent, resolves with rest. That helps me paint a clearer picture. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No nausea or vomiting at all. Just the headache, the blurry vision, and the tiredness. And sometimes a little stiffness in me neck, but I always put that down to sleepin’ in a funny position. Old age, y'know? Things get stiff.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. No nausea, vomiting, or fever. Let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Let me think… Years ago, the doctor told me me blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, but I stopped takin’ it ‘cause it made me feel a bit dizzy. Haven’t really bothered with it since, to be honest. Aside from that, nothin’ much. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. Never had diabetes or arthritis or anythin’ like that. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, medication use with dizziness as a side effect, and otherwise relatively healthy. Did you have any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. Always managed to avoid them, thankfully. A few stitches here and there when I was a young lad, runnin’ around and gettin’ into mischief, but nothin’ major. Just the usual scrapes and bruises. I've always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Me mother, she lived to be 95, strong woman. She had a bit of arthritis in her hands near the end, but other than that, pretty healthy. Me father, he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. And I have a sister, she's still livin' in Jamaica, but I haven't seen her in years. She's doin' alright as far as I know, but we don't really talk much. No history of serious headaches in the family that I'm aware of, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant family history of headaches. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin' at all. Just a cup of chamomile tea before bed sometimes to help me sleep. But that's it. No pills, no vitamins, no nothin'. I try to stay away from all that stuff if I can. Natural is best, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with anythin' like that. I can eat whatever I want, take whatever medicine they give me. Always been lucky that way too. Though, I don't go around tryin' to eat everything, mind you! Just never had a reaction to anythin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Popova, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Go ahead, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's gonna be somethin' uncomfortable, alright? I'm an old man, things don't move as easy as they used to!
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Popova, everything seems relatively normal so far. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I did hear a slight murmur, but your heart rhythm is regular. Your reflexes and strength are normal, and your gait is slightly slow but stable. I’m going to gently palpate your head and neck to check for any tenderness. I do notice some tenderness at the base of your skull, which I suspect is related to your headache.
PATIENT: Yes, that's where it hurts the most. Right there, . Especially when I bend me head forward. Feels like a tight muscle, almost. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. I figured it was just from workin’ so hard, but it’s been botherin’ me long enough now that I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that tenderness is consistent with muscle strain. Given your occupation and the intermittent blurry vision and fatigue, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out anything else. We’ll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and Vitamin D levels. I also want to get an EKG to assess your heart murmur further. And finally, I'm going to recommend a CT scan of your head just to rule out any structural issues. I know that sounds like a lot, but it's just to be on the safe side. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh my… that is a lot. A CT scan… sounds serious. Is it somethin’ you think is really wrong, Doctor? I just came in for a headache, not expectin’ all this. I don’t mind the blood tests, and I suppose an EKG is alright, but a scan… that worries me a bit. What exactly are you lookin’ for? I trust you, mind you, but I’d feel better knowin’ what’s goin’ on. And how much will all this cost? I’m retired, you know, and money isn’t exactly growin’ on trees.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Popova, and I apologize for potentially overwhelming you. A CT scan isn't necessarily indicative of something serious. It’s simply a precaution, given your age and the intermittent blurry vision. We want to rule out any underlying structural issues that could be contributing to your headache. We'll be looking for things like any abnormalities in the brain tissue, any signs of bleeding, or any issues with the sinuses. Regarding cost, I understand your concern, and I'll have my staff work with you to explore all available options. We'll check if your insurance covers any of the tests, and we can discuss potential payment plans if needed. I assure you we'll do everything we can to make this affordable. Before we proceed with the scan, let's focus on the blood tests and EKG first. They are relatively simple and can provide us with valuable information. We can then discuss the need for the CT scan after we have the results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Blood tests and an EKG first… that I can handle. And talkin’ about the scan afterwards, after we see the results… that makes me feel a lot better. I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly. I just don’t want any unnecessary fuss, you know? I'm an old man, I’ve lived a good life. So, what do I need to do about these tests? Do I need to fast for the blood work? And where do I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Exactly. We'll start with the basics, and we can always reassess. Yes, you do need to fast for the blood work. That means no food or drink – except water – for at least eight hours before the test. We'll schedule it for first thing in the morning, so you can have dinner tonight and then fast overnight. The EKG and blood tests can both be done here at the clinic. My nurse, Sarah, will give you the necessary paperwork and schedule your appointments. She’ll explain the preparation instructions in more detail. I’ll also have her provide you with information about the CT scan, including the cost and potential risks, so you have all the facts if we decide to proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. First thing in the mornin’… I can do that. And talkin’ to Sarah about the details… that’s good too. You've put me a lot more at ease, thank you. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I just want to feel better, you know? And I trust you to help me get there. So, I guess I'll go and talk to Sarah now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'm glad I could ease your mind. And yes, please go and speak with Sarah at the front desk. She'll take excellent care of you and get everything scheduled. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – severe headache, fever, changes in vision, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please don't hesitate to call us immediately. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Popova. We'll get to the bottom of this. And please, don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your kindness and patience. And I'll be sure to talk to Sarah now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Popova. Have a good day, and we'll see you tomorrow morning.
PATIENT: .
