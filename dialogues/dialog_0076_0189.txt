DOCTOR: Right, yes. Mr. Rowbottom, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. And frankly, I haven't got all day. I used to fly people all over the world, you know. Now I'm the one waiting around. What's this about, anyway? Blood in the... well, you know. Not a pleasant topic.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, everyone's time is valuable, Mr. Rowbottom. The nurse mentioned something about… hematuria?
PATIENT: Hemato-what-now? Look, I don't speak doctor-talk. Blood, plain and simple. In my stool. Is that all you need to know, or are we going to play word games? Honestly, these young people... always with the fancy words.
DOCTOR: Blood in your stool. Right. And how long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a couple of days, I suppose. Maybe three? It's not like I spend all day examining it, you know. Just noticed it when… well, when I went to the bathroom. It's not a lot, mind you. Just a streak. But it's enough to be bothersome. And concerning, naturally. A man my age... things fall apart.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said three days… has there been any change in the amount of blood, or the… consistency of the stool itself?
PATIENT: Consistency? Now you're just being difficult. It's... normal, mostly. Except for the red bits. And no, it hasn't gotten worse, if that's what you're asking. Just... there. I haven't been eating anything different, I don't think. Though Agnes – my ex-wife – always said I didn't have a refined palate. She was a fussy one. Does that matter? The food, I mean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any abdominal pain, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little… discomfort, maybe. Old age, you know. Things ache. But nothing sharp, or anything. Just a general feeling of… being old. Is that a symptom? Because if it is, I'm practically riddled with them. I used to be able to fly for twelve hours straight without a problem, but now… well. Don’t tell me I’m getting senile.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Haven't thrown up a thing. Just… irritated, frankly. Having to explain all this. A man’s private business, you know? And to be asked about the consistency… Honestly. But no, no nausea, no vomiting. Perfectly steady. Except for this… inconvenience. Is there a test you can just do to tell me what's wrong, or are we going to keep quizzing me?
DOCTOR: Yes, well, there are tests. We’ll need to do a stool sample, of course. And potentially some blood work. Given your age… and the presence of blood… we’ll also want to consider a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colono-what-now? You're going to look where? With what? Absolutely not. I’ve heard stories. Awful stories. Invasive, unpleasant… No, thank you. I’ll just… take some pills, I suppose. Something to stop the bleeding. I’m not sticking anything up… there. I’ve lived a long life, thank you very much. I’m not going to spend my last days… probed and poked. No. Just no. Is there anything else?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, with all due respect, dismissing this could be a serious mistake. We need to rule out more serious conditions. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting potential problems like polyps or… worse. I understand your reluctance, but it is medically necessary. We can discuss sedation options to make it more comfortable. Refusing it… leaves us with limited options and a significantly increased risk.
PATIENT: Sedation? Hmm. Will I be… asleep? Completely? I don't like the sound of being asleep. What if something goes wrong then? And who will… well, never mind. Look, I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But I want everything explained. Everything. What are these “polyps”? What’s the “worse”? And who’s doing this? I want someone… competent. Not some fresh-faced medical student. And I want Agnes… no, scratch that. No one needs to know about this. It’s a private matter. Are we clear on all of that? And when can I expect this… ordeal? Don’t tell me it’s going to take all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Yes, we can discuss sedation options; you would be lightly sedated, monitored closely, and generally unaware of the procedure itself. We'll explain everything beforehand. Polyps are growths inside the colon; most are benign, but some can become cancerous. That's why it's important to remove them. As for who will be performing the procedure, it will be Dr. Chen, a highly experienced gastroenterologist. And, of course, your privacy is paramount; no one will be informed without your express permission. We'll schedule it for next week. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. First, though, we need to collect a stool sample and run some blood work to get a baseline. Nurse Patel will assist you with that. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Patel, you say? Very well. Thirty to sixty minutes... I suppose that's manageable. But I want that Chen fellow to know exactly what he’s doing. No surprises. And don’t expect me to be cheerful about it. Still, it's better than… well, never mind. Yes, alright. Patel can collect the… sample. Get it over with. Just… no unnecessary conversation, please. I haven’t got the energy for small talk. And tell Dr. Chen to be gentle. Very gentle. Now, where do I find this Nurse Patel? Is she… competent? You see, I have a sensitive constitution.
