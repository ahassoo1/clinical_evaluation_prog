DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Okay… cough. I been coughin’ a lot. Long time already. And… tired also. Very tired. Sometimes my nose… block, you know? Like… sinus, I think they call it? Happens often.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough, tiredness, and a stuffy nose… sounds frustrating. How long have you been dealing with the cough specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… six months? Or more? I dunno exactly. It comes and goes, but mostly… there. Not getting better. My wife keep telling me to come see doctor, that’s why I’m here now. Sorry, I not good with rememberin’ dates.
DOCTOR: No worries at all about the dates, it’s perfectly alright. Six months of a cough is definitely long enough to get it checked out. Is the cough producing any mucus when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh… yes. Sometimes. White stuff. Not… a lot, but there. And sometimes… yellow. When I very sick, you know? Like got… flu. Sorry, I not sure what the color mean.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. The color can sometimes give us a clue. Have you had a fever at any point with this cough, or body aches?
PATIENT: Fever… yes. I think so. Not high, but… warm. Sometimes. And… ache, yes. All over. Like… when got the flu, you know? Not every time, but when cough very bad, I feel ache. Also… headache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cough for six months, white or yellow mucus, occasional fever, body aches, and headaches when the cough is bad. Have you noticed anything that makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… worse… maybe when the weather cold? Or when I… dusty place? Like workin’ on the tires, yeah. Lots of dust. Also… maybe when I lie down at night? Cough more when I sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather, dusty environments, and lying down seem to trigger it. Do you have any shortness of breath or wheezing when you cough or exercise?
PATIENT: Shortness of… breath? Not really. Maybe… little bit when I run? But I not run much, you know? Old man now! No wheezing. Just… cough, cough, cough.
DOCTOR: Alright, no wheezing is good. Just the cough. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past health. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Asthma… no. Bron… what you say? Never been told that. Pneumonia… maybe when I small boy? I dunno. Long time ago. I think I got sick… very sick… but I not remember what it was. Sorry. I not good with rememberin’ things.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. It’s alright if you don’t remember. Okay, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. Hospital… maybe when I was little boy? Fall from tree. Broke arm. But… that a long time ago. I haven’t been to hospital since then. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… My father, he got… heart problem. I think. He take medicine for it. And my mother, she got… sugar. Diabetes, that’s it. She always tired. I think that’s why I worry about feelin’ tired also.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father and diabetes in your mother. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I not like take medicine if I don’t need. My wife, she give me some… herbs sometimes. For cough, but… not help much. Just water and rest, that’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… no, I don’t think so. I can eat anything. Sometimes itchy when mosquito bite, but that’s everyone, right? Never been sick from food or medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Last question about your background – do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. I hate smoke. My wife, she hate smoke also. Makes me cough even more! No, never touch it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. Alright, Rayshon, thanks for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your throat, if that’s okay with you. Would you mind taking a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That's okay. Sounds good.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a deep breath… and another one… alright. Your lungs sound a little congested, I can hear some crackling, especially on the lower lobes. Your throat looks a little red, but no major swelling. I also don't see any swollen lymph nodes in your neck. Your temperature is 99.8 Fahrenheit, which is slightly elevated. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it sounds like you likely have acute bronchitis. The cough, congestion, and slight fever fit the picture. The history of it going on for six months suggests it might have started as something else, and maybe it’s just lingering. But, we should rule out anything more serious, just to be safe. Would you be okay with getting a chest x-ray?
PATIENT: X-ray… okay. What that do? Is… painful? I not good with… needles and stuff. And… will it show what’s wrong? You think it serious? Sorry, I get worried easily.
DOCTOR: That's completely understandable. No, an x-ray isn't painful at all. It's just a quick image of your lungs using a small amount of radiation - less than you get from a cross-country flight, honestly. You'll just stand or sit in front of a machine for a few seconds. It helps us see if there's any pneumonia, fluid buildup, or anything else going on in your lungs that we can't see just by listening. I don't think it's serious, but it's always best to be thorough, especially since the cough has lasted so long. It could be a simple lingering bronchitis, but we need to rule out anything more concerning like pneumonia or, rarely, something else. I want to be sure we get you the right treatment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, if you think so. No needles? Just… stand? Yeah, I can do that. I want to know what’s wrong, you know? My wife been tellin’ me to see doctor for long time. So… yes. Do the x-ray.
DOCTOR: Great. I’m glad we could discuss this. Alright, I’ll send you to the radiology department right down the hall. They’ll get you set up. Once they have the images, I’ll review them, and we’ll discuss the results and a plan. While we wait for the x-ray results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and avoiding irritants like dust and smoke. You can try an over-the-counter cough suppressant if it's keeping you up at night. Do you have any questions for me before we get you to radiology?
PATIENT: Okay… rest, fluids… cough medicine. I can do that. Uh… just one. How long the x-ray take? And… will it make me tired? Sorry, I keep askin’ questions.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all! It’s good to ask questions; it helps you understand what’s going on. The x-ray itself will only take a few minutes, maybe five at most. It shouldn't make you tired; it doesn't involve any physical exertion or anything like that. The technician will just position you and take a few images. After that, you can come right back here, and we’ll wait for the results together. I’ll explain everything as soon as I have them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Five minutes. Not tired. Sounds… okay. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Rayshon. I’m happy to help. Alright, let’s get you to radiology, and we’ll take it from there. Let me walk you over there. They’re just down the hall, second door on the right. I’ll meet you back here as soon as I can.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. .
