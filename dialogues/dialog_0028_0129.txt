DOCTOR: Right. Dawnetta Hatchard, 73. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Been happening for a bit now, and frankly, I don’t have time for this. I take pills, you know, for the arthritis. The red ones. Lots of ‘em. Is that what’s doing it? I just need to know if I need to worry, or if it’s just the pills.
DOCTOR: Black stool… right. And you've noticed this for “a bit”?
PATIENT: A few weeks, I reckon. Maybe a month? It's hard to say, I don't spend my days looking at it, you know? It's not like it’s bright black, more…dark. And it's not every time. Just sometimes. Look, I’m a mechanic. I fix things. I don’t deal in…bathroom issues. Can you just tell me if it’s serious? I have a truck that needs a new transmission.
DOCTOR: A month… intermittent. Right. And you mentioned arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Yes, the red pills. Doctor gave ‘em to me years ago. I take…oh, let me think… four in the morning, two after lunch, and three at night. Sometimes more if my knees are acting up. They’re…Naproxen, I think? Something like that. Big red ones. I've been on ‘em forever, honestly. It’s just… this black stool thing is new. And worrying. Though I doubt it’s anything serious. I’m a strong woman. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, yes. And a significant dosage, it appears. Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fatigue along with this change in stool color?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes a bit of a rumble, but I get that with everything I eat these days. Old age, you know. Nausea, no. Not really. Vomiting, heavens no. And fatigue? Well, I'm 73! Of course I'm tired. That’s just…life. Look, I’m not one for complaining. Is the black stool something I need to stop taking the pills for? Because if so, I’m not sure I want to. They let me work. And I need to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to be thorough. I need to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. And I'll do a quick digital rectal exam, to check for any obvious signs of bleeding. It’s standard procedure, don’t worry. If you’ll just lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: A digital rectal exam? Honestly. Is that really necessary? I mean, I’m not a delicate flower, but… really? It's probably just the pills. But fine. Get it over with. Just be quick about it, alright? I have a transmission to rebuild.
DOCTOR: It’s a necessary part of the evaluation, Mrs. Hatchard. It helps us rule out other potential causes. Alright. No obvious masses or tenderness. Your abdomen sounds normal, though there is some slight generalized discomfort. I'm noting that you appear slightly pale. We will need to order some lab work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a stool occult blood test, and a liver function panel.
PATIENT: Lab work? More waiting? Honestly, this is ridiculous. A complete blood count? A stool test? You're going to poke and prod me and run a million tests over a little bit of dark stool? Look, I’m telling you, it's the pills. Just write me a prescription or something to protect my stomach and let me get on with my life. This is a waste of my time, and frankly, your time. I have a business to run. I don't understand why we’re making such a fuss.
DOCTOR: While it’s possible the Naproxen is the cause, black stool can also indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. We need to rule that out. The lab work will give us a clearer picture. I’m going to order those tests now, and I'll also prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – Omeprazole – to help protect your stomach lining. However, this does not mean we've ruled out anything serious. It's a precautionary measure. You’ll need to follow up with me once you have the results, and we may need to consider a referral to a gastroenterologist if things don't improve. Here are the requisitions for the lab work, and here’s the prescription for Omeprazole. Please schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Are you serious? No, I don't have any further questions. Just…this is a lot of fuss over nothing, I'm sure. I’ll get the tests done, but frankly, I'm not optimistic. If you’ll excuse me, I have a truck waiting. Honestly, the younger generation… always overreacting. .
