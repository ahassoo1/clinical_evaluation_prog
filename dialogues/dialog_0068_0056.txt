DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… well, it’s the young people. The students. They simply don’t appreciate the value of a well-ordered library anymore. It’s quite… draining. I suppose that’s what my… assistant… said I should mention. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important collection to catalogue.
DOCTOR: I see… Your assistant brought you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, she insisted. A rather… enthusiastic girl. Thinks I need to “address my stress levels.” Honestly, the library runs perfectly well. Perfectly. I’ve been doing this for… a long time. A very long time. I simply don’t have time for… feelings. Can we just get this over with? I really must return to my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. While I understand your desire to get back to your work, it's important to address any concerns your assistant has, or that you might have. Even if everything seems perfectly well, it’s good to rule things out. Just to be thorough. So, let's start with… you mentioned feeling drained. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: "Drained" is a rather… dramatic word, Doctor. Let's just say I find myself… less enthusiastic about certain aspects of the job. The constant… noise. The lack of respect. The… digital devices. Everything is digital now! They don't need libraries anymore. It's... frustrating. And tiring. Is that what you wanted to hear? Honestly, I’m not one for discussing personal matters.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, frustration and fatigue, perhaps linked to changes at the library and the… shift towards digital resources. Has this been a gradual change, or did something specific happen that made things feel worse?
PATIENT: It’s been… insidious, Doctor. A slow erosion of standards. Each year, fewer students appreciate the beauty of a physical book. Each year, more of them are glued to their… screens. There wasn’t a specific event, it’s just… a general decline. It’s quite depressing, really. And the administration… well, they don't understand either. They want "innovation," whatever that means. It's all very… chaotic. Is this going anywhere? I truly don’t see what this has to do with my health.
DOCTOR: Well, chronic stress and frustration can have an impact on your health, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s good to identify these things. Let's try to get a broader picture. Outside of the library, how have you been feeling generally?
PATIENT: Outside the… library? I… I don't really do much outside the library. I used to… travel, I suppose. With my wife. But that was… a long time ago. She… passed away, you see. And now… the library is my life. It’s the only thing that keeps me… focused. Honestly, Doctor, I haven't given much thought to anything else. I’m perfectly content with my routine. Though, admittedly, sleep has been… less restful lately. Is that what you’re getting at?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m very sorry for your loss. And yes, the sleep disturbance is relevant. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to enjoy a hearty meal, but now… everything tastes rather bland. And I find myself… irritable. Snapping at the students, even when they haven't done anything wrong. My assistant has pointed that out as well, of course. Honestly, it's just… tiresome being around them all. So much… energy. I suppose I’m just getting old. Is that all you need to know? I really must get back… .
DOCTOR: Alright. So, decreased appetite, irritability, and difficulty sleeping, along with the chronic stress. It would be helpful to rule out any underlying medical causes for these symptoms. Perhaps a quick physical exam and some routine bloodwork?
