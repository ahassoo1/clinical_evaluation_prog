DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t quite recall all the details. My husband insisted I come. Something about… establishing care? We just moved here, you see, and he’s terribly concerned about these things. It's all rather…fussy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. Establishing care is important, and it's common to feel a little overwhelmed with a new move. Your husband is very thoughtful to be proactive. We’ll take things at your pace. So, even if you don't recall specifics, anything at all that’s been bothering you, even mildly, would be helpful. Are you experiencing any pain, discomfort, or changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, at my age, something always aches. It's simply the natural order of things. I assure you, it’s nothing… noteworthy. Though my knees do protest when I try to garden. But I managed a perfectly lovely rose bush just last week, so it can’t be that bad. Really, I think my husband is making a mountain out of a molehill.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re still able to enjoy gardening! And it's very common for knees to have some discomfort with age and activity. Just to get a better picture, would you say this knee pain is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, naturally. It wouldn't be sensible for it to be constant, would it? When I overdo it, perhaps. Or if it’s particularly damp. Honestly, I’ve lived a long life; I know my own body. I don’t need a litany of questions about…dampness.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Candice. You know your body best. I apologize if my questions seemed unnecessary. I just like to gather all the information I can. Besides the knees, are you experiencing any other aches or pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: My back isn’t what it used to be, of course. But who is at my age? It’s a slight stiffness, mostly. I manage. I have a very good housekeeper who sees to things. Honestly, I think all this poking and prodding is entirely unnecessary. Is this standard procedure?
DOCTOR: That's fair, Candice. I understand your concerns. A quick check-up is standard when establishing care, just to have a baseline and make sure everything is as it should be. It allows us to better understand your health and address any potential issues early on. Would you mind if I just listened to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your back?
PATIENT: I suppose… if it must be done. But I expect it to be quick. And gentle. I haven't the patience for a lengthy examination. Honestly, I have errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. Quick and gentle, I promise. Please sit comfortably. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Everything sounds clear, but I am noting some mild tenderness to the lower back on palpation. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Good heavens, that is tender! As I said, my housekeeper is very good. But as for appetite… well, one doesn't have the same enthusiasm for food as one used to. And I haven’t bothered with a scale in decades. Weight is such a vulgar topic. Honestly, I think we are done here, aren't we?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. I apologize for any discomfort. It's helpful to know about the decreased appetite. Just to get a complete picture, have you experienced any problems with your sleep, or noticed any fatigue or unusual tiredness?
PATIENT: Sleep? At my age, one is grateful for any sleep. And fatigue… naturally! One tires easily when one has lived a long and productive life. Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of these questions. Are you implying something is wrong with me? I assure you, I’ve always been perfectly… robust. I think I've answered enough questions for one day.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Candice. I'm not implying anything is wrong. I’m simply gathering information to get a better understanding of your overall health. It’s standard practice when establishing care. Let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh, a little something for my arthritis, occasionally. And a vitamin D supplement, my daughter insists. Honestly, all these pills… they rattle around in my stomach. I can't recall the names, and I doubt they would mean anything to you anyway. I prefer natural remedies, you see. I think I’ve indulged your curiosity quite enough.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright, Candice. We can often get that information from your pharmacy if you’d like. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve eaten everything, travelled everywhere. I am not one of these… delicate flowers. Honestly, I find this entire process rather… insulting. Are we quite finished? I have a luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full and adventurous life, and you’re in remarkably good spirits. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, I don't have any immediate concerns. However, given your age and history of arthritis, I would recommend a basic blood test to check your vitamin levels and kidney function, just as a precaution. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A blood test? Honestly! At my age, one simply doesn't do these things. I think I’ve humored you long enough. I’m quite certain I’m perfectly fine. And frankly, I have no intention of returning for any… unnecessary poking and prodding. Good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand your reluctance. I respect your decision. I’ll document our conversation and the examination findings. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. Here’s a card with the clinic’s information. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: Very well. Good day to you as well, Doctor. .
