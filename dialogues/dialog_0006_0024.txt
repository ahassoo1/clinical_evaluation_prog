DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. Kiante, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s me. Good morning, Doctor Gorga. Look, if we could just get this letter sorted quickly, that would be wonderful. I have a flight to catch on the 15th.
DOCTOR: Right, a flight. Yes, of course. Well, to get that letter sorted, I need to understand why you need it. What brings you in today, Kiante?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit complicated. My husband passed away last year, unexpectedly. He handled all the travel arrangements, always. And now, to go visit my sister, I need a letter confirming I can fly. Apparently, because of… well, everything, they need proof I’m fit to travel. It’s just a formality, I think, but the airline is being very strict. Medicare said I needed a doctor’s note.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband passed away last year… and the airline requires a letter confirming your fitness to travel. That makes sense, given the circumstances. And Medicare suggested this. Just to be clear – and forgive me, my memory isn't what it used to be – are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now?
PATIENT: No, not really. Honestly, I’m… fine. A little stressed, of course, with everything, but physically, I'm completely healthy. I don't take any regular medication, haven't been to the hospital since… well, since my husband. I had my annual check-up last November and everything was normal then. It's just this letter I need.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just pull up your records from last November...yes, here we are. Annual check-up, all normal. Blood pressure good, heart rate good… Everything appears to be in order. Just to cover all bases – and again, apologies if I’m asking questions you’ve already answered – any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. None at all. I can eat anything, no reactions to anything I've ever tried. Honestly, Doctor, I’m probably healthier than most people my age. This is really just paperwork, isn’t it? I appreciate you going through everything, but I'm a bit pressed for time.
DOCTOR: Right, no allergies. Okay. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, none. Not even over-the-counter things regularly. I'll take something for a headache if I really need it, but that's it. I really don't like taking pills unless absolutely necessary. Can we just… get to the letter? I have a connecting flight to think about, and I need to book a specific seat.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No medications, no allergies, recent check-up normal… Okay. I can certainly write a letter stating that you are medically fit to travel. Just to be absolutely sure, and for my documentation… have you experienced any changes in your health since your annual check-up?
PATIENT: No, absolutely none. Same as before. I've been feeling a bit…sad, naturally, but that's not a health condition. I’m sleeping okay, eating okay, no dizziness, no chest pain, nothing. It's all just grief, Doctor. Really. Can we please just get the letter? I'm starting to worry I won't make my flight.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Okay. Here you go. This confirms you are medically cleared for air travel as of today’s date. It also states you are not currently under my care for any significant medical conditions. Will this suffice for the airline?
PATIENT: Yes, that looks perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor. I really appreciate you getting this done so quickly. You’ve saved me a lot of stress. Is there anything I need to sign or… anything I owe?
DOCTOR: No, no signing necessary. And as for payment… Medicare should cover it, as it’s a standard clearance. Don’t worry about a thing. Just… try to get some rest before your flight, alright?
PATIENT: Wonderful. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. You've been very helpful. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Safe travels.
