DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get one of those cards… the one for driving, for ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or taxi work. I just want to make sure I’m allowed to do it, legally. It’s a bit of a bother, all this paperwork, but better safe than sorry, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. You’re referring to a medical certificate, often called a DOT physical certification, to ensure you meet the health requirements for commercial driving. That's very responsible of you to get it checked. Before we proceed, I’d like to review your medical history. I see here you are 70 years of age, and your weight is listed as 139 pounds with a height of 155 centimeters. Do you confirm this information is accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s all correct. 70 this year, actually, in November. And yes, the height and weight are right. I haven’t changed much in… well, a long time. I was married for a very long time, but divorced now. Just me, these days. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, San. And no, your marital status doesn’t directly impact the medical certification. I was simply gathering a complete picture of your overall health. Now, to begin, could you tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, I wear glasses. Other than that… I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that’s not bothered me since. Nothing major, really. I try to stay active, you know? Gardening mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you, San. That’s helpful. So, arthritis in your hands, corrective lenses for your vision, and a history of gallbladder removal. Do you know when you had your gallbladder removed, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it must have been… 1988, I think. Maybe '89. It was right after my husband and I took that trip to Hawaii. Yes, definitely before '90. It was a pretty quick recovery, thankfully. I don't recall any complications. I was much younger then, of course!
DOCTOR: 1988 or 1989, gallbladder removal without complications. Good to know. Now, regarding your arthritis, does it affect your ability to grip or manipulate objects?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. It's mostly stiffness and a little pain. Some mornings it's harder to make a fist, but I can still do everything I need to. I can garden, I can cook, I can drive just fine. It doesn't stop me from doing anything. I take a little over-the-counter medicine sometimes, when it’s really bad. See? Not too bad.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. That’s good to hear. And what over-the-counter medication do you use for the arthritis when needed?
PATIENT: Oh, just ibuprofen, mostly. Sometimes naproxen if the ibuprofen isn't enough. Nothing fancy. And I don’t take it every day, only when it flares up. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, San. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My mother always said I had an iron stomach! I’ve never even had poison ivy. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, San. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. My heart is fine, as far as I know. I had a checkup with my regular doctor last year, and everything was normal. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, and I haven’t felt dizzy in ages. I walk a bit every day, helps keep everything working.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring, San. And do you have any problems with your hearing or vision, other than wearing corrective lenses?
PATIENT: Well, my hearing isn’t quite what it used to be, I suppose. I sometimes have to ask people to repeat themselves, especially if there's a lot of noise. But it’s not too bad. And my vision is fine with my glasses, of course! I get them checked every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and ensure you meet the requirements for the DOT medical certification. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this card and be done with it. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll examine your vision and hearing. Finally, I’ll assess your range of motion and neurological function. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Both are within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… Is that alright? I used to be a very nervous patient, but I’ve gotten better over the years. Just tell me if anything seems wrong.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, meaning I don't hear any wheezing, crackles, or other unusual noises. Now, let's check your vision. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Right here in my purse. Here you go. They’re fairly new, I got them checked in March. I need them to read, mostly. Not so much for distance.
DOCTOR: With your glasses, your vision is 20/30 in both eyes. That’s acceptable for the certification. Now, I’ll check your peripheral vision. Your peripheral vision appears normal. Finally, I'll examine your ears with an otoscope. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums appear normal. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that alright? My neck gets a bit stiff sometimes, so it’s a little hard to keep it perfectly still.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally. Finally, let’s assess your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that strong enough, Doctor? I used to help my husband in the garden a lot, so I still have some strength left. He’s gone now, but… we used to do everything together. It keeps me busy, though, gardening.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is good. Alright, San. That completes the physical exam. Overall, your exam findings are within acceptable limits for the DOT medical certification. Based on my assessment, I am able to sign the medical certificate for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! That’s a relief. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You were very thorough, and you made me feel quite comfortable. So, I can just go get the card now? What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I'm glad I could help. Yes, I will complete the necessary paperwork and sign the medical certificate. You can then take this form to the licensing agency to obtain your official DOT medical card. The form details where you need to go. I'll also provide you with a summary of today’s exam findings for your records. It’s important to keep this information with you, in case of any future medical concerns. Do you have any other questions about the certification process or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Delacour. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate your time and patience. I’m glad I came in today. It’s good to have peace of mind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m happy I could assist you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and drive safely!
