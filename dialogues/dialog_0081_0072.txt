DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Forgetting things, you say. “Little things” can be quite disruptive, I understand. Can you elaborate on what these “little things” are?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Like… I left my keys in the fridge yesterday. And I had a dentist appointment scheduled for last week, but completely missed it. I didn’t even remember I had an appointment until my office called to charge me a no-show fee. It’s not a consistent thing, it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Leaving keys in the fridge… missing an appointment. And this is a relatively new development?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It's been maybe… the last three or four months? Before that, I was pretty sharp, I think. I mean, I’m a dentist, you know? I have to remember a lot for my work. It’s just… unsettling. And it’s not like big things, I remember how to do my job, and I remember people’s names usually. It’s more… everyday stuff.
DOCTOR: Well, dentists are often quite stressed individuals. It’s understandable that minor lapses in memory occur with a demanding profession. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s… a fair point, I am stressed. But this feels different, you know? It’s not just being tired or overwhelmed. Hmm… let me think. I guess I’ve been a little more… clumsy lately? Dropping things, bumping into furniture. Nothing major, but it’s happened a few times. And sometimes I have trouble finding the right words, like they're on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness, difficulty with word retrieval… Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your vision, headaches, or any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no headaches. And my vision seems fine, I think. I haven’t noticed anything different there. No weakness or numbness either. It's really just the forgetting, the clumsiness, and… that trouble with words. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise, which is why this is so confusing.
DOCTOR: Perfectly healthy, you say. Well, let’s review your medical history then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need to know. I have Medicare, so I’m sure they have a lot of information already. I don’t really have any major medical problems, to be honest. Just the usual check-ups and things.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does provide a fairly comprehensive record. Let’s see… no significant past medical history noted. No surgeries. Any family history of neurological conditions – Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, dementia, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had Alzheimer’s. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember a lot of the details, but my mother always said she had it. And… I think my uncle, her brother, had some issues with memory later in life too, but I’m not sure if it was ever properly diagnosed. It’s a bit of a hazy memory, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alzheimer's in the grandmother, possible cognitive issues in the uncle… Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I’m single. I live alone. I work a lot, obviously. I don’t really have a lot of hobbies, to be honest. I used to enjoy hiking, but I haven’t had much time for that lately. I eat pretty healthy, I think, and I don’t smoke or drink much. I’m not much of a partier.
DOCTOR: Single, works extensively, limited hobbies, healthy lifestyle… Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I’ve had the usual antibiotics and things over the years, but never had a reaction. I’m pretty good with medications, being a dentist and all. I always double-check everything for my patients.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Given your symptoms – the recent onset of forgetfulness, clumsiness, difficulty with word retrieval, combined with a family history of Alzheimer’s, I think it is prudent to conduct a basic neurological examination and order some baseline blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I appreciate you taking this seriously. A neurological exam and blood work, okay. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… what kind of things will the exam involve? I’m a little nervous, to be honest. It’s just… the thought of something being wrong…
DOCTOR: Understandable nervousness, Ms. Heidenthal. The examination is quite straightforward. I will be assessing your reflexes, coordination, balance, and cognitive function with a few simple tests - things like recalling a list of words, repeating phrases, and identifying common objects. It is not painful or invasive in any way. It is simply a preliminary assessment to determine if further investigation is warranted. Now, if you’ll just follow my instructions... Let’s start with your reflexes. Please sit comfortably and relax your legs.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… less scary than I thought. Relax my legs, right. Alright, I'm ready. I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, can you please close your eyes and tell me the date?
PATIENT: …August 2nd… 2025. Is that right? I think so. It’s Tuesday, isn’t it? Or is it Wednesday? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025 is correct. Let's move on. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Remember them, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Apple, Table, Penny. I think I’ve got it. It’s… a bit of a strange combination, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Now, I want you to close your eyes again. I’m going to place an object in your hand, and I want you to tell me what it is.
PATIENT: Um… it’s… long and… cylindrical? It’s… something you write with? Oh, wait… it’s a… pen! Yes, it’s a pen. A ballpoint pen, I think. Is that… okay? I feel like I should know this instantly.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite adequate. Now, can you please tell me the current President of the United States?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That’s… that’s on the tip of my tongue. Is it… Biden? Joe Biden? I think it’s Joe Biden, but I’m not completely sure. It’s embarrassing, I should know this!
DOCTOR: Adequate. Alright, Ms. Heidenthal. That concludes the brief neurological assessment. As you can see, there are some… areas of concern. We will proceed with the blood work to rule out any underlying vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues that may be contributing to your cognitive difficulties. We will also order an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of your neurological status. I want to be upfront with you, Ms. Heidenthal. While it is too early to make a definitive diagnosis, your symptoms and family history warrant a thorough investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An MRI… and a thorough investigation… So you do think something is wrong. It’s… Alzheimer’s, isn’t it? That’s what you’re thinking. I… I don’t know what to say. It’s terrifying. Yes, I understand. I… I think. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Heidenthal, let’s not jump to conclusions. Many conditions can cause cognitive impairment, and it’s far too early to label anything definitively. The MRI and blood work will provide us with crucial information. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid unnecessary stress and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available, and then we can discuss the next steps. I’m also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion, as is standard practice in cases like yours. Do you have any questions about the referral process?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. A second opinion. That sounds… sensible. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will the MRI… will it be painful? I’m not good with enclosed spaces.
DOCTOR: The blood work results typically take 2-3 business days. The MRI scheduling will depend on availability at the imaging center, but we can expedite the process if necessary. As for the MRI itself, it is generally painless, but it does involve lying still inside a scanner for approximately 30-40 minutes. If you have claustrophobia, you can discuss options with the technician, such as open MRI or mild sedation. We will ensure you are comfortable and informed throughout the entire process, Ms. Heidenthal. Now, let's proceed with the referral paperwork. Do you have any preferred neurologists, or would you like me to suggest a few based on your insurance network?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any preferences. Just… whoever is good. Whoever can… tell me what’s happening. I… I guess that’s all. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will contact you to schedule the MRI and neurology appointment. We will also send you a copy of your test results once they are available. In the meantime, try to remain calm and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Heidenthal?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. .
