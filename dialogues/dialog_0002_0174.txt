DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good morning. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. A bit… down, you could say. It’s rather inconvenient, to be honest. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I see. Okay, that's good you came in to talk about it. It's definitely better to address things when they start affecting your daily life. “A bit down” can mean a lot of different things. Can you tell me a little more about what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain. Just a general lack of enthusiasm, I suppose. Things don't feel good anymore. Even my garden, which I usually adore, feels like a chore. And I’m sleeping poorly. Not nightmares, just…restless. It’s been going on for a few months now, I believe. Though, truthfully, time does seem to slip away these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. A loss of interest in things you usually enjoy, trouble sleeping… and it's been going on for several months. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. Not particularly, no. I still eat. Perhaps not with the same gusto, but I haven't lost my appetite entirely. My housekeeper does most of the cooking, you see, and she’s very good. I wouldn’t say I’ve been looking forward to meals, though. Just…eating because one must.
DOCTOR: Okay, eating normally, just not enjoying it as much. And you mentioned sleeping poorly – is it difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: Mostly staying asleep, I think. I can get to sleep alright, usually. But then I wake up…several times during the night. And then I lie there, just…thinking. Or not thinking, exactly. Just…awake. It's frustrating. I used to be a very sound sleeper. A good eight hours, without fail.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up during the night and having trouble getting back to sleep. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels during the day?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. I tire easily. Used to be I could work in the garden all day, then go to a social event, no problem at all. Now…now I find myself needing to rest in the afternoon. And even then, I don't feel truly rested. It’s…disconcerting. I’m a very active woman, you see. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling tired even after resting is definitely concerning, especially when it’s a change from your usual level of activity. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, sadness, or worthlessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. That’s a…good way to put it. Not constantly, mind you. But there are days when…well, when I wonder what the point of it all is. Sadness, not really. More…empty. And worthlessness…no, I wouldn’t say that. I’ve always been a productive member of society. But I do feel…unmoored, if that makes sense. Lost my footing, perhaps. It’s a strange feeling. I don't want to feel this way.
DOCTOR: That makes a lot of sense, and it sounds incredibly difficult. It’s good you’re able to articulate these feelings. To help get a better picture, let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had a touch of the flu a few years ago, nothing serious. My doctor always checked my blood pressure – usually a little high, but manageable with diet, he said. And I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, successful operation, thankfully. Other than that…no, nothing significant. I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. I believe in looking after oneself. Do you need a list from my previous physician? I can certainly arrange that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No, a list isn’t necessary at this point, but thank you for offering. Knowing about the hip replacement and slightly elevated blood pressure is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the hip replacement?
PATIENT: No, just the hip. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, of course, but that was so long ago it barely seems relevant. And a rather unpleasant wisdom tooth extraction in my twenties, but that hardly counts as surgery, does it? Nothing major, certainly. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I believe a strong constitution is a gift from God.
DOCTOR: No, those wouldn't be considered major surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family, has anyone else in your family experienced anything like what you’re going through— depression, anxiety, or other mental health concerns?
PATIENT: That’s a…difficult question. My sister, God rest her soul, was…always a bit melancholic. Not officially diagnosed, mind you. But she spent a lot of time indoors, and wasn’t particularly social. My mother worried about her, constantly. And my nephew, on my son’s side, has…struggles, I believe. He doesn’t talk about it much, but my daughter-in-law mentioned he sees a therapist. So, yes, there’s been…a tendency, perhaps. But nothing overt, if you understand what I mean. We weren't a family to discuss such things openly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A family history of those kinds of struggles can certainly be relevant. Let's talk a bit about your current lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! I’ve never touched a drop of alcohol in my life, and the thought of smoking is abhorrent. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I have always been a very temperate woman. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, though. Earl Grey, usually. And perhaps a small biscuit with it. But that is hardly a vice, is it? I believe in moderation in all things. I have always prided myself on my good habits.
DOCTOR: No, a cup of tea and a biscuit is hardly a vice! That’s very good to know. Just covering all the bases. One last question about your lifestyle. Are there any major stressors in your life right now – financial difficulties, relationship problems, or anything else that’s causing you worry?
PATIENT: Well… now that is a difficult question. My divorce, I suppose. It was finalized a few years ago, but… it still stings. He wasn't a bad man, exactly, just… incompatible. We grew apart. And my son lives quite far away, in America. I don’t see him as often as I’d like. And… truthfully, I miss having a purpose, I suppose. I used to be very involved in charity work, but I haven't felt up to it lately. So, yes. There are… stresses. But nothing insurmountable, I assure you. I’m a resilient woman. I always have been. I just…don't feel like myself. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s absolutely enough, Nani. And thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it's understandable that you're not feeling yourself right now. Okay, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m quite used to doctor’s visits. Though, usually, it’s just for a check-up. I’m hoping we can get to the bottom of this feeling soon. It’s rather… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Neurological exam is also within normal limits. I'm also going to take your temperature. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Everything appears physically normal at this point. Now, based on what you've told me and this brief exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that depression isn't a sign of weakness, and it's very treatable. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help us to identify the cause, then yes, please do. I’ve always believed in thoroughness. I just want to feel like myself again. Is it… serious? Will I need medication? I’ve heard… stories.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Nani. It's good you're asking those questions. The blood work is just to rule things out—it doesn't mean we've definitely diagnosed anything yet. And whether or not you need medication is something we'll discuss after we have the results of the blood work. There are many different treatment options for depression, including therapy, lifestyle changes, and, if necessary, medication. Medication isn't always the answer, and we'll only consider it if other options aren't effective. There are various types of therapy, like cognitive behavioral therapy, that can be very helpful. We'll talk about what's best for you based on your specific situation. The goal is to help you feel better, and we'll do that together. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done. I'll give you a requisition form, and you can go to the lab at your convenience. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. The lab is not far from my home. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need an appointment to discuss them, or can I just call? I prefer not to have to wait too long. This feeling… it’s rather unpleasant, as you can imagine. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: The results usually take about 3-5 business days. Once they’re back, the lab will notify me, and then my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. It’s best to discuss the results in person, so we can go over them thoroughly and make a plan together. I understand you don’t want to wait, and we’ll do our best to get you in as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you find your feelings are worsening, or if you have any thoughts of harming yourself, please don't hesitate to call my office or go to the nearest emergency room. It’s important to prioritize your safety. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough, and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow. Hopefully, we can get this sorted out soon. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nani. I’m glad I could help. No, there's nothing else you need to do for now. Just go to the lab at your convenience, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, you're not alone in this. I’m here to help you every step of the way. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. I appreciate that. Good day to you as well. .
DOCTOR: Take care, Nani. We'll talk soon.
