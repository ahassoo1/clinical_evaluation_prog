DOCTOR: Hi Stephane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face… well, it feels droopy on that same side. It’s quite alarming, really. I expect you to figure it out quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and understandably concerned. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are alarming. We'll get this sorted out as efficiently as possible. Just to clarify – which ear is it, and when exactly did you notice this started?
PATIENT: The left ear, naturally. And it was this morning. I woke up, and there it was. Don’t you people usually ask these things right away? Honestly, it’s just… gone. And my face feels like it’s going to fall off. It's the whole left side, don’t you see? It’s not a subtle thing.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, I apologize. Sometimes I jump ahead. Sudden onset is very important. Okay, left ear, this morning… and you're describing weakness on the entire left side of your face?
PATIENT: Weakness, drooping… it's all the same thing, isn’t it? Yes. The whole left side. It’s quite obvious, I assure you. I don’t appreciate having to spell it out. Is this going to take long? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I'll be as quick as possible while still being thorough. We need to rule out some serious possibilities. Okay, let's do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and stick out your tongue. Then I'll check your reflexes and some sensation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Honestly? It sounds like a waste of time. But fine. Get it over with. I’m sure it’s something dreadful. Just… be quick about it. And try not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, smiling… good. Raising your eyebrows… a little asymmetry there on the left. Tongue… sticks out straight. Reflexes are normal on both sides. Light touch sensation is intact. I’m also going to listen to your ear with my stethoscope. Just tell me if that's uncomfortable. Hmm… and I'm going to look in your ears. Okay, I'm seeing some slight redness in your left ear canal, but nothing dramatic. But the facial weakness is definitely present. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, this is concerning for Bell’s palsy. Have you had any fever, headache, or neck stiffness?
PATIENT: Bell’s… what? Is that serious? And no, no fever, no headache. No neck stiffness. I just woke up like this. It’s rather inconvenient, honestly. I have important meetings. Is there something you can do about it? Will I be able to hear again? And will my face stay like this forever? Get to the point.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bell’s palsy is weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of your face. It's often temporary, but it can be concerning. The cause is often unknown, sometimes linked to a viral infection. The good news is, many people recover fully. We'll need to rule out other possibilities first, though. I want to get a blood test to check for infection and inflammation. I also recommend an MRI of your brain just to be absolutely sure there isn't something else going on. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a course of oral steroids, which can help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of recovery. I’ll also recommend eye drops to keep your left eye moist, since you may not be able to blink normally. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Honestly, it sounds like a lot of fuss for a drooping face. Are you sure it’s not just… stress? I have a very demanding job. But fine, if you insist. Steroids… are those safe? I don't want any side effects. And how long will this take? I really don’t have time for this. Can’t you just give me something to make it better now?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I want to assure you I’m not recommending these tests unnecessarily. While stress can contribute to various health issues, the sudden onset of hearing loss and facial weakness is a red flag that we need to investigate further to rule out more serious conditions like stroke or a tumor. Steroids do have potential side effects, but they’re generally well-tolerated for a short course. We'll discuss those side effects in detail before you start them. Common ones include temporary increase in blood sugar and mood changes. I’ll also monitor your blood sugar levels. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix for this. The steroids are the best treatment we have to reduce inflammation and promote recovery. It can take weeks or months to see improvement, and sometimes physical therapy can help. Let’s get those blood tests ordered and schedule the MRI. In the meantime, be very careful to protect your left eye – use artificial tears frequently and consider wearing an eye patch at night to prevent injury. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm not allergic to anything. Honestly, this is all very disruptive. I suppose I have no choice. Just… get it over with quickly. And make sure the MRI place isn’t too crowded. I don’t want to sit around for hours with a bunch of sick people. Can I at least get a note for work explaining why I’m missing meetings?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, good. I’ll make sure to note that. And yes, absolutely, I’ll write you a note for work explaining your symptoms and need for medical leave. I’ll also try to recommend an MRI facility that minimizes wait times, although I can't guarantee it won't be busy. Here's the requisition for the blood tests – you can get those done at any lab, and they’ll send the results directly to me. And here’s the note for your employer. I’ll also have my assistant schedule the MRI for you. They’ll call you with the details. I want to see you back in one week to review the blood test results and discuss a plan moving forward. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your symptoms – such as worsening weakness, double vision, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. Just… try to make it as quick and painless as possible. And I expect to be feeling better soon. I have important things to do.
