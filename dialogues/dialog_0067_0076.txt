DOCTOR: Good morning, Clarke. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs, you see? They’re really bothering me. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda…hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins, red and hard. I see. And how long have you been noticing these bumps, Clarke?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started with just one or two, and now there’s quite a few. I didn’t think much of it at first, figured I just bumped them somehow. But they don’t seem to be going away, and they're a little sore sometimes. Especially when I'm working.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months, starting with a few and now several, and some soreness, particularly when you’re working. Can you tell me a little bit about the type of work you do, Clarke?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work moving… well, everything, really. Freight, stock, materials. It's mostly hand work, loading and unloading things. A lot of walking and standing, you know? I've been doing it for… a long time. Not as much as I used to, though. Getting older, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. A lot of physical work can certainly take a toll. And these bumps, are they only on your shins, or have you noticed them anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, just my shins. Both of them, pretty much the same. Not on my knees or ankles, just… right on the front of my shins. They're not itchy, thankfully. Just… noticeable and a bit uncomfortable when I'm putting weight on them. Is that…normal? I don't know anything about these things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, just on the shins, not itchy, and uncomfortable with weight-bearing. That helps me narrow things down. Have you noticed any changes in your skin around the bumps?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? The skin looks pretty normal to me, I think. Maybe a little dry sometimes, but I live in a dry place, so that's usual. It's not peeling or anything, and no blisters. Nothing like that. Does that make sense? I’m trying to remember, but it's just…bumps.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Clarke. No peeling, no blisters, just bumps and maybe some dryness. Okay. Now, have you had any recent injuries to your legs, even minor ones that you might not have thought much of?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not really, not that I can remember. I get little scrapes sometimes, you know, from the work, but nothing major. I try to be careful. Maybe I bumped them a while back, but I truly don’t recall anything specific. I don’t think so, though. It feels like they just…appeared.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I haven’t been feeling sick, no fever or anything. My legs don’t swell, and I don't have any pain anywhere else. I sleep okay, and I eat alright. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't at my age, right? No, I guess not really. Just these bumps. They're the main problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no swelling, no pain elsewhere, just the bumps and some occasional tiredness. I’d like to take a closer look at them, if that’s alright with you. Could you please sit back and I'll examine your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. Take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke, I'm feeling your legs now. There are about ten or so bumps on each shin, they're all fairly small, raised, and hard to the touch. They do seem slightly tender when I press on them, but no significant warmth or redness beyond what you've described. The skin surrounding them is dry, as you mentioned. It's looking like these might be shin splints with some localized inflammation. Have you been doing any new or increased activity recently?
PATIENT: Shin splints? Oh, my daughter used to get those when she was running track. Increased activity… well, the warehouse has been busier lately, so I’ve been doing a little more lifting and walking, but nothing that different. It’s not like I suddenly started running marathons or anything! Is that serious? Do I need to stop working? I have bills to pay, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Clarke. Shin splints themselves aren't usually serious, but they can be quite painful and debilitating if left untreated. It doesn't sound like you've dramatically increased your activity level, which is good. However, even a slight increase combined with the physical demands of your work can be enough to trigger them. Stopping work completely isn’t necessarily the first step. We’ll want to rule out other possibilities first. I'd like to order some basic bloodwork, just to ensure there isn't anything else contributing to this, like an inflammatory condition. And I'm going to recommend an X-ray of your lower legs to rule out a stress fracture. It’s better to be safe, especially since you're experiencing pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Bloodwork and an X-ray… okay. That sounds… thorough. I guess if it rules things out, that’s good. I don't mind getting the tests done. Will the X-ray hurt? And who will call me with the results? I really appreciate you looking into this, Doctor. It's good to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray won’t hurt at all, Clarke. You’ll simply stand or sit while the technician takes some images. It's a very quick and painless procedure. I'll personally review the bloodwork and X-ray results, and my nurse will call you with the findings within a few business days. If anything urgent comes up, she'll let you know immediately, of course. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible when you're not working, applying ice packs for 15-20 minutes several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the discomfort. We can discuss stronger options if those aren’t effective. Do you have any allergies to medications, especially NSAIDs like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to medications that I know of. I've taken ibuprofen before for headaches, no problem. Rest and ice… okay, I can do that. It's hard to rest when you've got bills to pay, but I'll try. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Or anything I should be avoiding besides working too hard?
DOCTOR: Good. Avoiding overexertion is key right now. Also, try to wear supportive shoes with good cushioning when you are working, and consider compression socks to help with circulation. For now, let’s focus on those basics – rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relief, supportive footwear, and compression socks. I’ll get the orders for the bloodwork and X-ray sent over to the lab and radiology department. My nurse will contact you to schedule those appointments. We'll review the results together and discuss a more definitive treatment plan at that time. In the meantime, if the pain worsens significantly, or if you notice any swelling, redness, or warmth spreading around your legs, please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better knowing what's going on and what I can do about it. I’ll see you after the tests then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Clarke. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. My nurse will be in touch to schedule those tests. Get some rest, and take care.
PATIENT: .
