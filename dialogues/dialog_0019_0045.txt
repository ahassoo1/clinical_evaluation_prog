DOCTOR: Good morning, Enrique. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my face. It gets… red. Like, flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, you know? It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Flushing, you say. And it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, comes and goes. Sometimes when I eat… spicy food, maybe? Or… when I get upset. Not very upset, just… a little bothered. It's hard to say exactly why. It just… happens. It's been going on for… oh, maybe six months now? I don't keep good track of these things.
DOCTOR: Right, six months or so. And it’s triggered by spicy food and, occasionally, feeling a little bothered. Do you notice anything else happening when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my heart beats a little faster. Not like racing, just… aware of it, you know? And… I get a little warm. Not a fever warm, just… hot face, warm body. No sweating, though. Definitely not sweating. And… I don’t get dizzy. No, no dizziness. That's good, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. No dizziness is certainly good. Okay, so flushing face, faster heartbeat, and feeling warm… all happening sometimes with spicy food or when you're a little bothered. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all, even if they don't seem connected?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my sleep hasn’t been the best lately. I wake up a few times a night. Not every night, but… more than usual. And… I’ve been a little tired. But, you know, who isn’t tired? I’m 57. Maybe that’s just… getting old. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: No, Enrique, being a little tired at 57 is perfectly normal. But it's good you mentioned it. Let’s just make a note of that. So, we have flushing, occasional faster heartbeat, warmth, and some disrupted sleep. Now, thinking about your past health... Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. My wife… she had some problems, but… I didn’t. Just… normal aches and pains, you know? Old age things. I had the flu a few times, that’s all. Nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for anything big.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. No major medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I don't like hospitals, you see. My wife… she had a lot of surgeries. I stayed with her, of course, but… I try to avoid them myself. It’s… not a pleasant place.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Enrique. No surgeries at all. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my family… my parents, they both passed away a long time ago. They didn’t have… this flushing thing. My sister… she has high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had some problems with his heart, a few years back. But… nobody else that I know of has this. It’s just me, I think. It's strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no family history of flushing, but a sister with high blood pressure and a brother with heart problems. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Never have. I try to stay away from them if I can. I believe in… letting the body heal itself, you know? My wife… she was on a lot of pills. It was… complicated. I prefer to just… deal with things myself, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, pollen, anything at all?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat everything. Spicy food, everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Never. Not even as a child. My wife was allergic to… cats, I think. But not me. I like cats.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. That’s good. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I live alone now, you see. My wife… she passed away two years ago. I used to work as a counselor, helping people with… problems, you know? But I retired a few years back. Now I mostly… read. And watch TV. I walk a little, but… not much. I don't drink, never have. And I don't smoke. Pretty quiet life, really. Simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, a quiet life, retired, no smoking or drinking. Now, Enrique, before we move on, are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed, even if they seem minor or unrelated?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes… my hands get a little shaky. Not all the time, just… when I’m nervous, maybe? Or… when I’m trying to do something delicate. Like… threading a needle. Or… writing my name. It's not bad, just… noticeable. And… sometimes I feel a little… anxious. But who doesn't get anxious these days? It's just… a little worry. Nothing serious, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaky hands and occasional anxiety. That's helpful to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a general look. It'll help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My wife… she didn’t like doctors very much. She always felt… poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Enrique. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Now, let’s take a look at your face. I notice some mild redness, especially on your cheeks. It’s not a rash, more of a flushing. Your pulse is a little quick, but not alarmingly so. Overall, you seem to be in good health, but that elevated blood pressure and the flushing are things we need to look into.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it… my heart? I don't want to end up like my wife, you see. She had so many problems…
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Enrique. Let's not jump to conclusions. Your heart sounds good right now, but the elevated blood pressure and flushing together are what we need to investigate. It could be a number of things - sometimes it's related to stress, diet, or even medication, though you’re not on any. It could be something called rosacea, which causes facial flushing, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few blood tests. They'll check your thyroid levels, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. It's a routine procedure, and it will help us pinpoint what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, I suppose so. If it helps… I don't like needles, you know. But… if you think it’s necessary. Where do I go for that? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Enrique. I understand your hesitation about needles. It's a quick procedure, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. There’s a lab just across the street - I’ll write you a requisition form. You can go there anytime tomorrow. They'll send the results to me electronically, and it usually takes about 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I’d like you to try to reduce your stress levels. Perhaps some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing or gentle exercise?
PATIENT: Relaxation… yes, I suppose. I used to enjoy reading, but… it's hard to concentrate these days. Deep breathing… I can try that. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Any foods I should avoid? I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Good question. For now, let’s avoid spicy foods and caffeine, as those can trigger flushing. Also, try to limit alcohol, though you don’t drink anyway. As for other foods, there’s no specific diet recommended at this point. We'll have a better idea once we have the blood test results. I’m also going to write you a referral to a dermatologist. They specialize in skin conditions and can provide a more in-depth evaluation of the flushing. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A dermatologist… yes, that sounds… wise. If you think it’s best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It’s… unsettling. My wife always said I worried too much. But… it's hard not to. Will the dermatologist need anything from you? Or should I just make an appointment myself?
DOCTOR: You're right to want to get to the bottom of it, Enrique. I’ll send a referral with my initial findings – the elevated blood pressure, the flushing, and the blood test results. That will give them a good starting point. You can call their office to schedule an appointment – the number is on the referral form. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. It’s always best to err on the side of caution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very sensible. Chest pain… shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. Thank you. You’ve been very… kind. And… patient. I think… I think that’s all for now, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. I’m glad I could help. Yes, I think that’s all for now. Just get those tests done and schedule an appointment with the dermatologist. And remember, if anything changes, or you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call. Take care, Enrique. And please try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I will. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
