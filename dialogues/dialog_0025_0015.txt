DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor… Fourney, yes? It is… my sinuses, I think. They feel… not good. It has been a little while, but I cannot say exactly how long. A few weeks, maybe? It is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. It is important to be precise, Ms. Boham, but we'll do our best. "Not good" is… vague. Can you describe what "not good" feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… like pressure, behind my eyes, and in my cheeks. And… stuffy. Very stuffy. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes, through my nose. Not always, but… often. It is a heavy feeling, you understand? And a little bit of… ache. Not a bad ache, but… present. I hope that makes sense. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Pressure behind the eyes, stuffiness, a heavy ache… yes, that's a bit more specific. And is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. Some days are worse than others. Today is… worse. Last week, it was better. I could… smell things. Now… not so much. My husband, he says I am not cooking with enough spice! But it is true, the smells are… faint. It's not a big problem, but… worrying, a little.
DOCTOR: Husbands. Well, loss of smell can be… concerning. Now, have you had a fever at any point during these "worse" days?
PATIENT: Fever… I do not think so. I have not felt hot, if that is what you mean. I have not taken my temperature, though. We… do not have one at home. My husband, he usually gets sick, not me. I am sorry, I am not very good with these things. I just know I feel… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no temperature taken. Have you noticed any pain in your teeth, or any drainage from your nose?
PATIENT: Drainage… sometimes. When I blow my nose, it is… a little thick, and yellow. Not a lot, but… there. It started around the same time as the stuffiness. The teeth… no, no pain in the teeth. Just the pressure, like a heavy weight. And sometimes, a little bit of headache. It is all connected, I think.
DOCTOR: Thick, yellow drainage… alright. Now, have you been exposed to anyone else who's been sick recently?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My husband works at the oil field, and he sees many people, but he has not been sick. And I… I mostly stay at home. We do not have many visitors. It is just us, usually. So, no. Not that I am aware of, Doctor. It is difficult to say, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That is… good. I will try my best to breathe normally. It is… alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Sinuses… a little tenderness to the touch here and here. No significant swelling. Your throat looks a little red, but that could be anything. It sounds like you likely have a sinus infection. It's not severe, but it needs to be addressed. Given your lack of a thermometer at home, and the yellow drainage, I think a course of antibiotics is warranted. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. That is… tender, yes. And… antibiotics. My husband, he has taken those before. I… I do not think I am allergic to anything. We have never had much need for medicine, thankfully. But I am not sure. Perhaps… a rash, once, when I was a little girl, after a shot, but it was long ago. It is hard to remember. Is it… bad? The infection?
DOCTOR: A rash after a shot is unlikely to be relevant. It’s important to be precise, Ms. Boham. And no, it's not bad – it's a common infection, easily treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, it could become more serious, but we’re catching it early. I’m going to prescribe you Amoxicillin. It’s a standard antibiotic. We'll do a 10-day course. And please, if you develop a fever, rash, or any difficulty breathing, stop taking the medication immediately and go to the emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… ten days. And… fever, rash, breathing trouble… yes, I understand. I will… watch for those things. My husband can help me, if I forget. But… I do not have insurance, Doctor. How much will this cost? I am… concerned about the money.
DOCTOR: That’s… unfortunate. The cost of the medication will vary depending on the pharmacy. I can write you a prescription for a generic version, which will be cheaper. I can also see if there are any patient assistance programs available, but those often have income restrictions. I'll also send you home with a list of low-cost pharmacies in the area. Frankly, the fact that you don't have insurance complicates things. It's a systemic issue, really. But we'll do what we can.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It is… difficult. I appreciate your help. My husband… he works very hard. And… we manage. The generic version is… good. That is alright. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to know? About the medicine? Or… anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Take the Amoxicillin with food, to minimize stomach upset. You may experience some nausea or diarrhea – that’s normal. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid alcohol while taking the medication. And if your symptoms don't improve after a few days, or they worsen, schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Food… plenty of fluids… no alcohol… Yes, that makes sense. I think… I think that is everything. No, Doctor, I do not have any other questions. Thank you for your time, and for your patience. You have been very kind. I will… take care. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon. And try to get some rest. .
