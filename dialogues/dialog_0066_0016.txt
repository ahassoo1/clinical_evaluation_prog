DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I must say, you look rather young to be a doctor. No offense, of course. It's just… well. Anyway, it's about my bruising. I’ve been on that blood thinner for… oh, it must be nearly two years now, since my wife passed, and lately I’ve been getting bruises just from looking at things. It’s ridiculous, really. Small bumps, I barely notice them, and then – bam – a purple mess. It's quite concerning.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Nicky. It’s a common observation! And you’re right to be concerned about increased bruising, especially while on a blood thinner. Two years is a good while to be on one, and changes like that definitely warrant a check-up. So, just to clarify, these bruises are appearing with minimal trauma, even things you wouldn’t normally notice?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Minimal trauma. I mean, I’m careful, I always have been. But I bumped my elbow on the doorframe yesterday – barely a touch, really – and this morning, it’s the size of my palm. Purple and… tender. And it’s not just my arms, either. I noticed one on my leg this morning, and I have no recollection of hitting it on anything. It’s… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information, Nicky. Bruising with minimal trauma, and appearing in multiple locations without a clear memory of injury. Has this been a gradual increase in bruising over the past few months, or did it seem to happen suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Now that you mention it, it has been gradual. At first, it was just the occasional one, and I chalked it up to getting older, you know? But over the last… oh, maybe three or four months, it’s definitely gotten worse. More frequent, bigger, and… easier to get, I suppose. It's not like I’ve changed anything in my routine, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over three to four months – that's helpful. And you haven’t had any falls, even minor ones, that you might not have immediately registered?
PATIENT: No, no falls. I’m quite steady on my feet, thank you very much. I take pride in my balance. It’s… well, it's important when you live alone. No, I haven’t stumbled or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like my blood is just… thinner than it should be. Which, I suppose, is the point of the medication, but this feels… excessive.
DOCTOR: You're right to question it, Nicky. It's good you’re paying attention to your body. Excessive bruising, even on a blood thinner, needs investigating. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. I see here you’ve been on warfarin since 2023. Do you know the reason you were prescribed it initially?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It was after my wife, bless her soul, passed away. She had… complications. Blood clots, that’s what the doctor said. Something to do with sitting too long on the plane during our trip to visit our daughter. They were afraid I might be prone to the same thing, given our… family history. So, they put me on it as a preventative measure. It felt a little… unnecessary, if I’m honest, but they insisted.
DOCTOR: I understand. A preventative measure after a family history of clots makes sense, although it’s always good to revisit the reasoning. Do you remember if any specific tests were done to determine your risk before starting warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… that was all so long ago, and I was rather… preoccupied, you understand. My wife… it was all a blur. I believe they took some blood samples, maybe checked for certain… factors? Something about clotting? But honestly, I couldn’t tell you specifically what they were looking for. The doctor just said it was “routine” and that it was best to be safe. They started me on the medication and… that was that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s understandable to not remember specifics during a difficult time. Let’s talk about other medications you're taking. Besides the warfarin, are you currently taking anything else – over-the-counter medications, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, just a standard one for seniors. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. Nothing prescribed, just the usual stuff. Oh, and sometimes I'll take a little bit of fish oil. For my heart, you know? My daughter suggested it. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and fish oil. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no blood in my urine or stool. No excessive fatigue, no dizziness… Just the bruising. It's really the only thing. Though now that you mention it, I have been feeling a little… weaker lately. But I just chalked that up to getting older. It's hard to say if it's related or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other bleeding symptoms, but some increased weakness. That’s worth noting. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and then take a look at some of these bruises. Do you have any areas in particular you’d like me to focus on?
PATIENT: No, go ahead. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose the bruise on my elbow is the newest one, so that might be a good place to start. And the one on my leg is rather large, though it's not particularly painful. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicky. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but that can fluctuate. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now and they sound clear. The bruise on your elbow is approximately 5cm in diameter, tender to the touch, and appears to be resolving, which is good. The bruise on your leg is larger, about 8cm, and also tender, but not excessively so. I don't see any other significant bruising visible at this time. I'm going to order a complete blood count and a prothrombin time test to check your blood levels and see how well your warfarin is working. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. As long as it helps figure out what’s going on. I must say, I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Some doctors just dismiss older patients as… well, never mind. A blood test sounds like a good start. And please, don’t hesitate to ask if you need any more information.
DOCTOR: I absolutely will, Nicky. And you’re right to advocate for yourself, and I’m glad you're speaking up. It's important to understand what's going on with your body. We’ll get those labs ordered right away. They usually take a couple of hours to come back. While we’re waiting, let’s talk a little bit about your diet. Are you eating a consistent diet rich in Vitamin K?
PATIENT: Vitamin K? Oh dear. I… I'm not sure. I try to eat healthy, you know? Fruits, vegetables… I like a good salad now and then. But I don't specifically focus on Vitamin K. My daughter is always telling me what I should be eating, but honestly, I just eat what tastes good. Is that bad? I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner… does that interfere with anything?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad”, Nicky, but Vitamin K plays a crucial role in blood clotting, and your warfarin works by interfering with Vitamin K. So, a wildly fluctuating intake of Vitamin K can make it difficult to maintain a stable dose of your medication. As for the wine, alcohol can also interact with warfarin, especially in large amounts. We need to maintain a consistent diet, and a consistent warfarin dose, for optimal effectiveness and safety. A sudden change in diet, or alcohol consumption, could affect your INR levels. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for a few days to review the lab results and discuss a more consistent diet plan. Would next Tuesday work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday sounds fine, Doctor. As long as I can remember it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. But yes, Tuesday is good. And I suppose I should probably cut back on the wine. My daughter would be pleased to hear that. A consistent diet… I’ll try my best. It’s just… sometimes a salad just doesn’t cut it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Nicky. We’re not aiming for perfection, just consistency. And if you forget, that's alright, we can review it again. Okay, let's get you scheduled for Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM. I'll also have the nurse print out a handout with a list of Vitamin K-rich foods and some dietary guidelines for patients on warfarin. In the meantime, if you experience any signs of excessive bleeding – nosebleeds, blood in your urine or stool, unusual bruising, or any prolonged bleeding from cuts – please head to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with an old man like myself. Emergency room… I’ll remember that. I always worry about those things. Thank you again for taking the time to listen and explain everything. I feel a little better now, knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nicky. It’s my pleasure. And please don’t think of yourself as "old"! You're proactive and engaged in your health, and that's what matters. The nurse will be in shortly to review the discharge instructions and schedule your follow-up appointment. If anything comes up before Tuesday, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good rest of your day, Nicky. And try not to worry too much. We'll get this sorted out.
