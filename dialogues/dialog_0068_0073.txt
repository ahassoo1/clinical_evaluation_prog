DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? This has been going on way too long. It's…well, it’s the runs. Just constant diarrhea. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and nothing’s helping. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Right, diarrhea… and you said it's been ongoing for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. It started…probably close to a month now? Maybe a little longer. Honestly, I stopped keeping track after a week. It's just…exhausting. And embarrassing to even talk about. I’ve been mostly just trying to tough it out, but it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: A month or longer…I understand. It can be difficult to discuss. And certainly disruptive. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m just…going to the bathroom a lot. And feeling weak, I guess. Not eating much because I don’t want to…you know. Is that a symptom? I just feel awful all the time. Look, I’m a painter, I need my strength. I can’t be running back and forth to the toilet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and decreased appetite along with the diarrhea. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Blood? No, no blood. Definitely not. And no fever, no throwing up, just…a lot of cramping. Really bad cramps. And like I said, no appetite. Everything just feels…off. I really don’t understand what’s going on. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, so it’s not that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No blood, no fever, no vomiting, just cramping and decreased appetite. And you haven't made any dietary changes. Let's see… Do you have any allergies to medications, Ms. Woodring?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I mean, I get a little itchy with some perfumes, but that's about it. No serious allergies. I don’t take anything regularly. Just some ibuprofen now and then for my back, but that’s it. Honestly, I don’t trust most of those pills anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. Ibuprofen as needed for back pain… And your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? What do you mean? I’ve had the usual colds and flus, broken a wrist when I was a kid… Nothing major. My husband… well, he had some heart trouble, but he passed away a few years back. That’s about it. I'm generally healthy, or was until this started.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Generally healthy until recently… Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don’t take too long. I have work to get back to, you know? I don’t have all day to sit around here. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Please lie down on the exam table. Alright… I'm hearing some…increased bowel sounds. And there's some tenderness here, in the lower abdomen. Nothing severe, but definitely sensitive. Are you experiencing pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: It's…tender all over, really. But yeah, lower abdomen is the worst. It just feels…tight. And crampy, like someone’s twisting things up in there. It’s really uncomfortable. Look, is this going to take much longer? I'm starting to feel a little… anxious just being here. I’d rather just get a prescription or something and go home.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased bowel sounds, lower abdominal tenderness. I understand your anxiety and wanting to get this resolved quickly. Given the duration and your symptoms, I’d like to order a stool sample to rule out any infection. And a blood test to check for inflammation and dehydration. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Can’t you just give me something to stop it? A pill, an injection… anything? I don’t have time for samples and blood work. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I'm a busy person. Is there anything else you can do? Like, a stronger over-the-counter thing?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. However, given the length of time this has been going on and the lack of response to over-the-counter medications, it’s important to determine the cause of the diarrhea before starting any treatment. Blindly prescribing medication could potentially worsen the situation or mask a more serious underlying problem. A stool sample and blood test will give us valuable information. If you are truly uncomfortable with those options, I can write you a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication, but I strongly advise against it without knowing the cause. And I would recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist. Would you like me to proceed with the lab orders, or discuss the referral?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Lab orders. I guess. But I want the results fast. And if this doesn't help, I'm going somewhere else. This is wasting my time. And honestly, I don't see what good a referral is going to do. More waiting, more tests… It’s all just a waste. Just get the paperwork started.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've printed out the lab requisitions for the stool sample and blood test. The lab is just down the hall. They should be able to take care of you right away. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, but I will have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. Here you go. And I’ll also have the nurse give you information about a gastroenterologist, should you decide to pursue a referral later. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I need to get back to work. Thanks, I guess. .
