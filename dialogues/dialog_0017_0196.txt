DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Licano. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember when it started, to be honest. It’s been a while, though. A long while. It just… is.
DOCTOR: "Always tired," you say. A rather unhelpful description, I must admit. When you say "always," can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, not literally always. Like, I sleep, usually. But… even after sleeping, I just don’t have the energy. It's like… dragging myself through mud all day. Maybe it’s been… six months? A year? It all feels… blurry.
DOCTOR: Six months to a year of fatigue. And this fatigue… does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Not that I can recall, really. Just… everything. Doing dishes, walking to the store… even just thinking sometimes feels exhausting. It’s… constant, I suppose. It doesn’t really get better or worse, just… is.
DOCTOR: Constant fatigue, you say. And no exacerbating factors. Very well. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Fever… no, not that I know of. Weight loss… maybe a little? I haven’t been eating much, but I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that makes sense. Chills… sometimes I feel a bit cold, but it’s August, you know? It could just be the air conditioning. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: “Not very good at remembering.” Yes, well. Let’s try a more directed question. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… Not really… I just… don’t feel hungry much anymore. Like, I should eat, I know I should, but it just doesn't appeal to me. I eat enough, I think, to keep going, but it’s not like I’m enjoying my food or anything.
DOCTOR: Decreased appetite and anhedonia regarding food. Very well. Now, Ms. Licano, have you experienced any difficulties with your bowel movements or bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Um… no, not really. Everything seems… normal, I guess. A little slow sometimes, maybe, but I mean, who hasn't…
DOCTOR: Routine question, Ms. Licano. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions—diabetes, heart disease, thyroid problems, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my husband… he had a heart condition, but I didn't… I don't think I do. The doctor told me I was perfectly healthy for my age… a while back. I take something for my blood pressure, I think… but honestly, Doctor, I get so confused with all the medications. I just… take what they tell me to take.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, unspecified. And a vague recollection of past good health. Let us attempt to clarify. What medications specifically are you currently taking, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, that’s the problem! I have… these. I… honestly, I don’t know what any of them are for. The pharmacy just… puts them in a bag for me every month. I just take them with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: This is… less than ideal, Ms. Licano. We will need to obtain a proper medication list. Fortunately, we have access to your electronic health record. Let's see… ah. Lisinopril 20mg daily, Atorvastatin 40mg daily, and… Metformin 500mg twice daily. Are you aware of these medications?
PATIENT: Oh! Lisinopril… that’s the blood pressure one, right? And… Metformin… my husband took that, didn't he? For… the sugar? I just… take them, like I said. I don’t really pay attention to the names. It’s all a bit much for me.
DOCTOR: Patient unaware of medication regimen. Now, Ms. Licano, have you had any surgical procedures in the past?
PATIENT: Surgical… hmm. I had my gallbladder out, I think. A long time ago. And… oh! And a hysterectomy, when I was younger. But that was… decades ago. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like another lifetime.
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy and hysterectomy. Very well. Now, Ms. Licano, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. And my brother… he had cancer, lung cancer. A smoker, he was. My father… he was healthy, as far as I know. A farmer, he was. Strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of heart disease, paternal history of lung cancer. Now, Ms. Licano, before we proceed to a physical exam, I must ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, never. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. And… drugs? Oh, goodness, no! Never. I’m a good Romanian girl, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption. Very well. Now, Ms. Licano, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. It’s… a bit cold, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, approximately 78 beats per minute. Lung sounds are… diminished bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles appreciated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with mild generalized fullness. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Blood pressure is 138/82. Your weight is 108 pounds. And your height is 187… centimeters, is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. 187. It feels… strange to be so tall, sometimes. Is something wrong, Doctor? Everything feels… a bit blurry, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, your weight is significantly low for your height. A BMI of 30.9 indicates obesity, but your current weight of 108 pounds suggests significant weight loss. The diminished lung sounds are concerning, and the generalized fullness of your abdomen warrants further investigation. Based on your history and physical exam, I suspect a number of possibilities. To rule out underlying causes, I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a chest X-ray. We will also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Tests? So… something is wrong? I just… feel so tired all the time. I don’t… I don’t understand all these words. What's a… comprehensive metabolic panel? And what if… what if it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, I understand you're anxious, but it is premature to assume the worst. A complete blood count assesses your red and white blood cell counts, which can indicate infection or anemia. The comprehensive metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. The thyroid test assesses your thyroid hormone levels, which can cause fatigue. These tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive appropriate treatment. We will discuss the results in detail at your follow-up appointment. Until then, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet and adequate hydration. The lab technician will contact you to schedule your tests. Do you have any other questions before I excuse myself?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. No… I don’t think so. Just… please hurry. I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the nurse provide you with a list of instructions and a referral to the lab. I expect you to follow these instructions diligently, Ms. Licano. And please, try to remain calm. .
PATIENT: .
