DOCTOR: Good morning, Hedy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day, okay? I’m just… tired. Really tired. And I been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, exactly. It just… tastes good sometimes. Don’t look at me like that. It’s… hard to explain. I just want something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. I understand. You’re feeling very tired, and you’ve been experiencing cravings to eat dirt. It's alright, you're in a safe place to talk about anything. It is unusual, but we can figure this out together. When you say “tired,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: More? What is there to say? I’m tired. Like… all the time. Even after I sleep. It’s not like regular tired, you know? It’s… heavy. Like someone’s sitting on my chest. And I can't seem to get anything done. I used to be able to… well, nevermind. It doesn’t matter now. Everything feels like too much effort. Does that make sense? Honestly, I just want to lie down.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Hedy. It sounds incredibly draining. And it's good that you're able to describe it so clearly. This fatigue… has this been going on for a long time, or is it a recent change?
PATIENT: Ugh, long time. Honestly, I don't even remember exactly when it started. Maybe… a few months? Everything's kinda blurry these days. It’s just… gotten worse. Slowly, but definitely worse. It used to be just at the end of the day, and now it's… all the time. And the… dirt thing started around then too, I think. It’s hard to keep track. I just want a pill or something to fix it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, and it's gradually worsened. And the craving for dirt started around the same time. I understand you're hoping for a quick solution, and we'll definitely explore options. This craving for dirt – is it just any dirt, or is it specific types?
PATIENT: Specific? What are you, a geologist? It’s… red clay, mostly. The stuff in my garden. I don’t go digging up special dirt, if that's what you're asking. It just… smells good, and tastes… earthy. I know it sounds crazy. Look, I haven't been feeling myself lately, okay? I just want to feel normal again. I used to… I used to do important work. Now I just… eat dirt and feel tired.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound crazy, Hedy. It’s important to understand all of what’s going on, and you're being very helpful in explaining things. This craving… how often would you say you’re giving in to it?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t make me think about it. It’s… most days. Not like huge amounts, okay? Just… a handful. Maybe a couple of times a day. When I’m really tired. Or stressed. Which is… always, lately. It's embarrassing, you know? I used to be a professional. Now I’m sneaking dirt in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: It is understandable that you’d feel embarrassed, Hedy. But you’re doing the right thing by coming in and talking about this. This craving, along with the fatigue, makes me think we need to run some tests to see what’s going on. Have you noticed any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, great. More waiting around. Look, I’m not a fan of doctors, okay? I just want a quick fix. Other symptoms… let me think. My stomach’s been… off. Kind of hurts sometimes. And I’ve been… extra tired, which, I already said. And… I don’t know. Just generally feeling awful. I can't seem to concentrate. I forget things. Like… names. And… what was I saying?
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal discomfort, difficulty concentrating, and memory issues. It’s alright to forget things, Hedy, especially when you're feeling unwell. That's actually quite common. The tests will help us understand what’s causing these symptoms and rule out anything serious. Specifically, I’d like to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and thyroid function. Also, given the dirt craving, we should look at your zinc and other mineral levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, more blood. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know? Even if I can’t remember what they are. As long as it’s quick. And don’t tell me about every single thing you’re looking for, okay? I don’t understand all that medical mumbo jumbo. Just tell me if I need a pill.
DOCTOR: Alright, Hedy. We’ll keep it as quick as possible. And I promise, I’ll explain the results in plain language, and we’ll focus on what’s important. No medical mumbo jumbo. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood now. After that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam—just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be gentle, okay? I bruise easily. And I really don't have a lot of patience for this. Just get it done. Honestly, I feel like I’m wasting my whole day here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Hedy. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your frustration. Let me just quickly wash my hands, and then the nurse will be right in to get started. You can sit comfortably on the exam table. And while we wait, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. More remembering. Look, I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Maybe ten years? I was healthy. I ate right. I worked hard. I was a computer programmer. CNC stuff. Very precise work. But then… my husband got sick. And… then he died. And everything just… went downhill. I haven’t really been keeping track of anything since then. No allergies, I guess. No major surgeries. I took some pills for… sadness, after he died. But I stopped taking them. That's about it.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Hedy. It sounds like you've been through a great deal. It's understandable that you haven't been focused on your health lately. Okay, so no known allergies, no major surgeries, and briefly took medication for sadness. Do you have any family history of medical problems—like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… that’s a long story. My mother had… something with her stomach. Cancer, I think. But she didn't like doctors either, so nobody really knew what was going on. My father was healthy as a horse. Worked in a factory his whole life. Strong guy. But he died young. Heart attack, I think. It was… a long time ago. I don't remember a lot of details. Honestly, I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with stomach cancer, father with a heart attack. It’s alright that you don’t remember the details, Hedy. We can work with what you do know. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs and do a quick exam of your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Take a deep breath for me… and let it out slowly. Good. Everything sounds okay so far. Now I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Ugh, cold. And poking. Just… be quick, okay? My stomach's been… off. It hurts sometimes. But it’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain. It’s more… dull. And achy. Like I ate something bad. But I haven't eaten anything bad. Except… the dirt, maybe. Don't look at me like that. It's not helping. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dull, achy pain, not sharp. And you’re right, the dirt could be contributing. I’m not judging, Hedy. We’re just trying to figure out what’s going on. I’m not feeling any masses or significant tenderness, but it does seem a bit sensitive. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. And your heart rate is a bit fast, 98 beats per minute. Okay, so to recap: fatigue, craving for dirt, abdominal discomfort, difficulty concentrating, memory issues, and slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate. We'll get the bloodwork results back as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Ugh, so many problems. Just tell me what I need to take. A pill, or something. I don’t have time for all this talk. And don’t tell me to change my diet or exercise. I’m tired, remember? Just… fix me. And can I have a glass of water? My mouth feels dry.
DOCTOR: I understand you want a quick solution, Hedy, and I wish it were that simple. However, we need to know why you’re feeling this way before we can determine the best course of action. I'm not going to tell you to change your diet or exercise right now. We'll address those things if they become necessary. I'm going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, thyroid function tests, zinc level, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us rule out several possibilities, including anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. In the meantime, I'm going to order a mild iron supplement for you to start, just in case. It won’t hurt to start addressing a potential deficiency while we wait for the results. And yes, I’ll get the nurse to bring you a glass of water right away.
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. A pill. Okay. Good. As long as it's not one of those big ones. And can I get a note for work? I'm probably going to be out for a few days. I just... can't deal with this right now. Honestly, everything feels like too much effort.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Hedy. I’ll write you a note excusing you from work for a few days. It will state that you are experiencing fatigue and require medical evaluation. I’ll also note the need for some rest. Here you go. I’ll also make sure the nurse gives you information on the iron supplement and how to take it. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Hedy. We’ll start with the bloodwork and go from there. It may take a few days to get the results back, but we’ll be in touch as soon as we have them. In the meantime, please try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. No questions. Just… get me out of here. And don’t call me unless it’s important. I have things to do. Or… I think I have things to do. Whatever. Just… goodbye.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. You take care of yourself. The nurse will walk you out, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
