DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s… somewhere on my body, I believe. I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's been a bit foggy lately, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to articulate things when you're not feeling your best, and memory issues can certainly contribute to that. Let's take our time. When you say swelling, can you tell me where on your body you've noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is the challenge, isn't it? I feel it mostly… around my neck, I think? And perhaps a little bit on my face? It’s hard to be certain. It doesn’t hurt, not exactly, but it feels… full? Is that a good way to put it? I truly apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Tomassoni. "Full" is a helpful description. So, swelling around the neck and potentially the face, without pain. Has this swelling been sudden, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I believe. It wasn’t… a sudden thing. More like I noticed it slowly getting… more noticeable, over the past week or so, perhaps? It's difficult to pinpoint the exact time, honestly. I don’t have a strong recollection of when it started. I do remember thinking it wasn't urgent at first, but then it didn't go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over the past week. And you said it hasn't been painful?
PATIENT: No, not painful. It's… uncomfortable, perhaps? Just a strange sensation. Not sharp, not aching. More like… pressure, sometimes? And it feels a little warm to the touch, if that makes sense. I've been trying to monitor it, but… well, as you know, my recall isn’t the best. I apologize if I’m being unhelpful. Is there something I should be doing to help remember things? It's been quite frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Tomassoni. It’s important for me to understand what you're experiencing, and you're doing a good job describing it. We can address your memory concerns later if you'd like. Right now, let's focus on the swelling. You mentioned warmth. Is that localized to a specific area, or is it more general?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… very kind of you. The warmth… it seems to be mostly in my neck, yes. Just on the sides, where I feel the swelling. Not all over, thankfully. And… now that I think about it, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual. But I attributed that to just… life, you understand? A lot has been happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling and warmth primarily in the neck, and increased fatigue. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your thyroid gland and lymph nodes in your neck, and perhaps listen to your heart and lungs as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I apologize again for not being more… precise with the details. Is there anything I should be doing to prepare? Or should I just… remain still?
DOCTOR: No preparation needed, just relax. You can sit up or lie down, whichever is more comfortable for you. I'll start by gently palpating your neck. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender. I'm going to feel for any lumps or areas of tenderness… Do you feel anything at all when I press here?
PATIENT: Just… pressure, Doctor. It’s not painful, but I can definitely feel it. A little… uncomfortable, perhaps? Especially on this side… There’s a slight… fullness there, yes. I do hope I’m not being too vague again. It’s difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness on the left side. And on the right side?
PATIENT: Not as noticeable on the right, Doctor. It feels… smoother, perhaps? The left side definitely feels more… firm, if that makes sense. It’s not painful, I want to reiterate that, but there’s a distinct difference between the two sides. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m listening now. I also want to check your pulse. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Everything seems normal so far, but the fullness you're describing on the left side of your neck is something we need to investigate further. I'm concerned about the possibility of an enlarged lymph node. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and thyroid function tests. We may also need to consider an ultrasound of your neck to get a better look at what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Anything to determine what is causing this. Blood work and an ultrasound… absolutely. I understand. I trust your judgment. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? Or things I should avoid? I apologize for my constant questions, but I am a little worried, to be frank.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize for your questions, Mr. Tomassoni. It's perfectly natural to be worried when something feels off. For now, there's no need for any specific precautions. Continue to monitor the swelling and let me know if you notice any changes – if it grows rapidly, becomes painful, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever or difficulty breathing. We will get this sorted out. I'll have the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they can schedule you for blood work. The ultrasound can be scheduled through the radiology department. I'll also have my nurse, Sarah, schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds… excellent, Doctor. Thank you. Blood work, ultrasound, follow-up appointment… I appreciate your thoroughness. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel… somewhat reassured, to be honest. Yes, please have Sarah schedule everything. And… thank you again, Doctor. I truly appreciate your kindness.
