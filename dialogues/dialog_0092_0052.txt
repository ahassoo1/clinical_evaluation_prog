DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been happenin’ most mornings now, for…oh, maybe a month or so. The other doctor – Dr. MacLeod – he said somethin’ about my heart, but I’m afraid I didn’t quite catch all of it, and it’s started botherin’ me more lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. So, it's the nausea that's concerning you, and it's been present for about a month. You mentioned Dr. MacLeod said something about your heart. Do you recall anything specific he mentioned, even if it was just a word or two?
PATIENT: Aye, I do remember a bit. He said somethin’ about…heart failure. And that it could be why I’m feelin’ so tired all the time as well. He did some tests, blood work, and an…echocardiogram, I think he called it. Said it showed somethin' wasn’t pumpin’ as well as it should, but I was a wee bit flustered, to be honest. I’m not one for medical talk, ye see. It’s just this mornin’ sickness feelin’ that’s been gettin’ worse. Makes it hard to even have a cup o’ tea.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Benic. Medical terminology can be quite confusing. It’s good you recall he mentioned heart failure and some tests were done. Let me access those results on the computer here. Just to clarify, when you say “mornin’ sickness feeling,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. It’s…well, it's like when my sister was expectin’. Not as bad, mind ye, but a similar sort of queasiness. Right in the pit o' my stomach, and a wee bit of…well, I’ve had to be quick with a bucket a couple o’ times, if ye catch my drift. It usually hits soon after I wake up, before I’ve had anythin’ to eat, and lasts for a good hour or two. It's not constant, thankfully, but it's enough to ruin me start to the day. And the tiredness…that's just always there now, like a weight pressin’ down on me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Benic. That’s very helpful. It sounds quite unpleasant. So, nausea upon waking, some vomiting, and persistent fatigue. Now, looking at your records from Dr. MacLeod, the echocardiogram does indeed show reduced ejection fraction, consistent with heart failure. The blood work also shows elevated BNP, which is a marker associated with heart failure. It appears he started you on a low dose of furosemide, a water pill. Have you been taking that as prescribed?
PATIENT: Aye, I’ve been takin’ them every mornin’, just like he told me. Little white pills, weren’t they? Seems to make me need to…well, visit the wee boys’ room a fair bit more often, but I figured that was what it was supposed to do. I haven't noticed a huge difference in how I’m feelin’, to be honest. Still tired, still feelin’ queasy most mornin’s, and sometimes even in the evenin’s now. I just thought maybe it needed time to kick in properly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you've been compliant with the furosemide, but haven’t experienced significant improvement in your symptoms. That’s important information. Increased urination is a common side effect of furosemide, and it's good you've been experiencing that, indicating the medication is working to some degree. However, the persistent nausea and fatigue suggest we may need to adjust your treatment plan. Before we discuss potential changes, let's go through a bit more of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Aye, Dr. MacLeod told me I had high blood pressure a few years back. He put me on somethin’ for it, a wee orange pill, I think. Been takin’ that regularly ever since, I can’t rightly recall the name though. As for diabetes…no, not that I’m aware of. My mother had it, but I've never been told I do. I try to eat sensible, mostly fish and vegetables, though I do have a fondness for a wee bit o’ shortbread now and then. Can’t deny myself all pleasures, ye see.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Benic. It's good to know about the high blood pressure medication. We can look that up in your records as well. And a fondness for shortbread is perfectly understandable! Let’s move on to your family history. Aside from your mother having diabetes, are there any other significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Aye, my father…he had a bad ticker, as they say. He had chest pains for years, and eventually had to have a wee procedure done. I don’t rightly know what it was, somethin’ to do with blocked arteries, I think. He passed away when I was still a young man. My sister’s side o’ the family…mostly alright, I think. A bit o’ arthritis here and there, but nothin’ too serious. My grandfather on my mother’s side…he had kidney problems, I recall, but that was a long time ago. I'm tryin’ to remember, but my memory's not what it used to be. But a bad heart definitely runs on my father's side, aye.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s helpful information, particularly the history of heart disease on your father’s side. Knowing that there’s a family predisposition increases our concern. Now, regarding your lifestyle…do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was a smoker, and I saw what it did to him. Dreadful cough, and always short o’ breath. I vowed then and there I’d stay away from them. I do enjoy a wee dram o’ whisky now and then, but that's it. And a pint o’ beer with me friends on a Friday night, mind ye. But nothin’ excessive. I try to stay active as well, walk the dog every day, and do a bit o’ gardenin’. Keeps me busy, and keeps me mind sharp.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Benic. Avoiding smoking and maintaining an active lifestyle are very positive. A moderate amount of alcohol is generally acceptable, and it sounds like you're doing well in that regard. One final area to cover: are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think…besides the high blood pressure pill and the water pill, I take a multivitamin every day, just a general one, for a bit o’ extra health. And sometimes, when me arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Just when it’s really botherin’ me, mind ye, not regularly. Oh, and I’ve been takin’ some fish oil capsules lately, for the heart, apparently. A friend recommended them. That's all I can think of, Doctor. I try to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s a very complete list. So, we have the high blood pressure medication, furosemide, a multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and fish oil supplements. Okay, Mr. Benic, based on everything you've told me, and the information from Dr. MacLeod, it appears you are experiencing worsening symptoms of heart failure despite being on furosemide. The family history of heart disease, your high blood pressure, and the nausea and fatigue are all concerning. The fish oil and ibuprofen shouldn’t be causing this, but we should consider minimizing the ibuprofen use. To get a clearer picture of what’s happening, I'd like to order some additional blood work, including a complete metabolic panel to check your kidney function, and a repeat BNP to see if your heart failure is progressing. I also want to check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause similar symptoms. And I’d like to do a physical exam now, if you don’t mind. Specifically, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check for swelling in your legs, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. More tests can’t hurt, I suppose. I’m happy to have a listen to me heart, and ye can check me legs and all. I’ve noticed them feelin’ a wee bit swollen lately, but I just put it down to the weather. I'm quite happy to have ye check me blood pressure as well. Whatever ye think is best, Doctor, I trust your judgement. Just want to feel a wee bit more like meself again, ye see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. I appreciate your trust. Alright, if you could just sit up on the table for me, that would be great. And if you don't mind, could you please remove your shoes and socks?
