DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. There’s some swelling, yes. It’s been… present for a little while, I believe. Honestly, my memory isn’t the best, so pinpointing when it started is tricky. It’s mostly… on this side of my face, I think. <points vaguely to the left side of his face>
DOCTOR: "A little while," is helpful, but not terribly precise, Mr. Tomassoni. Let’s try to narrow it down. Was it a sudden onset, or did it gradually appear?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Yes, definitely gradually. It wasn’t like I woke up one morning and it was suddenly there. More… a slow increase over time. It’s frustrating, I apologize. I wish I could be more specific. Is that… is that helpful at all?
DOCTOR: It’s… something, yes. And don’t apologize for not being a medical professional, Mr. Tomassoni. Now, can you describe the swelling itself?
PATIENT: Well, it feels… soft, mostly. Not hard or painful, thankfully. Just… puffy, I suppose. It’s not terribly large, but noticeable, certainly. I’ve been… avoiding mirrors a bit, if I’m honest. It’s mostly around my cheekbone, I believe, and maybe a little bit near my jaw. It doesn’t seem to be… changing dramatically day to day, just… there. <fidgets slightly with his hands> Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And has there been any associated… discharge, redness, warmth, or any changes in sensation – numbness, tingling – in that area?
PATIENT: No, no discharge at all. And I don’t think it’s red, though, truthfully, I haven’t examined it closely. I haven’t really… wanted to. Warmth… no, I don’t believe so. As for sensation… no, everything feels normal. No numbness or tingling. It’s just… a swelling. A strange, soft swelling. <pauses> I suppose I should have paid more attention, but it hasn’t been causing any real discomfort, so I… put it off. Is that foolish of me?
DOCTOR: Perhaps a little, yes. Ignoring something until it becomes a problem is rarely the best course of action. Now, let's move on. Any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, chills, or night sweats. I haven’t felt unwell in any way, to be honest. Just… this swelling. It’s quite perplexing, really. I haven't been travelling anywhere, or been around anyone who’s been ill, as far as I’m aware. <rubs his chin thoughtfully> Do you… do you think it could be something serious? I’m probably worrying unnecessarily, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say without a proper examination, Mr. Tomassoni. Now, I’m going to need to take a look at this swelling. If you’ll just allow me… <gestures towards the examination chair>. While I'm examining you, I'll also quickly check your lymph nodes, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. <stands up slowly and walks towards the examination chair, a little nervously> I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please don’t hesitate to tell me if anything feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could sit up straight, please. I’m just going to gently palpate the area… and as I mentioned, I’ll check your lymph nodes. <begins gently pressing on the left side of his face, observing closely>. Can you tell me if this is tender at all?
PATIENT: No, not particularly tender. A little… pressure, perhaps, but not painful. It’s… difficult to describe. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… a feeling of something being there. It feels… softer when you press on it, if that makes sense. <grimaces slightly> It’s a bit strange, I apologize for being vague. Is everything alright so far?
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Tomassoni. I’m just trying to get a feel for things. <pauses, then continues palpating his neck>. Hmm. Your lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged on this side. Not alarmingly so, but… present. Do you have any history of frequent infections – sore throats, ear infections, things like that?
PATIENT: <pauses, thinking hard> Frequent infections… not particularly, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Chickenpox, measles… but nothing significant in recent years. Perhaps a cold or two each winter, but nothing that required a visit to the doctor. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, eat well, get enough sleep… <fidgets with his hands> This is… concerning, isn't it? Is it something serious? I feel a bit foolish for not mentioning this earlier. Perhaps I should have been more observant.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this up now. Now, let’s go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. I've been quite healthy, overall, as far as I know. Just the occasional cold, as I mentioned. I did have my tonsils removed when I was a child, but that was… a long time ago. <pauses> Is that relevant, Doctor? Should I have remembered to mention that earlier? I’m terribly sorry if I’m being unhelpful. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Tomassoni. It’s helpful to have a complete picture. Tonsil removal is good to know. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, drink anything… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no environmental allergies. I’ve never even had hay fever, which is quite unusual, given my family’s history. <pauses> My mother was terribly allergic to pollen, poor woman. I seem to have dodged that bullet, at least. <smiles faintly> Is that… helpful, Doctor? I’m trying to recall everything I can, but it’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what medications, if any, are you currently taking?
PATIENT: None at all, Doctor. I don’t take any medications. Not even over-the-counter remedies, usually. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if possible. A bit of rest, plenty of fluids… that sort of thing. I haven’t needed anything stronger, thankfully. <pauses> I did take some ibuprofen once, for a headache, but that was… years ago. Does that count? It wasn’t a regular thing, certainly. <fidgets with his hands> I apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, tell me about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer, autoimmune diseases, or other significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: <pauses, thinking hard> That’s… a difficult question. My mother… she passed away several years ago, from heart disease, I believe. My father… he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s quite elderly and his memory isn’t the best either, so getting accurate information is… challenging. I believe my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had some sort of arthritis, but I’m not sure what kind. And… I think there was a distant cousin who had cancer, but it was a long time ago and I don’t recall the details. <frowns> I wish I could be more specific, but my family isn’t terribly forthcoming with medical information, if I’m honest. They tend to… avoid the topic. <sighs> Does any of that help, Doctor? I’m terribly sorry for being so unhelpful. I feel like I’m failing miserably at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, tell me a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. I find it… quite repulsive, actually. I’ve always been very health-conscious, as I mentioned. I eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and try to avoid stress as much as possible. I drink alcohol occasionally, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner from time to time, but I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker. <pauses> I work as a speech-language pathologist, so I’m constantly advocating for healthy habits. It would be rather hypocritical of me to indulge in unhealthy behaviors, wouldn’t it? <smiles faintly> Is that… relevant, Doctor? I’m trying to provide as much information as possible, but I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. This is… quite a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your slightly enlarged lymph nodes, the gradual onset of this swelling, and your… somewhat vague recollection of family history, I’m going to recommend a few tests. We’ll start with a complete blood count to rule out any infection, and a CT scan of your neck to get a better look at the swelling and lymph nodes. I’m also going to order a thyroid panel, just to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Please, go ahead with those tests. I trust your judgment. <pauses, looking anxious> Are you… are you concerned? Is it something serious? I’m probably overreacting, aren’t I? I just… I don’t like not knowing. Perhaps it’s just a harmless cyst, or a swollen gland. I’m trying to remain optimistic, but it’s difficult. <fidgets with his hands> When will I know the results? And… will it hurt? The CT scan, I mean. I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: It’s far too early to say definitively, Mr. Tomassoni. That's why we are conducting these tests. The CT scan is painless, but you will need to lie still for a short period of time. The results should be available within a few days, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they're in. In the meantime, try not to worry unnecessarily. <pauses> I'll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then we'll schedule the CT scan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For taking the time to listen, and for running these tests. I appreciate your thoroughness. <pauses, looking slightly lost> I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results. And try not to worry. Easier said than done, I suppose. <fidgets with his hands> Thank you again. <waits expectantly for the nurse>.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
