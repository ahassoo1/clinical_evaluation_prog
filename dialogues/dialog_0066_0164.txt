DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and sort of…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I ate some fava beans. I didn’t think much of it at first, but it’s not going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a yellowish tinge to your skin… and it started after eating fava beans, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. I love fava beans, I grew up eating them. But this time, a couple of days after I had a big plate, I just started feeling weak and then I noticed my skin looking…off. Like a pale yellow color. It’s a little scary, to be honest. I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness and that pale yellow color... that is something we should look into. Fava beans are interesting in this case. Have you ever had a reaction like this after eating them before?
PATIENT: No, never. I really do like them, and I've been eating them on and off my whole life. My grandmother used to make a stew with them, and I always had a bowl. This is completely new. It just… happened this time. I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new development. Let's talk a little more about this tiredness. Can you describe it?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It's not just being a little sleepy. It’s like all my energy is gone. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort. And I’ve been feeling really breathless just walking around the house. It’s not like I’ve been doing anything strenuous, you know? Just normal things, like cooking or doing laundry. It's really worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning – significant fatigue and breathlessness with minimal exertion. And the timing with the fava beans is definitely something we need to consider. Before we go further, let me quickly check your vitals and then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. And I don’t have any medical conditions, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t really been to the doctor in years, to be honest. I usually just try to rest and things get better on their own. But this…this feels different. I'm glad I came in.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you came in, Mande. We’ll figure this out. Okay, let’s start with a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. I’ll also check your sclera – the whites of your eyes – to see if that yellowing is present there as well. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lung sounds are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s take a look at your eyes. Yes, I do see some yellowing of the sclera, confirming what you mentioned about your skin. This is called jaundice. I'm also noting your skin tone – it's pale and has a yellowish hue. Let's get some bloodwork ordered to see what might be causing this. It could be related to your liver, gallbladder, or red blood cells. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If it’s something to do with my liver… that’s a little scary, honestly. I’ve never had any problems with that before. Bloodwork sounds good. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better, I guess. Is it something serious? I’m trying not to panic, but…fava beans causing this? It just doesn't make sense.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mande. We'll take it one step at a time. Fava beans can be linked to a condition called Favism, which is an enzyme deficiency that causes a breakdown of red blood cells after consuming them. That’s why I’m asking about this. It’s more common in people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern descent, but it can occur in anyone. The bloodwork will help us determine if this is the case, or if something else is going on. We’ll check your liver function, your red blood cell count, and other markers to get a clear picture. I’m ordering a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , and a bilirubin level. We'll also check for G6PD deficiency, which is the enzyme affected in Favism. The lab should be able to process these quickly. In the meantime, it’s best to avoid fava beans and any foods that might contain them. Do you have any family history of anemia, jaundice, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… my grandfather on my mother’s side, he was Romanian, and he was often…tired. He was a farmer, so I always assumed it was just from hard work. But now that you mention anemia… he did complain of feeling weak a lot. I don’t think he was ever officially diagnosed with anything. And my aunt on my father’s side, she had some kind of liver problem when she was younger, I think, but I don't have the details. It was a long time ago. We weren’t very close, and my parents are both gone now, so it’s hard to remember exactly. But yes, there might be some history of those things in the family. Would knowing more about what they had help?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mande. Family history can be really important. If you happen to come across any medical records or have any more details about your grandfather or aunt’s conditions, please let me know. For now, we'll focus on getting these bloodwork results back. It sounds like there might be a genetic component here, and knowing more about your family history could guide our diagnosis and treatment. The lab will contact me with the results, usually within 24-48 hours. I'll give you a call as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—like dark urine, severe abdominal pain, or confusion—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all pretty clear. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explaining everything so thoroughly. I will definitely avoid fava beans, and I’ll try to dig up any information I can about my family history. And I’ll keep a close eye on my symptoms. Hopefully, it’s not too serious. I'm just a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re looking into it. I will wait for your call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I understand your worry, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before I call with the results. Take care, and try not to stress too much until we have more information.
