DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Versace, nice to meet you. Well, I've just been getting the chills, you know? Like, not a fever, but just…cold. It's been going on for a few days now.
DOCTOR: “Just chills,” you say. Alright. And when you say a few days, can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I guess, last Friday. So, four days now? Maybe five. It's hard to keep track, honestly. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little shiver now and then, but it’s been more constant the last couple of days.
DOCTOR: Four or five days… constant now, you said. Are you experiencing anything else with these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, good question. Now that you mention it… I’ve been feeling kinda tired, more tired than usual. And a little achy, like I worked out really hard, but I haven’t. Just generally… blah, you know? No cough or anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Tired and achy… No cough. Alright. And are you noticing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Actually, yeah. I haven't been very hungry. Usually I eat pretty well, but the last couple of days I've had to force myself to eat anything at all. Everything just feels… tasteless, kind of. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Tasteless... Loss of appetite. Right. Have you been experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No vomiting or anything like that. Just…not wanting to eat. And I guess, a little bit of a headache on and off, but it’s nothing major. Like, I don’t even usually get headaches.
DOCTOR: No vomiting, minimal headache… Okay. Let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, wow, okay. That's a… specific question! Um… not really? Everything’s been pretty normal there, thankfully. Sorry if that's…too much information! It’s just not something I've been thinking about with all this other stuff.
DOCTOR: It’s all pertinent information, Ms. Aslan. It helps me to build a complete picture. Now, have you noticed any rashes or skin changes?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin feels normal. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I just haven’t had much energy to even think about things like rashes. Everything feels kinda…blah, remember?
DOCTOR: Yes, “blah.” Alright. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Um, no, not that I know of. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. I'm pretty careful, and I usually check with the pharmacist just in case. But no, no known allergies. Unless you count dust, maybe? I sneeze a little, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Dust doesn’t usually count, Ms. Aslan. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not on any regular medications. Just over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like pain relievers for a headache if it gets really bad. But nothing scheduled, nothing prescribed. I try to stay away from stuff if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get a quick physical exam, just to see what's going on. Can you step up onto the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds good. I hope it's nothing too serious! It's just been a weird few days.
DOCTOR: Please lie back. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular, rate is within normal limits. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to feel your lymph nodes. No noticeable swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Alright. I'll check your temperature. 99.2 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated, but not concerning. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. Just a little pressure, that’s all. You're being very thorough, Doctor. It's good. I appreciate it. What do you think it could be? Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: "Worried" is a strong word, Ms. Aslan. Based on the physical exam alone, it's difficult to pinpoint a cause. The slightly elevated temperature and your symptoms could indicate a mild viral infection. However, given your loss of appetite and the fact that it's been going on for five days, I'd like to order some blood work to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel, just to be safe. We’ll also do a basic urine analysis. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Blood work, urine analysis… yeah, okay. Um… what exactly will those tests show? And how long will it take to get the results? I just… I'm a little anxious about this. I don’t usually get sick like this.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a picture of your overall health, looking for signs of infection, inflammation, and any potential abnormalities in your organ function. The metabolic panel checks your electrolyte levels, kidney and liver function. The thyroid panel will assess your thyroid function, as that can sometimes cause fatigue and loss of appetite. The urine analysis will rule out a urinary tract infection. Results typically take 24 to 48 hours, depending on the lab. We'll call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Try not to worry, Ms. Aslan. It’s likely just a minor illness. But it's always best to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Blood work, metabolic panel, thyroid… to rule things out. 24 to 48 hours. Okay. So, do I need to do anything special before the blood work? Like, fast or anything? And where do I go to get it done?
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours prior to the blood draw. That means no food or drinks other than water. The lab is located at the Rural Health Center, just down the road. Here is the requisition form with the address and instructions. They will take care of everything there. Once you have had the blood work done, please inform the clinic and we'll continue with the work-up. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting. Rural Health Center. Got it. No, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Versace. I appreciate you being thorough. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, just rest and drink fluids?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Aslan. Rest and fluids. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, can help with the headache, if needed. Avoid strenuous activity. And if your symptoms worsen—specifically, if you develop a fever over 101 Fahrenheit, severe vomiting, or difficulty breathing—go to the emergency room immediately. I will document these instructions in your chart. Are you currently employed?
PATIENT: Um, yes. I'm a Health Education Specialist. Why do you ask? Is it relevant to…this?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Aslan. I need to document whether you'll require a sick note for work. Given your symptoms and the need for further investigation, I’m happy to provide one for the next three days. I’ll print that out for you as well. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A sick note, that would be great, thank you. No, I think that's everything. I just hope it's nothing too serious. And I'll go get the blood work done as soon as I can. Thanks again, Dr. Versace.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get the blood work done promptly and inform the clinic. Have a good day, Ms. Aslan. .
