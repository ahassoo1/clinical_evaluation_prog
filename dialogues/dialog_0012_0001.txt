DOCTOR: Hi Johney, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here… well, to try and quit smoking. It’s become rather a nuisance, really. And, frankly, a bit frightening. I’ve been at it for… oh, sixty years, give or take.
DOCTOR: Sixty years – that’s a long time, Johney. It takes a lot of courage to tackle something like this after that long. It’s good you’re making this change now. It is frightening, and you’re right to be concerned about the health effects. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how much you currently smoke?
PATIENT: Certainly. I usually go through about a pack and a half of cigarettes a day. Marlboro Reds, specifically. I’ve tried cutting back before, you see, but it… never quite sticks. First cigarette is always around seven in the morning, with my coffee. Last one… well, that varies. Sometimes as late as eleven at night, if I’m watching television. Is that… is that helpful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Johney. Knowing the amount and timing gives me a good starting point. And it’s completely normal that you've had trouble cutting back – nicotine is very addictive. Have you noticed any specific times or situations where you feel the strongest urge to smoke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. When I’m stressed, naturally. Though, truthfully, lately everything feels stressful. But… even when I’m not particularly bothered, after a meal is difficult. And… when I’m with old friends. Several of them still smoke, you see. It’s… a habit, ingrained in the companionship, if you understand. It feels rude to not join them, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Johney. Social situations can be incredibly challenging, and it’s understandable that you’d feel that way. Those ingrained habits and social connections make quitting much harder. Now, aside from the urge to smoke, have you noticed any physical symptoms related to your smoking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite a few, I'm afraid. I get rather short of breath these days, even with simple tasks. Climbing the stairs… a real ordeal. And a cough, of course. A persistent cough, especially in the mornings. My doctor back home—Dr. Vaitkus, a good man—said it was “smoker’s cough,” naturally. And I tire easily. Much more easily than I used to. It’s… diminishing, you see. My stamina, my energy.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Johney. Those symptoms are all consistent with long-term smoking. I'd like to listen to your lungs and heart, if that's alright. Just a quick exam to get a baseline. Then we can talk about some options for quitting. Could you please sit back and take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’ve had my share of examinations over the years. Do let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney. I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, which is common with smoking. Your heart sounds regular, but your breathing rate is a little elevated. I also notice some decreased air movement in the lower lobes of your lungs. It’s good we’re addressing this now. Have you ever tried any medication or nicotine replacement therapy to help you quit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never any medication. Back when I was a younger man, I attempted to quit “cold turkey” a few times. It… did not end well. Very irritable. And the cravings… unbearable. My wife—God rest her soul—said I was impossible to live with. After that, I decided it was best not to disturb the peace. No patches, no gum… nothing of the sort. I suppose I’ve resigned myself to it, until now.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly difficult, Johney, and it's completely understandable why you'd avoid something that caused so much stress for you and your wife. It's good you're trying again now, though. We have more options available than we did in the past, and we can work together to find something that suits you. Before we discuss those options, I’d like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don’t mind. Just to get a complete picture. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, as one does at my age. It flares up with the weather, mostly. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be. I wear glasses, of course. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago. It was… unpleasant. Other than that… I’ve been relatively healthy, all things considered. I’ve always been a strong man, despite the cigarettes. A farmer, you see. Hard work keeps you going.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Johney. Arthritis, vision changes, and a history of pneumonia. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… yes. I had my appendix removed when I was a young man, back in Lithuania. A rather simple procedure, as I recall. And… oh, a hernia repair about twenty years ago. That was a bit more involved, but I recovered well. Other than that… no major surgeries. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. Avoiding the need for serious interventions. Until now, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal and hernia repair. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one, Doctor. My family… well, it was rather large. And we weren’t much for keeping records. My father… he passed away at a relatively young age, from a heart condition, I believe. My mother lived to be quite old, though. Into her nineties, I think. She was a very strong woman. As for illnesses… there was some talk of diabetes on my mother’s side, but nothing definitive. And a few cases of cancer, further back in the family. It’s… rather vague, I’m afraid. Lithuanian families weren’t always forthcoming with such details. Superstition, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Johney. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing anything at all is helpful, though. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol or use tobacco products other than cigarettes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never much of a drinker. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. But never anything excessive. And cigarettes are my only tobacco product. Always have been. I always thought a man should have some vice, you see. And cigarettes… well, they seemed the least disruptive. A foolish notion, perhaps, in retrospect. But there you have it.
DOCTOR: That's fair, Johney. And it’s good to know. Now, one final question for this part – are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a bit of ibuprofen, Doctor, when my arthritis flares up. And occasionally some antacids, if I eat something that doesn't agree with me. Nothing regular, mind you. Just as needed. No supplements. I always thought those were a bit of a waste of money. Natural remedies… I never had much faith in them.
DOCTOR: Okay, Johney, thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a really good understanding of your overall health. It’s clear you've been a strong man, dealing with a lot for a long time. Now, let’s talk about quitting smoking. There are several options available to us. We can try nicotine replacement therapy – patches, gum, lozenges – to help manage the cravings. There are also prescription medications that can help reduce your urge to smoke. And, of course, there are behavioral therapies and support groups that can provide you with the tools and encouragement you need to succeed. Given your history of irritability with cold turkey, and your preference for a more straightforward approach, I think starting with a nicotine patch might be a good first step. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: A patch, you say? That… sounds reasonable. Less disruptive than gum, certainly. And I do appreciate a simple solution. Cold turkey… well, that was a mistake. A youthful folly. I suppose I’ve learned a bit since then. Yes, Doctor, a patch sounds… acceptable. What strength would you recommend? And are there… side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Johney. I'm glad you're open to trying the patch. We'll start with a low dose – likely a 21mg patch – and gradually increase it if needed, based on how you're feeling. As for side effects, the most common ones are skin irritation at the patch site, and sometimes mild sleep disturbances, headaches, or nausea. These are usually temporary and resolve on their own. It's important to let me know if you experience any severe or persistent side effects. We'll also want to discuss some strategies to help you manage cravings and avoid relapse. Are you willing to work with me on a plan for that?
PATIENT: A plan… yes, I believe I am. I’m not one for leaving things to chance, you see. A methodical approach is always best. What sort of strategies do you have in mind, Doctor? And will this require… a great deal of my time? I still have my farm to tend, you understand. It demands a certain… dedication.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Johney. I completely understand. We’ll tailor the plan to fit your lifestyle and commitments. It won't require a huge time commitment, I promise. The plan will involve identifying your triggers for smoking – situations, emotions, or activities that make you crave a cigarette – and developing coping mechanisms to deal with them. We can also discuss some behavioral techniques to help you break the habit, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness practices. And I can provide you with some resources for support groups or counseling if you're interested. We'll also talk about how to handle cravings and avoid relapse. A big part of that is having a support system. Do you have family or friends who would be supportive of your efforts?
PATIENT: Supportive… that’s… a bit of a complicated question, Doctor. My friends, as I mentioned, still smoke. They mean well, but I doubt they’d be… encouraging. I lost my wife a few years ago. She was always my biggest supporter. I live alone now. Mostly keep to myself. The farm is enough company, to be honest. It demands attention, you see. Constant attention. But… perhaps a bit of guidance from you would be enough support, for now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Johney. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it's completely alright if you don't have a strong support system right now. We can absolutely work through this together. I'll be here to provide you with the guidance and encouragement you need. Okay, let’s start with the patch. I'll write you a prescription for a four-week supply of 21mg nicotine patches. You’ll apply one patch each morning, and we’ll check in after a week to see how you’re doing. During that week, I want you to focus on identifying your smoking triggers and developing some coping mechanisms. I’m also going to give you some information about a local support group, just in case you change your mind. And I’ll give you a handout with tips for managing cravings and avoiding relapse. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A four-week supply of patches, a check-in after a week, and information about coping mechanisms. I appreciate your… methodical approach. And the handout. Knowledge is always a good thing. I suppose… I suppose it’s time to face this, once and for all. I've put it off long enough. Perhaps sixty years is long enough. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I go? Any particular warning signs I should look out for?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful attitude, Johney. You’re absolutely right – sixty years is long enough. And you’ve already taken the biggest step by deciding to quit. As for warning signs, be aware of any dizziness, nausea, or vomiting. These are usually mild and temporary, but if they become severe, stop using the patch and call my office. Also, if you experience any unusual heart palpitations or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Most importantly, don't be afraid to reach out if you're struggling. I'm here to help, and we'll work through this together. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to check on your progress. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, a week’s time will do nicely. I appreciate your… patience and guidance. It’s reassuring to know I’m not facing this alone, despite my… solitary existence. I suppose… I suppose I should be going now. I have chores to attend to. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You have my… sincere gratitude.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Johney. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, you’ve got this. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week.
