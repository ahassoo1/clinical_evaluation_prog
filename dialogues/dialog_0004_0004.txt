DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor! Just here for my shots, I think. A routine check-up, you know? I get a little forgetful about when I'm due for things, so my husband usually reminds me, but I figured I'd get it done while I was thinking about it.
DOCTOR: "Shots," right. Well, we’ll certainly review your immunization record. But a "routine check-up" involves a bit more than that, Ms. Fornes. To properly assess your health, I need a comprehensive understanding of your current condition and medical history. Let's start with the present. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms – anything at all that's been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm, not really. Nothing major, no. My knees get a little creaky sometimes, getting up and down, but that's just old age, I suppose! And maybe a little tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? I've been helping my daughter with her new baby, so that keeps me busy. Is that something I should mention?
DOCTOR: “Old age,” as you put it, is relative, Ms. Fornes. And while fatigue is common, it's not normal. We need to determine the cause of that fatigue. And yes, assisting with a new baby is relevant. Significant life events can impact health. Let's quantify this fatigue. On a scale of one to ten, with one being no fatigue at all and ten being completely debilitating, where would you place it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A scale, huh? I don't know... maybe a four? It's not like I can't do things, it just... takes more effort, you know? Like, I need an extra cup of coffee in the morning now, where I didn't used to. And sometimes I just feel… drained at the end of the day. Is that helpful? I’m not good at these numbers things, sorry.
DOCTOR: A four is… potentially significant, given your other statements. It’s not the number itself, Ms. Fornes, but the change from your baseline. Now, let’s delve a bit deeper. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me think. Not really. I mean, my appetite's been a little off, sometimes I don't feel very hungry, but I figured that was just because I'm not moving around as much, you know? With helping my daughter, I’m mostly just… sitting. And maybe a little more forgetful than usual, but like I said, that’s been happening for a while. Nothing major, honestly. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Nothing major," you keep repeating that, Ms. Fornes. It's dismissive, and frankly, unhelpful. Let’s establish a clear medical history. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh! Now, you mention weight loss… That's funny you ask. I did step on the scale last week and… yeah, I think I lost a few pounds. Not on purpose, though! I hadn’t even noticed it until you said something. Maybe five pounds? I’m not sure, I don’t weigh myself often. Is that a lot? I’ve been so busy with the baby I haven’t really been paying attention to myself.
DOCTOR: Five pounds, unexplained, is… concerning, Ms. Fornes. Especially in conjunction with the fatigue and decreased appetite. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been diagnosed with anything serious. I had the flu a couple of times, and a bad cold last winter, but nothing… lasting. My husband says my blood pressure was a little high at one point, maybe ten years ago, but he took me to the doctor and they said it was just stress. They didn’t give me any medicine or anything. Just told me to relax more. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: “Relax more.” A remarkably unhelpful medical recommendation, Ms. Fornes. Nevertheless, it's pertinent information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? It was really painful, but the surgery went well, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. And… I think I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was young, but I don’t remember much about it. My mom took me, I was just a kid. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Cholecystectomy twenty years ago. Wisdom teeth extraction, date unknown. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My family… Well, my mother had heart trouble when she got older. She had a pacemaker put in, and she passed away from a stroke a few years back. And my father… he had diabetes. He lost his leg because of it. And my aunt… she had Alzheimer's. It was really hard to watch. Does that… does that matter? It feels like a lot.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fornes, all of this matters. A family history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and dementia significantly elevates your risk. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother smoked when she was young, but she quit when I was born. She always told me it was the worst thing anyone could do to themselves. I don’t even like being around people who smoke. How about alcohol? I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing crazy. Just to relax.
DOCTOR: Occasional alcohol consumption. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a few. I take a multivitamin, you know, to keep healthy. And I take some glucosamine and chondroitin for my knees. Like I said, they get a little creaky. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take some melatonin. But that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing serious. Just trying to keep up with everything, you know?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fornes. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. We’ll start with your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and perform a neurological assessment. Please undress down to your examination gown, and we’ll begin.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Alright. I'll go change. Is there a private room for this? And… is it going to be cold in here? I always get chilly.
DOCTOR: Yes, the examination room is private. And I assure you, we can adjust the temperature to your comfort. Please, take your time. It's important to be as comfortable as possible for an accurate assessment, Ms. Fornes.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: "Let's see what we're dealing with."
