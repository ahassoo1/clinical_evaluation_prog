DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Kalinski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. It's a… a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. A dull ache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn’t feel… sharp. Not like a bad toothache. More like… someone is squeezing the back of my skull. When I walk, sometimes it gets a little worse. And… if I get too warm, it's bad too. I was working on the rail yard yesterday, fixing a little thing on one of the dinkeys… hot sun, you know? Made it feel much worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's a squeezing sensation at the back of your skull, worsened by walking and heat, particularly with exertion like working in the rail yard. Have you noticed anything else associated with the pain?
PATIENT: No… not really. I don’t feel sick to my stomach. No blurry vision. Just… the headache. And sometimes, I feel a little… tired. But I am ninety years old, Doctor! I think a little tired is normal, eh? I sleep okay though. Not too much trouble sleeping.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair point, Mr. Brum. A little fatigue at your age is certainly understandable. And no nausea or vision changes, that’s good to know. You mentioned it started about three days ago. Do you recall anything specific that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: No, no… just woke up with it. Nothing special the day before. I ate my usual breakfast – tortillas and coffee. Worked on the rail yard, like always. Came home, watched the little television… and then the headache started. Nothing fell on my head, nothing hit me. Just… started. I don't know what to tell you, Doctor. I've never had a headache like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it presented spontaneously, without any specific injury or event preceding it. And this is a new type of headache for you. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had a little trouble with my heart, maybe twenty years ago. But the doctor said it fixed itself. Just told me to take it easy. And my knees… they ache sometimes, you know? Old age. That's about it. I've never been to the hospital for anything serious. Mostly, I just try to keep working, keep busy. Helps me feel… useful. No… no diabetes, no nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of some heart trouble that resolved, and some knee pain. No diabetes or other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, never. Always been too scared of the hospital, I think. And… never needed anything taken out or put in. Everything still works, mostly. Except the knees, eh? And the back of my head, now. But no… no surgeries. My wife… she had her gallbladder out, a long time ago. But that was her. Not me. She’s gone now, though. Been five years.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. It takes courage to share those memories. And no surgeries for you, that’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do you have any family members who experience headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My sister… she used to get bad headaches, when she was younger. But I don't know what kind. Just… headaches. She lived in Guatemala, though. Never saw a doctor much. And… my son, he sometimes complains about headaches, but nothing serious. Works in an office, lots of stress, you know? But I don't know if they’re like this headache. Different, I think. More… pressing, this one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of headaches, but not necessarily similar to what you’re experiencing. Now, let’s talk a little about your current medications, if any. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Not even aspirin. I used to, for my knees, but it bothered my stomach. So I just… deal with the pain. My wife, she used to make me little teas for everything. But she's gone now, and I don't remember the recipes. Just… nothing. I try to eat healthy, mostly. Tortillas, beans, coffee… that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I've lived a long life, I've tried everything! Never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes, the dust on the rail yard makes me cough, but that's not an allergy, just… dust. And the sun, I get hot, but I don't think that's an allergy either. I think… I think I'm pretty healthy, for an old man. Just this headache now. It's worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes and strength, and looking in your eyes. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, eh? Old bones, you know. And… it might be a little hard to balance. My knees, they aren't what they used to be. But I’ll try my best. Do you need me to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. And no, you don’t need to remove your shoes. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, Mr. Brum, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that okay? I don’t want to miss it. My eyesight isn't the best, eh? It's hard to tell if it's getting better or worse these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Brum. Your eye movements are good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Not very strong, eh? Old man’s hands. Used to be strong, working on the rail yard, fixing everything. But not anymore. Is that enough? Do you need me to squeeze harder? I can try.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Brum. You have good strength for your age. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay, Mr. Brum. Everything seems… within normal limits, although your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a tension-type headache. These are very common, and often related to stress, muscle tension, or even dehydration. However, given your age and the recent onset, I would like to be cautious.
PATIENT: A tension headache? Hmm… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I don’t feel stressed, exactly. Just… old. And I drink plenty of coffee. Is coffee bad for it? You think it's the coffee? Maybe the sun? Or the rail yard dust? I'm just worried, eh? Is it something I need to be really worried about? Will it go away?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking these questions, Mr. Brum. A tension headache isn’t usually serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. It means the pain is likely from muscle tension in your head and neck. While coffee isn't usually a cause of tension headaches, it can sometimes worsen them due to its effect on blood vessels. The sun and dust could potentially contribute, but are less likely to be the primary cause. To be on the safe side, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying inflammation. And, I’d also like to get a CT scan of your head, just to be absolutely sure there’s nothing else going on. Do you have any concerns about getting a CT scan?
PATIENT: A blood test, okay. That’s not so bad. I’ve had blood taken before. But a CT scan? What is that, Doctor? Does it hurt? Will it make me sick? I don't like being closed in, if that makes sense. My wife… she didn’t like closed spaces. I always worry I’ll feel… trapped. Is it quick? And is it expensive? I don’t have much money, you know. I just want to know if it's something bad. Is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mr. Brum. A CT scan is a type of X-ray that creates detailed images of the inside of your head. It doesn’t hurt at all – you simply lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It takes only a few minutes, and you won’t be closed in completely. There’s a space around you, so you can see out. I understand your concerns about closed spaces, and we can certainly discuss options to make you more comfortable, such as having someone stay with you during the scan or using a mild sedative if needed. Regarding cost, I understand your concerns. Since you are uninsured, the scan will be more expensive. Let me see what the approximate cost will be and if there are any financial assistance programs available at the hospital. I will have my nurse, Maria, assist you with that. We don’t want finances to be a barrier to getting the care you need. For now, let's focus on getting the blood test done. Maria will draw the blood for you now. And then, we'll schedule the CT scan, and discuss all of your concerns again before proceeding. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. If Maria will be there, and you say it won’t hurt… and we can talk about it again before I do it… okay. I trust you, Doctor. And my wife… she always said I worried too much. But it's hard not to, eh? The blood test first… and then talk about the scan. Yes. That’s good. Please tell Maria to be gentle, though. Old veins, you know. They don’t like being poked. And thank you, Doctor. For being patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Brum. It's my pleasure. I will personally speak with Maria and ensure she is gentle with your veins. And I’m happy to answer any questions you have along the way. Let’s get started with the blood test, then. Maria will be right in to assist you. In the meantime, if anything changes or if you feel worse, please don’t hesitate to let me or the nursing staff know. We are here to help.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will. Thank you. I hope it doesn't take too long. My legs get tired easily, you know. And… well, I'm just a little nervous. But I trust you, eh? You seem like a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re in good hands, Mr. Brum. And it won't be long. Maria is very skilled and will make the process as comfortable as possible. Try to relax, and remember to breathe deeply. I’ll be right here if you need anything. .
PATIENT: .
