DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg – my right leg, specifically. It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Numbness in the right leg," noted. And how long is "a little while now"?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I'd say, roughly three weeks ago. It wasn't constant at first, just… intermittent. But it's become more frequent in the last week or so. I can recall the exact date it started – July 10th, after a particularly long hike.
DOCTOR: July 10th, after a long hike. That's… specific. And can you describe the numbness?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I have a rather good memory for details. As for the sensation… it’s not exactly pain, but it isn’t normal. It’s like… a pins-and-needles feeling, but duller. And it usually starts in my foot, then travels up my calf. Sometimes it feels cold, too, even when the room is warm. It doesn’t affect my ability to walk, thankfully, but it's definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: "Pins and needles, dull sensation, travels from foot to calf, associated with cold sensation." Right. And does anything specifically make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Thinking about it... prolonged standing seems to aggravate it. And, oddly enough, when I’m sitting for extended periods, too. It’s a bit of a paradox, really. Also, if I cross my legs, that often brings it on. I do a lot of animation work, so I'm sitting quite a bit. It's not always after sitting, but often.
DOCTOR: "Aggravated by prolonged standing and sitting, worsened with leg crossing." Fascinating. And what about any recent injuries to your leg or back?
PATIENT: No injuries, Doctor. Nothing I recall, at least. I might have twisted my ankle slightly a few months back – maybe February? – but I didn't seek medical attention for it. It wasn't serious, just a bit of a sprain that healed on its own. But that was quite some time ago. As for my back, no recent issues or injuries there either. I'm generally quite careful with my posture, given the nature of my work.
DOCTOR: "Generally quite careful," you say. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I consider myself to be in good health. I eat a relatively balanced diet, though admittedly, I spend a bit too much time indoors. No allergies, no chronic illnesses, nothing like that. I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing significant in recent years. I do have private insurance, if that’s relevant. Is there anything else you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: "No chronic conditions, balanced diet, private insurance." Alright. And any family history of nerve issues, diabetes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... My maternal grandmother had diabetes, type 2, but she was diagnosed fairly late in life – in her seventies, I believe. And my uncle, on my father’s side, has some sort of peripheral neuropathy, I think? He lives out of state, so I don’t have all the details. It causes him some discomfort in his hands and feet, but he doesn't discuss it much. As for the rest of my family, I’m not aware of any significant nerve issues. Is that the sort of thing you were looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. I occasionally drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month – but very rarely. And I absolutely do not use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, mostly focused on my work and occasional hikes. I assure you, my lifestyle isn’t particularly… risky.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. This will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with reflexes. Taps patellar and Achilles tendons with a reflex hammer. Patellar reflex is 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflex is also 2+ bilaterally. Now, please flex your foot upwards, and push against my hand. Tests dorsiflexion strength. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally. Now, point your toes downwards. Tests plantarflexion strength. 5/5 bilaterally. And how about sensation here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It feels… normal. Perhaps a little dull, but nothing concerning. It feels like… a slight prick, as you’d expect, I suppose. It’s difficult to describe, but it doesn’t feel absent or significantly different from the other side. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. Again, slightly dull, but present. It’s… consistent with the feeling in my foot, I would say. Not particularly sharp or intense, but I’m aware of the sensation. It's a little unnerving to be poked and prodded, if I'm honest, but I understand it's necessary. Perhaps it’s just my nerves, given the reason I’m here.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Not even discomfort. Just… the sensation of being touched, which, as I mentioned, is a bit odd considering the reason for my visit. It feels… normal, if that makes sense. No shooting pain, no tingling, no weakness… just a slightly diminished sensation when you poke me. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the physical exam, your reflexes and muscle strength are normal. The sensation is slightly diminished, as you noted, but not absent. This could be a mild case of peripheral neuropathy, possibly related to your prolonged sitting and animation work. However, given your family history of diabetes, we need to rule that out. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an HbA1c to check your blood sugar levels over the past three months. We should also consider a nerve conduction study to get a better look at the function of your nerves.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. I understand the need to rule out other possibilities, and diabetes does run in the family, so that's prudent. A nerve conduction study… will that be uncomfortable? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures, but I’m willing to do what’s necessary to get a diagnosis. As for the blood work, that sounds straightforward enough. When would I be able to schedule those tests?
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction study involves small electrical impulses. It can be mildly uncomfortable, a buzzing sensation. But it's quick. As for the blood work, you can go to the lab downstairs anytime this week. I'll send the order electronically. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. We'll likely start with lifestyle modifications – regular stretching, taking breaks from sitting, and ensuring a healthy diet. If the neuropathy is confirmed and severe, we may consider medication. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Do you have any other questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that answers my questions quite thoroughly. Lifestyle modifications sound… reasonable. I suppose I haven't been as diligent with stretching as I should be, and the sitting certainly isn't helping. I appreciate you outlining the next steps so clearly. The blood work and nerve conduction study… I’ll schedule those as soon as possible. Thank you for your time and expertise, Doctor Duplichan. I’ll be in touch once I have the results.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please keep me informed. Don't delay scheduling the tests. Next patient.
