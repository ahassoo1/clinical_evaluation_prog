DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascandola. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up, mostly on this side here <gestures to his right foot and ankle>. Started a couple days ago, maybe three. Not sure exactly. It just… got bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Swelling on the right foot and ankle, started a few days ago. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it doesn’t really hurt, not unless I push on it real hard. It just feels… full, you know? Like there's too much water in there. I haven't bumped it or anything, not that I remember. I mostly just walk to the store and back, and sit around a lot. I work at the loan place, mostly paperwork, so I'm on my feet a little, but not much. <shrugs> It just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific injury you recall, swelling gradually increasing over the last few days, and it doesn't cause pain unless you press on it. You mentioned you do some walking and sit for work. Is the swelling constant, or does it get worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: It's worse at night, I think. Or maybe it just feels worse at night because I'm not moving around. Hard to say. During the day, when I'm at work, it's… not gone, but not as puffy, maybe? I usually take my shoes off when I get home, and that's when I really notice it. Does that make sense? I ain't good at explaining things sometimes.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Parascandola. Swelling is worse after being on your feet during the day and more noticeable when you rest and take your shoes off. Okay. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in the foot or ankle along with the swelling?
PATIENT: No, not really. It just looks… bigger. Same color as the other one, I think. I haven’t felt it getting hot, and my skin feels normal. I checked it this morning, kinda poking around. Nothing seemed different, just… swollen. I worry sometimes, you know? My cousin, she had something with her legs, and it got really bad. That’s why I came in, just to be sure it ain't nothing like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your cousin’s experience. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Okay, let’s do a quick exam of your foot and ankle. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. <starts to carefully swing his legs off the chair and onto the examination table> Just let me know if I’m doin’ anything wrong. I ain’t been to the doctor in… well, a long time.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mr. Parascandola. Just relax. I'm going to start by taking a look at your foot and ankle, and then I'll feel around to check for any tenderness. I'll also check your pulses. Okay, pulses are good on both sides, and no significant tenderness when I press. There is some mild pitting edema – meaning when I press on your skin, it leaves a little indentation for a moment – on the top and inside of your right foot and ankle. It doesn’t seem to be a large amount. Do you have any history of blood clots or problems with your veins?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, not that I know of. Never been told anything like that. My veins… I get them sometimes, the little spidery ones on my legs, but nothing bad. My mom had some kinda problem with her legs when she got old, but I don’t know what it was. Mostly, I just try to ignore them. <shrugs> They don’t really bother me. I mostly drink water, I try to stay hydrated. Is that good? Does that have anything to do with it? I read somewhere… things.
DOCTOR: That's good you're staying hydrated, Mr. Parascandola. That is good. The spidery veins, or varicose veins, aren’t usually a cause of sudden swelling like this, but it's good to know. And no history of blood clots, that’s helpful. Given what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some edema, or swelling, likely due to prolonged standing and reduced activity. It's not uncommon. However, we need to rule out anything more serious. I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test just to rule out a blood clot. It's a simple blood draw. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A blood draw? Yeah, I guess so. If it rules things out, that sounds good. I don’t like being poked, but I don’t want anything bad happenin’ either. Where do I go for that? And how long does it take to get the results? Do I need to fast or anything? I always forget these things. <fidgets with his hands>
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It's a quick poke, and it’s worth the peace of mind. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. You don't need to fast for this particular test. The results usually come back within a few hours, and my nurse, Sarah, will call you with the results, or schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your foot whenever you can, especially at night, and wearing compression socks if possible. They help with the swelling. Are you able to get those easily?
PATIENT: Elevatin’ it… yeah, I can do that. I got a little stool I can put my foot on. Compression socks… I think they sell those at the drugstore, right? I might have to ask my neighbor, she knows more about that kinda thing. She’s a nurse, too, retired. Okay, elevatin’ and socks. I can remember that. Is there anything else I should be doin’ or avoidin’? Should I be drinkin’ more or less water? I always get confused. <shakes his head slightly> My brain ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, don't change your water intake. You're doing fine with staying hydrated. And you're right to ask your neighbor for help with the compression socks – that's a great idea! For now, just focus on elevating your foot and keeping an eye on it. If the swelling gets significantly worse, if you develop any pain, redness, warmth, or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those would be signs of a more serious problem. Do you have any other questions for me before we get the lab work ordered?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Emergency room if it gets worse, elevatin’ and socks… and wait for the call. You’re very patient with me, Doctor. I ask a lot of questions, I know. <offers a small, grateful smile> Okay, let’s get this blood test done, then. Where do I sign?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Parascandola. It’s my job to answer your questions, and I'm happy to help. It’s always best to be informed. Sarah, my nurse, is right outside the door. She'll get you checked in and take you to the lab. Just let her know you’re here for a D-dimer test. She’ll take care of everything. Here she is now.
