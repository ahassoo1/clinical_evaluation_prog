DOCTOR: Good morning, Bianca. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just… I does be really thirsty all the time. And hungry too! Is not a normal thing, you know? I eat, and then a little while after, I feel like I could eat again. And I drink plenty water, but me still thirsty. Is happening for a couple weeks now.
DOCTOR: A couple weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Maybe… three weeks now? Is hard to say exactly. Time does fly when you getting older, you know. But it start slow, and now… now is almost all the time. I does have to carry water with me wherever I go.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. Me husband and me, we does the same things. He does garden, I does cook, we does go church on Sundays. Everything is pretty much the same. We ain't travel nowhere, ain't change the food we eat… I does wonder if it have something to do with the heat, but is always hot in Trinidad, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, the heat can certainly play a part, but it sounds like more than that. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… hmm. I does feel a little tired sometimes, but who don't? And… maybe I does go to the bathroom a little more often, but I thought that was just the water I does be drinking! Is hard to say what is normal and what is not, you know? I ain’t had any trouble sleeping, or feeling sick to me stomach. Just thirsty and hungry all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: Me appetite? Well, is good, Doctor! Is too good, maybe. I does want to eat all the time, like I said. Everything taste good, and I does eat a lot. More than usual. Me husband does say I look like I gaining weight, and he is right, I suppose. But is not like I does be eating anything bad, you know? Just normal food, like rice and beans and chicken. Sometimes a little sweet treat, but not too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, not really. I does get a little high blood pressure sometimes, but the doctor give me some pills for that. I take them regular, and is usually alright. Other than that, nothing much. I does get a little arthritis in me hands, but who don’t when you get old? And I had the flu a couple times, but that’s all. Me husband does tell me to go to the doctor more, but I don’t like going to doctors, you know? Is always a waste of time.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking for the high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. Is a little white pill, I think. Me husband does remind me to take it, because I does forget sometimes. I think… is called… Amlodi… something? Amlodi… I can’t quite remember the full name. Is a little bottle, and I take one every morning. Is the doctor give me a long time ago, so I never really bother to learn the name. Me husband knows, if you need to know.
DOCTOR: Right. And any allergies to medications, food, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I does eat anything, and I never had any trouble with pills before. Me husband does give me some herbal remedies sometimes, but I don’t know what they is. He does get them from a friend who live in the country. But I ain't never have a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. Is important to be able to eat, you know? Is one of life’s pleasures.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick exam. Just going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we'll see about getting some blood work done, just to be sure.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sound alright. Me husband always tell me to get me blood checked, so maybe is a good idea. You go ahead, and I will cooperate. Is just… I don't like needles, you know? But I will try me best.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Pulse is 82, regular. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… normal. Now, we'll need to get some blood work done. Just a standard panel to check your sugar levels, kidney function, and a few other things. It’ll give us a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sugar levels? Is that… is that what make you thirsty? Me husband does say me mother had something like that, but I don’t know much about it. Is that what you think is wrong with me? Is it serious? I does worry sometimes, you know. But I trust you, Doctor. You go ahead and do what you need to do. Just… try to be quick with the needle, please?
DOCTOR: It's too early to say for certain, Bianca. The thirst could be related to your sugar levels, but it could also be something else. The blood work will help us rule things out and get a clearer picture. Don't worry too much, we'll get to the bottom of it. The nurse will take you to the lab now. Just try to relax, and it will be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I will go with the nurse now. Is just… me hands does get shaky when I worry, you know? I hope I don’t faint. But I trust you, and I will try me best to be calm. Is there anything else I need to know before I go?
DOCTOR: No, that's all for now. Just try to drink some water before you go to the lab. And try not to worry too much. The nurse will explain everything. We'll have the results back in a couple of days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will go find the nurse now. And… thank you again. .
