DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Yeah, nice to meet you too. It's… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. And, uh, I get kinda sweaty when they happen, and my heart races. It's been going on a while now, on and off. I don't really… remember exactly when it started, to be honest. It feels like ages.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, with sweating and a racing heart. That certainly sounds concerning. When you say "on and off," can you give me a sense of how frequent these headaches are?
PATIENT: Frequent… hmm. That’s a tough one. It's not every day, definitely. Maybe… a couple times a month? Sometimes it'll be a couple weeks between them, other times it's closer together. Like, last month I think I had three, but the month before that maybe just one. I’m really bad with dates, sorry. It’s kinda… random, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Random occurrences, a couple times a month, sometimes closer together. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Uh… they're… throbbing, mostly. Like a really bad pressure, right behind my eyes and in my temples. It feels like my head's gonna split open, honestly. And it's usually on both sides, not just one spot. Everything gets kinda blurry when it’s really bad, and bright lights bother me a lot. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room and try to sleep it off. I don't really… take anything for them, if that makes sense. I just hope they go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, throbbing pressure behind the eyes and in the temples, both sides, blurry vision, sensitivity to light… and you try to sleep it off. No medication taken. Now, when these headaches come on, is there anything specific that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. I wish I knew! Honestly, it doesn’t seem to be anything specific. Sometimes it’s after a long day at work, but other times it happens when I’m just relaxing at home. I haven't noticed any connection to food or anything like that. Stress maybe? I mean, I got divorced a couple years back, so… things have been a bit stressful, but I don't always feel stressed when they happen. It's really frustrating, because I can’t predict them. I just… get one.
DOCTOR: I understand that’s frustrating. Stress can certainly be a factor, even if it’s not always a clear connection. And divorce is a major life event. Let's move on to other symptoms. Aside from the headaches, sweating, and racing heart, have you experienced any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… not really, I don't think. My appetite's been okay, I guess. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours, so that could just be from that. Oh! Actually… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, especially right before a headache starts. But it doesn't last long, just a few seconds. And I've been… a bit more forgetful lately, but honestly, I’ve always been a bit like that. I don’t really know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more tired, dizziness before the headaches, and some increased forgetfulness. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… uh… honestly, I don't really go to the doctor much. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, not that I know of. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. I think I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Well, except for these headaches, obviously. I’ve never really needed to see a specialist or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, just typical childhood illnesses and a broken arm. And no specialist visits. What about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Definitely not. Never had any surgeries. Nope. Just the broken arm, and they just put it in a cast. Didn’t need to operate or anything. I’m pretty sure about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have a history of headaches, migraines, high blood pressure, heart problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tough one. I didn’t really keep up with a lot of that. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think. And he had some heart trouble later in life. He passed away a few years ago. My mom… she had some problems with her nerves, I think, always complaining about tingling in her hands and feet. And my grandmother… she had really bad headaches, always complaining about them. But honestly, I don't know much more than that. We weren’t a very close family, I guess. It's kind of blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry but some history of high blood pressure and heart trouble in your father, nerve problems in your mother, and headaches in your grandmother. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… uh… I work pretty long hours, like I said. Production work, you know? It's physical, lots of lifting and bending. I don't really have much time for hobbies or anything. I live alone. I don’t really drink or smoke. I try to eat okay, but it’s usually just quick and easy meals. Nothing fancy. Pretty boring, really. I don't really get much exercise besides work.
DOCTOR: Okay, long hours of physical work, living alone, no smoking or drinking, quick and easy meals, minimal exercise. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Like I said, I don't really go to the doctor much, so I don't have any prescriptions. I don't take any vitamins or supplements either. I just… deal with things as they come. I guess I’m just a tough guy. But these headaches… they’re getting pretty bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay, Jaxston, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Given your history of headaches with sweating and a racing heart, along with the dizziness and some forgetfulness, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. We need to rule out some things to get to the bottom of this. First, I'd like to do a physical exam, including checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Blood pressure and heart sounds… sure. Let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable or anything. I’m not really a fan of doctors, but I trust you'll do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jaxston. I appreciate your trust. It won't be uncomfortable. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 145/90. Heart rate is 88 and regular. Lung sounds are clear. Neck is supple, no lymphadenopathy. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Cranial nerves are intact. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Neurologically, everything seems normal. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety or the physical exam itself. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function, and some inflammatory markers. We'll also want to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would you be able to get those tests done at the lab down the street?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? Uh… yeah, I guess so. I mean, I don’t really want to, but if you think it’s necessary… yeah, I can go to the lab. Is it gonna be expensive? I don’t really have a lot of money right now. And what exactly are we looking for with all this? Just trying to understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Jaxston. We can discuss options if it becomes a financial burden. We can also see if the lab offers a payment plan or reduced rates for uninsured patients. I'll have the staff check for those options for you. As for what we're looking for, the blood work will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing your headaches, like anemia, infection, or thyroid problems. The EKG will evaluate your heart rhythm and look for any abnormalities that could be contributing to your symptoms. It's a precaution to make sure everything is functioning properly. We're not necessarily looking for something specific, but these tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us make an informed decision about the best course of action. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: No, I guess not… not really. Just a lot of tests. Okay, so blood work and an EKG… and you’ll let me know the results? How long will that take? I have to go back to work tomorrow, so… I need to know if it’s gonna take a long time. And, uh, will I need an appointment to come back and talk about it? It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot, Jaxston. I'll make it as easy as possible. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back, so we can schedule a follow-up appointment for three to five business days from now to discuss them. That gives the lab enough time to process everything and me enough time to review the results. My staff will call you tomorrow to schedule that appointment and discuss any financial assistance options at the lab. They can also answer any questions you might have about the tests themselves. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious condition that needs immediate attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… the tests, and the appointment. And try not to make it too expensive, okay? Thanks, Doc. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It's just… nice to talk to someone about it. I've been putting it off for a while. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. I’m glad you came in. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and make sure you’re taken care of. My staff will be in touch tomorrow to schedule your follow-up appointment and discuss the lab costs. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
