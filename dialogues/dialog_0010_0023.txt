DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's... in my breast. It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. And you said it's in your breast – which breast, specifically?
PATIENT: Uh... the left one. Sometimes it feels like a dull ache, and sometimes... more like a sharp pain. Not all the time, though. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, left breast pain, varying from dull ache to sharp pain, and it's intermittent. How long has this been going on for, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm... maybe two, three weeks now? I'm not so good with dates. It started... after I was doing some work on a roof. A lot of reaching and... lifting. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three weeks, and it seemed to start after some heavy work involving reaching and lifting. That’s helpful information. Does anything specifically trigger the pain?
PATIENT: Not really that I can tell. Sometimes when I move my arm a certain way... but not always. It just... happens. I tried to ignore it, but it's not going away.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "not going away," is it constant, or does it come and go throughout the day?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Some days I don’t feel it at all. Other days… it hurts more. It’s not always there, Doctor. Just when I move a certain way, or… I don’t know. Sometimes just… randomly.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pain, triggered sometimes by movement but also occurring randomly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever. No... lumps, that I can feel. Nothing like that. Just the pain. And… maybe a little tired, but I do a hard job. So I'm usually a little tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, no palpable lumps, just the pain and some fatigue, which you attribute to your work. Have you noticed any changes to the skin in that area – redness, dimpling, or any discharge from your nipple?
PATIENT: Discharge? No, nothing like that. I haven't noticed any redness either. My skin looks normal, I think. I haven't really… looked that close, to be honest. I just noticed the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any history of any medical problems, like heart issues, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve never been to the doctor much. Just the usual colds and… maybe a bad back sometimes from work. Nothing serious. My wife, she says I should come more often.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. Any family history of breast cancer, or any other cancers, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I don't think so. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. I don't remember her having any problems like that. And my wife's family… I don't know, really. We haven't talked about it much. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. I don’t like it. I drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. Just one or two. And no, I don’t use any drugs. Never have. My job is dangerous enough without… that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills. I try to stay away from them if I can. Just… maybe some painkiller for my back sometimes, when it's really bad. But not often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your chest and feel around. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Okay. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I didn’t hear anything abnormal there. Now, when I palpate your chest… there is some tenderness to the left breast, as you mentioned. I don't feel any distinct lumps, but there is some discomfort when I press here. Your lymph nodes under your arm feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. I’m noting all of this for the record. It is possible this is musculoskeletal pain - related to the work you were doing on the roof. However, given the pain you're experiencing, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a mammogram and an ultrasound of your left breast. It's a precaution, but it's best to be thorough. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A mammogram? What’s that? Is it… painful? I don’t like going to the hospital. And what’s an ultrasound? I just want this pain to go away. Is it serious, Doctor? You think it is something bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. A mammogram is an X-ray of your breast. It helps us look for any abnormalities that we can’t feel during a physical exam. It can sometimes be a little uncomfortable – you’ll need to compress your breast between two plates for a few seconds, but it shouldn't be severely painful. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the tissues in your breast. It doesn't involve any radiation and isn’t painful at all. I want to reassure you, it’s highly unlikely to be anything serious, especially given your age and the fact that the pain started after heavy work. However, because you’re male, breast cancer is less common, and often presents differently. That’s why we need to investigate thoroughly to rule out anything concerning. Think of it as a safety check, to give us peace of mind. We’ll get a referral to the radiology department at [local hospital name]. They can schedule the mammogram and ultrasound for you. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… a safety check. That sounds better. I guess. My wife will be happy I’m getting it checked out. She always tells me to go to the doctor. So… [local hospital name], huh? I’ll have to ask her how to get there. Is it… expensive? I don’t have insurance, Doctor. That's one reason I don't go.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, I don’t have the exact pricing information for the radiology department at [local hospital name]. However, I can have our billing department contact them to get an estimate for you. They may also have financial assistance programs available for patients without insurance. We will do everything we can to help you navigate that process. I’m making a note to have them reach out to you. In the meantime, to manage the pain, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and apply a cold compress to the area for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Cold compress and… ibuprofen. Okay. And the billing department will call me? About the cost? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. And for not making me feel… silly about it. I just want this pain to be gone. And I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. It’s my job to address your concerns and ensure you receive the best possible care. Don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or if your pain worsens. The billing department will reach out to you within the next few business days with an estimate. We'll schedule a follow up appointment for after the mammogram and ultrasound, so we can review the results together. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm optimistic we'll figure this out.
