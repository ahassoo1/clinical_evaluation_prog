DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… someone I care about and me… we are thinking about having a baby. I just… I want to make sure everything is okay, you know? Before… before we try. It's a bit confusing, all of it. I don't really remember what I need to do.
DOCTOR: That's a very responsible thing to do, Mr. Verrall. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. And it’s perfectly alright if things aren’t clear – a lot of people find it confusing. So, you're wanting a preconception check-up to make sure you're healthy before trying to start a family. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. A… a check-up. To be healthy. I… I think that’s what it’s called. Is there a lot to it? I don't remember much from… well, from anything, really. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, we’ll take things at your pace. It's not usually a huge ordeal, mostly just gathering some information and doing a basic physical. We’ll go over your medical history, any medications you're taking, and do a quick exam. It helps us identify any potential issues that might affect your ability to conceive or a healthy pregnancy. To start, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… That’s… difficult. I’ve been to doctors before, of course, but I don’t… I don't recall specifics. I had the usual childhood things, I suppose. Maybe? I had a bad cough once, a long time ago. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy. But nothing serious, I don’t think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, a long time. Years. I don't even remember why the last time. Does that… help? I’m sorry I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. Don’t worry about it at all. It’s very common for people to not remember specifics from years ago. We can work around it. Let’s see… have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. No one ever told me I had… those things. I feel alright, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I do get… a little breathless when I climb stairs, but I’m not a young man anymore. Is that… is that something to worry about? I really don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: It's good you mentioned the shortness of breath. It could be related to age, but it's worth checking out, just to be sure. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs during the exam. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I… I don't believe so. No. Nothing cut open. Maybe… maybe I had my tonsils taken out when I was a kid? But I really can't remember. It was a long time ago. My mother… she would have known. But she’s… not here anymore. I’m sorry. I’m getting confused. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It is a lot, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. We can take a break if you need one. And it’s alright that you don’t remember details. We’ll just do the best we can. Okay, let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. I don't recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. Maybe a little sniffly nose in the spring, but everyone gets that, right? I don't take any pills or anything regularly. Just… sometimes an aspirin for a headache. But that's all. I’m really trying to remember, but it's… difficult.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies or regular medications. Alright, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… tricky. My father… he died when I was young. From… old age, I think. My mother… she had some problems with her… with her bones, maybe? She was always complaining about aches and pains. And… my brother, he had a bad heart, I think. But he lived far away, so I didn’t see him much. I don’t know… it’s all a bit hazy. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. My family… we didn’t talk much about health. It wasn't something we did.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very common for families not to discuss health openly. We’re just trying to get a general idea. So, a father who passed away at an older age, a mother with bone problems, and a brother with heart issues. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. And I… I used to drink a little wine with dinner, but not anymore. Not for years. My doctor… a long time ago, he told me to stop. Said it wasn’t good for me. And no… no drugs. Never. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. I like my garden, and… and reading. That’s about it. I don’t go out much. I try to eat healthy, but… sometimes I just have a biscuit with my tea. Is that bad? I worry about doing everything right.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Verrall. No smoking, limited alcohol, and no drug use. And enjoying a biscuit with your tea is perfectly fine – it's about balance. It sounds like you live a pretty healthy lifestyle overall. Before we move on to the physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I live alone. Always have, really. And… I worry sometimes. About being… too old to be a father. It’s silly, I know. And… I want to be a good father, if… if it’s possible. I just… I want everything to be okay. For the baby. And for… for the person I care about. Is it too late for me, Doctor? That’s what I really worry about.
DOCTOR: That's not silly at all, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly natural to have those concerns, and it’s very thoughtful of you to consider them. Age can be a factor, but it’s not necessarily a barrier. We’ll need to do some tests to assess your overall health and see if there are any potential risks. But it’s definitely not too late to explore the possibility of starting a family. Okay, now I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick check of your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. I will be very gentle. Please just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, that’s just a quick initial assessment. Based on what we’ve discussed and the preliminary exam, I recommend we order some blood tests to check your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. We should also do a urine test to check for any infections. And I’d like to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm more accurately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds like a lot of tests. But… if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes. Okay. Tests. I just… I hope they don’t find anything too bad. I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. All this talk about blood pressure and crackling… it doesn’t sound good.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Verrall. It's completely natural to feel anxious when facing tests. But remember, these tests are just to get a clearer picture of your overall health. The slight crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things, and the elevated blood pressure is something we can manage if needed. We're not necessarily looking for anything bad, just making sure everything is in good working order. Alright, I’m going to write up the orders for the blood tests, urine test, and EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to take care of you. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan. It should take a few days to get everything back. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Yes. Will these tests… will they hurt? And… how much will they cost? I don’t have insurance, you see. It’s just… money is tight.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Verrall. I understand your concern about cost, especially without insurance. The blood tests and urine test involve a simple needle prick, so there will be some mild discomfort, but it shouldn’t last long. The EKG is completely painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest to monitor your heart’s electrical activity. As for the cost, I don’t have the exact figures at my fingertips, but I can have our billing department contact you to discuss the prices and explore any potential financial assistance programs. We do have some options for patients without insurance, and we can work with you to find a payment plan that fits your budget. I’ll make a note to have them reach out to you after this appointment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… very kind of you. Thank you. Financial assistance… that would be a big help. I really appreciate it. Okay. So… tests, then follow-up appointment. And someone will call me about the money. Is there anything else I need to do right now? Or can I go now? I'm feeling a little… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: That’s right, tests then a follow-up appointment. And the billing department will be in touch with you. No, you’re all set for now, Mr. Verrall. You can go ahead and head down to the lab – they’re just around the corner. The receptionist can direct you. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of things and ensure you have all the information you need. Thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
