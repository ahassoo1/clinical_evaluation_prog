DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I been getting… flushed. That's what you call it, right? My face gets red. Happens sometimes, not all the time. It's… bothering me a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, “flushed,” meaning your face gets red. And it happens intermittently, not constantly. I understand it’s concerning you. Can you tell me a bit more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When? Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes after I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… just when I’m talking to people. Not everyone, you know? Just… some. It's strange. I don't feel hot, if that makes sense. Just… red.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered sometimes by spicy food, but not reliably. And you’ve noticed it occurring during conversation with certain people. You don’t experience a fever or feeling warm with it, just the redness. Just to clarify, when you say “some people,” is there anything specific about those people or the conversations that seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: That’s… a hard one. It’s not like I can point to a thing. Maybe… if I feel… shy? Or if someone is looking at me a lot? I don’t know. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. It's not like I'm trying to get red! I just… do. It happens quick, too. Then it goes away.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be embarrassing, Mr. Withycombe, and it sounds quite frustrating. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. So, it sounds like it might be linked to feeling self-conscious or being the center of attention, or perhaps a bit anxious in social situations. Let's get a bit more of your medical background. Have you experienced this flushing before, or is this a new symptom?
PATIENT: New. Very new. Started maybe… six months ago? Never had this problem before. I've always been… quiet, you know? But not this. Never got red like this before. Everything was normal before. I mean, as normal as things get for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, then, and it's a new development. That’s helpful to know. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms accompanying the flushing—no sweating, dizziness, headache, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or headache. Sometimes… my heart beats a little fast, maybe? But I don't know if it's from the flushing, or… just me. I get a little worried sometimes, that's all. But no sweating. Definitely not. Just… red face.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes a rapid heartbeat accompanies the flushing, but it’s hard to say if it’s related. We’ll want to investigate that further. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Doctor always said I was healthy. Just… old. I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands, but that's it. Never been told I had high blood pressure or… sugar problems. Nothing like that. I try to eat right, you know? Not too much salt.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just the one. For my hands. It's… Naproxen, I think? Little white pill. Take it every morning. Helps with the pain, a little bit. That’s all I take.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen for arthritis. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I eat everything. Never had a problem with… bee stings or poison ivy or anything like that. My wife… she was the one with allergies. Poor thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, do you have a family history of anything like heart problems, high blood pressure, or skin conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had a heart problem, I think. A long time ago. He passed away when I was young. And my mother… she had bad skin. Very sensitive. Always getting rashes. But that’s… about it. Nothing much else, that I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a father with heart problems and a mother with sensitive skin. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and just take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My blood pressure is probably fine. I try to relax, you know? But go ahead, check it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 145 over 90. That’s something we’ll want to monitor. Heart rate is a little fast as well, 88 beats per minute. Skin looks normal, no rashes or visible issues. Given your symptoms and the elevated blood pressure and heart rate, several possibilities come to mind. It could be something related to anxiety, a reaction to certain triggers, or possibly something vascular. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: EKG? Those are the stickers, right? My wife had one of those once. Okay… yes, that's alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Stickers are okay. And… the blood tests too. I don't like needles, but… I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Withycombe. The EKG involves placing stickers on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. And yes, the blood tests will involve a needle, but it will be quick. I'll get the orders sent to the lab. They’ll contact you to schedule those. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend keeping a diary of when these flushing episodes occur. Note what you were doing, what you ate, and how you were feeling emotionally. This will help us identify any potential triggers. I’d also like you to try to reduce your stress levels. Easier said than done, I know, but things like deep breathing exercises or gentle walks can make a difference. We'll review the results of these tests and discuss a plan of action once they’re back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A diary. I can do that. Write things down. And… try to relax. That's hard, though. But I’ll try. And thank you, Doctor. For… listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could listen. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll send a note to the lab with a request for expedited results, and you should hear from them within a day or two to schedule the tests. I’ll also provide you with a handout that explains some common relaxation techniques. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. And I’ll try to remember the… relaxation stuff. And the diary.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
