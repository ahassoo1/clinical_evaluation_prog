DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, it’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about my… business. Down there. I saw some red. In the bowl, you understand. Not a good sign, not at all. I’ve seen things, you know. Flying all over the world… and this is worse than turbulence, I tell you what.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You noticed some red in your stool, and you’re concerned about it. That’s definitely worth checking out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What more is there to say? It was red! Bright red. Like… well, like someone mixed cherry juice in there. And it wasn’t a little, mind you. A good amount. I haven’t been eating cherries, either. Don’t you think that’s a bit… alarming? I’ve always prided myself on a good constitution, you know. A pilot can’t be… delicate.
DOCTOR: It is concerning, and you're right to bring it to my attention. Bright red blood in the stool can have several causes, and it's good you’re paying attention to changes like this. Just to be thorough, has this happened before, or is this the first time you’ve noticed this?
PATIENT: First time. Absolutely the first time. I’ve had… a few aches and pains, getting older, you know. A bit of a twinge here and there. But never this. Never anything… colorful. I’ve always been regular, too. Like clockwork. This throws everything off. Makes a fella wonder what’s going on inside. Not a pleasant thought, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's unsettling when things change, especially with your routine. Okay, so this is a new symptom, and you’re normally very regular. Have you noticed any pain with bowel movements, or any changes in your stool consistency – like if it’s been looser than usual, or harder?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… there was a bit of a strain. Not terrible, mind you. Just a little extra effort. And it wasn't quite as… solid as usual. A bit softer. But I figured it was just something I ate. You eat all sorts of things when you're travelling, you know. Strange foods. Probably just a bit of indigestion. Though, it didn't feel like indigestion. More… down lower.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more strain and a softer stool along with the blood. That gives me a little more to work with. Now, just to get a full picture, have you experienced any fatigue lately, or noticed any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Goodness no. If anything, I’ve got more weight around the middle these days. Getting older, you know. Everything slows down. And fatigue… well, I get tired, of course. I’m eighty-eight years old! A fella gets tired. But not any more tired than usual. I still get out and about, you know. Do a bit of gardening. Though, not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no recent weight loss and fatigue is consistent with your age. Have you noticed any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: Cramping…hmm. Not exactly cramping. More of a…a dull ache. Low down. Comes and goes. Not sharp, nothing like a proper pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like a little niggle. I usually ignore it, to be honest. Old age, you know. Everything aches eventually. I didn't think much of it. Until I saw the… the color.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that comes and goes. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Divert…what now? Inflamm…something? No, no. Never been diagnosed with anything. I’ve always been a strong lad. Kept myself fit. A pilot has to be, you know. Can't be falling ill in the middle of the Atlantic. Had a bit of a bad knee years ago, playing football. But that’s it. Nothing serious. Just the knee. I think it was cartilage. The doctor gave me some pills. Helped a bit. But mostly I just toughed it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior diagnoses other than a knee issue. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the knee. Arthroscopic surgery, they called it. Years ago. Fixed the cartilage. A small incision. Didn’t bother me much. I was back flying within a few weeks. Modern medicine, you know. It’s alright, sometimes. Though, I prefer to avoid doctors if I can. They always want to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee surgery in the past. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife...well, my ex-wife, she passed away a few years back. Had a daughter, lives out in British Columbia. Don’t see her much. As for illnesses… my father, he had a bad heart. Died young. And my mother… she had arthritis, terrible pain. Couldn't get around much in her later years. But that's about it. Not a family of sickly people, generally. Though, I suppose everyone gets something eventually.
DOCTOR: Alright, history of heart disease in your father and arthritis in your mother. Now, just to finish up with the background, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a bit. I don't believe in all those pills. Give me fresh air and a good walk any day. A little bit of cod liver oil when I was a lad, my mother insisted on it, but that was decades ago. Nothing now. I like to keep things natural, you know. I eat a sensible diet. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Alright, Arbie, that gives me a good starting point. Given your symptoms - the bright red blood in your stool, the slight change in consistency, and the occasional dull ache - and the fact that this is new for you, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll need to listen to your abdomen and do a rectal exam. This will help me determine the source of the bleeding and rule out anything serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. A rectal exam, you say? Well, I suppose if you have to. It's not exactly pleasant, mind you. But if it's going to tell you what's going on… alright. Just try to be quick about it, eh? And be gentle. An old fella's parts aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Could you please lie down on your side on the examination table?
PATIENT: Grumbling noises. Alright, alright. Don't rush me. Old bones don't move so fast these days. There. Happy now? Let's get this over with. And I hope you find something useful, you know. All this poking and prodding better be worth it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I'm listening to your abdomen now. It sounds… normal, good bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to do a quick digital rectal exam. This might be a little uncomfortable, but I'll be as careful as possible. Please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Okay… I feel some… firmness on the left side of your rectum, and a small amount of blood on my glove. There doesn’t appear to be a large mass, but there is some tenderness to the touch. It's likely a source of your bleeding.
PATIENT: Tenderness? Firmness? That doesn't sound good, does it? What does it mean? Is it serious? You’re not going to tell me it's… well, you know. I've lived a long life, but I’m not ready to… shuffle off this mortal coil just yet. Tell me straight, Doctor. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. It’s good you want me to be direct. The firmness and tenderness could indicate a few things. The most likely possibility, given your age and symptoms, is diverticulosis – small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. These pouches can sometimes become inflamed or bleed, causing the symptoms you’re experiencing. It’s common in older adults and often doesn’t cause serious problems. However, it could also be something else, like a polyp or, less likely, something more concerning. To be certain, I recommend a colonoscopy. It's the best way to visualize the entire colon, identify the source of the bleeding, and rule out any other potential causes. It involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to view the colon lining. We can also take a biopsy if needed. I understand this sounds daunting, but it’s the safest way to get a definitive diagnosis and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Would you be open to discussing a referral to a gastroenterologist to schedule a colonoscopy?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy… a flexible tube… Hmph. Sounds unpleasant, to say the least. And expensive, I bet. I haven't got insurance, you know. Always prided myself on being self-sufficient. Didn't want to bother with all that paperwork and… well, all that. But… sighs… you think it’s necessary? You really think it could be something serious? I suppose if you’re telling me it’s the safest way… alright. A referral to a… gastro-whatsit… sounds sensible, I suppose. Though I don’t like it one bit. Tell me, Doctor, how much does this… procedure… cost? And is it terribly painful?
DOCTOR: Alright, Arbie. It’s good you’re considering it, even if you’re not thrilled about it. You're right to ask about cost and pain. Colonoscopies can be expensive, typically ranging from $1,500 to $3,000 depending on the facility and any additional procedures performed. Because you don’t have insurance, we can explore options like financial assistance programs at the hospital or a payment plan. I’ll have my staff look into that for you. As for pain, most patients tolerate it quite well. You'll be given sedation – medication to help you relax and minimize discomfort – so you likely won’t feel much during the procedure. You may feel some bloating or cramping afterwards, but that usually subsides quickly. We'll discuss the preparation process in detail – it involves cleaning out your colon – and ensure you’re as comfortable as possible. I’m going to write a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment and discuss the costs and preparation details. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fiber intake and drinking plenty of fluids. And please, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or significant bleeding, go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fiber… and fluids. Always telling a man what to do. Sighs. Alright, alright. Dr. Vance, you say? I'll… give her a call. And I'll try to eat more… roughage. Not my favorite, mind you. But if it keeps the… the unpleasantness… at bay. And thank you, Doctor. For being… straight with me. Even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. I appreciate it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go lie down. All this talk of tubes and… examinations… is rather draining.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbie. I understand it’s not easy to hear, but I believe it’s always best to be informed. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Dr. Vance. And please do rest. Take care, and I wish you all the best. .
PATIENT: .
