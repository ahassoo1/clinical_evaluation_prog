DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Bonck. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Dr. Neppl. It's nice to meet you too. I… well, I just moved here. And I need to, um, get set up with a doctor? I think that’s it. It’s kinda a check-up thing, I guess. Since I’m new. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Bonck. Establishing care with a new physician is a very sensible thing to do after a move. And yes, Medicare is important information – thank you for mentioning that. I see here that you are 21 years of age. To get a good baseline for your health, I’d like to ask a few questions. We’ll cover your medical history, any current concerns, and do a brief physical exam. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Medical history… hmm. That might be hard. I don't really… remember much, honestly. But I'll try to answer what I can. What kind of questions? I get a little lost if it's too complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Bonck. We'll proceed at your pace. We can take it slowly and I'll gladly rephrase anything that's unclear. It’s not uncommon for patients to have gaps in their medical recall. We’ll focus on what you do remember, and if there are significant gaps, that’s something we can document. Let’s begin with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as asthma, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I've never really been sick sick, you know? Like, I get colds sometimes, but nothing… serious. I definitely don’t have… diabetes or heart problems. I wouldn't even know what those felt like. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Bonck. It's important to me that we take our time, and that you feel comfortable sharing. Okay, no known chronic illnesses. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… surgeries. Let me think… No. I’m pretty sure I haven’t had any surgeries. I don’t have any scars, do I? Nope, nothing obvious. And I don't remember being in the hospital. Not ever. I think. It was a long time ago, maybe? I get things mixed up sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It is quite alright to not recall events with perfect clarity. No surgeries or hospitalizations reported, that is good. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history, if you know it?
PATIENT: Family… uh oh. This is tricky. My mom… she’s not around anymore, and I didn't really know my dad. I don’t know… I don’t think anyone in my family was really sick. My grandma… she was old, I think, but I don’t know what she died of. I’m really sorry, I wish I could tell you more. It’s all kinda blurry. I don’t want to be useless.
DOCTOR: You are not being useless at all, Ms. Bonck. Family medical history can be difficult to obtain, especially with limited information. It's perfectly acceptable that you don’t have a lot of details. We’ll simply document what you do know, and we can revisit this if you happen to recall anything further in the future. Okay, no significant family medical history known at this time. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Um. No. Definitely not. I don't smoke, and I don’t drink. I’ve never tried any of that stuff. And… no, no drugs either. Never. Is that… a weird question? I just don’t do any of that.
DOCTOR: Not a weird question at all, Ms. Bonck. It's a standard part of the medical history, and I appreciate your honesty. Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think really hard… I don't think so. I don’t break out in hives or anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I think. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a tummy ache sometimes, but that’s it. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything important.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Bonck. That completes the preliminary history. Now, I’d like to ask you about any current symptoms you may be experiencing, if any. Are you having any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, or any other concerns that brought you in today, aside from establishing care?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, now that you mention it… I do get kinda tired a lot. Not like, can't-get-out-of-bed tired, but just… worn out. And I think I've been eating a little less lately. Not on purpose, I just don’t feel very hungry. Everything else… feels okay, I guess. It's just those two things. I’m not sure if that’s anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and decreased appetite. We can definitely explore those further. Could you describe the fatigue in more detail?
PATIENT: Uh… it's just… kinda all the time, you know? Like, even if I sleep okay, I still feel a little bit… heavy. It's not like a sharp tired, just… blah. It's hard to explain. It doesn't really stop me from doing things, but I get tired easier. And it's been going on for… a few weeks, I think. Maybe longer? I’m not very good at keeping track.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Bonck. A persistent feeling of “blah” and increased fatigue even after adequate sleep is certainly worth investigating. And several weeks is a relevant timeframe. Now, regarding the decreased appetite, has there been any unintentional weight loss associated with that?
PATIENT: I… I haven’t really been weighing myself. I don't own a scale. But I think I might be a little bit smaller? My clothes feel a little bit looser, maybe. I haven't tried them on in a while, though. It's not a big deal, I don't think. I just haven't been very hungry. I'm not trying to lose weight, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unintentional weight loss is a possibility, but unconfirmed. That’s helpful information. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah. Okay. That's okay. Physical exam. What does that… involve? I get a little scared of doctors, sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Bonck. Many people feel that way. It’s quite routine. I’ll be listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. I’ll also check your reflexes and briefly assess your neurological function. It doesn’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. We can pause at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… less scary when you explain it. But… can you tell me what you're doing as you do it? It helps me if I know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. That's a very reasonable request. I will explain everything step-by-step. First, let's start with your vital signs. I'm going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 118 over 72, which is within the normal range. Now, I'm going to check your pulse. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, also within the normal range. Finally, I’ll check your temperature. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No… no questions. That all sounds okay. Numbers are good? Is that good? What do the numbers mean? I'm sorry, I don't know a lot about this stuff.
DOCTOR: They are indeed good numbers, Ms. Bonck. A blood pressure of 118/72 is considered healthy, and a pulse of 78 is within the normal range for an adult at rest. Your temperature is also normal. Think of your blood pressure as the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. The first number is when your heart beats, and the second number is when your heart rests between beats. Your pulse rate is simply how many times your heart beats per minute. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and I'm not hearing any unusual noises. Your lungs are clear, and I'm also not hearing any wheezing or crackles.
PATIENT: Okay… heart good, lungs good. That’s good to hear. What about the ears? Does that… hurt? I get worried about the ear things.
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Ms. Bonck. You're doing great. No, the ear examination shouldn't hurt at all. I'm just using an otoscope – a small instrument with a light – to look inside your ears. It might feel a little bit cool, but it shouldn't be painful. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look normal. There’s no sign of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I’ll take a look at your throat. Say "Ahhh" for me, please. Your throat looks clear, and there’s no sign of redness or swelling.
PATIENT: "Ahhh..." Okay. All clear. That was… easy. It's less scary when you tell me what you're doing. What's next? Is it over soon?
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Ms. Bonck. You've been a wonderful patient, and you're right - we’re almost finished. The next part involves a quick check of your abdomen. I’m just going to gently press on different areas of your stomach to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No… no pain. A little… funny? Like a little bit squishy? But not hurt. Is that bad? I don’t know what normal feels like.
DOCTOR: That’s a good observation, Ms. Bonck. It's perfectly normal for the abdomen to feel somewhat soft, and it's good that you are aware of your body. I'm not feeling any areas of significant tenderness or abnormalities. Finally, I’d like to check your reflexes. This is just to assess your nervous system function. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, the physical exam is complete.
PATIENT: Okay… good. All good. I think? What does it mean? Is something wrong? What are we going to do about the tired and the… squishy stomach?
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Ms. Bonck. And you're right to ask. Based on the physical exam, everything appears normal. However, your reported fatigue and decreased appetite warrant further investigation. It's unlikely that the “squishy stomach” is a cause for concern, but the fatigue is the more important issue to address. Several factors could be contributing to this, including stress, poor diet, lack of sleep, or even underlying vitamin deficiencies. To rule out any potential medical causes, I'd like to order some basic blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid hormone test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Okay… yeah, if it will help. What does it involve? Do I have to… do anything special before? I get nervous around needles, too. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about needles, Ms. Bonck, and it’s perfectly valid. We can take it slow, and I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is aware of your concerns. The blood work involves a simple blood draw from your arm. You’ll sit in a comfortable chair, and a trained phlebotomist will clean your arm with alcohol and insert a needle into a vein. It only takes a few minutes. As for preparation, I recommend drinking plenty of water in the 24 hours before your appointment to make your veins more prominent. You don’t need to fast beforehand, unless I had ordered a specific test that requires it—and in your case, you don’t. You also don't need to alter any medications. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan to address your fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that doesn’t sound too bad. No fasting. And just drink water. Yes, that sounds alright. Can… can we schedule the appointment now? And… can you make sure the needle person knows I get scared?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bonck. I'm happy to schedule that for you right now. Let me see… we have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM for the blood draw. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10:00 AM… yes, that works. And… you'll tell them about the scary needles?
DOCTOR: I absolutely will. Okay, Tuesday at 10:00 AM it is. I’ve made a note for the lab technician regarding your anxiety, and they will be prepared to take extra care and ensure you’re comfortable throughout the process. Here’s a lab requisition form for you to take with you. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Bonck?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Dr. Neppl. For being patient and… not laughing at me. I hope the blood test finds something out. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Bonck. It was my pleasure, and please, do not hesitate to ask if any questions come to mind before Tuesday. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious, and there is no need to feel embarrassed. I share your hope that the blood tests will provide us with some answers. And remember, we’re in this together. I’ll see you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, take care of yourself. Have a good day, Ms. Bonck.
PATIENT: Thank you. You too.
