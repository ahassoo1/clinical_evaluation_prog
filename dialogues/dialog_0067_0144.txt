DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilly. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Pfennig, is it? Yes, well… honestly? Curiosity, mostly. I don’t usually go to doctors unless something’s terribly wrong, and even then… I mostly just let my daughter handle it. She worries so. But she said I should come get a… a check-up. Just to see. You know, at my age. It’s probably nothing, really. I just thought I’d humor her.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Lilly. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and regular check-ups are a wonderful idea, even if you're feeling well. It's good to establish a baseline. So, “just to see” is a good starting point. Are there any specific things you’ve been noticing, even small things, that prompted this visit, or is it truly just a general check-up as requested by your daughter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific things… hmm. Let me think. Well, my knees have been a bit… creaky, I suppose. But that's just getting old, isn't it? And I forget things, naturally. Though, honestly, I’ve always been a bit forgetful. My late husband used to say I’d forget my own head if it wasn’t attached. It’s hard to say what’s new and what isn’t, you see? I don’t really notice these things, not until someone points them out.
DOCTOR: That’s very common, Lilly. It can be difficult to distinguish between what’s a normal part of aging and what might be worth looking into. The creaky knees are certainly something many people experience as they get older. And forgetfulness, as you said, can be a lifelong trait. Just to clarify, when you say you forget things, can you give me an example?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Examples… Well, just yesterday I went to the kitchen to get… what was I getting? Oh, bother. It was something for dinner, I’m sure of it. And I stood there for a good five minutes, trying to remember. Eventually, my daughter told me I’d already put the chicken in the slow cooker hours ago. See? It’s things like that. Little things. Not… major. I don't wander off or anything. Just… gaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, “gaps” in memory – remembering what you went to the kitchen for, things like that. And it doesn’t seem to be impacting your overall orientation or causing you to get lost, which is good. To get a better picture, would you say this forgetfulness has been getting worse lately, or has it been fairly consistent over time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I suppose… maybe a little worse? It used to be just names, mostly. I’m terrible with names. But now it’s… things I did. Like yesterday with the chicken. Or I’ll start a sentence and completely lose my train of thought. It's frustrating, more than anything. My daughter keeps looking at me with that worried face... honestly, she makes a bigger deal out of it than I do.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re aware of the changes, even if they’re frustrating. And it’s very common for family members to be concerned. Let’s talk a little bit more about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with the memory changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I get tired easily, I suppose. But who doesn’t at my age? I used to be able to garden all day, but now I need to take breaks. And sometimes, I feel a bit… off balance. Not dizzy, exactly. Just… unsteady on my feet. But again, I blame that on getting older, too. It’s probably just my knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and feeling unsteady. Those are good things to mention. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, let's go through some basic health questions. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped over the cat. Silly thing. Nothing too serious, though. I don't think I've had any major illnesses. A lot of colds, of course, and the usual aches and pains… but nothing that kept me in the hospital for long. My late husband, he had a heart condition. That was… difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilly. I'm sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been very hard. Now, thinking about medications, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think. I take a blood pressure pill, a little white one. And something for my arthritis, it's a pink capsule. I think that's it. Oh! And I take a multivitamin every day, just because my daughter tells me to. She’s very good about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure pill, something for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Do you happen to know the names of the medications for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, not really. I just have my daughter fill the little containers every month. She knows what I need. I don't bother with the names, too much trouble to remember. Honestly, I just take them when she tells me to. It’s easier that way. She handles all that complicated stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilly. We can certainly look that up in the system. It's good you have someone to help manage that for you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat everything. I love Korean food, of course – spicy kimchi, everything! I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter always asks, but I always tell her “no.” I don't believe in allergies. They're just… modern nonsense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lilly. No known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh, dear. What does that mean? Do you want to know about my friends? I don’t really have friends, not anymore. My late husband was my best friend. Since he passed… I mostly just stay home and watch television. My daughter visits every week, thank goodness. She takes me to the grocery store and keeps me company. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Lilly. It’s helpful to know what your daily life is like. I was just asking about things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or have any hobbies. But it’s perfectly alright if you don’t engage in those things. You’ve already given me a good picture of your life, and that's very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, dear. Whatever you need to do. I suppose it’s good to check everything, even if I feel fine. Just don’t take too long, alright? I have my soap opera on this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilly. I’ll be as quick as I can. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Now, could you please follow my gaze as I check your eye movements?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I always thought my eyesight was getting worse, but my daughter says it’s just old age. I have trouble reading small print these days, but I just hold the book closer. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Your eye movements seem normal, and your pupils react to light appropriately. Holding the book closer is a common adjustment with age, Lilly. We can certainly check your vision more thoroughly if you'd like, but it doesn't sound like anything urgent. One last thing. I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed, I’d like to order some blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Honestly, I hate needles. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. My daughter will be glad I’m finally getting everything checked. What are you looking for, exactly? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be nervous about needles, Lilly. We’ll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. And no, I don’t necessarily think something is wrong, but the blood tests will help us rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue, memory changes, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Specifically, I’d like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your cholesterol levels and kidney function. It’s a pretty standard set of tests. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those things… No, not really. They all sound… complicated. As long as it’s nothing serious. And as long as it doesn’t take too long. My daughter can explain everything to me later. She's very good with medical things. When do I get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilly. Your daughter can certainly help explain the results. We can get the blood drawn at the lab right across the hall. They’re very efficient, and it shouldn’t take too long – about 15-20 minutes. I’ll send the order electronically to the lab now, and they’ll be expecting you. In the meantime, I’ll write you a prescription for a multivitamin with B12 to help support your overall health. And I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Two weeks sounds fine. As long as I don’t have to come back too often. My daughter will be pleased I’m following your instructions. And thank you, dear. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s just… everything is so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. It’s my pleasure. And you’re right, healthcare can be complicated. That's why I'm here to help guide you through it. Here's the prescription for the multivitamin. And here's a slip with the lab order. They'll be expecting you anytime today. We’ll schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, dear. You've been very kind. And tell your staff I appreciate their patience too. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilly. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and enjoy your tea. We'll see you in two weeks. Have a good day!
