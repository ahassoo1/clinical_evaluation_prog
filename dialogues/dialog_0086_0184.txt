DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Good morning to you too. Look here, Doctor, I ain't got all day. I come 'bout... well, lookin' at myself. I don't like what I see in the mirror no more. It’s just... saggin’, everything is. And feelin' loose. Not good. Not good at all. I want it fixed. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: “Sagging” and “loose,” alright. And you’re concerned about… your overall physical appearance then?
PATIENT: Concerned? That's a weak word, Doctor. I dislike it. Very much. It used to be… firm. Now? Like an old rag. Especially down here. <gestures vaguely at his stomach> And the arms. Everything’s droopin’. It's embarrassing, you understand? I used to be a strong man, buildin’ things. Now… well, you see. It’s not a good look for a man.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re unhappy with some changes you've noticed in your body. When did you start noticing these changes, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think now... It wasn't sudden, you know. Gradual. Maybe... five, six years ago? After my wife passed, to be honest. Didn’t eat right, didn’t keep up with things. Less reason to, you see? Used to be I was out buildin’ all day, strong as an ox. Now… I mostly sit. And look at myself gettin' worse. It's been slow, but now it's really botherin' me. It just keeps... gettin' worse. And I want somethin' done about it. Quick like.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five or six years, coinciding with your wife’s passing. And you’ve noticed a decline in muscle tone, particularly in your abdomen and arms. Have you been doing any sort of exercise at all during this time, even just walking?
PATIENT: Exercise? <scoffs> Doctor, I'm seventy-six years old! Walkin’ to the fridge is exercise enough these days. No, I haven’t been doin’ no “exercise”. What good would that do now, anyway? Too late for all that, I reckon. I need somethin'… real. Somethin' to tighten things up. Not some walkin' around. I want a fix. You understand? A proper fix.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Trendler, at your age, expecting a “quick fix” might not be realistic. However, we can certainly explore options. Before we talk about those, though, I need to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Heart problems? No. Never had any of that. Bit of arthritis in the knees, but that’s just old age. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but the doctor gives me a pill for that. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. I used to be a strong man, you know. Worked hard all my life. Built things. Never sick a day in my life 'til after… well, never mind. I just want somethin’ done about this saggin’, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, managed hypertension... and you said you take a pill for your blood pressure. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute! You expect me to remember the name of a little pill? I take it every mornin', that's all I know! Little white thing, maybe? Doctor gave it to me years ago. I don't keep track of all that fancy stuff. I just take it when I'm told. Look, are we gonna talk about fixin' me, or are you gonna quiz me on pills all day? I haven't got time for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, knowing your medications is important. It can affect what options are available to you. However, we can look it up. Do you have a pharmacy you regularly use?
PATIENT: Fine, fine! There’s a pharmacy down the road. “Thompson’s Pharmacy”. Old man Thompson runs it. He knows me. Maybe he remembers what he’s givin' me. But honestly, Doctor, this is gettin’ ridiculous. I come here to get somethin’ done. Not to be interrogated about little pills and pharmacies. Can we please just talk about fixin’ this saggin’, before I lose my patience? It’s embarrassin’ enough as it is. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I’m accessing your records from Thompson’s Pharmacy now... okay. You’re on Lisinopril for hypertension. Now, about this “sagging”… I need to examine you to determine the cause. This could be simple muscle loss due to aging, or it could be something else. Are you agreeable to a physical examination?
