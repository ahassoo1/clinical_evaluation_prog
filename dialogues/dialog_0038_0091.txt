DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Bianca. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Is nice to meet you also. Well, lately I been drinkin' a lot of water, more than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just... don't seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, that does sound a bit concerning, feeling thirsty all the time and constantly hungry. How long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Maybe... about a month or so now? It start slow, just feelin' a little more thirsty with the heat, you know? But it gettin' worse each week. And the hunger... that come a little after the thirst start. It not like a normal hungry, it just... always there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a month, gradually getting worse… that's helpful. And you said it's not a normal hunger, more of a constant feeling?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is right. Not like when I miss lunch, you know? This is... always there. Even if I just finish eatin' a big plate of rice and beans and chicken, I still feel like I need somethin' else. It botherin' me real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes along with the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see... well, I been goin' to the bathroom more often, yes. To pee, mostly. And... sometimes I feel a little tired, but I does work hard all day with the pump, so I thought that was just from that. I not sure if that is connected. Is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, more frequent urination and some fatigue… those could certainly be relevant. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm... not that I know of, Doctor. I does wear glasses, you see, so sometimes things is a little blurry if I not wearin' them. But I don't think my vision change change. I see the same as always when I wearin' my glasses. Is that makin' sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. You’ve been wearing glasses already, so we're looking for changes in your vision, not just general blurriness. Good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin' like that. I does get a little back pain from the work, but the doctor just tell me to stretch and take some pain reliever when it bad. Otherwise, I always been pretty healthy, touch wood. My mother, she had some trouble with her heart when she get old, but nothin' like that ever bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had surgery, never been in the hospital. I does try to stay away from those places if I can! I does believe in takin' care of myself, you know? Eat good food, drink plenty water... well, maybe too much water lately. But generally, I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good information. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take nothin' regular. Just the pain reliever when my back hurt real bad, and that ain't every day. I does try to avoid takin' pills if I can, you know? I believe in natural remedies when possible. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly fine. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or insect stings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Never had any reaction to anythin' that I know of. I does get mosquito bites all the time, livin' here, but that ain't an allergy, just an annoyance! I can eat anythin', as far as I know. Never had any trouble with food.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful to know. And just one final question before we do a quick exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmm... well, I work every day with the pump, like I say. It hard work, pumpin' water for everybody. I does get up early, go to work, come home, cook for my husband, and then relax a little before bed. We don’t go out much, mostly stay home. We eat mostly local food, rice and beans, chicken, fish, you know. Is a simple life, but is a good life.
DOCTOR: Alright, a busy but simple life. That gives me a good picture. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And I’d also like to check your weight and height, if that's alright with you.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. You can do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Is just a little worryin' me, feelin' so thirsty and hungry all the time. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let’s start with your weight and height. Then we'll check your blood pressure. Okay, your weight is 78 kilograms and your height is 168 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 27.6. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We'll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright, everything sounds good so far. I'm going to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam. Reflexes are normal and neurological function is intact. Alright, everything seems normal on the initial exam. Based on your symptoms and these initial findings, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including pre-diabetes or diabetes. The increased thirst, frequent urination, and constant hunger are all classic signs. However, your blood pressure is also elevated which is a concern. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and cholesterol. They'll also help us rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diabetes? That sounds... serious. My mother, she didn't have that, did she? I always try to eat healthy, you know? Is just... I don’t know what is happenin'. Blood tests? Is that gonna hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work tomorrow, you see.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Bianca. It is serious if it is diabetes, but it's also very manageable with the right treatment and lifestyle changes. And don't beat yourself up about it. Many people develop diabetes even with a healthy lifestyle. It doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. As for your mother, I can check her records here at the clinic to see if she had a history of diabetes. Okay, it looks like your mother did not have a formal diagnosis of diabetes, but there is a note that she had slightly elevated blood sugar levels during a routine checkup a few years before her passing. So, there could be a genetic component. Now, regarding the blood tests, they won't hurt much at all. It's just a small prick of a needle to draw a little bit of blood. Most people don't even feel it. It will only take a few minutes to draw the blood. And the results usually come back within 24 to 48 hours. We can call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water, but try to avoid sugary drinks. Also, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. And don't worry too much – we'll figure this out together. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, that is good to know about my mother. A little relieved it wasn't nothin' serious with her. And small meals... I can try that. Is just hard when I feel so hungry all the time! The prick of the needle... I don't like needles. But if it gotta be done, it gotta be done. And how much will the blood tests cost? I don't have insurance, you see. Is a little worryin', payin' for all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Bianca. It’s absolutely okay to be worried about that, especially without insurance. Let me check the pricing for you. Okay, the basic blood panel we need, including the blood sugar, kidney function, and cholesterol tests, will cost $150. We do have a payment plan available if that would be helpful, and we can also see if there are any local assistance programs that can help cover the cost. We definitely don’t want the cost to prevent you from getting the care you need. We also have a social worker here at the clinic who can help you explore different financial assistance options. Would you like me to connect you with her?
PATIENT: Oh, $150… that is a little much, but maybe I can manage. The payment plan sounds good, if that is possible. And connectin' me with the social worker... yes, please. That would be very helpful. I don't know where to start lookin' for assistance, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I feel a little less worryin' now, knowin' you are tryin' to help me with the cost. So, the blood tests first then? When can I do those?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Bianca. I'm glad I can help ease your worries a little. It's my job to make sure you get the care you need, and that includes helping with the financial aspects as well. Yes, let's get the blood tests done first. Our lab technician, Maria, is available right now, so we can do them immediately. She’s very gentle and efficient. She’ll explain the procedure to you, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes total. Then we’ll just wait for the results to come back. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: No, I think I am ready. Just a little nervous about the needle, but I can manage. Thank you again, Doctor, for bein' so patient and understandin'. Lead the way, and I'll follow. I trust you and Maria. Let's get this over with. Hopefully, it is nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. This way. Maria is right over here. She's expecting you. Remember, it's just a small prick, and it will be over before you know it. And we'll take it one step at a time. Maria, this is Bianca. She's here for the blood tests we discussed. She'll get you all set up. I'll be right here if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to call my name if you're feeling anxious or uncomfortable.
PATIENT: .
