DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… someone told me I should be. New to the area, you see. Medicare insisted on it, really. Honestly, I don’t quite recall why they insisted. Just a formality, I presume. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. A preventative visit is always a good idea, even if it’s simply to establish care. And you are quite right, it is important to get everything documented. To help me understand your overall health, perhaps we can start with a bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly, and if so, could you tell me about any significant health concerns you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant concerns… that’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. There have been… things. I suppose I had a touch of the flu a few years back. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, naturally. Beyond that… honestly, I can’t recall specifics. I’ve always been… quite healthy, generally. I don’t see the point in dwelling on ailments, you know? It just brings one down. Is there a quicker way to do this? Perhaps a form I can fill out?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. We do have a medical history questionnaire. That might be easier. It covers most of the key information. Please take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. While you’re completing that, I’ll just pull up your file to see what information Medicare has on record. It appears you've had some previous visits documented in Florida… let's see what details we can uncover.
PATIENT: Florida… yes, that was a long time ago. Honestly, I barely remember the doctors there. They all seemed the same, really. Do you need me to spell everything? My handwriting isn't what it used to be, either. And I do wish they'd use a larger font. It’s very inconsiderate, you know.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Engelhaupt. Take your time, and please don’t worry about neatness or spelling. We can always clarify anything that's unclear. And you are absolutely right to point that out – the font is rather small. I'll make a note to request larger print forms for future patients. While you’re working on that, perhaps you could tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. I take something for my… well, I think it’s for my water retention. A small white pill. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly bothersome, I take a little something for the pain. Over-the-counter, you understand. Nothing serious. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. My husband usually handles all that. He's far more organized than I am. Is it absolutely necessary to list every little thing?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Any information you can recall is helpful, but don’t feel pressured to remember specifics. Knowing that you take something for water retention and occasional knee pain is a good start. We can often cross-reference that with pharmacy records. It appears there’s a record of Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily for hypertension and occasional Ibuprofen use. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Hydro… what-now? And Ibu… something? Oh, dear. That sounds vaguely familiar, but honestly, Doctor, you might as well be speaking a foreign language. I told you, my husband handles all of this. Hypertension… is that… high blood pressure? I seem to recall something about that. He's very diligent about keeping me healthy, you know. Perhaps you should speak to him directly. He'd have all the details. Honestly, this is all rather exhausting. Can we please hurry this along? I have a luncheon to attend, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I completely understand your frustration, and we can certainly expedite this process. Knowing you have a dedicated caregiver in your husband is very helpful. It would be wonderful if we could speak with him to gain a more complete understanding of your medical background. In the meantime, let’s perform a brief physical exam to assess your current health status. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Honestly, I haven't had a proper physical in… decades. I suppose it can't be helped. Just… be quick about it. And please, don’t poke and prod too much. My skin is rather delicate, you know. And do try to be gentle. Get it over with, Doctor. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. This cuff may feel a little tight for a moment. Just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 148/82, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits, but the blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Honestly. Probably just the stress of all this poking and prodding. I always get flustered with doctors. They always seem to find something wrong, you know? Is something amiss? You’re listening for a very long time. Are you sure you know what you’re doing? My late uncle was a doctor, you know. A very good one. He always said… Never mind. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished at the bases, which can be common with age. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any unusual masses or abnormalities. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Really, Doctor? Is this truly necessary? I assure you, everything is perfectly… functional. I still manage my luncheon dates, you know. And I do a bit of gardening, when the weather permits. Honestly, you’re treating me like a fragile porcelain doll. Oh! That tickles! And it’s rather undignified. Please, be quick about it. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are present and symmetrical, albeit slightly diminished, which is also common with age. Everything appears to be within normal limits for someone of your age. Well, Ms. Engelhaupt, physically, you appear to be in relatively good health for your age. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should address. And the diminished lung sounds warrant further investigation. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few simple blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. And a chest X-ray would be helpful to evaluate your lungs. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-rays? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite the ordeal. I came in for a simple check-up, and now you’re talking about… panels and rays. It's simply ridiculous. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But I insist on knowing the cost beforehand. And I expect a detailed explanation of what all of these tests entail. I won’t be subjected to any unnecessary procedures, you understand. And I expect you to be gentle. Very gentle. This is all so… unsettling. Can we at least schedule these tests for next week? I have a bridge game on Friday. Oh dear, what a fuss.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I completely understand your apprehension, and we will proceed at your pace. I will ensure all costs are clearly explained to you beforehand, and we will schedule the blood tests and chest X-ray for next week, avoiding your bridge game. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health, including your kidney function, liver function, and cholesterol levels. The chest X-ray will give us a clearer picture of your lungs and help rule out any potential underlying issues. The process is quite straightforward and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate hydration. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Questions? No, not really. I suppose you’ve explained everything adequately. Though frankly, I still think it’s all a bit… excessive. But very well, if it will appease you. Just… please, make sure the technicians are gentle. And I expect a prompt result. I don't like waiting around. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather draining. I suppose… that will be all for today. Is there anything else you require? I have a luncheon reservation to keep, you know. It's been… enlightening. Though not particularly enjoyable. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will ensure everything is arranged accordingly, and I will personally follow up with you regarding the results. The lab results should be available within a few days, and I will contact your husband to discuss the findings with him as well. Thank you for coming in today. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And do enjoy your luncheon. .
