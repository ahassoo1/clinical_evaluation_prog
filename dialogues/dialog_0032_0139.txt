DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re thirty-one years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, thirty-one. I... need check for referee. For fitness. For work. I want to make sure I am okay. It is important.
DOCTOR: “Referee,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Basketball. I referee basketball games. They want me to get checked... to be sure I can still do it. Is this okay? I don't want to waste time, if it's not.
DOCTOR: Right. A physical for fitness to referee basketball. While not a typical reason for a medical evaluation, it is certainly within the scope of preventative care. We will assess your overall health and ensure there are no underlying conditions that would preclude you from performing your duties. To begin, let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Significant... hmm. Not really. I had the flu, maybe, a few times. Nothing bad. Years ago, I broke my arm, playing... never mind. It's healed. My wife... she was sick. But she... she is gone now. So, not much else. Is that okay? Should I say more?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Shanor. I understand this can be difficult. While your wife's health is important, we are focusing on your current medical status today. Regarding your own health… you mentioned a broken arm. When was that, approximately?
PATIENT: About ten years ago. Playing basketball, actually. It was a bad fall. They put a cast on it. It healed good. Doctor said it was fine. No problems with it since. I don't think it matters for refereeing... does it?
DOCTOR: While it may seem unrelated, Mr. Shanor, a prior fracture can sometimes impact range of motion or predispose you to future injury. It's important that we have a complete picture. Do you experience any pain, weakness, or limited movement in your arm currently?
PATIENT: No. No pain. No weakness. I can move it just fine. I lift things at work... heavy things. No problem. It feels normal. Really. I promise. Is there something wrong? Should I see a different doctor? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of assessing your condition. Becoming agitated will not expedite the process. Let's move on to other areas. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat anything. Take any medicine, if I need. No problems. My wife... she had allergies. Bad ones. But I don't. I checked. Many times. Is that good enough? I really don't understand why you ask so many questions about things that don't matter.
DOCTOR: It is essential to rule out any potential contraindications, Mr. Shanor. We are conducting a thorough assessment to ensure your safety, and prevent any unforeseen complications while performing your duties as a referee. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. I drink tea, sometimes. Green tea. For health. That's all. No medicine. No vitamins. I eat healthy. Mostly. Look, can we just check me? I need to know if I can work. That's all I care about. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, your dismissive attitude is… unhelpful. I understand your urgency, however, a proper medical evaluation requires a comprehensive history. Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just... get it over with. Hurry. I have a game on Saturday. If I don't pass this... I lose my job.
DOCTOR: Please take deep breaths, Mr. Shanor. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I will assess your range of motion. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little stiff. Always has been. Like I said, I broke my arm. It doesn't hurt, just... doesn't go all the way up.
DOCTOR: Indeed. I see some restriction in your shoulder mobility. There is some mild tenderness upon palpation of the anterior shoulder capsule. Now, can you rotate your arms outwards, as if reaching behind your back?
PATIENT: It's... hard. It doesn't go very far. It feels tight. Like a rubber band pulling. Is this bad? Should I stop? I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Please stop there, Mr. Shanor. It appears you have some limitations in your shoulder rotation, and it’s causing you discomfort. Based on my initial assessment, it seems you may have some underlying rotator cuff pathology, potentially a mild impingement or early signs of adhesive capsulitis – commonly known as a frozen shoulder. To confirm this diagnosis, I recommend an MRI of your shoulder. It will allow us to visualize the soft tissues and determine the extent of any damage. I will also refer you to a physical therapist for evaluation and treatment. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates your shoulder pain. Do not referee any games until you have been cleared by a specialist.
PATIENT: MRI? Physical therapist? That sounds... expensive. And I need to work. I have bills to pay. Is there anything else I can do? Some medicine? An injection? I can’t afford all this. And Saturday... my game...
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concerns about the cost and your immediate need to work. However, prioritizing your long-term health is paramount. Continuing to work while ignoring this issue could exacerbate the problem, leading to more significant and costly interventions down the line. An injection could provide temporary relief, but it will not address the underlying cause. Furthermore, repeated injections can have their own risks and side effects. I can prescribe you some anti-inflammatory medication to manage the pain and inflammation, but it’s merely a symptomatic treatment. I strongly advise you to follow through with the MRI and physical therapy referral. I will provide you with a list of specialists in your area who offer payment plans. Given your limitations and discomfort, I am recommending you refrain from refereeing games until you have been thoroughly evaluated and cleared by a specialist. Continuing to play could cause further injury and potentially jeopardize your ability to work in the future. Do you understand?
