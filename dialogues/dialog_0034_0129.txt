DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Dr. Seil, is it? Yes, well, let's get this over with. It's my… stool. It’s black. Been happening for a bit now, and frankly, I haven’t got all day to sit here explaining things. I take pills, you see. For the pain. Lots of them. That’s all you really need to know, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for coming in, Ms. Hatchard. I understand you're concerned about the color of your stool, and that it’s been black for a while now. And you mentioned taking pain pills. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the black stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't recall the exact date. I keep a tidy house, not a diary of my… leavings. It was… several weeks ago, I’d say. Maybe a month? Longer? It doesn't really matter, does it? It's black. And it’s not normal. I’ve lived 73 years, I know what normal looks like. It’s these pills, I’m telling you. Strong stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and you’re right to be concerned about a change in stool color. While it could be related to the pain medication, black stool can have several causes, and it’s important to investigate further to be sure. To clarify, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, investigate further? Look, I'm not a complicated case. I take pills, my stool is black, and I'm a reasonably healthy 73-year-old. What more investigation do you need? But… fine. Let me think. No, not really. I’m a bit tired, naturally. I am 73. And my stomach feels a bit… unsettled sometimes. But that’s probably just the pills too, isn’t it? Everything feels unsettled these days. Honestly, I just want to know if I’m going to die from this. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Ms. Hatchard, and not too much at all. We’ll work through this together, and I’ll do my best to give you a clear understanding of what’s going on. The unsettled stomach is good to know. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the stool itself?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. You want me to describe it? Really? I suppose… it’s… well, it’s black. Like tar, almost. Not… runny, usually. More… solid. But sometimes a bit soft, depending on what I’ve eaten. And it smells… like stool, naturally. What kind of answer do you expect? This is ridiculous. I’m telling you, it’s the pills! Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Ms. Hatchard, and I understand your frustration. It's helpful to get a detailed description, even though it's not pleasant to discuss. The tar-like consistency is important information. Now, regarding the pain pills you're taking - do you happen to know the name of the medication, and how much you take each day?
PATIENT: Ugh, names. I never remember names. My husband, Harold, handles all that. He’s the organized one. Let me think… they’re little white pills. Small ones. And… I take them three times a day. Or is it four? Honestly, it varies depending on how much it hurts. He fills the little pill container for me, you see. I just… take them. Something with “profen” in the name, maybe? Ibu… or napro… something like that. Harold would know. He’s always going on about dosages and side effects. It's a bother, really. Just get me something that stops the pain, that's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, that’s helpful. “Something with profen” gives us a starting point. We will certainly verify the medication list to be sure. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in your bowel habits other than the color?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Definitely no blood. I would notice blood, thank you very much. And bowel habits… well, they’re… regular enough. Sometimes a bit constipated, sometimes… not. It’s old age, you see. Things slow down. I don’t want to sit here and dissect every trip to the bathroom! Honestly, are you going to ask me about the shape of it next? This is a waste of my time. Can we just get a test or something? Anything to prove it's the pills?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. You’re right, let’s focus on getting some answers. We will absolutely run some tests. Before we proceed, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want my medical history? Honestly. Well, Harold says my blood pressure is a bit high sometimes. He checks it with that little cuff thing. And I had a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone did. Beyond that… no. I’ve always been a reasonably healthy person. I eat my vegetables, I try to walk when the weather’s nice, and I don't smoke. I'm not one of those patients, if that's what you're thinking. Just fix my stool, please. I have a garden to tend, you know. And a perfectly good afternoon slipping away.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Hatchard. Thank you for sharing that. It's helpful to have a complete picture. Now, just to confirm, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once, years ago, for a bad gallbladder. They took it out, naturally. That was… oh, must have been 30 years ago? More? Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. But that’s it. Nothing recent. And I recovered perfectly from both of them, if you’re wondering. I’m a strong woman, you see. Always have been. Can we please move this along? This is becoming rather tiresome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard, thank you. That’s helpful. Finally, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, or stomach problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now you’re really reaching. My mother lived to be 92, and she was perfectly healthy until the very end. She swore by a glass of wine every night. My father… well, he had a bit of a heart problem towards the end, but he smoked like a chimney. And my brother… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer. But he smoked too, of course. It’s always the smoking, isn’t it? Honestly, I don’t see what any of this has to do with my stool. Can we just get a test already? I’m beginning to feel quite faint. I need a cup of tea, that's what I need. And to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the extensive questions. We've gathered a good amount of information. Based on what you’ve told me, the black stool could be related to the pain medication you are taking. However, given your age and family history, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I recommend we do a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. We may also need to consider a colonoscopy depending on the results of those tests. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Oh, for goodness sake. You’re going to shove a camera where?! Look, I suppose. If it's the only way to prove it’s the pills, then fine. But I want a very nice nurse. And I want to be completely sedated. I absolutely refuse to be awake for any of that. And I expect a full explanation of the results, in plain English, not all that medical jargon. And I want it done as quickly as possible. I have a garden to tend, you know. And I really, really need a cup of tea. And, honestly, this whole thing has been a dreadful waste of my afternoon. Let's just get it over with. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure all your requests are accommodated. We will schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible, and I assure you we’ll have a very nice nurse, and you will be completely sedated. I’ll also ensure a thorough explanation of the results in plain English. First, we'll start with the stool test. I’ll have the staff provide you with a collection kit, along with detailed instructions. Please bring the completed kit back to the lab as soon as possible. Once we have the results, we can discuss the need for a colonoscopy. In the meantime, let’s get you that cup of tea. Would you like anything else while we wait?
PATIENT: Just the tea, thank you. And make sure it's strong. I need something to calm my nerves. And please, hurry. The afternoon is slipping away. I really don’t have time for this. And, honestly, I’m starting to feel quite unwell. Just… get it done. Quickly. That’s all I ask. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. I'll have the nurse bring the tea right away. We’ll do everything as quickly and efficiently as possible. I’ll step out now and coordinate the lab test and the nurse. Please, make yourself comfortable and try to relax. We’ll get through this together.
