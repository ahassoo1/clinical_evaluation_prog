DOCTOR: Hi Rayshon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I… I keep coughing. A lot. And I feel very tired all the time. And my nose… it gets stuffy, like, always. I think I get it bad, sometimes. I dunno. It's been going on for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing, fatigue, and a consistently stuffy nose. “A while” is pretty broad – can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… rough estimate… Maybe… six months? Or maybe more? It's hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, but the coughing… that feels like it's always there, a little bit. And the tired… yeah, always tired. I just thought it was… work, you know? It’s a hard job, changing tires.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or more of coughing and fatigue, with a consistently stuffy nose. And you work changing tires, which is physically demanding. That’s helpful to know. Does anything specifically trigger the coughing, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger… uh… when it’s cold, maybe? Like, if the weather is cold, it gets worse. And… dust. Lots of dust at work, changing tires. That definitely makes it bad. And sometimes… at night, when I lie down. It’s worse then. I gotta… I gotta sit up, sometimes, to stop coughing.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather, dust exposure, and lying down seem to exacerbate the coughing. That’s good information. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: Fever…? I dunno about fever. I don't usually check. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but I think that’s just the weather. And… body aches… yeah, my body aches sometimes. But I think that’s from the work, lifting heavy tires all day. It’s hard work, Doctor. Really hard. I don’t know if that's the cough or the work… everything hurts, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand – it’s hard to separate things out when you're doing such physical labor. Okay, so no measured fever, some chills, and body aches that you attribute mostly to work. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or wheezing when you breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath…? Hmm… not really. I get… puffed, you know? After lifting tires. But that’s normal, right? From the hard work. Wheezing…? I don’t know what that sounds like. Is that… like a whistling sound? I dunno. I haven't heard anything like that. Maybe? I’m not sure. It's hard to tell. Everything feels… blocked up, sometimes. But not whistling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable shortness of breath at rest, and no wheezing that you're aware of. Just a feeling of congestion sometimes. Let's talk about other symptoms. Have you had any chest pain, or lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Sometimes, after coughing a lot, my chest feels… sore. Like I've been working too hard. But not pain. Weight…? I dunno. I haven't weighed myself in a while. Maybe a little? My wife says I haven't been eating as much. But I think that’s just because I’m so tired all the time. Don’t feel like eating when you’re tired, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some chest soreness after coughing, and potentially some weight loss, but you’re not sure. Your wife has noticed a decrease in your appetite. Now, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like asthma, allergies, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Uh… asthma… no. Never been told I have asthma. Allergies… I think I’m allergic to dust! But everyone is, right? From work. Diabetes… no. I don’t think so. I don't eat that much sugar. My wife makes me eat healthy. She worries about me. I dunno. No, I don’t think I have any… serious things. I just feel tired and cough a lot. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known asthma or diabetes, and you suspect a dust allergy. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? No. Never had surgery. Hospitalized…? No. Never been in the hospital. Just… bumps and bruises from work. Nothing serious. I try to be careful, but you know… tires are heavy. Sometimes you get hurt. But never anything that needed a hospital. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she has… some problems with her breathing. I think. When she gets old, she coughs a lot. And my father… he had a strong heart, I think. He worked very hard. But I don’t know… I don’t really know much about their medical stuff. We don't talk about it much. They live far away.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother has some breathing issues and your father was healthy and hardworking. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. I don't like smoking. Bad for you. My wife doesn't like it either. She'd kill me if I smoked. No, never. I drink… sometimes. A little beer with dinner. Not much. And I try to eat healthy, like I said. Mostly rice and fish. Sometimes chicken. My wife is a good cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don't smoke, drink alcohol occasionally, and eat a generally healthy diet. One last question about your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Uh… no. Not really. Sometimes I take… a painkiller, for my back, after work. Just when it’s really sore. Paracetamol, I think it's called. But not every day. And… sometimes my wife gives me some… herbal tea. For the cough. She says it's good for me. But that’s it. No regular pills or anything. Just painkillers sometimes, and herbal tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, paracetamol occasionally for back pain and herbal tea for your cough. Thank you, Rayshon. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Then I'll take a look at your throat. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to stop coughing. It’s very tiring. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart rate is a little fast, but regular. And I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, especially when you breathe out. That suggests some inflammation in your airways. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at your throat. Please open wide and say "Ahhh". Your throat looks a little red, but nothing too concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve heard, it sounds like you may be experiencing some bronchitis, possibly triggered by dust exposure at work. The wheezing and cough are consistent with that. We need to rule out other causes though. Do you have health insurance?
PATIENT: Bron… what-itis? Is that bad, Doctor? And… insurance? No. No insurance. I can’t afford it. Very expensive. I just pay as I go. Is it very expensive to fix? I need to work, you know. I can't afford to be sick for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, bronchitis is an inflammation of the airways in your lungs. It can be caused by a virus or by irritants like dust. It's usually not serious if treated promptly, but it can be uncomfortable and can linger if not addressed. We'll do our best to get you feeling better as quickly as possible. Since you don't have insurance, we’ll focus on the most affordable options. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia or any other lung issues. It's important to be sure. Do you know if there’s a community clinic nearby that offers affordable X-rays?
PATIENT: X-ray… I think… there's one. Down the road, near the market. But… I heard it’s very busy. Long waiting times. And I need to work… I can't be waiting all day. Is it very important, Doctor? Can’t we just… try medicine first? Maybe some strong cough syrup? My wife has some… very strong cough syrup. From when I had a cold last year.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the waiting time and needing to work. It's good you have some cough syrup at home. However, it's important to be thorough, especially given your symptoms and lack of insurance. An X-ray will help rule out anything more serious, like pneumonia, which requires different treatment. While cough syrup can help with the symptoms, it won’t address the underlying cause, and it could mask a more serious condition. Given your fatigue and ongoing cough, it's best to be cautious. If the wait time at the community clinic is excessive, we can discuss other options. Perhaps they have appointments available on certain days, or maybe there's a mobile X-ray service in the area. I'll also see if there are any financial assistance programs available to help cover the cost. For now, let’s start with a plan for symptomatic relief. I'm going to recommend an over-the-counter expectorant to help loosen the mucus in your lungs. And I suggest you continue resting, drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding dust exposure as much as possible. Are you able to wear a mask at work to minimize the dust?
PATIENT: Mask…? I have one… a blue one. But it’s… it’s not very good. Doesn’t stop all the dust. It gets dirty very quickly. I try to be careful, but it’s hard. Lots of dust when changing tires. Very hard to avoid. The expectorant… what does that do? Will it make me sleepy? I need to be awake for work, you know. I can't afford to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand. A basic blue mask is better than nothing, but it’s not ideal. If possible, we could look into getting you a more effective respirator. I can write a note recommending one, and perhaps the community clinic or a local safety store can help. An expectorant helps to thin and loosen the mucus in your lungs, making it easier to cough up. It shouldn't make you sleepy, but some people experience mild drowsiness as a side effect. If you do feel sleepy, please let me know, and we can explore other options. To recap, we’ll start with the expectorant, continue resting and drinking fluids, try to minimize dust exposure with a better mask, and schedule a chest X-ray at the community clinic when you have time. I'll also write you a note explaining your symptoms and recommending the respirator. Would you like me to also include a note for a few days of sick leave, just in case you're feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Sick leave…? That… that would be very helpful, Doctor. Very helpful. My boss… he doesn't like it when people take time off. Says it costs him money. But if you write a note… maybe he’ll understand. Yes, please. A note for a few days of sick leave, if possible. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I'll write a note for three days of sick leave, explaining your symptoms and the need for rest. I’ll also include the recommendation for the respirator and a brief explanation of why it’s important. Here you are. Please take these to your boss. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again. Very much. You’ve been very helpful. I hope… I hope I feel better soon. I need to work, you know. To support my family. But… thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshon. I understand, and I hope you feel better quickly too. If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve after a few days, please don’t hesitate to come back or seek medical attention. Take care, and get some rest. Goodbye.
