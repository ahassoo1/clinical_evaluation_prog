DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, the nurse just told me somethin' about my cholesterol bein' high. That's why I'm here, I reckon. Never had much trouble with numbers before, so I figured I’d best get it checked out. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: High cholesterol… yes. It can be, shall we say, less than ideal. It’s quite common as we get older, unfortunately. We’ll need to get a better understanding of what “high” means in your case, and then discuss what that implies. First, do you have any idea how high it was reported, or what the specific numbers were?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Numbers aren’t my strong suit, never have been. They just told me it was somethin’ I needed to talk to you about. I mostly just remember bein' a little surprised. I feel alright, you know? Still get around pretty good for eighty-eight. Do you have it written down somewhere?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Let me see… alright. Your total cholesterol is 285, your LDL is 190, HDL is 35, and triglycerides are 150. Those are elevated, Mr. Bohnett. Now, to understand why this is happening, and what we need to do, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – perhaps diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Those are big numbers, aren’t they? Let’s see… nothin’ major, not that I remember. Had a touch of arthritis in my knees for years, but that’s about it. My wife, bless her soul, she had a little bit of trouble with her blood pressure towards the end, but I haven't ever had problems with that. And no, never been told I had diabetes or anything like that. I was pretty active most of my life, workin’ as a supervisor, always on my feet. Though, I admit, I ain't been movin' around quite as much since she passed.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, and your wife had hypertension. And you've experienced a decrease in activity level. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Always been lucky that way, I suppose. Just the usual childhood things, like tonsils out when I was a little boy. But nothin' big, nothin' serious. Is this cholesterol thing somethin' I got from not movin' around enough, you think? I used to walk everywhere, but it’s just easier to stay put these days, if I’m bein' honest.
DOCTOR: Reduced activity can certainly contribute. It’s a complex issue, though. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family… my mother, she lived to be ninety-two, and she was always pretty healthy. My father… he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. But I don't really remember much about what it was, exactly. And my sister, she’s still livin’, but she’s out in California, and we don't talk much anymore. She always took better care of herself than I did, if that makes sense. Always watchin’ what she ate and exercisin'. I mostly just ate what was put in front of me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of heart trouble in your father. And you mentioned your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Well, now. That ain’t so fancy. Breakfast is usually just toast and coffee. Sometimes an egg if I’m feelin’ ambitious. Lunch… often a sandwich, ham and cheese, maybe some chips. And supper… depends. If I’m feelin’ up to it, I’ll cook somethin’ simple, like fish or chicken. Otherwise, I might just have a frozen dinner. I do enjoy a bit of ice cream now and then, if that matters. Don’t get much fruit or vegetables, I gotta admit. Old habits, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. My wife, she tried it once or twice when she was younger, but she didn’t care for it. And I don't drink alcohol either. Never really appealed to me. Always thought it was a bit of a waste of money, to be honest. And it just didn't seem worth the trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bohnett. So, no smoking, no alcohol, relatively inactive, diet could be improved… family history of heart trouble. Now, let’s take a look at you. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m happy to cooperate. I haven't had a good listenin’ to in… well, I don’t even remember when. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Nothing immediately concerning, but worth noting. Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated. Pulses are present and regular, but a bit diminished in your ankles. Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Everything seems relatively stable, but these findings, combined with your cholesterol levels, do warrant further investigation. We’ll need to run some additional tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Additional tests, you say? What kind of tests? Is it somethin’ serious, Doctor? I’m not afraid of a little poke or two, but I’d just like to know what we’re lookin’ at here. And what does this all mean? Is this gonna keep me from bein’ able to get around? I like my independence, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bohnett, let's not jump to conclusions. "Serious" is a strong word. Your cholesterol levels and blood pressure do increase your risk of cardiovascular disease, but we're catching this early, which is good. The tests I'm ordering are standard – a lipid panel to confirm your cholesterol levels, a complete blood count to check your overall health, and an EKG to evaluate your heart's electrical activity. We may also need to do a stress test, depending on the results of the EKG, just to see how your heart functions under exertion. These tests will help us determine if there’s any underlying cause for your elevated cholesterol and blood pressure, and whether you require medication or lifestyle changes. As for keeping you from your independence... that’s our goal – to maintain your independence. We’ll work with you to develop a plan to improve your health, and hopefully, allow you to continue doing the things you enjoy. It may involve dietary adjustments, increased physical activity, and potentially medication, but it doesn't necessarily mean a dramatic lifestyle overhaul. Does that sound a bit more reassuring?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that does sound a bit better, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin’ it all so clearly. And I understand, it’s good to know what we’re dealin’ with. Dietary adjustments and a bit more walkin’… I can probably manage that. Though, I might need a little help with the diet part. My cookin’ skills ain't exactly top-notch. So, what do I need to do next? And how long will it take to get these test results? Will the nurse give me instructions, or do I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: The nurse will give you the lab requisition and instructions for the EKG. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. I’m also going to provide you with a handout on heart-healthy eating and some resources for finding registered dietitians in the area. As for the EKG, you'll need to fast for at least six hours beforehand, and avoid caffeine and strenuous exercise. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Fast for six hours, no caffeine, talk to the nurse… I can manage that. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s good to know I’m in good hands. I suppose I’ll head over to the nurse’s station now. Thank you again, Doctor Nestingen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. We’ll do our best to take care of you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
