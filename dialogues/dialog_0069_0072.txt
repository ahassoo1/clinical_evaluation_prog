DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Andraca, nice to meet you too. Well, it's a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been… forgetting things. Not huge things, like, I remember who everyone is, but… little things. Like where I put my keys, or what I went into a room to get. It's been happening more and more lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this up – it’s much better to address these concerns early on. It's not embarrassing at all; memory issues can happen for many reasons, and we'll work together to figure out what’s going on. When you say “lately,” how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think… I’d say maybe the last six months or so? It was really gradual at first, just a few little slips here and there. But in the last couple of months, it's definitely gotten more noticeable. Like, I repeated myself to my friend just last week, twice in one conversation! It's things like that that are making me uneasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, with an increase in the last couple of months. That's helpful to know. And repeating yourself – can you give me an example of what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well, we were talking about a movie we both saw, and I asked her if she liked the main actor, then like five minutes later, I asked the exact same question again. She just looked at me funny. And it's not just her! It's happened with a couple of people now. It feels… frustrating, and a bit scary, if I’m honest. I’m usually very good with remembering details.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and it's perfectly valid to feel scared when you notice changes like this. Repeating questions, especially so soon after asking them, is certainly something we want to explore further. Besides forgetting things, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I’ve consciously noticed. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But honestly, with work being busy, I just figured it was that. My sleep's been okay, I think. And nothing else comes to mind, really. I haven't felt confused or anything like that, just… forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased tiredness, but attributing that to work. No confusion, just the forgetfulness. That’s good information. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and a broken wrist once, but nothing serious. I don't really have any ongoing health problems, and I haven't had to see a doctor much over the years. Just routine checkups, you know? I’m usually pretty healthy. I take a daily vitamin, that's about it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant past medical history. Just the tonsillectomy and the broken wrist. And a daily vitamin – is that a specific type, or just a general multivitamin?
PATIENT: Just a general multivitamin. Nothing fancy. One of those one-a-day kinds, mostly to make sure I'm getting enough… I don’t know, everything. It’s just a habit I got into a few years ago. I think my mom suggested it. I don’t really pay much attention to what’s in it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general multivitamin. And no other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the vitamin. And honestly, I've been a bit stressed at work lately, which probably isn’t helping. Long hours, a lot of pressure. But I don’t think that would make me forget things, would it? It just makes me tired.
DOCTOR: Stress can absolutely contribute to memory issues and fatigue, Ms. Heidenthal. It's a significant factor we'll consider. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer's or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My grandmother on my mother’s side… she did get quite confused towards the end of her life, but honestly, she was very old when that happened, so we just figured it was old age. My mom always said she wasn't really the same after she broke her hip. I don't think anyone else in the family had any real memory problems, no. It wasn’t really something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your maternal grandmother experienced confusion later in life, but it was attributed to age and a hip fracture. No other significant family history of memory issues that you're aware of. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I don’t drink at all, and I definitely don't smoke. Never have. And no drugs, of course. I’m very… moderate in everything, really. Mostly I just like to read and go for walks. Not much of a partier, if that’s what you’re asking!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Very moderate lifestyle. Now, just a couple more quick questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten pretty much everything! I sometimes get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I don't even usually need allergy medication for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just seasonal hay fever. And finally, are you currently experiencing any other health problems, such as headaches, vision changes, or problems with balance?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No headaches, my vision's fine, and my balance is good. I haven’t noticed anything else wrong at all, really. Just the forgetting. It's really just the forgetting things that's bothering me. I sometimes worry I’m going crazy! But I know that’s silly, right?
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be concerned, Ms. Heidenthal, and it’s good you’re bringing this up. It's always best to get these things checked out. Okay, so we've covered a lot of ground. Now I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything stands out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. I just hope it's nothing serious!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes, coordination, and memory. It won't take long. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is normal. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, let’s do a quick coordination test. Could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… Like that? It feels a bit weird closing my eyes.
DOCTOR: That’s good. A little bit off is not concerning at this point. Now, can you please follow my finger with your eyes, but keep your head still?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. I think so. Is this alright? I'm trying to keep my head still. It’s a bit strange doing this, honestly. I feel a little dizzy now.
DOCTOR: You're doing great. And it's perfectly normal to feel a little off with these tests, especially if you don't do them regularly. It's just to get a baseline. Okay, good. Eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, let's do a quick memory test. I'm going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me. Then, I'll ask you to recall them again in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best! I'm a little worried about this part, though.
DOCTOR: No need to worry. It’s a simple test. Okay, the three words are: apple, table, and penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Okay… apple, table, and… penny. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect! Now, we'll move on to the rest of the exam and then revisit those words in a few minutes. Your gait is steady, and your balance seems good. No noticeable problems there. Alright, let’s revisit those three words now. Can you tell me what they were?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… apple… and… oh dear. I can’t remember the other two. I know I heard them, but they just won’t come to me. Table… no, that doesn’t sound right. I'm so sorry! I'm really blanking on this. It’s just gone from my head.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Heidenthal. It's not unusual to have some difficulty recalling things, and this is just one small piece of the puzzle. It’s good that you repeated the first word correctly, but the difficulty recalling the others is something we’ll need to investigate further. Let me just take a look at your medical records to see if there's anything relevant here… I see you haven't had any recent blood work or imaging. And no prior history of neurological issues. Alright. Based on our conversation and the exam, I think it would be best to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory problems. We’ll also consider a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation if the blood tests are normal or inconclusive. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. I just want to know what's going on. I'd rather rule things out, and get some answers. Blood tests are fine. And a neurologist, if you think it's necessary. I just hope it’s nothing serious, like you said. Do you think it could be… you know… something like Alzheimer's?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re being proactive, Ms. Heidenthal. It's natural to be concerned about something serious, and I understand your question. Based on what we've discussed, it’s too early to say whether it’s something like Alzheimer's. There are many potential causes of memory problems, and we need to rule out other possibilities first, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even medication side effects. The blood tests will help us with that. And if those are normal, a neurologist can perform more specialized tests to assess your cognitive function and determine the underlying cause. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I'll also include a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. You can get these tests done at the lab just down the street. I'll give you a requisition form. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay mentally active, getting regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy diet. Do you have any questions about the tests or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Dr. Andraca. It’s a relief to have a plan, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I guess I'll go get these blood tests done. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll see you then. Take care, and try not to worry too much. .
