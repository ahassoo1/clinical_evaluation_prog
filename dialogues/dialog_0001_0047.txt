DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. It's... well, it's about gettin' some help for later on, ya know? My wife, she… she passed last year. And I'm thinkin' 'bout what happens if I need help someday. Someone told me I should look into insurance for… long-term care. That's what it was called, I think. I ain't real good with rememberin' names and stuff anymore.
DOCTOR: Long-term care, right. Look, everyone thinks about these things eventually. Though frankly, at your age, it's a bit… preemptive, isn't it?
PATIENT: Preemptive? Is that... bad? I just... I don't wanna be a bother to folks when I get older. My wife, she took care of everything. And now… well, now it's just me. I figured it was better to look into it before somethin' happens, ya know? Before I need help. I don't wanna be a problem.
DOCTOR: A "problem." Right. Well, look, Mr. Rover, people deal with things differently. It sounds like you're getting ahead of yourself. But fine. Let's get this over with. Do you have any existing long-term care insurance?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any. Like I said, my wife, she always handled the important stuff. I just… worked. I moved things, ya know? Freight, stock… whatever needed movin'. I wasn't much for paperwork or insurance. She said I'd just worry too much. So, no, I don’t have any. Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: It's... suboptimal, let's say. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… conditions? Uh… let me think. Doc, honestly, I get a little foggy on things. I got… my back acts up sometimes. From all the liftin', I guess. And my knees ain’t what they used to be. The doc back home gave me somethin’ for ‘em a while back, but I mostly just try to take it easy. I don’t know if that’s a… condition. I ain’t real sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: “Acts up.” Right. And how long have these… issues been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A long time. Probably… ten years, maybe more? The back started when I was still workin' steady. And the knees, they just kinda got worse over time. I didn't pay much attention to it then, ya know? Just figured it was part of gettin' older. I took some pain pills when it got real bad, but I try not to take 'em much anymore. They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had the flu pretty bad a couple winters ago. Doc said it was the worst he'd seen that year. And… oh! I used to get migraines sometimes, but they haven’t bothered me in… well, a long time. Years. Maybe five or six years. Mostly just the back and knees now. And gettin’ tired easy, I guess. But that could just be… old age. Is that enough? Am I tellin' ya everything I need to? I worry I'm forgettin’ somethin’.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Rover, you're not exactly a picture of robust health, are you?
PATIENT: Robust…? No, I guess not. I ain’t never been a fancy fella. Just a workin’ man. I mean, I used to be strong, could lift anything. But that was a long time ago. I just… want to be prepared. That’s all. So I don’t have to… bother nobody when I get too old to take care of myself. Is this insurance gonna help with that?
DOCTOR: It might. Look, the thing is, you’re… not an ideal candidate for long-term care insurance at this point. Your history… isn’t exactly reassuring. But we can explore some options, I suppose. What medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications… uh. Let me think. I got somethin' for my blood pressure, a little white pill. And somethin’ for my knees when they really bother me, but I don't take that often. It's… a yellow one, I think. Small. And sometimes I take somethin' for sleep, if I can't get to sleep. But that's just a couple times a month. I can't remember the names of 'em, Doc. I just take what the doc back home tells me to. I ain't real good with rememberin’ names, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies. Let me think real hard. I don’t think so. I never had a bad reaction to anythin’ the doc gave me. But… when I was a kid, I was always itchy when we went campin'. Maybe somethin' in the woods? But I don't know if that's a real allergy. I never went to a doctor about it. It just… itched. Does that count? I’m probably makin' this harder on you, aren't I?
DOCTOR: It does, and it doesn’t. Look, Mr. Rover, let’s just move on. Family history. Any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. Well, my mom, she had… I think it was the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that's what they called it. And my dad, he had a bad heart. He didn't live to be very old. And… my wife's side of the family… they had a lot of arthritis, I remember that. Lots of achin' joints. That's about all I can remember, Doc. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about health much. Is that enough? Am I still forgettin' somethin' important?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, sir. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she didn't like it. And I figured it wasn't a good habit. Always liked the clean air. Never smoked, never will. Always been a healthy man, 'cept for the back and knees, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover. Based on what you’ve told me… and frankly, it’s not much… you're not an ideal candidate for long-term care insurance. You have pre-existing conditions, a family history of chronic illness… it’s going to be very expensive, if you can even get coverage. I’m not going to sugarcoat it. I recommend you consult with a financial advisor to explore other options. And schedule a thorough physical exam with your primary care physician. That is my advice. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. So… there’s not much hope, is there? I just… I didn’t want to be a burden. I wanted to have a plan. Financial advisor… a thorough exam… I guess I understand. No, Doc. I don’t think I have any questions. Just… thank you for your time. I guess I’ll talk to my… to someone. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Rover. Next! .
