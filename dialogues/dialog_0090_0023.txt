DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. Like… here. It’s been happening for… maybe a week or so?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "sometimes," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s not like, bad pain. More like… a dull ache? It happens more when I move my arms a lot, I think. Like when I’m working on the roof. Not every day, though. Some days I don't feel it at all. It's just… strange. It's my chest, you know? A man shouldn’t have chest pain.
DOCTOR: Working on the roof… So, physical labor?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a roofer. It's… hard work. Lots of lifting, and stretching, and… you know. Being up high. My wife worries about me, but it’s how I make money. We have a family.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this pain ever radiated anywhere – down your arm, to your back, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. It stays right here. Not my arm, not my back. Just… here. It doesn’t feel like a muscle pain, exactly, but maybe it is? I don’t know. I just… it feels weird. Not like anything I've felt before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's go through some other things just to get a fuller picture. Do you have any shortness of breath with this pain, or at all, even when you're not experiencing the chest discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can breathe okay. Even when I'm working on the roof, I don’t have trouble catching my breath. It’s just the pain. Maybe a little tired after a long day, but that's normal, right? Being up and down all day…
DOCTOR: And have you had any other symptoms alongside this pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. No cough, no fever… no… I don’t think so. Maybe just a little worried. My wife keeps telling me to come see you, but I don’t like going to the doctor if I can help it. It probably isn't anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, any chest pain warrants investigation. It's good that your wife is encouraging you to get it checked out. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve never really been sick. Just… little colds sometimes. Never had to see a doctor before, not for anything serious. I eat okay, try to stay active… I don’t know. I guess I’m pretty healthy. I don’t take any medicine, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a hard one. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. Different things, I think. My mother… she had trouble with her stomach. My father… I don’t really remember. He passed when I was young. I don’t think anyone in my family had… chest problems, but I’m not sure. We didn’t talk much about that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: And how about social history?
PATIENT: Social history? You mean… like, do I go out a lot? Not really. I go to work, come home to my wife and kids. Sometimes we go to church. I don’t drink, and I don’t smoke. Never have. That’s… pretty much it. I'm a simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, one last thing for the history. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I can eat anything. My wife tries to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's a different problem. No, no allergies at all. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Can we get to finding out what’s wrong with my chest now? It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your chest wall. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Deep breath in… and out… Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles. Now, I'm going to feel your chest. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender… Hmm… mild tenderness to palpation over the pectoral muscles bilaterally, slightly more pronounced on the left side. No palpable masses. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and this brief exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing your chest pain. It could be musculoskeletal, meaning related to your muscles and chest wall, especially given your work as a roofer. However, chest pain should always be taken seriously.
PATIENT: Okay… that makes sense. Musculoskeletal… so, like… from working too hard? But you said it should be taken seriously… Does that mean it could be something bad? I don’t want anything bad. I have a family, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bulaong, I understand your concern. It could be simply muscle strain, as you said. But chest pain can also be a symptom of more serious conditions, such as cardiac issues or even pulmonary problems. It’s my job to rule those out. To do that, I recommend we order some basic blood work. A complete blood count and a metabolic panel will give us a good baseline. And, given your age and symptoms, I would also like to order an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work and… an EKG. That sounds… okay. If that’s what you think is best. I just… I want to know what’s wrong. And I want to be able to go back to work. My wife will be happy you’re doing this. She’s been worried sick. So… yeah. Let’s do the tests. Whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Good. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood for you, and we’ll get the EKG done right here in the office. It's a quick, painless procedure. While we're waiting for the results, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially lifting anything heavy. And if you experience any worsening of your pain – if it becomes more severe, radiates down your arm or to your jaw, or if you feel any shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No heavy lifting, and go to the ER if it gets worse. And you'll call me when the results are back? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's just… it’s scary, you know? My wife and kids need me.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That’s exactly what I’m here for. And I understand your concerns completely. We'll get to the bottom of this. My assistant will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and call you to discuss them. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. I’m just going to… wait for the results then. Thank you again for everything. I guess I'll just go sit in the waiting room.
DOCTOR: Alright. My assistant will let you know when she’s ready. Don't hesitate to let us know if anything changes. Take care, Mr. Bulaong. .
