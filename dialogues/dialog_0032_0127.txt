DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you are 25 years of age. May I ask what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s correct. Well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’re drooping. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, I think. It's starting to make things… troublesome.
DOCTOR: “Troublesome,” you say. Alright. Weakness and drooping eyelids… and this has been a gradual process over several months. Can you elaborate on the weakness, Mr. Schaust?
PATIENT: Yes, gradual is a good way to put it. It started with… well, I noticed it mostly when I was doing things around the house, things I normally wouldn’t even think about. Like, carrying groceries, or even just… lifting things. Now it's… it's hard to hold things for very long. My arms get tired quickly. And sometimes, I feel it in my legs too, though less often. It's not constant, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: So, weakness primarily in the arms, but you’ve also noted some weakness in the legs, intermittently. Do you find that this weakness is worse at certain times of the day, or after specific activities?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I think it’s worse later in the day, definitely. Like, by evening, I’m really struggling. And after I’ve been doing… physical things, obviously. But even just… concentrating for a long time makes it worse, if that makes any sense. It's strange. It’s not like a muscle ache, it’s just… fatigue. A deep fatigue.
DOCTOR: Fatigue worsened by concentration… interesting. And the eyelid drooping – have you noticed any double vision, or blurred vision at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. The vision itself is fine, I think. It’s just… they feel heavy, you know? And it makes me look… tired, I suppose. People have commented. No double vision, though. And no pain, or anything like that. Just… drooping. It's mostly noticeable at the end of the day, too, when I'm more tired. It's hard to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s… actually, yes. I have lost some weight, I think. Not a lot, but I’ve noticed my clothes are a bit looser. And my appetite… it’s been up and down. Some days I’m not hungry at all. It's not a deliberate thing, it just… isn't there. I haven't been tracking it, or anything, but I'd say I’m eating less than usual.
DOCTOR: Weight loss and fluctuating appetite… These are all things we need to investigate. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no… anything like that. I’m generally quite healthy, or was, anyway. It’s why this is so concerning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… hmm. My mother is… she’s fine, I think. A bit… anxious, maybe. My father… he passed away a few years ago. He had… heart problems, I believe. And my sister… she’s healthy too, as far as I know. No history of… anything like this, really. No muscle weakness, or drooping eyelids, or anything similar. It’s… it’s a bit worrying, to be honest. It feels like it’s coming out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: And do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I… I try to avoid medication if I can. I haven't needed anything, really. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no… anything like that. Just… nothing. I used to smoke, a little, when I was in university. But I stopped about two years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms—the progressive weakness, eyelid drooping, weight loss, fluctuating appetite—and your family history, I think we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'm going to start with a thorough physical examination, and then I'll order some blood work. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical examination and blood work. Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary. I just… I want to know what’s happening. It’s been worrying me a lot.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll follow me to the examination table. We’ll start with a neurological assessment—checking your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Then I'll examine your general condition—heart, lungs, and so on. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination.
PATIENT: Right. Yes, of course. Please, let me know if you need anything at all. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. I'm going to assess your pupils and eye movements. Just follow my finger with your eyes—don't strain yourself. “Good… good… follow it with your eyes.” “Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. Extraocular movements appear intact, but slightly limited in upward gaze. Will need to repeat this later for comparison.” “And now, I’d like you to smile for me. And frown. Good. Now, can you close your eyes tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can close them, Doctor. Though… it feels a little strained, if I’m honest. It's probably just tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Now, could you please stick your tongue out as far as you can?
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. It… it feels a little strange. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Please resist as I push down on your arms. Good. And now your legs. Push back against my hand. “Knees… good. Ankles… good. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are… 1+ bilaterally. Slightly diminished.” “Decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally. Possible weakness in upper extremities, but difficult to assess definitively at this time. Further testing required.”
PATIENT: Yes, I’m trying, Doctor. It… it feels a little harder than usual, if I’m honest. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like you to touch your nose with your finger. And then touch my finger with your finger. Repeat that a few times. “Finger-to-nose test reveals mild incoordination in both upper extremities. But it could be fatigue related. We'll need further investigation.” “Now, if you would please walk a few steps for me.”
PATIENT: Yes, I’m trying, Doctor. It feels… strange. It’s difficult to explain. My balance feels… off, I think. And my movements feel… clumsy. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on my initial examination, your symptoms—the progressive weakness, eyelid drooping, weight loss, fluctuating appetite, mild incoordination, and decreased reflexes—are concerning. I need to order some blood work to help determine the underlying cause. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin B12 level. Additionally, I want to check for specific antibodies and inflammatory markers. "I'll also order a creatine kinase level to assess muscle damage." “Please take this to the lab as soon as possible. They will need a sample of your blood. I will also need to arrange a referral for an MRI of the brain and spinal cord to rule out any structural abnormalities. I’m going to be frank with you, Mr. Schaust. Given your symptoms, we need to consider several possibilities. These tests will help us narrow down the diagnosis.” "Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An MRI… antibodies… I… I don’t understand. What possibilities are you considering, Doctor? Is it… is it something serious? What could be causing this? I've never felt like this before, and I’m quite frightened. Could you… could you explain it to me, in simpler terms? What am I facing?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, it's understandable that you're frightened. Let me explain as clearly as I can. Your symptoms—the weakness, the drooping eyelids, the weight loss—suggest a possible neuromuscular disorder. This means there's something affecting your muscles or the nerves that control them. There are several potential causes. It could be something relatively benign, such as a vitamin deficiency or thyroid problem. However, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, such as myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, or even a rare genetic muscle disease. The MRI will help us look for any structural problems in your brain and spinal cord. The blood tests will help us identify any antibodies, vitamin deficiencies, or inflammatory markers that may be contributing to your symptoms. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to be thorough. We’re not working with a definitive diagnosis yet, and the tests are crucial. I know it's a lot to take in. Do you have any specific questions about any of these possibilities, or would you like me to explain any of it in more detail?
PATIENT: Autoimmune… what does that mean exactly? Is my body… attacking itself? And what about the genetic muscle disease… is that something I would have been born with? Could it… could it get worse? And how long will it take to get the results of all these tests? I’m worried about… about not being able to work, about… about the future. Is there… is there anything I can do right now? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, let's address your concerns one by one. You are right to ask about autoimmune. Essentially, in an autoimmune disorder, your immune system—which normally protects you from infection—mistakenly attacks healthy tissues in your body. In the case of myasthenia gravis, it attacks the neuromuscular junction, disrupting the communication between your nerves and muscles, leading to weakness. Regarding genetic muscle diseases, some are present from birth, while others develop later in life due to genetic mutations. The tests will help determine if that’s a factor in your case. As for the future, it’s difficult to say definitively until we have the results of the tests. However, many neuromuscular disorders are manageable with treatment, such as medication, physical therapy, or lifestyle modifications. We will develop a personalized treatment plan based on your specific diagnosis. Regarding what you can do right now… it’s important to avoid strenuous activities that exacerbate your weakness. Try to get plenty of rest, maintain a healthy diet, and avoid stress as much as possible. I’m also going to write you a note to take to your employer explaining your condition. I understand this is a lot to process, Mr. Schaust. I will be here every step of the way to answer your questions and provide support. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as the test results are available to discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that helps. What kind of timeframe are we looking at for the results? Days? Weeks? And… is there anything I should be watching out for? Any specific symptoms that would warrant a call to the emergency room? I’m worried about… about it getting worse suddenly. And… I apologize for asking so many questions, but I’m just… scared.
DOCTOR: You are not apologizing for anything, Mr. Schaust. Your questions are entirely valid, and it’s important to be informed. Regarding the timeframe for the results, the blood work typically takes 2-3 business days to come back. The MRI, however, can take a bit longer—usually 5-7 business days, depending on the radiology department’s workload. I will personally follow up with you as soon as the results are available. Now, regarding symptoms that warrant a call to the emergency room… if you experience any difficulty breathing, swallowing, or speaking, you need to seek immediate medical attention. If your weakness suddenly worsens and affects your ability to move your arms or legs, or if you develop a fever or severe headache, you also need to go to the emergency room. These could indicate a serious complication. Otherwise, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. We are here to support you. I’ve written down the emergency contact numbers on this card for your reference. For now, try to rest and avoid strenuous activities. We will discuss the test results and develop a treatment plan once they are available. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for your time and… for being so patient with me. I appreciate it more than you know. I’ll… I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I hear back from the lab. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schaust. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best. .
