DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, I haven’t got all day, Doctor. It’s…well, I woke up this morning and I can’t hear properly in one ear. And my face feels… droopy, on that same side. It’s rather inconvenient, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Right. “Not hearing properly” and a “droopy face,” you say. Inconvenient, yes, I suppose it would be. Let’s try to be a bit more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I’m not a medical professional. It just feels droopy. Like…when you try to smile, one side doesn't go up as much. And the hearing…it’s just gone muffled. I didn’t bang my head or anything, if that’s what you’re thinking. It just happened. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be…difficult. “Happened” is not a diagnosis, Stephane. But we'll work with it. Tell me, when you say this morning… what time exactly did you notice these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Around 7:00 AM, I suppose. I always have my tea and read the news. That's when I realized something was off. The news sounded…distant, and then I looked in the mirror while brushing my teeth and noticed my mouth wasn't quite… symmetrical. Honestly, it was quite alarming. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we just going to dissect my morning routine?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Stephane, but a proper medical history requires details. And yes, your morning routine is relevant. It helps establish a timeframe. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, headache, or trouble with your vision at all this morning?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache… a little bit, now that you mention it. A sort of dull ache at the back of my head. But I get those sometimes. It's probably just stress. And my vision is perfectly fine, thank you very much. I was reading the newspaper, wasn’t I? If my vision was impaired, I wouldn’t be reading the newspaper. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am listening, Stephane. And I assure you, I'm quite capable. A little bit of a headache is relevant. Now, before we go any further, do you have any history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Family history… let me think. My mother had… I think she had something with her blood pressure, yes. High blood pressure. She was always a bit of a worrier, that woman. And my uncle, on my father's side… he had a stroke, a long time ago. That was quite tragic, actually. He never really recovered. Why do you need to know all of this? Is it serious? Because if it's anything like that stroke, I really don’t have time for a long recovery. I have…commitments.
DOCTOR: “History of hypertension and stroke in the family…” Right. It’s important information, Stephane. It helps us determine the potential cause of your symptoms. Now, do you currently take any medications, and do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t believe in filling my body with chemicals unnecessarily. A bit of herbal tea is all I need. And allergies…hmm. Dust, perhaps? I sneeze a bit sometimes. Nothing serious. I’m generally a very healthy person, despite…all of this. It’s probably just a virus. Is that possible? A really annoying virus that affects only one ear and half my face?
DOCTOR: A “really annoying virus” is…unlikely, Stephane. However, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I’m going to conduct a quick neurological exam, alright?
PATIENT: Neurological exam? Oh, for goodness sake. Must you? Look, I have a luncheon appointment. A very important luncheon. Can’t this be done quickly? I haven't got all day, Doctor. And please, be gentle. I do have a rather delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. As quickly as possible. First, let's take a look in your ears. Please open your mouth… and say "Ah." I need to examine your throat as well. Ears look clear, throat's a bit red, but nothing significant. Now, I'm going to have you close your eyes. I'm going to raise my eyebrows, and I want you to resist as I try to lower them. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Get it over with, then. Yes, I understand. Raise your eyebrows… Honestly, Doctor, I feel rather ridiculous. Is this really necessary? I assure you, I can raise my eyebrows perfectly well on my own. There! See? Perfectly strong. Can we please move on? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: It appears you have some weakness on the left side of your face, Stephane. Now, stick your tongue out as far as you can. And try to smile. Asymmetry is quite pronounced on the left side. Now, I want you to squeeze your eyes shut as tightly as you can, and don't let me pull them open.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is terribly undignified! There! As you can see, it’s…slightly crooked. Probably just stress, as I said. And now you want me to… No! Don't pull! . Honestly, I don’t understand why you’re putting me through all of this. Is this going to take much longer? My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. That’s enough for now. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, I’m concerned about the possibility of Bell’s palsy, though we can’t rule out other causes without further testing. It’s crucial you understand this requires further investigation. I need to order a blood test to check for other potential issues. And I strongly recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out a stroke. We need to act quickly to determine the cause of this and begin appropriate treatment.
PATIENT: An MRI? A blood test? Good heavens. All this for a bit of facial weakness and muffled hearing? Honestly, Doctor, I think you're overreacting. I told you, it's probably just a virus. Or stress. I have a very demanding schedule, you know. And an MRI… that takes hours, doesn't it? And the blood test… I detest needles. Look, I appreciate your concern, but I really don't think all of this is necessary. Perhaps a strong cup of tea and a good night's rest is all I need. I’m quite sure it will resolve on its own. Are you certain there's no other explanation? I have commitments, Doctor. Very important commitments.
DOCTOR: Stephane, with all due respect, dismissing these symptoms as “a bit of facial weakness” is irresponsible. While a virus is a possibility, it's one we need to rule out, not assume. Facial weakness and hearing loss can be signs of serious conditions, including stroke, which requires immediate intervention. I understand you have commitments, but your health is paramount. I strongly advise you proceed with the blood test and MRI. I’ve already put in the orders. The laboratory and radiology departments will contact you to schedule appointments. I will also give you a prescription for a course of prednisone, which can sometimes help with Bell’s palsy, should that be the diagnosis. If your symptoms worsen – increased weakness, difficulty speaking, severe headache, dizziness – you need to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
