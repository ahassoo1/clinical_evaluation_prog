DOCTOR: Hi Candice, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, I suppose it's just… a social visit, really. My husband and I recently relocated, and I believe one must establish a general practitioner. It's simply… proper. I haven’t much time, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Candice. Establishing care is a smart move, even without a specific concern. Just a check-up to get everything on record then?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A check-up. Though, I must say, I find all this…fuss…unnecessary. I’ve always been quite healthy, you know. My mother…well, never mind. Just get it over with, please. And do be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep things as streamlined as possible. To start, let's just go through a quick medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, medications, allergies – the usual. Then a brief physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A history? That sounds dreadfully tedious. I’ve lived a long life, young man. I doubt you have time to record it all. Allergies… let me think. I believe I once had a slight reaction to some sort of…flower. A very common thing, I assure you. Medications? Just a little something for my joints now and then. Really, I don't recall the name. It’s…white, I think? Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight reaction to a flower, and something white for your joints. We can certainly work with that. Do you know when you last took this medication for your joints?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. When? That’s…difficult. Perhaps a few weeks ago? Or was it months? Honestly, I can’t be certain. My husband handles most of those details. He has a much better memory for such things. Though, truthfully, he's been a bit forgetful himself lately. It’s a common ailment at our age, I presume.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Candice. We can try to get more details later if needed. Let’s move on to past illnesses and surgeries, if you can recall anything significant. Even something you think might be minor could be helpful.
PATIENT: Oh, illnesses…well, I had the flu, I suppose, a few times. As one does. And a rather nasty bout of…indigestion, years ago. Nothing serious, thankfully. Surgeries? Let me see… I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A very common procedure, back in my day. And…oh, yes! I had a small growth removed from my arm, many years ago. A simple thing, really. I don't recall the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils as a child and a growth removed from your arm. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family…are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family…hmm. My mother…she had a weak heart, I believe. Though, she lived to be a very respectable age, all things considered. My father was quite robust, actually. No real illnesses to speak of. Though, he did have a terrible temper. I don't believe that's hereditary, thankfully. Honestly, I'm not much for dwelling on family history. It's all rather depressing, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, how about this – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Certainly not. I find such habits…vulgar. My husband and I… we occasionally enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner. A very civilized custom, you understand. But smoking? Drugs? Absolutely not. We have always led a very…respectable life.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. If you could just sit back and relax...
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But do hurry, please. I have a luncheon engagement shortly. And please be gentle. My back isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… it’s rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick and gentle as I can, Candice. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. Your lungs are clear, but breathing seems slightly shallow. Now, let's check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, is it? Elevated, you say? That's probably just the…excitement of it all. I rarely visit doctors, you know. And shallow breathing? Well, I was carrying several heavy packages earlier. Honestly, I’m quite active for my age. Is that…is that all? May I get up now?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's slightly elevated. And as you said, likely related to activity or anxiety. Given your age and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to do a few simple blood tests just to get a baseline. We’ll check your cholesterol, kidney function, and a basic metabolic panel. It’s just a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests? Goodness gracious. Must we? I detest needles. And all that waiting for results… it sounds terribly inconvenient. Honestly, I’m quite sure I’m perfectly healthy. I haven’t the time for all this fuss. I suppose… I suppose I could allow a small sample. But do be quick about it, please. And make sure it’s a competent phlebotomist. I’ve heard horror stories.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. We’ll get it done as quickly and comfortably as possible. I’ll personally ensure a skilled phlebotomist draws the sample. It will only take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the lab results, I'd recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home. We can provide you with a device and instructions. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Oh, a device? More gadgets? Honestly, I’m overwhelmed as it is. No, thank you. I simply haven’t the inclination to monitor my blood pressure. I have a perfectly good schedule, you understand. And frankly, I trust my own judgment. If I feel unwell, I’ll simply…rest. That’s always worked in the past. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. Is there anything else? Because truly, I haven’t much time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. In that case, I’ll order the blood tests and we can discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, please try to maintain a healthy diet, get regular light exercise, and stay hydrated. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Though, honestly, I find all this…concern…a bit much. I’ve lived a long and fulfilling life, you understand. I’m quite sure I’ll be perfectly fine. Thank you for your time, young man. And do tell your phlebotomist to be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Candice. I’ll be sure to pass on your request. The lab results should be available in a few days, and my assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon.
PATIENT: Yes, well, thank you. I suppose I shall. Good day to you too.
