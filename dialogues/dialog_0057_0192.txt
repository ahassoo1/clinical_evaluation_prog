DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems like a waste of time, honestly, but you gotta do what you gotta do. It's August 2nd, right? Just making sure everyone's on the same page.
DOCTOR: Yes, today is August 2nd. I understand you're here for a medical examination required for the military. That's perfectly alright – we see these quite often. To make sure I have everything correct, is this a re-entry exam, or are you joining for the first time?
PATIENT: Joining for the first time. Never been in before. Though, my uncle Sven, he was a big shot in the… what's it called? The logistics corps? Something like that. Always bragging about it. Point is, I'm not some… second-hand soldier. This is all new to me. And frankly, I haven't got all day. What exactly are you checking for anyway?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. A first-time entry exam. It’s completely understandable to want to know what we’re looking for. The exam is fairly comprehensive, as you might expect. We need to assess your overall health to ensure you’re fit for duty and to establish a baseline for your medical history during your service. We'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature – do a physical exam of your heart, lungs, abdomen, and musculoskeletal system, and I’ll ask you a lot of questions about your medical background, any current medications, allergies, and family history. We’ll also likely need a urine sample and potentially some blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. I suppose it’s necessary. I don’t have any medications. Never needed 'em. And allergies… hmm. Dust bothers me a bit, sometimes. But who doesn’t sneeze at dust? Family history… my mother had… well, she had aches. Old age aches, mostly. Nothing serious. Look, are we gonna get on with this or just keep talking about aches? I’ve got things to do, you know. Assembly line doesn’t run itself.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's get started. Dust allergies are common, so we’ll make a note of that. And I understand your time is valuable. First, let's start with some basic information. I see here you’re 51 years old, and your height is 187 centimeters and weight is 53 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Accurate? Accurate is a strong word. I was 187 last I checked, maybe a couple centimeters off. And 53… yeah, that sounds about right. I’m… lean. Always been lean. Not much for putting on weight. Efficient, you could say. Don’t carry unnecessary baggage. Are you writing all this down? You better be. Don’t want any mistakes.
DOCTOR: I am documenting everything, Mr. Hartness. 185 centimeters and 53 kilograms noted. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What’s that even mean? I work. I build things. I eat. I sleep. No major complaints. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, I can't remember. Probably decades. Never needed to. I feel… functional. Is that good enough? Look, I'm not a delicate flower, if that's what you're asking. I’m a practical man. I need to know if there's a problem or not. Don’t want to waste time on… feelings.
DOCTOR: No, I completely understand. Functional is excellent, and it's good you haven't had any major health concerns. To clarify, have you experienced any recent changes in your energy levels, appetite, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. I get tired after work, naturally. Assembly line work is tiring, even if I am efficient. Appetite’s normal. I eat when I’m hungry. Sleep… sleep is sleep. I sleep until I’m not tired anymore. No fancy patterns. Look, are you looking for something specific? Are you expecting me to collapse or something? Because I assure you, I won't.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not expecting you to collapse, Mr. Hartness. These questions are just to help me get a complete picture of your health. Have you had any recent illnesses, even something minor like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Hmm. Last time I was truly sick… must have been… years ago. Maybe twenty years? A bad cold, I think. Nothing major. Just stayed home, drank some tea, and it went away. That’s all. I don’t sit around dwelling on sniffles. Pointless. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or just going through the motions? I’m starting to think this is all a waste of perfectly good time. And my time is valuable, you know. I build things. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cold about twenty years ago. We're getting there, Mr. Hartness. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Never. Absolutely not. Why would I be in a hospital? I build things! You don't get hospitalized for building things. I’ve never broken a bone, never had surgery, never even had a bad cut that needed stitches. I'm… resilient. A practical man doesn't go to hospitals. They're for… weak people. Look, are you seriously asking me this? It’s ridiculous. Next question.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental illness?
PATIENT: Family history… ugh. That’s… complicated. My father, he… worked. A lot. Didn't talk about health much. My mother, she had… aches, like I said. Old age aches. That’s all I really remember. Grandparents… they were gone before I was old enough to remember much. Some heart trouble, maybe, on my father’s side? Something about… a weak heart, I think. Honestly, they didn't exactly advertise their ailments. Practical people, you know. Didn’t want to burden anyone. Look, are you expecting me to recall every little detail about relatives I barely knew? It’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Some potential heart trouble on your father's side, and your mother had aches associated with age. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’ve taken in the past, even if it was just over-the-counter pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? I told you, I don’t take medications. Never needed 'em. Maybe some… aspirin, a long time ago, for a headache? But that was decades ago. A single pill. It barely counts. Look, are you writing all this down? Because it’s starting to sound like you're looking for something wrong. I assure you, there isn't anything wrong. I build things! I'm perfectly functional. This whole thing feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional aspirin in the past. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… I told you about the dust. It bothers me a bit. Other than that? No. Never had a problem. I eat everything. I don't go avoiding things. Practical people deal with things. It's not like I swell up or anything. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or just going in circles? I’m starting to think this is a complete waste of my time. And my time is valuable, you know. I'm a productive member of society. I build things. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. You mentioned a bit of dust allergy. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Drink… occasionally. A beer with dinner, maybe, on the weekend. Nothing excessive. I need a clear head for building things. Recreational drugs? Don’t even mention it. That’s… ridiculous. Practical people don’t waste their time with… that nonsense. Look, are you seriously asking me this? It’s insulting, frankly. Next question. And make it quick. I have things to do, you know. Important things. Things that contribute to society. Unlike… some people.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional alcohol consumption. Now, could you tell me a little about your occupation?
PATIENT: Occupation? I build things. Assembly line. Engines, mostly. Other machines. Important stuff. Things people need. I'm good at it. Precise. Efficient. Been doing it for… well, a long time. Years. It requires… focus. A steady hand. And a clear head. Look, are you writing this down? Because it’s not exactly a complicated story. I build things. That's what I do. And I'm good at it. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting close. Just a few more questions. Do you have any current complaints, like pain, fatigue, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Complaints? No. Absolutely not. I’m perfectly functional. A little tired after work, naturally. But that’s expected. It's assembly line work, you know. Requires effort. No aches, no pains, no shortness of breath. I’m… resilient. A practical man doesn’t sit around complaining. Look, are you sure you don’t need to check my… engine? Because I’m operating at peak efficiency. This whole thing is starting to feel… ridiculous. I'm perfectly fine. Next question. And make it quick. I have things to do. Important things. Things that contribute to society. Unlike… some people.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I appreciate you being so candid. It sounds like you’re very healthy and active. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to mention or any concerns you have that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Absolutely not. Look, I’m starting to think this was all a waste of time. I told you, I'm perfectly functional. Resilient. Efficient. A practical man doesn't have concerns. He builds things. He solves problems. He doesn't sit around dwelling on… hypothetical ailments. Honestly, I think you're looking for something that isn’t there. Are we finished yet? Can I go now? I have things to do. Important things. Things that contribute to society. Unlike… some people. This whole thing feels… insulting, frankly. Can we just get this over with? I need to get back to work. Next question. And make it quick. Or I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I understand your frustration. We can proceed with the physical exam, and if everything checks out, we can be done shortly. If you could please remove your shirt and shoes, and I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your abdomen, reflexes, and joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Quickly. I haven’t got all day. And be gentle. I need these hands for… building things. Don’t want to damage the machinery. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Just get it over with. I’m perfectly fine. Perfectly functional. You'll see. This is a waste of time. A complete waste of time. I build things. Important things. And now I'm standing here half-naked for… what exactly?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in... and out... Very good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, if you could lie back, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Go ahead. But be quick. And gentle. I told you. I need these internals for… things. Don’t want to mess anything up. This is… undignified. Absolutely undignified. Just get it over with. I’m perfectly functional. Perfectly fine. This whole thing is a complete waste of time. I build things. Important things. You’ll find nothing wrong. Absolutely nothing. Just hurry up. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Finally, I’ll just check your joints for range of motion and any signs of inflammation. Joints have full range of motion, no swelling or tenderness noted. Okay, Mr. Hartness. Everything appears normal. No significant findings during the physical exam. Now, I’ll need to collect a urine sample. There’s a cup in the bathroom.
PATIENT: Urine sample? Really? Is that necessary? I told you, I’m perfectly fine. Perfectly functional. You’re going to analyze my… fluids? This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I build things. Important things. This is… invasive. Fine. Just… fine. But hurry up. I haven't got all day. And I expect a full explanation of why you need this. It better be important. Absolutely important. This is a complete waste of my time. I build things. Important things. Important things. Now, where’s the bathroom? And hurry up. I’m perfectly functional. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: It’s just standard procedure, Mr. Hartness, to rule out any underlying issues. It's a quick test. I assure you. It won’t take long. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Take your time.
