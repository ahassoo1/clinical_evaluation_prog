DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It takes a long time, and it feels like it doesn’t all come out, if you understand. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with urination can be quite bothersome. So, it’s been about a month of experiencing this trouble with emptying your bladder – taking a long time and feeling incomplete?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A month, give or take a few days. It’s not every time, you know? Sometimes it’s fine, and sometimes it feels like I’m pushing for ages. And then it just… dribbles afterwards, a little. It’s embarrassing, really. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Yadao. And you shouldn’t be embarrassed at all – these things happen, and we’re here to figure out what’s going on. The dribbling afterwards is helpful information. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when it started… let me think. It wasn’t right after my birthday, that much I know. My birthday is in June. Maybe… July? Around the beginning of July, I think. We had a lot of rain that week, I remember that clearly. It just sort of crept up on me, it wasn't sudden. One day I noticed it took a bit longer, and then the next day a little longer still. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful. Around the beginning of July, gradually worsening… alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with this – things like increased frequency of urination, urgency – feeling like you have to go right away – or any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And no burning either. I do go a bit more often than I used to, I suppose. Not constantly, but I find myself thinking about it more throughout the day. It's not a sudden rush, more of a… a gentle reminder, if you know what I mean. Not urgent, just… frequent. I drink a fair bit of tea, you see. Perhaps that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of pain or burning. And yes, frequent urination, but not urgent... that's helpful. Tea is definitely a possibility, as it can have a diuretic effect. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or any problems with your kidneys or bladder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, my mother had high blood pressure, but I haven’t. The doctor always checked when I went for my yearly check-ups, and it was always fine. I had a gallbladder removed years ago, maybe twenty years ago now. Other than that… nothing major. I've had the usual aches and pains for someone my age, but nothing they ever needed to do anything about. I’m on Medicare, if that helps with records. They should have it all written down, shouldn’t they?
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare records are very helpful. Twenty years ago for gallbladder removal… alright. And no history of diabetes or kidney problems, that’s good. Just let me pull up your chart here… Ah, yes. Gallbladder removal in 2005. Routine check-ups, blood pressure consistently normal. No mention of any kidney issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or have you recently started any new ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, when it's dark. Nothing regularly. I try to eat a healthy diet, you see. My sister always said I had a cast-iron stomach, and I think she was right! I don't like taking pills unless I really have to. They always upset my stomach.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, just vitamin D occasionally, nothing else. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I used to help my mother with her garden, and she was allergic to so many things – roses, lilies, even some weeds! I seem to have inherited her green thumb, but not her sniffles. No, no allergies to anything that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, to get a clearer understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle examination of your lower abdomen. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. As long as it’s not too intrusive, I don't mind at all. I’ve always been a bit… stoic, you see. Not one to fuss over things. Just get on with it, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be wonderful. Okay, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen and gently press on it to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Your abdomen is soft, no noticeable tenderness. I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen, but nothing concerning at this stage. Bladder sounds normal. I'm going to ask you to cough, if you don’t mind. No significant change with coughing. It doesn't seem like there's any immediate cause for alarm.
PATIENT: Alright. Is it something serious, Doctor? I worry sometimes, you know. My brother always had trouble with his… waterworks, and it ended up being quite a difficult thing. He didn’t like talking about it, though. I don’t want it to be like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Yadao, especially with your brother's experience. It's good that you're being proactive about this. Based on the physical exam, it doesn’t seem to be anything immediately serious, but we need to do a little more investigating to get a clearer picture. The slight fullness I felt could be a number of things, and it’s important to rule out any potential causes. I'd like to order a urine analysis and a simple blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. We can also measure your post-void residual volume – that’s the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate – to see if you’re emptying your bladder completely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. A urine analysis, blood test, and… post-void residual volume… I'll need to remember that one! How will we do that? Will it be uncomfortable? I don't like needles very much, you see.
DOCTOR: No, the post-void residual volume test isn’t done with a needle. It’s a quick, non-invasive ultrasound of your bladder after you urinate. It’s completely painless. We'll just use a handheld device on your abdomen to get an image of your bladder. The blood test will require a small needle prick, but it’s very quick. We can draw the blood right here in the clinic. And the urine analysis is just a simple sample you can provide. The nurse will give you a cup and instructions. We’ll get these tests done today, and I'll review the results as soon as they come back. We can then discuss the findings and determine the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, actually. No needles for the bladder test is a relief. And a simple sample… I can manage that. The nurse will help, you say? Good. Alright, Doctor. Let's get it done. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I just want to be able to sleep through the night without having to get up all the time!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse, Elena, come in and assist you with the urine sample and blood draw. She’s very gentle and will explain everything thoroughly. We’ll get this sorted out, Ms. Yadao. Sleeping through the night is a very reasonable goal, and we’ll do our best to help you achieve that. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available. Elena! Could you please come in and assist Ms. Yadao with the urine sample and blood draw?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll try not to worry too much in the meantime. Elena, you say? I'll look forward to meeting her. .
