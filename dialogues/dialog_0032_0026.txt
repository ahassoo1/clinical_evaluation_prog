DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes and goes, but when it's here… honestly, I feel like I’ve been run over by a truck. My husband keeps saying I need to rest more, but honestly, I haven’t done that much differently.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, you say. And it’s not related to any significant change in your activity level?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I still do my bit around the house. A bit of gardening when the weather’s nice. It’s just… sudden. Like a switch. One minute I’m fine, the next I can barely lift a teacup. And my muscles… they ache something awful with it. It’s not like a strain, you understand. It’s inside.
DOCTOR: “Inside,” you say. Hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… well, it started last spring, I suppose. Maybe around… Easter? It comes and goes in waves, like the tide. Some weeks I barely notice it, others I’m stuck in a chair for days. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I see here your date of birth is… August 14th, 1944. And you're with Medicare, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. August fourteenth. And Medicare… yes, thank goodness for that. Old age isn’t cheap, you know. Though they don’t cover everything, naturally. It’s a… blessing, I suppose. Though sometimes I wish they’d just fix what’s wrong instead of sending me for a million tests.
DOCTOR: Well, we do try to be thorough. Now, aside from the tiredness and muscle aches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, symptoms… well, I get a bit breathless sometimes. Not like I’m ill, just… winded easily. And my hands, you’re right. They ache terribly in the cold. But I assumed that was just… old age. Everyone gets aches and pains, don’t they? Though this tiredness… this is different. It just takes the strength right out of me. It's frustrating, you know? I used to be so active.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I might feel a bit warm sometimes, but nothing… dramatic. And chills… not really. I get cold easily, as I said, but that's just because I'm… thin. Always have been. Night sweats… no, definitely not. I sleep quite soundly, actually, when I can sleep. Though I wake up feeling utterly exhausted.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a bit of glucosamine for my hands. The doctor suggested it a few years back. Doesn't do much, truthfully. And allergies… well, I think I was allergic to something when I was a child. Pollen, maybe? But I haven’t had a reaction in… decades. Honestly, I can’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. My husband probably knows more about it. He keeps track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Well, my mother lived to be quite old. Ninety-something, I think. She had a bit of trouble with her heart at the end, but otherwise, she was remarkably healthy. My father… he died young. A farming accident, it was. Nothing to do with… this. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, honestly. A few colds, the usual things. But nothing like this ongoing tiredness. It’s… worrying, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Could you please sit up straight on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. An examination. Honestly, I’ve had so many examinations in my life. They never seem to find anything. Still, if it makes you happy. Be gentle, dear. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Deep breath in… and out… again… Sounds a little diminished, but not concerning for her age. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. A bit on the lower side, but acceptable. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are… diminished, as expected. And finally, I'll just feel your abdomen. Soft, no tenderness noted. Everything seems… unremarkable, frankly.
PATIENT: Unremarkable, you say? That’s what they always say! But I feel terrible, dear. Absolutely dreadful. It's frustrating to be dismissed like this. I haven't come here for fun, you know. There must be something wrong. My tiredness isn't just… old age. It feels like there's no strength left in my body.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your frustration. However, as I stated, the physical exam was within normal limits for your age. We can, of course, run some blood tests to rule out certain possibilities. A complete blood count to check for anemia, a thyroid panel, and a basic metabolic panel would be prudent. These will help us identify if there's an underlying medical issue contributing to your fatigue. Would you like me to order those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Honestly, it's all so… tiresome. But… I suppose if you think it's necessary. Better to rule things out, I suppose, even if I doubt they'll find anything. Yes, alright. Order the tests. Just… please hurry. I can't keep living like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. I've ordered the blood tests. The lab technician will call you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest when you feel fatigued and maintaining a healthy diet. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… please, do try to find something. I feel like I'm wasting my time here, and it's… demoralizing. But thank you, dear. I suppose I'll just have to wait. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You're welcome, Ms. Oitker. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day. .
