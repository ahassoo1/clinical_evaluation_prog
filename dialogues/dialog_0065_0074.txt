DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's this blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, and my daughter, bless her heart, she told me I ought to get it checked. Don't like fussin' with doctors if I don't have to, but… well, she worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to address. Now, when you say "lately," can you tell me approximately how long has your blood pressure been reading higher than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It's been... maybe a couple of months now? I don't really keep track of things like that. It just felt different, you know? More tired than usual, little headaches sometimes. It ain't been terrible, but it ain't right either.
DOCTOR: "Different" is helpful, but vague. And headaches… can you describe those for me?
PATIENT: Well, they ain't the kind that knock you flat, Doctor. More like a pressure, right behind my eyes and in my forehead. Comes and goes. Usually in the afternoons, I think. And they don't last too long, maybe an hour or so. It's hard to say for sure, bein' ninety years old, things kinda… blur together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can appreciate that. Okay. And besides the headaches and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Not that I can recall, really. I still get up and bake every day, though my hands get tired quicker than they used to. I make pies mostly – apple, peach, blueberry… folks around here love my pies. But I haven't felt dizzy or had any trouble seein', or anything like that. Just… older. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: Feeling older is a symptom of getting older, Ms. Steines, but we need to rule out anything else contributing to your fatigue and headaches. Do you have any difficulty with shortness of breath, even with mild exertion, like walking around the house?
PATIENT: No, not really. I walk to the garden every day, pick a few berries, that sort of thing. Ain’t been winded or nothin'. I get a little slower, maybe, but that’s just age. I used to be able to climb up on the roof to fix the shingles, but… well, that was a long time ago. Don't do that anymore!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little. I figured it was just from standin' on my feet so much when I'm bakin'. My feet get kinda achy too, but I always just put it down to bein' old. I suppose that doesn't mean much.
DOCTOR: It could be related to your age, Ms. Steines, but it’s important to investigate. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, nothin' like that. Never been a sickly woman, truth be told. I had the flu a couple times, and a bad case of pneumonia when I was a girl, but other than that, pretty healthy. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a weak heart towards the end, but I never had trouble with mine. I do take a water pill, though. Doctor gave it to me years ago, for a little puffiness. Don’t even remember what it was for now.
DOCTOR: A water pill… do you happen to know the name of it, or approximately when the doctor prescribed it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, no, I don't. It was... a long time ago. Maybe fifteen, twenty years? The doctor at the time was Dr. Abernathy. He retired years ago, and I never really asked what the pill was for, I just took it like he said. Little white one, I think. Just take one every mornin'. I’m not good with rememberin’ names and things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been allergic to nothin’. I eat all kinds of things, and I can handle most plants just fine. My mother was a Cherokee herbalist, taught me a lot about what grows wild. Never had a problem with pollen or anything like that. I always felt like a good, strong, plain woman, built to last. But I reckon everyone gets a little creaky eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay. And before we proceed with a physical exam, let's quickly review your family history. Were any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or children – diagnosed with high blood pressure, heart disease, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, my mother… she lived to be ninety-five, bless her heart. She had a little trouble with her legs towards the end, and the doctor said somethin' about her circulation. But I don’t rightly recall what. My father… he died young, from a fever, when I was just a girl. Didn't know much about what folks died from back then. And my brother… he moved out west and I lost touch with him years ago. Never heard much about his health. I reckon that’s about all. We weren’t a family that talked much about sickness. Just dealt with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Lord no, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother always said they were bad for your lungs, and she was right about most things. I've always liked the smell of fresh-baked bread better than any smoke. No, never a smoker. Don’t you worry about that.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little glass of wine with supper sometimes. A small glass. My husband used to enjoy a little whiskey, but I never got much of a taste for it. It just… didn’t agree with me. Nothing more than that, I promise. Nothing that would bother anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Steines. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Then I’ll feel your abdomen and check your pulses. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get on with it. I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind. I've got pies to bake, you know. Let’s get this done, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lean back, please. I’m going to start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm… and try to breathe normally. 162 over 94. A bit elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe in and out slowly. Heart rate is regular, but I’m detecting a slight murmur. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but with diminished breath sounds at the bases. Okay. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and eyes…
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? What does that mean? My husband had a murmur, and he didn't live long. Don't tell me I'm gonna end up like him. Just hurry up, please. This is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Steines, please don’t worry. A murmur simply means there’s an extra sound when your heart beats. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, and it can have many different causes. We’ll need to investigate further to determine the cause of yours. Your ears are clear. No sign of infection. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I do see some mild clouding of the lenses, which is common for someone your age - that’s cataracts. It's not affecting your vision at the moment, but we can monitor it. Your throat is clear. No redness or swelling. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Pulses are weak, but present in all extremities. Alright, Ms. Steines. That’s all for the physical exam. I’m going to review your chart and discuss my findings with you in a moment.
PATIENT: Weak pulses… and tender… What's wrong with me, Doctor? I just want to bake pies. I don't want to be sick. You’re scaring me now. Tell me straight. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, I understand your anxiety, and I want to be as clear as possible. Your blood pressure is elevated, and the murmur I detected warrants further investigation. The tenderness in your abdomen and weak pulses are also concerning. Based on my initial assessment, I suspect several possibilities. It could be related to age-related changes in your cardiovascular system, but it could also be indicative of underlying heart disease, kidney issues, or even early signs of peripheral artery disease. I want to be upfront: these findings do require further evaluation to determine the exact cause. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a kidney function test. I also want to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like to order a vascular ultrasound to evaluate the blood flow in your legs. I know this is a lot of information, and it’s probably overwhelming. But it’s important to get a clear picture of what’s going on so we can develop the appropriate treatment plan. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Blood work… EKG… ultrasound… Lord. That sounds serious. My husband… he had all those tests too. And… and it didn't end well. I don't want tests. I just want to go home and bake pies. Can't you just give me somethin' for my blood pressure? A pill, like I used to take? Please. Don't send me to the hospital. I don't want to be poked and prodded. I just want to live out my days in peace. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, I understand your fear, and I want to assure you that I’m not trying to scare you. I know you’ve been through a lot, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I also have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Simply prescribing a pill without knowing the underlying cause of your elevated blood pressure could be dangerous. It could mask the symptoms of a more serious condition, and delay proper treatment. The tests I’ve ordered are relatively non-invasive. The blood work just involves a simple blood draw. The EKG is a painless procedure that involves placing electrodes on your chest. And the vascular ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of your blood vessels – it doesn't involve any radiation or injections. I'm not sending you to the hospital right now. I want you to have the tests done here, in the clinic. And I'll be with you every step of the way, to explain the results and discuss your options. I understand you're afraid, but please trust me when I say that these tests are necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. They will help us determine the best course of action to ensure you can continue to live a long and healthy life. I can call your daughter to explain everything if you would like. Would that help?
PATIENT: My daughter… yes, call her. She always knows what to do. Tell her… tell her I’m scared. And tell her to bring me my pie recipes, just in case. Fine. Do the tests. But hurry up, please. I don’t want to spend my last days in a doctor’s office. Just… just get it over with. And promise me… promise me you’ll tell me straight. No sugarcoating. I want to know the truth, no matter how bad it is.
DOCTOR: I promise you, Ms. Steines. I will be honest with you, every step of the way. I’ll explain the results in plain language, and we’ll discuss all of your options together. I’m calling your daughter now. Hello?
