DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely, and I’m a Family Medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To begin, could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's quite simple. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face… well, it feels droopy on one side. It’s rather unsettling, if you must know. I don’t have time for this, really. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I appreciate you coming in immediately. A sudden change in hearing coupled with facial drooping is concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when exactly you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: This morning, like I said. I woke up, went to say good morning to my housekeeper, and… nothing. Just silence on the left side. Then, when I looked in the mirror, I saw my face wasn't quite… symmetrical. It wasn’t gradual, it just was. I don't need a detailed timeline, doctor. It happened this morning. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, that is helpful. Thank you for clarifying. To be precise, can you recall approximately what time this morning you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: Goodness. Are you always going to ask about the exact time? It was… around 7:30, maybe 8:00 am. I had my tea, then went to find Maria. Honestly, I don't keep a log of when my hearing fails. Are you suspecting I'm making this up? Because I assure you, I am not. It's quite inconvenient, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nissenbaum, absolutely not. I apologize if my questions seem overly detailed; it’s simply standard procedure to establish a clear timeline when evaluating a sudden onset of neurological symptoms. We need to rule out certain possibilities. Could you describe the facial drooping in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… difficult to explain. The left side of my face doesn't move quite like the right. When I smile, it pulls up, but not as much. And my… my left eyelid seems to droop a little. It makes me look quite… uneven. I can't quite close it all the way either, which is rather irritating, frankly. Do you need me to demonstrate? It's rather undignified, but if it'll speed things along…
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you’re comfortable, a demonstration would be very helpful. Please don't feel any embarrassment; this is a clinical examination and essential to understanding what's happening. And then, if you could also try to raise your eyebrows and show me your teeth, that would be useful as well.
PATIENT: There. Are you satisfied? It's quite obvious, isn’t it? I feel like half my face is paralyzed. It’s terribly distracting. I have a board meeting this afternoon, you know. This is… problematic.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, I see what you mean. There is noticeable weakness on the left side of your face. To gather more information, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No headache, thankfully. No dizziness. My vision seems alright, although everything is a bit blurry now that I’m focusing on it. I haven’t felt any numbness or tingling anywhere. Oh, and my tea tasted perfectly normal, if that’s relevant. I did feel a little… off balance this morning, but that could just be from getting up too quickly. Honestly, doctor, I don’t have a list of ailments to report. Just the ear and the face. It's enough, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, that is helpful. The absence of other symptoms is important information. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Good heavens, no. I eat very healthily, and I’m quite active. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I don't eat sugar. And a stroke? No, never. My late husband, Harold, he had some heart trouble, but I’ve always been perfectly healthy. I go for annual check-ups, although my previous doctor retired last year, and I haven't found a replacement yet. Frankly, I prefer to avoid doctors when possible. Is this necessary, doctor? It's all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you, I will be as efficient as possible. Knowing your medical history, even if it’s limited, helps us rule out potential causes. Have you ever had any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgical procedures… Let me think. Harold always said I had the constitution of an ox. No, nothing major. I had my tonsils removed as a child, ages ago. And I had a mole removed from my back a few years ago, but it was a simple procedure. Nothing else. Honestly, I can't recall anything else of significance. Are we getting anywhere with this, doctor? Because I really must get going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nissenbaum, we are gathering information. Finally, I'd like to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had a stroke, facial paralysis, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… My mother had terrible migraines, always complaining of them. Harold's father had some memory problems in his later years, but they just said it was old age. Beyond that… No, I don’t believe so. We weren’t a particularly sickly family, if you must know. We had good genes, I suppose. Look, doctor, with all due respect, I’m not a medical encyclopedia. I’m telling you what I remember, but I can't recall every single ailment that ever affected my relatives. Is this really going to help diagnose my ear and face?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. Your family history is helpful, and the information you've provided is sufficient for now. Now, I’d like to perform a brief neurological examination to assess the function of your cranial nerves. This will involve testing your hearing, vision, facial movements, and reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Just get it over with quickly, please. I have a board meeting to attend, you know. And honestly, I find this whole process rather demeaning. But if it’s absolutely necessary, then proceed. Just be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’ll examine your ears with this instrument. This will help me rule out any underlying ear infection or structural abnormalities. …The ear canal appears clear, and the tympanic membrane is intact. There is no visible sign of infection or fluid buildup. Now, I’m going to test your hearing with a simple tuning fork. Please tell me when you can no longer hear the sound.
PATIENT: Nothing. I can't hear a thing. Absolutely nothing. It's just a buzzing sound, barely perceptible. As I said before, my left ear is completely silent. Don't waste any more time on that side, doctor. It’s a lost cause. Let's move on to the face. I have a meeting, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will now assess your facial movements. Please close your eyes tightly, and I will gently try to open them. …There is noticeable weakness on the left side. I can easily open your left eyelid with minimal resistance. Now, please smile broadly. …As you demonstrated earlier, the left side of your face does not move as fully or symmetrically as the right side. Now, please puff out your cheeks.
PATIENT: There. Are you satisfied? It's quite obvious, isn't it? The left side just won't… puff. And my eye keeps fluttering closed. It’s terribly irritating. Honestly, doctor, this is rather undignified. Can we please get to the bottom of this already? I haven’t got all day. Is it a stroke? That's what I'm afraid of. Harold… well, it wouldn’t be surprising. I feel a bit faint now, actually.
DOCTOR: Please remain calm, Ms. Nissenbaum. You are doing very well. Based on the neurological examination, your symptoms – the sudden onset of hearing loss on one side and facial weakness – are highly suggestive of Bell’s palsy. Bell’s palsy is a condition caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. It typically presents with a rapid onset of weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. It’s not a stroke, although it can sometimes mimic stroke symptoms. It’s important to rule out other potential causes, however. To do this, I would like to order a blood test to rule out any underlying infection, and I recommend a MRI to ensure there isn’t anything else causing this. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood tests? Good heavens. Is it serious? Will I be… disfigured? I have a very important board meeting tomorrow! And what about my appearance? This is… devastating. Harold always said I had a beautiful smile. Bell's… palsy? Is it contagious? I don’t want to infect anyone. What are the chances of recovery? And will this affect my cognitive abilities? I need to be sharp for my meeting. And what treatment is involved? Do I have to be hospitalized? I absolutely refuse to be hospitalized. I have commitments. Give me something… something to take. A pill, perhaps. Something that will fix this immediately. Now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Nissenbaum. Let me address them one by one. Bell's palsy is not contagious. It’s caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, not an infection. In most cases – around 80-90% – people with Bell’s palsy make a full recovery. The prognosis is generally very good, especially when treatment is started promptly. The recovery process can take weeks to months, and the extent of recovery varies from person to person. Regarding cognitive abilities, Bell’s palsy does not affect your brain function or cognitive abilities. It only affects the muscles of the face. The treatment for Bell’s palsy typically involves a course of oral corticosteroids – a type of anti-inflammatory medication – to reduce the swelling of the facial nerve. In some cases, antiviral medications are also prescribed. We can start you on a course of Prednisone immediately. I also recommend eye drops to keep your left eye moist, as you may have difficulty closing it completely, and a protective eye shield to prevent irritation overnight. While hospitalization is usually not necessary, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress and ensure there are no complications. Regarding the MRI, it is recommended to rule out other potential causes, such as a tumor or stroke, although based on my examination, those are less likely. It is a precaution. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Prednisone, you say? And eye drops? That sounds… tolerable. A pill is preferable to an MRI, certainly. I suppose I can agree to that. A week, you said? I’ll need a written prescription, of course. And the name of a good pharmacy nearby. I don’t have time to waste running around. And what about my meeting tomorrow? Will this medication make me drowsy? I need to be alert and focused. And will it have any side effects? I absolutely refuse to be incapacitated. I have important decisions to make. Now, doctor, let's get this over with. And please, no more talk of MRIs. I’m already quite distressed as it is.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concerns. I’m prescribing Prednisone 40mg, to be taken once daily for five days, then gradually tapered off over the next five days as instructed on the label. I will also write a prescription for artificial tears to be used as needed to keep your left eye moist. The common side effects of Prednisone include increased appetite, fluid retention, and mood changes. Some people may experience mild drowsiness, but it’s usually not severe. It's important to follow the instructions carefully and avoid alcohol while taking Prednisone. Regarding your meeting tomorrow, I recommend getting a good night’s sleep and staying hydrated. You may experience some mild fatigue, but it should not significantly impair your cognitive abilities. Here is a list of pharmacies near the clinic. I also recommend applying a warm compress to your left cheek several times a day to help relieve discomfort. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Just… try to remember I have a very important life, doctor. I don't have time for complications or unnecessary procedures. And if this medication doesn’t work… well, I’ll find another doctor. Thank you. Or, perhaps, more accurately, I hope you’ve been helpful. Goodbye.
