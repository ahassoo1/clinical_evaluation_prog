DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. It is… difficult to say exactly. Things… the words, they do not come as easy as before. It is frustrating, truly. I forget… what was I saying? Oh, yes. Finding words. That is why I am here, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty finding words, you say. And how long has this been… occurring?
PATIENT: Occurring… Yes, a good word. Let me think. It is… not recent. Not like yesterday, or even last week. It has been… months, I think. Maybe six? Or more? It comes and goes, you understand. Sometimes it is… worse than others. It is hard to pinpoint, honestly. I do not keep good track of such things.
DOCTOR: Months. Variable, you said. Alright. And is this difficulty with words… impacting your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. Quite a bit, actually. I work with… numbers and people's benefits. Compensation, you see. I must write reports, and speak with… clients. It is embarrassing when I… stumble. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, and… it feels disrespectful. It makes things take longer, and… I do not want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Compensation work. Requires… precision. And you said repeating yourself. Are there any other… changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me see. Sometimes, I feel… a little lost in conversations. Like I am not following, even when I am. And… my wife, she used to say I had a good memory for names. Now… I struggle. Not always, but… often enough to be worrying. She passed away last year, you see. So perhaps it is just… grief.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss of a spouse. Significant life event, certainly. And these difficulties… do you find they are worse at certain times of day?
PATIENT: Worse at times… yes, perhaps. In the evenings, I think. When I am tired. And if I am… stressed. Trying to remember something important, like a… a client's name, or a number… that is when it is most difficult. It is like the word is on the tip of my tongue, but I cannot quite grasp it. It is… unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… other than the… words? Let me think. No, not really. I sleep alright, I suppose. I eat… regularly. My appetite is not what it was, perhaps, but that is probably just… getting older. I do not feel unwell, you understand. No headaches, no dizziness. Just… this. The words. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s… difficult to say without a proper assessment. Now, have you had any recent medical evaluations, bloodwork, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Evaluations… bloodwork… Yes, my primary care doctor, she did some tests about three months ago. Just a general check-up. Everything came back… normal, she said. Cholesterol was a little high, but she put me on something for that. Nothing else, you understand. She didn’t seem concerned about… this. She said I was just stressed. But it’s not just stress, is it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Normal bloodwork, recent lipid panel… Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the cholesterol medication?
PATIENT: Medications… Yes, the cholesterol pills, of course. And… sometimes, when I cannot sleep, I take something over-the-counter. Just a small dose. Melatonin, I think it is called. And… occasionally, if my back aches, I take ibuprofen. But that is… infrequent. Really, that is all. I do not take many pills, Doctor. I prefer not to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen, melatonin, statin… Now, Mr. Gyamfi, given your age, normal bloodwork, and the intermittent nature of these symptoms, it could be a number of things. It's possible this is simply age-related cognitive changes, or potentially exacerbated by stress. However… given your report of difficulty finding words and your concern, I think we should proceed with a brief cognitive assessment to get a baseline. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: A… cognitive assessment? You mean… a test? What kind of test, Doctor? Will it be difficult? I am not good at tests. I worry I will just… fail, and then you will think it is something… serious.
DOCTOR: It is not a fail test, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s a simple series of questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory and cognitive function. We’ll be looking at things like recalling words, following directions, and basic calculations. It’s fairly straightforward, and it's standard practice when someone presents with these concerns. I assure you, it’s not meant to be stressful. And, if it does indicate a problem, we can discuss further options, including potential referral to a neurologist. Shall we proceed?
PATIENT: Proceed… yes. I suppose so. If it will help… to understand. Though, honestly, Doctor, I am a little frightened. A neurologist… that sounds… serious. Very well. Let us proceed. But please… be gentle. And explain everything clearly. I do not understand much medical jargon, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will keep it brief and explain as we go. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat three words for me. Listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Apple… table… penny. Yes, I believe I have them. Are those… correct? It is a little difficult to concentrate, Doctor. All this worry, you see.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I want you to count backwards from 100 by sevens.
PATIENT: One hundred… by sevens… Oh dear. Ninety-three… eighty-six… seventy-nine… Oh, this is… difficult. Seventy-two… Sixty-five… I… I am losing my place. I am sorry, Doctor. I cannot seem to… concentrate. It is slipping away.
DOCTOR: Alright. That is sufficient for now. We can stop there. Your performance was… sub-optimal. Given your history and these initial findings, I recommend a referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. She can conduct a more thorough evaluation and determine the underlying cause of your difficulties. I will have my staff schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist… more tests… Is it… something bad, Doctor? Is it… Alzheimer's? My mother… she had something like that. It was… terrible. Please, tell me… what do you think it is? Even if it is… not good. I would rather know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gyamfi, I understand your concern, and it is certainly reasonable to be worried. However, I cannot provide a definitive diagnosis based on this brief assessment. Jumping to conclusions would be irresponsible. It could be a number of things, including early cognitive decline, but it could also be caused by stress, medication side effects, or other underlying factors. That’s why a thorough evaluation by a specialist is crucial. Dr. Reed will conduct a comprehensive neurological examination and order appropriate tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. I strongly advise you to attend your appointment and follow her recommendations. Now, do you have any other questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No… I understand. A specialist… more tests. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose… that is all. I will… wait for the appointment. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will be in touch. .
