DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my water. It bothers me. A lot. It keeps…happening again and again. I don’t…I don’t really know what it is, exactly. Just…uncomfortable. And I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: “Happening again and again,” you say. Can you be more specific about what you mean by that, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specific? Well…it feels like I need to…go. A lot. And when I do…it burns. It’s…not a nice burn, Doctor. It has happened…oh, maybe three times now in the last few months? I’m not good with dates, you see. It just…keeps coming back. And I don't know why. Is that specific enough?
DOCTOR: Alright. Burning with urination, occurring intermittently over the last few months. And you say it feels like you need to go frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Frequent…oh, yes, very frequent. Especially at night. It wakes me up. It’s…disruptive. I have to get up, you see. Several times. It’s tiring. And then the burning…it's just…awful. Do you…do you know what it is? I don’t want it to happen anymore.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, particularly at night, accompanied by a burning sensation. We need to rule out a few things, Ms. Wease. First, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh…well, I don’t think so. I haven’t really…looked. I just…feel the burning. I haven’t paid attention to the…color. I’m sorry, Doctor. I don’t know. Is that bad? Should I be looking?
DOCTOR: It's alright. It's helpful to know. It can be indicative of certain things, but it's not always present. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever…chills… Oh, no, I don’t think so. No fever. Not that I’ve noticed. And no chills. My back…sometimes aches, but I’m an old woman, you see. It aches all the time. Is that what you mean? Just…old lady aches. It’s probably just my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or significant back pain beyond what you attribute to age. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history…well, I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I had a gallbladder taken out, years ago. And…and I was divorced, if that counts. I don’t…I don’t think I have anything serious. I try to stay healthy. No diabetes, I don’t think. No kidney problems, either. I haven’t been told about any. It was a long time ago, you see. I forget things. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A cholecystectomy… years ago. And no known diabetes or kidney issues. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no medications. I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. Never have. I try to avoid them. Just a little something for my arthritis sometimes, when it’s really bad. But nothing regularly. Not at all. I'm not a pill person, you see.
DOCTOR: No regular medications. Alright. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh…well, my grandson, he brought me some different teas last week. Herbal teas. He said they were good for me. I’ve been drinking those. Instead of my usual coffee, sometimes. Is that a change? I haven’t changed much else. I mostly eat the same things. Soup, mostly. It’s easy. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Herbal teas… potentially. We’ll consider that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had an allergy, you see. Maybe a little sniffle sometimes when the flowers bloom in the spring, but that’s just…the pollen. Nothing serious. No, I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. Not to pills or anything like that. I told you, I don't take pills. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical exam, Ms. Wease. And a urinalysis, of course. If you’ll just lie down there, we’ll start with abdominal palpation. Then I’ll listen to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh. A…a physical exam? Must I? It’s been a long time since I’ve had one of those. Very well. If you must, Doctor. But please be gentle. Old bones, you see. I hope this won’t take long.
DOCTOR: It won’t. Now, please lie flat. I’m checking for any tenderness. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s…a little uncomfortable, Doctor. Not pain, exactly. Just…sensitive. There, on the…lower part. On the right. It feels…full. Like something is…pressing. Is that normal? It's been like that for a little while. Maybe a week? I thought it was just…gas.
DOCTOR: Tenderness in the lower right quadrant. Auscultating…bowel sounds are present, though somewhat…hypoactive. Now, please sit up. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. We'll need a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. I'll send you to the lab immediately.
PATIENT: A…urinalysis? Oh dear. Must I give a sample now? I just…I don't like the idea of going in a cup, Doctor. And I had a lot of tea this morning! Will that affect it? Is it…serious? I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Yes, you need to provide a sample now. And yes, the tea could dilute the results, but it’s still necessary to rule out infection. It is standard procedure, Ms. Wease. The lab is just down the hall. They will provide you with a collection cup and instructions. It's not a pleasant experience, I grant you, but it’s essential for accurate diagnosis. Please go now. We will discuss the results when they are available.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A cup…of course. Old lady aches and a cup…what next? If it is an infection…will I be alright?
