DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Condray, it’s about time, really. My husband, bless his heart, has been encouraging me to look into this… medical marijuana. He says it might help with… things. I’m not entirely convinced, you understand, but he’s quite insistent. He says you’re the one to ask about getting a… permission slip, if you will.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment option, and you'd like to discuss whether it might be right for you and what the process of obtaining a recommendation would involve. That's perfectly alright. Before we dive into that, just to make sure I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit more about what “things” you’re hoping it will help with?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… the aches, Doctor. Old age, you know. Everything creaks. And the… the nerves. My husband says it helps him sleep, and frankly, I haven't had a proper night’s rest in months. It’s not debilitating, mind you. I manage. But it’s… tiresome. Really tiresome. I don’t need anything strong, understand. Just something to… take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aches and difficulty sleeping are the main concerns. And you’re looking for something to help manage those symptoms, not necessarily a strong medication. That’s good to know. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these aches?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… everywhere, Doctor. My knees, naturally. And my back, quite a bit. My hands ache terribly in the mornings. It's just… wear and tear, I suppose. I've always been active, you see. Gardening, mostly. And keeping up with the house. But now… it’s just there. A constant… bother. I’ve tried creams, you know. And those little heating pads. They help momentarily, but it always comes back. It's not like a sudden, sharp pain, understand. It’s just… persistent. A dull, nagging discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent, dull aches in your knees, back, and hands, worse in the mornings. And creams and heating pads provide only temporary relief. That helps me paint a clearer picture. Now, when you say it's been going on for a while… roughly how long have you been experiencing these aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years, Doctor. Years. It started gradually, you understand. A little twinge here, a little stiffness there. But it’s gotten progressively worse, of course. Perhaps… five years, at least. Maybe longer. It’s hard to say precisely. Old age has a way of blurring things, you know. It wasn’t sudden, like a fall or an injury. Just… a slow decline. And the sleep… the sleep deprivation has been… well, it’s been going on nearly as long. It's exhausting, I tell you. Exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, five years of progressive aches and sleep disturbances. I understand that’s a significant amount of time to deal with discomfort. To help me get a fuller understanding, could you tell me a bit about your other medical conditions, if any?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of the high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed with… a little pill, every morning. Nothing serious. And my cholesterol is a bit high, but again, the doctor put me on something for that. Otherwise… no. Nothing major. I've always been a very healthy woman, despite my aches and pains, you understand. I don’t believe in dwelling on things. And I certainly don’t believe in over-medicating. That’s why I’m hesitant about all of this, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both well-controlled with medication. That’s good to know. And I understand your hesitation regarding medical marijuana, especially given your preference to avoid over-medication. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides those for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. I take a calcium supplement, Doctor. For my bones, you understand. My husband is very insistent about that. And… occasionally, an over-the-counter pain reliever for particularly bad aches. Ibuprofen, usually. But not regularly. Just when I absolutely have to. And… that’s it, I believe. Nothing else. I try to stick to natural remedies whenever possible. Though, clearly, I'm considering a departure from that, at my husband's urging.
DOCTOR: Okay, calcium supplement and occasional ibuprofen. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never been one for allergies. I eat everything, you understand. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I’m a very… sturdy woman. A bit creaky, perhaps, but sturdy. I don’t believe in coddling myself, you understand. All those modern sensitivities… it’s all a bit much, frankly. No allergies to report, Doctor. None whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as arthritis, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Family history… let me see. My mother… she had a bit of heart trouble towards the end, you understand. But she lived to be eighty-seven, which is quite respectable. And my father… he was a strong, healthy man, until… well, until he passed, suddenly, of course. No arthritis, not that I recall. And no diabetes, either. Mostly just… old age, you understand. They weren’t ones for… fussing over their health, either. They just… persevered. A bit like me, really. Strong stock, you understand. Very strong stock. No significant family history of medical conditions to report, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal heart history and generally good family health. Thank you. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not! I find the habit utterly repulsive. My husband, bless his heart, smoked for a while, years ago, but he quit, thankfully. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. It’s dreadful for your health, you understand. And simply… uncouth. No, Doctor, I do not smoke, and I have never smoked. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A very small glass. Mostly on special occasions. I wouldn’t say I drink, you understand. It’s more… a social custom. And frankly, Doctor, it helps me relax. But I assure you, it’s not a regular habit. A small glass of wine, perhaps once a week, if that. Nothing excessive. Nothing to speak of, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, I’m quite active. I was even more so, before my aches and pains, of course. But I still spend a good deal of time in my garden. Weeding, planting, pruning… it keeps me busy. And I keep up with the house, you understand. Cleaning, cooking… the usual things. I don't sit around and mope, Doctor. I believe in keeping busy. Though, admittedly, it’s become a bit more… challenging lately. But I still do my best to maintain an active lifestyle. I walk around the garden every day, at least. And I enjoy a little light housework. It's good for the soul, you understand. Good for the soul.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. It sounds like you’ve always been a very active and independent woman. Now, let's talk about the aches themselves. To help me determine if medical marijuana might be a suitable option, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose so. I’m not terribly fond of being poked and prodded, you understand. But if it’s necessary… alright. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And please, don’t take too long. I have errands to run this afternoon. And I do believe my husband will be wondering where I am. Proceed, then. But gently, please. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Ranells. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, everything sounds clear and normal with your heart and lungs. Your knees have some tenderness to the touch, particularly on the inner side, and your range of motion is a little limited, but there's no significant swelling or redness. Your hands also show some tenderness in the joints, especially at the base of your thumbs, and your grip strength is slightly weaker than expected. I don't see any signs of significant inflammation or deformity.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a bit… uncomfortable, Doctor. As you can see, it’s the inner part that bothers me the most. And yes, my hands… they ache terribly in the mornings. Especially after gardening. It makes it difficult to… grip things, you understand. I used to be able to hold anything, but now… It’s not debilitating, mind you. But it’s… bothersome. Very bothersome. Are you quite finished now, Doctor? I really must be going soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Ranells, I’m finished with the exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing osteoarthritis in your knees and hands. This is a common condition, especially as we age, and it causes pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion in the affected joints. Now, regarding medical marijuana, it can be a helpful option for managing the pain and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis. It doesn’t cure the condition, but it can provide significant relief for some people. However, it’s important to be aware of the potential risks and side effects, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. Do you have any questions about osteoarthritis or medical marijuana at this point?
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? And side effects? Drowsiness? I have errands to run, Doctor! I can’t be drowsy! And dry mouth… that sounds simply dreadful. My husband mentioned something about… feeling different. Is that a side effect? I’m not sure I like the sound of this at all, Doctor. It all seems… rather unsettling. Will it affect my mind? Will I be able to… think clearly? I need to be sharp, you understand. I have a household to manage. And I certainly don’t want to feel… odd. Explain, Doctor. Please explain all of this. Carefully. And don’t use any… medical jargon. I want to understand. Truly understand. Before I even consider… feeling different.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Ranells. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to explain everything in detail. Osteoarthritis, simply put, is wear and tear on the joints. It happens over time, like the parts in a car wearing down. It causes pain and stiffness because the protective cushioning in your joints breaks down. Now, about medical marijuana. It won't make you "high" in the way you might think. The products we would consider for you contain very low levels of THC, which is the component that causes the euphoric effect. Instead, they contain higher levels of CBD, which has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties. As for the side effects you mentioned, drowsiness is possible, but it’s usually mild and temporary. We would start with a very low dose and gradually increase it if needed, so we can minimize that risk. Dry mouth is also a common side effect, but it can be easily managed by drinking plenty of water. As for feeling "different," some people experience a mild sense of relaxation or altered perception, but it’s not the same as being intoxicated. It won’t impair your thinking or judgment, especially at the low doses we would use. However, it’s important to be aware that it can interact with other medications you’re taking, so we need to review your medication list carefully. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hm. Low levels of THC… that’s somewhat reassuring. And CBD, you say? Anti-inflammatory… that sounds promising, I suppose. My husband has been reading all sorts of things about it. But interacting with my medication… that’s concerning. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, you know. And one for my cholesterol. And a calcium supplement, of course. Here. This is everything. Just in case. I wouldn’t want to… mix things up. And… what would this entail, exactly? If I were to… try it? Would I have to… smoke it? Because I absolutely refuse to smoke. Absolutely.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Ranells. Let me just confirm these… okay, losartan for blood pressure, atorvastatin for cholesterol, and calcium supplement. I’ll make a note of these to check for potential interactions. And you're right to ask about how it's administered. You absolutely would not have to smoke it. There are several other ways to take medical marijuana, such as oils, tinctures, capsules, and edibles. Oils and tinctures are placed under the tongue, capsules are swallowed like any other pill, and edibles are… well, they’re food products that contain a measured dose of marijuana. Most patients prefer oils or capsules, as they’re easy to use and provide a consistent dose. We would start with a very low dose of either of those, and gradually increase it if needed, under my careful supervision. The process would involve a consultation with me to determine if you’re a suitable candidate, a discussion of your medical history and medication list, and a recommendation for a specific product and dosage. If you decide to proceed, I would monitor your response and adjust the dosage as needed. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: No smoking… that’s good. Oils and capsules… that sounds… less unpleasant. And you would monitor me? Carefully? That’s… reassuring. I wouldn’t want to… experiment on my own. What sort of… effects could I expect? If everything goes smoothly, of course. Would it make me… sleepy? Or… giddy? I need to be able to function, Doctor. I have a garden to tend, you understand. And a household to manage. I can’t be… incapacitated. And… how much would all of this cost? I don’t want any surprises. My husband and I are… comfortable, but we’re not extravagant. Explain, Doctor. Carefully.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Ranells. Let's address your concerns one by one. If everything goes smoothly, the most common effects you might experience are relaxation, reduced pain, and improved sleep. Some patients also report a mild sense of euphoria, but it’s usually very subtle. As I mentioned, drowsiness is possible, but we would start with a very low dose and gradually increase it to minimize that risk. Giddiness is uncommon at the low doses we would use. The goal is to find a dosage that provides relief from your symptoms without causing any significant side effects. We would work together to find the right balance. Now, regarding the cost, it can vary depending on the product you choose and the dispensary you purchase it from. However, a typical month's supply of oil or capsules might cost between $150 and $300. The initial consultation with me would be $250, and any follow-up appointments would be $100 each. I understand that this is an investment, and I want to be transparent about the costs involved. I also want you to know that some dispensaries offer discounts for seniors or patients with chronic conditions. Would you like me to provide you with a list of reputable dispensaries in the area?
PATIENT: Hm. $250 for the consultation… and $100 for follow-ups. And $150 to $300 a month… It’s… not insignificant. But if it helps with the aches… and the sleep… My husband has been quite insistent. A list of dispensaries, you say? Yes, please. And… are they all… reputable? I wouldn’t want to end up in some… shady establishment. I expect a certain level of… decorum, you understand. And… knowledgeable staff. I don’t want to be sold some… inferior product. And… what’s the first step, if I were to… proceed? What paperwork would be involved? I have all my medical records, of course. But I wouldn’t want to miss anything. Explain, Doctor. Carefully.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Ranells. I understand your concerns about finding a reputable dispensary, and I would only recommend establishments that I trust. The dispensaries on my list are all licensed and regulated, and they have knowledgeable staff who can answer your questions and help you choose the right product. The first step, if you were to proceed, would be to complete a medical history questionnaire and provide me with your medical records. I would review your records carefully to determine if you’re a suitable candidate for medical marijuana. If I determine that it’s a good option for you, I would issue a recommendation, which would allow you to purchase marijuana from any licensed dispensary in the state. The paperwork is fairly straightforward, and I have staff who can assist you with the process. It will involve providing your name, address, date of birth, and medical history, as well as signing a consent form. We would also need to obtain your authorization to release your medical records from your primary care physician. I have all the necessary forms available in my office, or I can email them to you if that’s more convenient. Do you have any questions about the paperwork or the process?
PATIENT: Emailing the forms would be… preferable, yes. I dislike carrying too much paper. And I suppose I should notify my primary care physician. He’s a bit… old-fashioned, but I wouldn’t want to… surprise him. Very well, Doctor. Send me the forms. And the list of dispensaries. I’ll… consider everything. And if I decide to… proceed, I’ll be in touch. Thank you, Doctor Condray. You’ve been… most informative. And surprisingly patient. I appreciate your… thoroughness. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Ranells. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. I’ll have my staff email you the forms and dispensary list right away. Have a good day, and I hope to hear from you soon. .
