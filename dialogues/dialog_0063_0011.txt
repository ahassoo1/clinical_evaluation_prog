DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Armando Honcoop, that's me. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. I wanna make sure I can get somethin' done… a little touch-up, you understand. Need a paper sayin’ it’s alright. That's all. I do radio stuff, towers, that sort of thing. Important work. Don't have time for… complications.
DOCTOR: A “touch-up,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little… fixin’. It’s nothin’ serious, I assure you. More of a… personal matter. And I need to know if I'm even able to do it, health-wise. I don't recall any major problems, but… things slip your mind, you know? I’m 64, not a spring chicken. Just wanna be sure it won’t interfere with my work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, this is a medical consultation, not a… convenience store. I need specifics. What exactly is this “fixin’” you are referring to?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I don't see why I gotta spell everything out. It’s… cosmetic. I want somethin' done to my face. That’s it! Is that so hard to understand? I ain't lookin’ for a heart transplant, just a little… improvement. And frankly, I don't appreciate bein’ questioned like this. I pay good money for your time.
DOCTOR: "Good money," Mr. Honcoop?
PATIENT: Well, relatively good money! Look, I don’t have insurance, alright? So everything comes outta my pocket. I work hard for it, climbin' those towers and all. It ain’t cheap, and I’d like to know if I'm wastin' my time and money on this… examination if you're gonna make me jump through hoops just to get a simple clearance. It's a face thing, Doctor. That’s all you need to know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us attempt to ascertain if you are… physically capable of undergoing a cosmetic procedure. I require a basic medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease?
PATIENT: Hypertension… is that high blood pressure? I think… maybe? The doc at the quick clinic mentioned somethin' about watchin' my salt, years ago. That was a long time back, though. I mostly feel alright. Climbin’ those towers keeps me in shape, you know. Heart… no, never been told nothin' about my heart. Diabetes… definitely not. I don't eat that much sugar. Honestly, I don’t remember much beyond that. Old age, you know how it is. Everything gets… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: And any past surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago! And… oh! I broke my arm once, fallin’ off a ladder, but they just set it in a cast. No cuttin' or nothin'. That’s about it. Mostly bumps and bruises from the job. It's a dangerous line of work, you know. Always climbin’ around.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, Doctor, I don't keep up with all that. My mama… she lived a long time, but I don’t recall what she died of. My daddy… he worked in a factory, somethin’ with metal. I think he had… problems breathin’ towards the end. But beyond that… it's all a blur. We weren't one for keepin' detailed records, you understand. It was a different time. Now, are we gettin’ anywhere with this or what? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me see… Not that I know of. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that's probably just the dust. Dust is everywhere, climbin’ around on those towers. I don’t react to any medications, as far as I recall. Look, I ain't a delicate flower, alright? I’m a sturdy fella. I spend my days fixin’ things, not layin’ in bed with sniffles. This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Never been much for pills. I believe in good, honest work and fresh air. That's my medicine. A little bit of muscle rub for my back sometimes, but that's it. Nothing a doctor would need to know about. Honestly, Doctor, are we almost done here? I’m losin’ daylight. I got a tower to inspect before it gets too dark.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure... 140/90. Pulse… 72. Respiration… adequate. Let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly… muffled. Lungs… clear to auscultation, but reduced breath sounds bilaterally. Skin… appears normal, some age-related changes noted. And your weight is… quite low for your height. 52 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yeah, well… I stay active, alright? Keeps the weight off. Always climbin’. And I eat… reasonably. Look, what does this all mean? Am I cleared for this thing or not? I ain't a medical man, I just wanna know if I can get it done. Don’t need a lecture on my weight, just a yes or no. Time is money, Doctor. You understand that, right?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, your blood pressure is elevated. Your weight is significantly below the healthy range, and your reduced breath sounds are concerning. While I can’t definitively say you are unfit for a cosmetic procedure, I strongly advise against it at this time. I recommend a thorough evaluation by a cardiologist and a pulmonologist before even considering such a thing. Furthermore, I suggest a nutritional assessment. I will write you referrals. I also recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results of those evaluations. .
