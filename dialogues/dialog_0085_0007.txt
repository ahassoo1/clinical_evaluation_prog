DOCTOR: Good morning, Lakiya. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my back. It’s been quite painful, actually. I’d like to get it looked at if you don’t mind, and be quick about it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lakiya. We'll do our best to be efficient. Back pain can be really disruptive, so I understand wanting to get it sorted out. To start, can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a constant ache, mostly. But it gets sharp when I bend over. Or if I try to lift something, even something not very heavy. I work with fences, you see. Lots of bending, lifting, reaching… It started about three weeks ago, I think. Maybe a little longer. It hasn’t gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of constant ache with sharp pain on bending and lifting – that gives me a starting point. And working with fences explains a lot of potential strain. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s not… it doesn’t go around my back, not really. Mostly just right in this spot. And sometimes it feels… tight. Like a muscle is always knotted up.
DOCTOR: Alright, localized to the lower back with tightness. That’s helpful. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Right now? It’s not terrible. Maybe a… four? It’s always there, but it’s not excruciating. It’s when I move that it gets higher. Like when I was sitting down just now, it was maybe a two. But standing… four, I’d say. Definitely a four.
DOCTOR: Okay, a baseline of four, flaring up with movement. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yes. Sitting, mostly. And when I can lay down flat. Heat helps, too. A warm bath, or a heating pad. That eases it up for a little while. Not a cure, but it takes the edge off. I’ve been trying to take it easy, but… fences don’t build themselves, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll figure out a plan to get you back to work safely. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications, like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. The ibuprofen, mostly. Doesn’t seem to do much, honestly. I take it, and it maybe takes the very sharp edge off for an hour or so, but it’s back soon after. I don’t want to take too much, you know? Not good for the stomach.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, being mindful of your stomach. Alright, Lakiya, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back, if that’s alright with you. Just so I can get a better sense of what's going on. We'll check your range of motion, and I’ll gently feel around to see if I can pinpoint the source of the pain. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I just… I’d like it to be quick, if you don’t mind. I have other things I need to get to. But yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could lie face down for me, please. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness right here, at the base of your spine. And I noticed a little stiffness when you bent forward. Do you feel any pain radiating down your legs when you bend or sit?
PATIENT: No, thankfully no. It stays right in my back. Doesn’t go down my legs, or anywhere else. Just… right here. It feels… tight, even when you’re just touching it. Not a shooting pain, just… a constant pressure. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. That localized pain and tightness is good information. It sounds like a muscle strain is likely, potentially aggravated by your work. It's good it's not radiating down your legs, as that would suggest a different issue. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… some high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a pill for it, and it’s been fine ever since. Other than that, nothing major. Just… getting old, I suppose. And widowed, if that matters. My husband passed three years ago. But no health problems, besides the blood pressure. Medicare is my insurance.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lakiya. I'm sorry for your loss. And good to know about the blood pressure – that’s helpful for the overall picture. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the pill for the blood pressure. It’s… lisinopril, I think that’s the name of it. A small white pill. I take one every morning. That's it. I don't take anything else. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Okay, Lakiya, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a lumbar muscle strain. The good news is that these usually resolve with conservative treatment. I'm going to recommend a course of physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles, improve your posture, and prevent future injuries. I’ll also suggest continuing to use heat as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. No. Just… tired of being hurt, if that’s an allergy. But no to the pills, no to anything that I know of. Physical therapy… that sounds alright, I suppose. Will it be expensive? I’m on Medicare, and… well, I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: That's a fair concern, and I understand completely. Medicare typically covers a significant portion of physical therapy costs. We have a referral specialist right in the clinic, and our billing department can help you verify your coverage and estimate any out-of-pocket expenses before you start. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant – cyclobenzaprine – to help with the spasms, and a referral for physical therapy. We can start with a low dose of the muscle relaxant, 5mg at bedtime, and see how it goes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright. 5 milligrams… that doesn’t sound too bad. As long as it doesn’t make me too… sleepy. I need to be able to function, you know? Fences won’t build themselves. And thank you for helping me with the Medicare part. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lakiya. We’ll make sure you have all the information you need regarding your coverage. The cyclobenzaprine can cause some drowsiness, so I’d recommend starting with half a tablet at bedtime to see how you tolerate it. If that’s well-tolerated, you can increase to the full 5mg. And absolutely no driving or operating heavy machinery if you feel drowsy. I’m also going to give you a handout with some simple exercises you can start doing at home – gentle stretches and core strengthening exercises. These will complement the physical therapy. I’ll also write a short work note for your employer, explaining the limitations you may have. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. The handout and the work note are good. And the half-pill idea is smart. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I just want to get back to work, and not be in pain all the time. I think I’m ready to go, if you’re finished. Thank you, Doctor Lahn.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. I understand your desire to get back to work. Here's the prescription and the referral order, and this is the handout with the exercises. Please schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible, and don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. If the pain worsens, or you develop any new symptoms – like numbness or weakness in your legs – please call us immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Take care, and try to rest and be gentle with yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
