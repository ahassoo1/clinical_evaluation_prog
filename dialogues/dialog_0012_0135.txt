DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It is good to meet you as well. I am here because of… a problem with my ear. There is liquid coming from it. It started, hmm… maybe one week ago? It is not much, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid coming from your ear for about a week, that is good to check out. Not much, but enough to be concerning – I understand. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… clear liquid. Not blood, not… pus. Just clear. And it happens mostly when I… when I move my head a certain way. Or, perhaps, when I press on the area behind my ear. It does not hurt, exactly. More… a feeling of fullness. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that helps a lot, Gerhard. Clear liquid that comes out with movement or pressure, and a feeling of fullness… okay. It doesn't sound like it's terribly painful, which is good. Has there been any hearing loss or ringing in your ear at all with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think… No, I do not believe so. My hearing… it seems normal. And no ringing. I have not noticed anything like that. Although… now that you mention it… sometimes, very quiet sounds… they seem… distant. But I thought that was just because I am getting older. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It is definitely possible that's age-related, Gerhard. Hearing changes are common as we get older. But it’s good you mentioned it, and we should consider everything. Okay, so no pain, clear liquid with movement/pressure, feeling of fullness, and some slight distant hearing. Have you had any ear infections in the past, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. When I was a young boy, living in Somalia… I had many ear infections. Very common, the doctor told my mother. We did not have good medicine then. I do not remember much, but I think they were quite painful. After I came to this country, I did not have any more problems with my ears… until now. Is this important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Gerhard. A history of frequent ear infections, especially in childhood, can sometimes lead to issues later in life. Let me ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any other medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart trouble?
PATIENT: Yes, please ask. I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a small white pill every morning for it. And… sometimes my knees bother me. The doctor said it is arthritis. Nothing serious, but it makes walking difficult on cold days. I do not have… diabetes, I do not think. I had a blood test last year and everything was normal, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis in your knees. Good to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Yes. Besides the pill for my blood pressure… I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I do not get enough sun. Also, sometimes, when I cannot sleep, I take… something for sleep. It is a small, pink pill. I do not remember the name. My daughter buys it for me. It helps me rest. Is that… alright? I hope it is not a problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re telling me everything, Gerhard. It's important to know all the medications you're taking, even if they're occasional. We can look up the sleep aid later, don't worry. Alright, one last few quick questions about your history, then I'd like to take a look at your ear. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe so. I have never had a reaction to any medicine. My mother always said I was a strong boy! She gave me many things when I was small. Herbs, mostly. I do not remember any… allergies. But perhaps… a slight irritation with some perfumes. They make me… sneeze. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A slight irritation with perfumes isn't usually a major medical concern, Gerhard. That's good to know though. Okay, it sounds like we have a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your ear. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Please, look at my ear. I trust your judgment. I want to know what is causing this… liquid. It is worrying me. Please be gentle, though. It does not hurt, but… I do not like things in my ear.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Gerhard. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll just take a quick look and see what's going on. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. Okay… I see some mild redness in your ear canal, and a small amount of fluid is visible. The eardrum itself appears intact, which is good. There's a little bit of… some debris in the canal, it looks like. It could be old wax mixed with the fluid. It doesn’t look like there's a current infection, but we’ll want to rule a few things out. I think the next step would be to do a simple hearing test, just to get a baseline. Then, I'd like to gently clean out your ear canal to get a better look at the eardrum and rule out any other issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A hearing test and cleaning… that is good. I trust you. Please, do what you think is best. I want to be sure this is nothing serious. Is the cleaning… uncomfortable? I worry about pain, even if you say it will not hurt.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Gerhard. We'll take it very slowly, and I'll let you know what I'm doing every step of the way. The cleaning itself shouldn't be painful – it might feel a little strange, or like a slight pressure, but nothing more. If you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately and I’ll stop. Let's start with the hearing test. It's a simple test where you'll wear headphones and let me know when you hear a sound. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will try my best. I do not want to cause you any trouble. This hearing test… is it like when I was a boy in the army? Loud noises and ringing in my ears? I hope it is not like that. I still have trouble with my hearing sometimes from those days.
DOCTOR: No, Gerhard, this is nothing like the army tests. This will be very gentle, at low volumes. We're just checking to see if you can hear different tones, it’s not about loud noises at all. We’ll start very low and gradually increase the volume if needed, but we'll stop immediately if it's uncomfortable. Okay, let’s get started. I’m going to put these headphones on for you. Just relax and let me know when you hear a beep. Any beep at all, even a very faint one. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready, Doctor. Please, begin. I will listen carefully for the beep. But… do not worry if I cannot hear it. I am an old man, and my hearing is not what it used to be. Just tell me what to do. I will try my best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Gerhard. No pressure at all. We’ll work at your pace. And if you don’t hear anything, that’s perfectly fine, just let me know. Okay… do you hear anything now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not hear anything. It is… very quiet. Like the wind… far away. Perhaps I am just old. I apologize for wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Gerhard! That’s very helpful information. It just helps me get a better understanding. Okay, let's try this frequency. Focus and let me know if you hear a tone, even a faint one.
PATIENT: …Yes! Yes, I think I hear something now. Very faint… like a… a high-pitched whistle. Is that… good? I do not know what I am supposed to hear. I apologize, Doctor. I am not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That is good, Gerhard! That’s very good. It means your hearing is still present, we’re just testing to see how well you hear different frequencies. Okay, just keep listening and let me know if the tone gets louder or quieter. Don’t worry about being "good" or "bad" – we’re just gathering information. Alright… and how about now?
PATIENT: …It is still there, Doctor. A faint whistle… like the wind. It does not get much louder, even when you change… the machine. It stays the same. It is a… quiet whistle. I hope this is not too difficult for you. I do not want to cause you trouble.
DOCTOR: You're not causing any trouble at all, Gerhard, truly. You’re doing great. The hearing test is just giving me some baseline information, and it sounds like you have some degree of high-frequency hearing loss, which is very common as we age. Okay, let’s stop there for now. That gives me a good starting point. Now, if you’re comfortable, we can gently clean out your ear canal to get a better look at your eardrum. We’ll use a small bulb syringe and warm water. Sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. If you think it is best, please proceed. I trust your judgment. But… please be gentle. I do not like anything in my ear. A small bulb syringe… is that safe? I worry about damaging my eardrum.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gerhard. It’s perfectly natural to be cautious. The bulb syringe is very safe when used properly, and I will be extremely gentle. I will only use warm water and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort at all. I'm going to gently insert this into your ear canal, and then gently squeeze the bulb to rinse out any wax or debris. It might feel a little strange, or like a slight pressure. Okay… just relax and breathe normally. I’m going to gently squeeze now… how does that feel?
PATIENT: …It feels… wet, Doctor. And a little strange. Like water in my ear. Not painful… just… wet. I hear a slight… rushing sound. Is that normal? Please… be careful. I do not want to damage my ear.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Gerhard. The rushing sound is just the water rinsing through the ear canal. I’m just gently rinsing now… can you feel any discomfort at all?
PATIENT: …No, Doctor. Not pain. Just… wetness. And a slight… fullness. Like pressure in my ear. It is a little uncomfortable, but not… terrible. I can feel your… gentle touch. Please… continue, if you think it is best. But stop if it becomes painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Just a little fullness, that’s fine. I'm going to continue gently rinsing for a few more seconds, and then I’ll stop and take a look. Alright… that should be enough. I’m going to stop now. Just hold still for a moment. Okay… let’s take a look.
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I am ready. I hope you can see something. I worry about this… problem in my ear. I trust you will tell me the truth, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Okay… there. I can see your eardrum now. It appears intact, which is excellent. There's some mild redness, as we saw before, and a little bit of debris still present, but nothing alarming. It doesn’t look like there’s any sign of an infection. Based on what I’m seeing, and what you’ve told me, it sounds like you likely have a mild case of earwax buildup, combined with some slight inflammation. The clear liquid you’re experiencing is likely fluid from the ear canal due to the inflammation. It's not uncommon, especially with your history of ear infections as a child. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… makes sense. Earwax and inflammation… it is good to know it is not something… serious. A little wax and… swelling. I am relieved. So, what do we do about it? Will I need medicine? Or… surgery? I hope it is not surgery.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear you're feeling relieved, Gerhard. And no, definitely no surgery! For this, we can usually manage it with simple measures. I recommend using over-the-counter earwax removal drops for a few days, following the instructions on the bottle. That should help soften and loosen the wax. I’ll write you a prescription for some drops just to be safe. Also, I'm going to prescribe a mild topical steroid ear drop to help reduce the inflammation. Use that after you've used the earwax removal drops for a few days. I'll give you detailed instructions on how to use both drops. It’s important to follow those carefully. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Drops… and a follow-up appointment. I can manage that. I am good with following instructions. Please, write them down clearly for me, so I do not forget. And thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You have put my mind at ease. I was very worried about this… problem in my ear. You are very kind and… gentle.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. This outlines everything clearly – the earwax removal drops, the steroid drops, how often to use them, and potential side effects to watch out for. It also includes a contact number if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Just remember, if you experience any pain, fever, or significant hearing loss, contact us immediately. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. We’re here to help. Alright, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Yoshino. That is… everything. You have been very thorough and… kind. I truly appreciate your help. I believe I can manage the drops and… the follow-up appointment. Thank you again for… easing my worries. I will… see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. It was my pleasure. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. Goodbye.
