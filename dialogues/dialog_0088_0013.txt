DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you too. Well, it's... my water. I have trouble getting it all out when I go to the bathroom. It's been happenin' for a little while now, and it's startin' to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having difficulty completely emptying your bladder. And you said this has been going on for “a little while” – can you give me a sense of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe six, seven months ago? It wasn't too bad at first, just a little bit left behind, you know? But the last couple months it's been more and more. Sometimes it feels like there's a lot left in there.
DOCTOR: Alright, six to seven months… and it's progressively worsening. That’s helpful to know. And when you say “a lot,” can you describe that?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to say exactly. It’s not like a full bladder-full again, but… enough that it feels uncomfortable. And I gotta go back pretty soon after I just went. It's more frequent, I guess. I don't want to be botherin' you with this, but it's… it’s gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not bothering me at all. That's what I'm here for. Frequent trips and a feeling of incomplete emptying… okay. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burnin'. That ain’t happenin’. It just… doesn’t finish. It's kinda strange, really. Like somethin’s holdin’ it back. No hurtin’ though, thankfully. Just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning – that’s good. And you don’t have a fever, chills, or any back pain accompanying this, correct?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. No fever, no chills, and my back feels alright. Just the water thing. I’m feelin’ alright otherwise, mostly. I still go out fishin' when I can, keep myself busy.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the stream…? Hmm… let me think again. Not really. It's… well, it's just a stream, you know? It ain't weak or strong or anything. It seems pretty normal, just doesn’t all come out. I'm not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Okay. And have you ever had any trouble starting to urinate, or have you had to strain to get it going?
PATIENT: No, no trouble startin’. It comes when I need to go. And I don’t have to push or strain, nothin’ like that. It just… leaves somethin' behind. Like I said, it's just not emptyin' all the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of – like diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I don't think so. Not really. I used to have a little trouble with my blood pressure, but the doctor got it under control a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve always been pretty healthy. I eat fish a lot, you know? Good for you, they say. And I take Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, controlled blood pressure is good to know. And you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never been told I had diabetes. I go to the clinic for check-ups when they tell me to, but they haven’t said nothin’ about sugar or anythin’ like that. I drink a lot of water, too, try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, other than perhaps something for your blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: No, not right now. Not a single thing. Like I said, the doctor got my blood pressure under control a long time ago and I haven't needed any pills since. Just fish and water, mostly!
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat all sorts of things, try to. My wife used to make a really good salmon pie… but, well, she's gone now. I’m alright with food, though, no allergies.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your wife. And good to know about no allergies. Now, let's move on to your past surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or surgeries?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s been a while now. As for surgeries… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a long, long time ago. Other than that… no, I haven't had any operations. Just the appendix, when I was maybe ten or twelve years old.
DOCTOR: Okay, just an appendectomy. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My momma had trouble with her kidneys when she got older, but I don't know much about it. My daddy was pretty healthy, lived to be a good age. I don’t really know about other folks, didn’t see them much. We lived pretty far out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with kidney trouble, father healthy…And finally, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Well, I grew up in a small village out on the coast. I used to fish a lot with my dad, then with my wife. Now I mostly do it by myself. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I live alone now, but I have some friends I see from time to time. Just keep busy, you know? It helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and you live alone. Alright, Mr. Hilber, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your abdomen and I may do a quick neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that's alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, okay? I ain't as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… well, it's kinda strange. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… a little pressure. Like when you push on a full belly, maybe. Nothing too bad. Like you said, just pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m not finding any tenderness, and no masses. Reflexes are normal. Now, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the post-void residual volume will tell us how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, I think so. A test to see how much water is left in there after I go… and another test to see if I got any… uh… bugs or somethin’ in the water? That sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. Will I need to bring a sample with me, or will you get it here?
DOCTOR: You'll provide a urine sample here in the office. I'll give you a cup and instructions. The post-void residual volume test is done after you urinate - a nurse will use a special machine to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It’s quick and painless. We’ll get those results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you increase your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water a day, and try to avoid caffeine and alcohol. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, eight glasses of water is no problem. I already drink a lot of water, so that won't be hard. And I don't drink much caffeine or alcohol anyway. Thank you, Doctor. That all sounds good. When should I expect to hear back about the tests?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Hilber. Our office will call you within three to five business days with the results. If we find anything concerning, we'll discuss a treatment plan, which may involve medication or a referral to a urologist. If the results are normal, we can discuss some lifestyle modifications to help improve your bladder emptying. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I don't think so. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me, Doctor. I’ve been worried about this for a while now, and it's good to finally get it checked out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I’m glad I could help. If anything changes or gets worse before we hear back from the lab, please don't hesitate to call the office. A nurse can advise you. Here are the instructions for the urine sample, and the nurse will be in shortly to assist with the post-void residual volume test. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
