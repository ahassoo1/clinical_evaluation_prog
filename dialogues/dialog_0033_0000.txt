DOCTOR: Right. Sharifa Firestone, 44 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my legs. They just…gave out. Not completely, you understand. More like jelly. It started a few days after I got over a really nasty cold. Just weakness, really. But it’s both legs, and it’s… inconvenient, to say the least. I had to practically crawl to the car this morning. It’s not something a woman my age should be dealing with, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Jelly,” you say. And it started after a cold. Right. I see. And when you say “gave out,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, I just told you. They feel weak. Like I’ve been running a marathon and haven't had water. It's…difficult to explain. They just don’t hold me up properly. I was walking down the hallway, and I felt like I was going to fall. I had to grab the wall. It's not a dramatic collapse, but it's not normal. I don’t understand why a perfectly healthy woman would suddenly have weak legs after a little cold. It's… concerning, wouldn't you say?
DOCTOR: Concerning is…subjective. And a "little cold" can sometimes have lingering effects. Right. So, the weakness is in both legs equally?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose. It feels equal. I haven’t exactly been doing a weightlifting competition with them to measure, you know? But yes, it’s both. It's not like one is perfectly fine and the other is useless. They both just…lack power. Honestly, I’ve always been quite active, and to feel this…fragile is rather upsetting. And it's both legs, so it’s not some silly pulled muscle. It must be something more serious, don't you think?
DOCTOR: "Must be" is a strong word, Ms. Firestone. Let’s try to be methodical. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Just…weakness. Like I said, they don’t feel right. They feel like… noodles. I can feel them, I can move them, but they aren’t strong. It’s not like pins and needles or anything. Honestly, if it were just tingling, I wouldn’t be wasting your time. This is… debilitating. I’m a tour guide, Doctor! I need to be on my feet! It’s rather inconvenient, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Right. Tour guide. And no numbness or tingling. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about… that? Honestly, Doctor, I didn’t come here for a full examination of my entire system! I came about my legs. But… no. Everything is… normal, as far as that goes. I haven’t noticed any… changes. Really, I just want to know why my legs are so weak. It’s not like I’m ancient or anything. It’s just… unusual. And frustrating. Do you think it could be something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, everything could be serious. It’s my job to rule things out. Now, let's move on. Any fever or other symptoms accompanying the cold?
PATIENT: Honestly, yes, a terrible fever. Chills, body aches, the whole thing. I was absolutely miserable. It lasted about four days, maybe five. I had to cancel a whole tour group! It was quite a nuisance. I took some over-the-counter medicine, you know, the usual things. Helped a little, but it was still awful. And now this weakness. It's just… one thing after another, isn't it? I really just want to be able to walk without feeling like I’m going to fall over. It’s simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a significant fever with your cold. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want me to stand? After I’ve just told you my legs are weak? Honestly, Doctor. Fine. But don't be surprised if I wobble. I'm telling you, it’s not a pleasant experience. And please, be careful. I don't want to fall and cause a scene. It's rather undignified, you know? There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please just stand still. Can you close your eyes?
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to make me fall? I already told you my legs are weak! I’m trusting you here. Fine. But if I go down, it’s on your head. Don't say I didn’t warn you. Honestly, this is rather nerve-wracking.
DOCTOR: Okay, open your eyes. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly capable woman, and you’re making me feel like an invalid! But fine. See? I can walk. It's not graceful, perhaps, but I can do it. Honestly, this isn't telling you anything you don't already know. My legs are weak! It’s obvious!
DOCTOR: Alright. Stop. Now, sit back down. Your reflexes seem normal, but your strength is diminished. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Perhaps a Vitamin D deficiency or something similar. We'll also need to consider the possibility of post-viral weakness. It's not uncommon after a significant illness.
PATIENT: Post-viral weakness? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds terribly vague. So, you're telling me I could just be… weak for no reason? After a cold? That’s hardly a diagnosis, is it? And blood work? More poking and prodding. Fine. Do what you must. But I expect a proper explanation, and I expect it soon. I have tours to run, you know. I can’t spend all day in here getting tested for vague possibilities. And frankly, I'd appreciate a little more… reassurance. It's rather unsettling to be told I might just be… weak.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration. We're running tests to rule things out, not to simply tell you you’re weak. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. I’ll also print out a referral for physical therapy. It may help to strengthen your legs, regardless of the underlying cause. It will take a few days to get the results back. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Physical therapy? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not some frail old woman who needs to be babied back to health! But… fine. I suppose it can't hurt. A referral is a referral. Well, I suppose that's something. But I still expect a proper explanation when those results come back. And I expect it to be thorough. I don't want to be dismissed with vague terms like "post-viral weakness." I’m a tour guide, Doctor, not a… a convalescent! Very well. I suppose I’ll be going then. I sincerely hope this solves the problem quickly. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. .
