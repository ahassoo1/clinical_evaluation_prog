DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me – in as concise a manner as possible – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. My breathing… it makes a whistling sound. Especially when I walk fast. It feels… tight in my chest then, too. It’s been happening for maybe… a week now, I think? I’m not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: A week, you say. Yes, well. “Whistling,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, a whistling. Like a… a small bird, maybe? But inside my chest. It’s not painful, not exactly. More… worrying. And it makes me tired quicker. I used to be able to walk much further. I work with the athletes, you see. Need to be strong.
DOCTOR: Athletes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am an athletic trainer. I help them with their stretching and… making sure they don’t hurt themselves. Mostly high school students. I show them how to wrap their ankles and… things like that. But this breathing… it makes it harder to watch them, you know? I need my breath to tell them what to do. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's not get carried away. It could be many things. Do you smoke, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. My husband, he smoked… a long time ago. But I always told him no. It is not good for the body. I try to be very careful with my health. I eat good food, and I walk… or, I used to walk more.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I don't think so. I had a penicillin shot when I was a little girl… a very long time ago. But I don’t remember having a reaction. Maybe a little bit of a fever, but… I'm not sure if that was the shot, or just a cold. I don’t take much medicine now, thankfully. Just some vitamins.
DOCTOR: And what vitamins are those, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the usual ones, Doctor. One for my bones, calcium, I think. And one with… the colors, you know? Like a rainbow. For energy. My daughter buys them for me. She says they are good. I forget the names, though. Everything is so confusing now!
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on. Have you had any chest pain, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not pain, exactly. Like I said, it’s tight. A squeezing feeling, sometimes. But not painful. It’s more… uncomfortable. And it happens when I breathe in deeply, or when I hurry. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. It's not like a sharp pain, if that helps. More like… someone is holding my chest a little too tight.
DOCTOR: And any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My father, he was… not very strong. He had trouble walking when he got older. But he didn’t go to the doctor much. We didn’t have good doctors where I grew up. He just… slowed down. I don’t think it was his heart, though. Maybe his legs? My mother, she was very healthy. Lived to be a very old age. She walked every day. So… I don’t really know, Doctor. It’s hard to say. We didn't talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a listen to your lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I trust your judgment. Please, do what you need to do. I hope you can find out what is wrong. It worries me to be out of breath. It’s hard to help the young athletes when I cannot breathe properly.
DOCTOR: If you’ll just sit here, and take a deep breath when I ask. Hmm. There is some… wheezing. And a slight… diminished breath sound on the lower lobes. Do you cough at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sometimes. Mostly in the mornings, when I first wake up. It’s not a bad cough, not usually. Just a little tickle in my throat. But lately, it’s been… deeper. More… rumbling, maybe? I thought it was just a cold, but it hasn't gone away. And when I lie down flat, it feels worse. Like something is… stuck in my chest. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. I don't want to bother you with too many details.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s a good question. Now that you mention it… my feet do feel a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just from standing too long at the school. But maybe it’s something else? I wear comfortable shoes, but they still… swell a little. Not terribly, but I notice it. My daughter says I should elevate my legs more often. Is that bad, Doctor? Is that a sign of something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. We'll need to get a chest X-ray and some blood work done. Just to rule things out. And I’m going to refer you to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist – for a proper evaluation. They will be able to give you a more definitive answer. It could be a number of things – bronchitis, mild asthma, or something else entirely. We need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… like a lot, Doctor. A specialist? And tests? I was hoping it was just something simple. I don't like going to too many doctors. It makes me nervous. But… if you think it’s best, I trust your judgment. Will the tests… hurt? And what will the specialist do? I hope they are gentle. I’m just worried about being… poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is painless, Mrs. Kilton. It’s just a quick picture. The blood work will involve a small needle prick – a little discomfort, but nothing to be alarmed about. The pulmonologist will likely ask you a lot of questions, and perhaps perform a breathing test – you’ll just be blowing into a tube. They’re professionals – they won't “poke and prod” unnecessarily. I am ordering these tests to ensure we have a clear understanding of what is happening, and to get you the appropriate treatment. Here is the referral. The office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A breathing test. I can do that, I suppose. Blowing into a tube. That doesn’t sound too bad. And the office will call? I don’t need to do anything myself? That’s good. My daughter is good at making appointments, maybe she can help if I get confused. Hmm… I think… no. No, I don't think so. Just… please tell me it’s not something too serious, Doctor. I need to be strong for the athletes. They depend on me. And I don't want to be sick for too long. Thank you for your help, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: We will have a better understanding once we have the test results. I’ve ordered everything necessary to get you a diagnosis. Try to rest, Mrs. Kilton. And please, call my office if your symptoms worsen significantly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will try to rest. And I will call if things get worse. Thank you again for your kindness. I hope the tests don’t take too long. .
