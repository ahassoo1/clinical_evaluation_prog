DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family… we’ve had some trouble with headaches over the years. It’s all a bit fuzzy, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright if things are a little fuzzy. We’ll take our time. So, weakness and headaches… can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. It's not constant, you see? It comes and goes. Mostly on one side, I think… the left side? Or maybe the right? Oh dear. It just feels… heavy, sometimes. Like I can't lift my arm as easily, or my leg feels like it's dragging a little. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. Just… episodes, my daughter called them. And they don’t last too long, usually. A few hours, maybe? It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, episodes of weakness, primarily on one side – you’re not certain which, and lasting a few hours. And you mentioned headaches. Can you describe those headaches for me?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… those are different for everyone in the family, I think. Mine… they’re not the sharpest pain, not like a stabbing thing. More of a… dull ache, across my forehead, sometimes behind my eyes. They can get pretty bad, though. Make me feel a little sick to my stomach, sometimes. And bright lights bother me when I have one. But honestly, Doctor, it’s hard to remember what each one felt like… they all sort of blend together after a while. My sister, now she had terrible migraines… but that was years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, dull ache across the forehead, sometimes behind the eyes, can cause nausea, and worsened by bright lights. And you said your sister had migraines. Do you know if anyone else in your family experienced similar headaches to yours?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother… she had them, too. And my son, he gets them sometimes, although he says they’re different than what I have. He says his feel like a throbbing, right behind his temples. He takes something for them, I can’t remember what it was called… a little white pill, maybe? And my husband… well, he always just said he had a “stress headache.” He was a very practical man, my husband. Didn’t bother much with doctors. It’s all a bit of a family affair, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of headaches – your mother and son experiencing them as well. Let’s switch gears a little. Aside from the weakness and headaches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. Well, sometimes when I get these headaches, I feel a little… confused, maybe? Like I can't quite find the right words. And I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that could just be getting up too fast, you know? I’m 83, Doctor, things don’t work quite like they used to. I don’t think there’s anything else… not that I can recall, anyway. It’s all so muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, confusion and dizziness sometimes accompanying the headaches. Now, do you have any past medical conditions that you know of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, I've been on pills for it ever since. And… arthritis, in my hands and knees. It's just a little achey-ness, really. Nothing too serious. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… oh dear, I’m probably forgetting something. My daughter always reminds me of everything. I really wish I could remember better. I used to have such a good memory!
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure managed with medication, arthritis, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, here we are. Besides the blood pressure pill… I take something for my arthritis, a little white one. And…oh, yes! A vitamin D. The doctor said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take something for that. Just a half a pill, usually. It helps me rest. Does that make sense? I hope I'm not confusing you.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Tofani. You’re not confusing me at all. So, let’s recap: blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, vitamin D, and a sleep aid as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never really had any trouble with allergies. A little bit of a sniffle sometimes in the springtime, but nothing serious. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, never had a reaction. My mother always said I had an iron stomach! I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but if I suddenly start swelling up, I’ll be sure to let you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to check your reflexes and strength. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’ve always gone to doctors when they told me to. Go right ahead, dear. I'm a bit nervous, but I know you're just trying to help.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal and lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Strength is a little diminished on the left side, 4/5, compared to the right side which is 5/5. Reflexes are normal. I’m also going to check your gait and balance. Your gait is a little unsteady and you seem to have some difficulty with balance. Okay, Ms. Tofani, I've completed the exam. The diminished strength on your left side and unsteady gait are something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I've been feeling a bit off lately, but I just thought it was my age. My daughter will be so worried. Is it my weakness acting up again?
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ms. Tofani. The symptoms you’re describing – the weakness, headaches, confusion, and the findings on the exam – could be a number of things. Given your family history and the recent changes you’ve noticed, I want to rule out a few possibilities. I see you’ve had routine check-ups in the past, but it looks like the last brain scan was several years ago. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain to get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll also need to do some blood tests to check for any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, an MRI… That sounds… complicated. Is it painful? And blood tests… I always bruise so easily. My daughter always says I worry too much. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, I suppose I can do it. But please, don't do anything too… drastic. Just try to find out what's going on, so I can get back to my normal life. And please explain everything to my daughter. She's much better at understanding these things than I am.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Tofani. An MRI is painless, it uses magnets and radio waves to create a detailed image of your brain. You'll lie still on a table inside a large machine, and it can take about 30-60 minutes. The blood tests are routine, and we'll take precautions to minimize bruising. I'm thinking this could be a transient ischemic attack , sometimes called a "mini-stroke," or something else entirely. The MRI and blood tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I'll order these tests immediately. The lab will contact your daughter to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them thoroughly and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend that your daughter drive you home today. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as sudden severe headache, difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or vision changes – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a “mini-stroke”? That sounds… frightening. Yes, I think I understand. My daughter driving me home is a good idea. And… the emergency room if things get worse. I’ll try to remember that. It’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. My family… we always worry so much. Will the tests take long? And… what if it is something serious? Please, just tell me what to expect. And please, be kind to my daughter. She's been so worried about me lately.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Tofani. We’re taking these tests to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and the sooner we have the results, the sooner we can start any necessary treatment. The lab should be able to schedule the tests within the next few days. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. If it is a TIA, it’s important to address it quickly to prevent a full stroke. But remember, it could be something else entirely, and we won't know for sure until we have the results. I will personally explain everything to your daughter, and we’ll work together to create a plan that’s best for you. I'm going to write a referral for a neurologist to follow up with you after we have the results of these tests. They specialize in conditions affecting the brain and nervous system. For now, try to relax and focus on taking care of yourself. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office or go to the emergency room. And I assure you, I will be as kind to your daughter as possible. She's doing a wonderful job taking care of you. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… that sounds… serious. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s nothing too bad. And thank you for being so kind. My daughter will be here any minute. She’ll want to hear everything, too. Thank you again, Doctor Cumper. You’ve put my mind at ease… a little. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Tofani. Please let your daughter know I’m here if she has any questions. I hope you both have a safe trip home, and we’ll talk soon.
