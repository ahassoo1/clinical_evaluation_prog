DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Billman. Well, it's… it's a bit difficult to explain. I've been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’ve been drooping. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I’d say. Not suddenly, but… gradually.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… it makes me look quite tired, I suppose. And it’s starting to affect things. I work in facilities management, so there’s a fair amount of… getting around and seeing things, you know? It's becoming more difficult to do my job efficiently. Is that… is that making sense?
DOCTOR: Facilities management… so physical work, some visual attention required. And you say it’s been gradual, over months. Any other symptoms along with the weakness and drooping eyelids?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. I suppose I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, but I chalked that up to… well, life. I am divorced, Doctor. That takes it out of a person. But nothing specific… no pain, no dizziness, no… nothing else that stands out, if that’s what you mean?
DOCTOR: Divorced… figures. Alright. And you haven’t noticed any double vision, blurred vision, or trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing… no, not really. My vision… now that you mention it, sometimes things seem a little… less sharp, perhaps? But I wear glasses, so I just assumed it was my prescription needing adjustment. I haven't specifically noticed double vision, no. Is that… something I should be looking for? I'm not sure I understand.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, it's just routine questions. Less sharp vision… could be anything. Do you have any family history of… well, anything like this?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a good question. My mother, she had… something with her muscles, I think. It wasn’t… crippling, but she got tired easily. And she had some trouble with her eyes later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. She’s… passed away now, so it’s hard to say. My father… he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Just… old age eventually. I’m not sure if that helps? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said you’re not currently taking any medications, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No medications at all. I try to stay as healthy as possible, considering. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just… vitamins, occasionally. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. No hay fever, no reactions to foods… nothing like that. I've always been fairly… resilient, I suppose. Unless you count a mild dislike of cats, but I don’t think that counts as an allergy. Is it important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schaust, a dislike of cats is not medically relevant. Okay. Let’s do a quick exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I just… I want to get to the bottom of this, if you know what I mean. It’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to check your vital signs. Then, I'll take a look at your eyes, and do a brief neurological exam. If that doesn’t give us anything, we can consider some blood work. Lie back, please. Blood pressure is… elevated. 140 over 90. Not great. And pulse is a little fast.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh. Is that bad, Doctor? I do get stressed easily, as you may have noticed. Is that related to… everything? I haven’t been sleeping particularly well, either. Perhaps that’s it? I drink coffee, of course, to stay alert. It’s a vicious cycle, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Pupils are… sluggish. And there's some ptosis – drooping of the eyelids – on both sides, but more pronounced on the right. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. But it’s… a little difficult, Doctor. It feels like I have to concentrate more than usual. And… is that normal? That it feels… strained? My eyes do feel rather heavy, you know. Perhaps it's just tiredness. I’ve been working long hours recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I want you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. And then, I want you to resist me pushing down on your arms and legs. Your grip is… weak. And your reflexes are a bit diminished. It's subtle, but it's there. It's not paralysis, thankfully, but it's not what I'd expect for someone your age. Mr. Schaust, I'm going to order some blood work. I want to check your thyroid levels, your vitamin levels, and rule out any autoimmune issues. It's possible this is something relatively minor, but we need to get to the bottom of it.
PATIENT: Autoimmune issues? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work, yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I… I suppose I was hoping it was just stress, but… if it’s something more… Is there anything I should be worried about specifically? Should I… avoid anything in the meantime? I feel a bit anxious now, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, don’t panic. It’s probably nothing serious. But we need to rule things out. We’ll check for Myasthenia Gravis – that’s a condition that causes muscle weakness – and other potential causes. In the meantime, avoid strenuous activity, and try to get some rest. I wouldn't drive if you’re feeling particularly weak. Here’s the requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at the lab down the street. They’re open until 5 pm today. Once the results are back – usually a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Any questions?
PATIENT: Myasthenia Gravis… I've never heard of that. Is it… curable? And… strenuous activity, you say? That’s… difficult. My job requires a lot of physical work, as you know. I suppose I can try to take it easy. A few days, you said? I'll try to be patient. Just… is it likely to be something serious, Doctor? I don't want to… overreact, but I'm a bit of a worrier, as you may have gathered. And what if it is something serious? What would happen then? I feel a little… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust, I understand your anxiety. But I’m not going to speculate about worst-case scenarios. We have to get the results back first. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, it's manageable. There are treatments available – medications, therapy. It doesn’t necessarily mean a drastically reduced quality of life. And frankly, it could be something entirely different – a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue. It’s far more likely to be something relatively straightforward. Don’t jump to conclusions. Get the blood work done, and we'll go from there. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. I just… I’ll try to stay calm. And I’ll get the blood work done as soon as possible. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you explaining everything… even if it’s a bit frightening.
