DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s rather…complicated. I suppose you could say I’m exploring a potential…situation. A romantic one. And I like to be thorough, you understand. One doesn’t simply jump into these things. I want to ensure everything is…suitable.
DOCTOR: Right… thorough. Okay. And… how does this relate to a medical visit, exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I wasn’t quite sure how it related, initially. My husband suggested I come in. He believes a general check-up is prudent before… well, before I become too involved with someone else. He’s very… cautious. And, I suppose, it's good to have a baseline, isn’t it? One never knows what sort of…habits someone might have.
DOCTOR: Habits… I see. So, you’re looking for a general health screening, essentially?
PATIENT: Not precisely. I wouldn't call it screening. I simply want to be certain I’m… adequately protected. From anything untoward, naturally. And to be aware of any… pre-existing conditions that might… complicate matters. It’s a delicate subject, Doctor. You understand. A lady has to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Ms. Pandolfi, your record indicates you're 44 years old, and your weight is listed as 93 kilograms. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your medical history to get a better understanding of your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Ask away. I have an excellent memory, you know. Dates, details… I rarely forget a thing. Though, truthfully, I don't see what my past medical history has to do with…this current predicament. But if you insist. Just don't expect any lengthy explanations; I’m a very efficient person.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… significant is relative, isn't it? I had my tonsils removed as a child, a rather unpleasant affair, I recall. And a rather nasty bout of the flu in ’98, kept me bedridden for a week. Oh, and a minor knee surgery in 2010 after I tripped over a rug. Honestly, nothing terribly dramatic. I've always been quite healthy, generally speaking. Unlike some people I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child, flu in '98, and knee surgery in 2010. Do you have any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a very sensible diet, Doctor. No processed foods, plenty of water, and I walk regularly. My husband—he's a retired pharmacist, you see—is quite insistent about those things. He’s very particular. As for high blood pressure or heart problems… utterly preposterous. I have a perfectly sound constitution. I simply wouldn't tolerate such ailments.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's… complicated. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, but she had a rather unfortunate fondness for sweets. Her sister, however, developed…certain issues later in life, issues I won't bore you with. My father was…robust, shall we say. He simply…stopped one day. Nothing specific, really. Just…declined. It wasn't a particularly illuminating family history, Doctor. Mostly just…people living and then not living. Is this truly relevant? I’m beginning to suspect my husband sent me on a wild goose chase.
DOCTOR: Okay… And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just my daily multivitamin, Doctor. And the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, though those are infrequent. My husband, as I mentioned, is rather strict about medication. He believes most doctors simply push pills to line their pockets. He's a very informed man, truly. I assure you, I am not reliant on any sort of… pharmacological assistance. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though, honestly, I'm not even certain why you're asking about medication. What does this have to do with…the situation?
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And… do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I am remarkably robust, Doctor, as I've mentioned. I can tolerate almost anything. Though I do find certain perfumes rather overpowering. And I'm mildly averse to shellfish, but that’s a matter of taste, not an allergy. Honestly, I fail to see the connection between my aversion to shellfish and…well, you know. This is rather frustrating, isn’t it? Are you quite certain you understand the nature of my visit? Perhaps I should have brought my husband along; he’s much better at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, with all due respect, I’m a little unclear on what exactly you’re hoping to achieve with this visit. You mentioned a…situation, and concerns about protection. Are you comfortable telling me what specifically you’re worried about?
PATIENT: Finally. Someone asks a direct question. Very well. I am…exploring a potential relationship with a gentleman I met at a gala. A very charming gentleman, I assure you. And my husband, while supportive of my social life, expressed…reservations. He suggested a thorough medical evaluation to ensure…certain standards are met. He's quite worried about… sexually transmitted infections, naturally. He's a pharmacist, you understand; he's rather fastidious about such things. He wants to be certain this…gentleman is “clean.” It's rather vulgar, honestly. But here we are. Are you satisfied? Now, can we get on with testing, if that’s what’s required? This is terribly undignified.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for clarifying. Yes, we can certainly proceed with testing for sexually transmitted infections. To give you the most accurate results, I’d like to perform a physical exam as well. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? I assure you, I am in excellent health. A visual assessment should suffice. I find the idea of a…thorough examination rather… intrusive. My husband did not mention anything about a physical. Is this standard procedure for…situations like these? Honestly, I'm beginning to question the wisdom of this entire endeavor. Perhaps I should have simply asked the gentleman directly. It would be far less…degrading. But, if it’s absolutely required… I suppose. But please be…discreet. This is a delicate matter.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Pandolfi. The physical exam is standard procedure to ensure a comprehensive assessment and accurate diagnosis, especially when there's a risk of infection. It allows me to check for any visible signs or symptoms that might not be apparent otherwise. I assure you, everything will be done with the utmost discretion and respect. We can tailor the exam to your comfort level, focusing on areas relevant to your concerns. Would you like me to explain what the exam would involve?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain it, then. But please be brief. And avoid any…unnecessary details. I have a very delicate constitution, as I’ve mentioned. And frankly, the entire premise of this examination is rather…insulting. But if it must be done, let us get it over with. Quickly. And discreetly. I do expect a certain level of professionalism, Doctor. This is not a matter to be taken lightly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The exam will involve a visual inspection of the external genital areas to look for any sores, rashes, or other abnormalities. I would also need to collect a urine sample to test for common STIs like chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. If you are comfortable, I can also perform a swab to test for trichomoniasis. The entire process is relatively quick and painless. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A swab? Good heavens. Is there absolutely no avoiding that? It sounds…invasive. And undignified. And what about privacy? Will I be adequately covered? And who will be performing this…procedure? I trust it will be a female nurse? I simply will not tolerate…unnecessary exposure. Honestly, Doctor, this is rapidly descending into a complete debacle. But if it’s absolutely unavoidable… proceed. But with the utmost discretion. And please, explain exactly what you will be doing before each step. I refuse to be surprised. And I expect a full explanation of the results, in clear, understandable terms. No medical jargon, please. Just… get it over with. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Pandolfi. We can absolutely have a female nurse present during the exam for your comfort. The swab is necessary for accurate testing, but it’s a quick and minimally invasive procedure. It involves gently collecting a small sample from the cervix. We’ll ensure you’re adequately covered and positioned comfortably throughout the entire process. I will explain each step before it’s performed, and I’ll use clear, understandable terms when discussing the results. Are you ready to proceed with the preparation for the urine sample?
PATIENT: Very well. Just…get it over with. But please, do be gentle. And discreet. And hurry. This is quite distressing. And I do expect a thorough explanation of the results, as promised. No medical terminology, Doctor. Clear, concise language. I refuse to be confused by… technical jargon. Now, where do I… deposit this sample? I suppose a sterile container is required? Honestly, the indignity of it all. But if it must be done… lead on. But hurry. And please, do try to maintain a semblance of professionalism. This is not a social call. It’s a medical procedure. A rather unpleasant one, at that. But necessary, apparently. Now, where is this container?
DOCTOR: Yes, a sterile container is required. The bathroom is just over there. We have provided a private room with all the necessary supplies. Take your time, and when you are finished, simply leave the sample on the counter. I’ll let you have some privacy, and I will be waiting outside when you're ready. Please, let me know if you need anything. We are here to make you as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Very well. Just…do not disturb me. And I expect complete discretion. This is a private matter. And please, maintain a respectful distance. I simply will not tolerate any…unnecessary intrusions. Now, let us get this ordeal over with. Quickly. This is quite distressing. .
