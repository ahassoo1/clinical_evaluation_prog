DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. I see here you’re a new patient with our clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my stomach. Food keeps coming back up. It’s… unpleasant. And it’s been happening more lately. Honestly, I expect better from a body that’s lasted this long.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re experiencing vomiting, and that it’s become more frequent recently. I appreciate your directness, Mr. Altine. We will certainly get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the vomiting a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What’s to describe? It’s… food. Coming up. Like I said. It's not exactly a complicated situation. It usually happens a couple of hours after I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Steak, soup, doesn’t make a difference. And it’s not like a violent heave, just… a return trip. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, I’ve never had to explain this to anyone before. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing, Mr. Altine, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. It's perfectly alright. It’s important information, and you’re not the first patient to experience something like this. You mentioned it happens a couple of hours after eating, regardless of the type of food. Is there any pain associated with it – before, during, or after?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. More like… discomfort. A little burning in my chest sometimes, but it's not like a sharp ache. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like too much pressure. And I get a bit of heartburn, you know? That's probably what it is. Everyone gets heartburn. I just thought this was… worse than usual. Look, I eat a good dinner, then I lay down to watch the news, and then… well, you know. It’s a nuisance. And my wife keeps telling me to see someone. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, discomfort and a burning sensation in your chest, sometimes with heartburn, occurring after meals, especially when you're resting. And your wife is understandably concerned. Mr. Altine, while heartburn is common, the fact that you're experiencing this with the vomiting warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? I told you about the food coming back up! What else am I supposed to be looking for? I haven't sprouted wings or started speaking in tongues. Honestly, I don't sit around analyzing every little thing that happens after dinner. I'm a busy man. I run an emergency management office, I don't have time for symptom checklists. Look, I’m feeling a bit… lightheaded just talking about this. Is this going to take much longer? I have a meeting at ten.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Altine, and I apologize if I’m asking too many questions. I assure you, I’m trying to be thorough. The lightheadedness is important information, thank you for mentioning that. Just a few more quick questions, then we can proceed with a brief examination. Have you noticed any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I’ve gained a few pounds. My wife keeps making these heavy Polish dinners, and I’m a polite man, I eat what she puts in front of me. Though, now that I think about it...maybe my belt is a little looser. But that’s probably just the heat. Look, I’m a big man, a few pounds either way doesn’t make a difference. Can we just get this over with? I need a diagnosis and a solution, not a lifestyle assessment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand your frustration. Just to clarify, you’ve noticed your belt feels a little looser recently, but attribute that to the heat. And you haven’t experienced any other symptoms – no fever, no abdominal pain, no changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No fever, no pain, and… look, I don’t discuss my bowel movements with doctors, alright? That's a bit personal, even for me. Everything else is…normal. As normal as it can be for a man my age. I eat, I sleep, I worry about disasters, and sometimes my food comes back up. Is that enough detail for you? I'm starting to feel quite uncomfortable now. This whole thing is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, that's helpful. I apologize for the somewhat personal nature of the questions; it’s simply part of gathering a complete medical history. Alright, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to gently palpate your abdomen. This will help me assess the situation further. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And be gentle, alright? I haven't been poked and prodded like this in… well, a long time. Honestly, I’d rather be preparing for a hurricane than lying here being examined. Let’s just hope you find something useful. This is a waste of my time, but if my wife wants it, I suppose I'll cooperate. Just… hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Altine, I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm gently pressing on your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness or pain in any particular areas?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… pressure, maybe, but nothing significant. It’s just… uncomfortable being touched. I’m a private man, alright? I haven’t been examined like this since… well, never mind. Just… get it over with. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. I’m an emergency management director, I deal with real problems, not… stomach discomfort. Is that enough poking and prodding? Can we talk about a solution now? I need something to stop this food from coming back up. Something quick and effective. I haven't got time for fancy diets or lifestyle changes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. I understand your discomfort and desire for a quick resolution. Based on the examination, I don’t feel any significant tenderness or abnormalities. However, given your symptoms – the recurrent vomiting, the discomfort, and the possible weight loss – I believe further investigation is warranted. There are several possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively benign, like gastritis or GERD, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. Would you be agreeable to ordering some blood tests and a possible upper endoscopy?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Endoscopy? What are you talking about? Look, I thought this was just a case of heartburn. I don’t need fancy tests and invasive procedures. I just want something to stop the vomiting! Are you telling me this is serious? Honestly, I'm starting to worry now. My wife is going to have a field day with this. Just… what exactly would these tests show? And how long are they going to take? I have a meeting next week, I can’t be laid up for days. This is… unacceptable. I need a second opinion, frankly. A doctor who understands that a man has things to do. This is… ridiculous. .
