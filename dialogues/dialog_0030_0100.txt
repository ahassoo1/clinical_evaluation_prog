DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Quicksey, is it? That's a pretty name. Um… well, honestly, it’s about a test. A drug test, I think? Someone said I needed one. My memory’s not what it used to be, you see. It's something to do with work, I believe. I operate some pretty big machines... paving equipment. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like your employer may be requesting a drug screening as part of your job requirements – particularly given the nature of your work. I see here you’re covered by Medicare and we have your height and weight recorded. Do you happen to know which department at work requested the test, or perhaps who you spoke with regarding it?
PATIENT: Oh, Medicare, yes. That's right. And… tall, aren’t I? Which department… hmm. Let me think… Honestly, it was a fella… youngish, with… brown hair, I think? He just said something about needing to be sure, for safety reasons. It was the main office, I guess? Not one of the job sites. I wish I could be more help, truly. I get so mixed up these days. It wasn’t a formal meeting or anything. More like a quick chat during a break. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Hughston. It's perfectly common to not remember all the details, especially if it wasn't a formal process. The important thing is that you're here to get it done. To clarify, are you currently experiencing any symptoms that prompted you to seek medical attention today, separate from this work-required drug screening?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms at all. Just… this test. I feel fine, really. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just… life, you know? I haven’t been sick or anything. Just trying to keep up with everything, keep the machines running, and… well, remember where I parked the car most days. Nothing medical, truly. Just a routine thing, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, this is primarily for work compliance, and you aren't experiencing any specific health concerns at this time. Just to be thorough, could you please tell me if you have any allergies to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. Not that I know of! I used to be allergic to bee stings as a kid, but that was ages ago. As for medications… I don’t take anything regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. No known drug allergies, no. I’ve always been pretty good with medications, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug allergies and only occasional aspirin use. That’s helpful. Now, just a quick check – have you taken any medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements in the past few days?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Just the aspirin, I think. Maybe two days ago, for a bit of a headache. Nothing else, no. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can. Mostly just water and coffee to keep me going. No herbal remedies or anything like that. I’m pretty simple, really. Definitely nothing recently, other than that aspirin.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the occasional aspirin. That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Hughston. To proceed with the drug screening, we'll need a urine sample. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician there will provide you with specific instructions. It's a fairly straightforward process. Would you like me to briefly explain what substances the standard screening panel tests for, just so you're aware?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample, alright. That's… simple enough, I suppose. And… what substances? Yes, please. It's always good to know what you're getting into, isn't it? I don't… partake in anything, if that's what you mean, but I wouldn't mind knowing what they're looking for. Just to be informed, you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The standard drug screening panel typically tests for several common substances. These include: amphetamines, which are stimulants; barbiturates, a type of sedative; benzodiazepines, another type of sedative often used for anxiety; cocaine; marijuana – or THC; opiates, which are pain relievers; and phencyclidine, also known as PCP. The test also checks for the presence of specific proteins that can indicate kidney or bladder problems, as well as sugar levels. Do you have any questions about any of those substances?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a lot of things. I think I’ve heard of some of those… cocaine, marijuana… those are bad things, right? I definitely don’t have any of those in my system! The other ones… the barbi… whatever, and the opiates… are those in pain medicine? I took some, years ago, after I… after my husband passed. Could that show up? It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Hughston. And it’s important that you asked. Opioids are often found in pain medication. The detection window – how long a substance can be detected in your urine – varies depending on the specific opioid and how often it was used. Given the time that has passed since you last took pain medication, it’s unlikely to show up on the test, but it’s good to be aware of the possibility. To be completely thorough, and to avoid any potential false positives, it’s always best to disclose any past medication use to the lab technician. They can provide the most accurate interpretation of the results. Would you like me to write a note to the lab mentioning your past opioid use for pain management?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. That would put my mind at ease, truly. I just… I don’t want to get in trouble at work. I’ve been operating those machines for years, and I'm very careful. Yes, please, write a note. Anything to make sure everything goes smoothly. I appreciate you listening and understanding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I've made a note of that for the lab technician. They are very familiar with these types of situations. Alright. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The technician will give you instructions on how to collect the sample and will answer any questions you may have. After you’ve completed the collection, they’ll send the sample to the lab for analysis. The results usually take a few business days to come back. Do you have any questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Just down the hall to the left… and tell the technician, right? Thank you so much, Doctor Quicksey. You’ve been very kind and understanding. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything and writing that note. It’s a weight off my shoulders, honestly. I’ll head down there now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I’m happy to help. Please don’t hesitate to come back if you have any further questions or concerns after you’ve spoken with the technician. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with the screening.
