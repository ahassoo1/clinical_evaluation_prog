DOCTOR: Hi Candis, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have time for this. I’ve been feeling…off. Tired, mostly. And I have this…habit. A bad one. I eat dirt. Clay, mostly. Don't look at me like that, it's just…happening more and more. And it's not helping the tiredness, obviously. Just get on with it, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. No judgement here, we're just trying to figure things out. You said tiredness and…eating clay. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, definitely. Seems to be getting worse, though. It’s not just…sleepy tiredness. It’s like…everything is heavy. Walking feels like wading through water. And I have no energy for…anything, really. I used to garden, you know? Can’t even think about it now. It’s just…exhausting to think about it. Does that make sense? I don’t even know why I bother telling you.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Candis. Fatigue that feels like wading through water is a very helpful way to describe it. And the loss of interest in activities you used to enjoy is important too. So, months of increasing fatigue…any other symptoms that seem to go along with it?
PATIENT: Well…my stomach hasn’t been right. A bit…upset. Not sick, exactly. Just…off. And I feel cold. Always cold. Even when it's warm. I have to wear a sweater constantly. And…I've been a bit…forgetful lately. Though, don't you go thinking I'm senile! I remember plenty, thank you very much. Just…where did I put my keys? See? That kind of thing. It's irritating.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis, that’s all very helpful. Stomach upset, feeling cold even when others don’t, and some forgetfulness. It's good you're noticing these things. Now, about the clay…how often are you eating it, and how much at a time?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't make me talk about it. It's embarrassing. It started small, just a little pinch here and there when I was gardening, you know? Like…a taste. Now…a couple of times a week, maybe more. A handful each time. It's…soothing, I guess. And I crave it. Like needing something. A really awful habit, I know. Don't lecture me. I already feel bad enough about it.
DOCTOR: I’m not going to lecture you, Candis. I understand it provides some sort of comfort. It’s good you’re being honest with me about it. We need to figure out why you're craving it. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had the flu, badly, when I was 40. And my blood pressure’s a little high, the doctor said, a few years back. But nothing serious. I used to be very healthy, very active. I walked everywhere. Still do, when I can. But lately…no. Nothing else. I don't go to doctors much. Waste of time, usually. They just tell you to eat more vegetables. It’s not helpful. Do you really need to know all this?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Candis. Knowing your past medical history, even things that seem minor, helps me put the pieces together. The flu and high blood pressure are good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve been very lucky, you see. Always took care of myself. Good food, plenty of exercise. Until recently, of course. This tiredness…it's just draining the life out of me. I don't even recognize myself anymore. And this…clay business. It's just…disgusting. I used to be so particular. Now I’m eating dirt! Honestly. Is this all you need to know? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Candis. A few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Just trying to get the full picture. Have you ever had any major illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had…arthritis, badly. And my brother…he had heart trouble. Died young, unfortunately. A shame. And my grandmother…she was a bit…forgetful, towards the end. Like me, I suppose. But that’s just old age, isn't it? I don't know. My family wasn’t really one for talking about illnesses. Just…suffered in silence, mostly. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, Candis, even if they didn’t talk about it much. Arthritis, heart trouble, and some forgetfulness in your grandmother...okay. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. Always have, really. Never married. Didn’t have the time for it, I suppose. Too busy working. Physical Therapist Aide, you know? Lots of lifting and moving. Until I started feeling…this way. It’s a demanding job. Not anymore, though. I had to cut back. Can’t manage the lifting. It's humiliating. Now, are you done with the questions? I really would like to go.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Candis. Just a few more quick things. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, when it gets high. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. That’s it. I don't believe in loading up on pills. Natural remedies are better, usually. Though nothing seems to be helping this tiredness. Or the…clay. Can we just get on with it now? I have things to do. Really, I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. No problem. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. And don't tell me to eat more vegetables. I’ve heard it all before. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just make things up. Now hurry up. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart rate is a bit slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. A little tenderness in the upper right quadrant. And now, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. Just follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Eye movements are a little slow, but otherwise intact. Okay, Candis, that’s all.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Is it something serious? Don't tell me it's just stress. I don't have stress. I just want to know what’s wrong with me, alright? And stop looking at me like that. I’m perfectly capable of understanding medical terms, you know. Just tell me, plainly. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Your heart and lungs sound fine, but I noticed some tenderness in your upper right abdomen, and your eye movements were a little slow. Given your symptoms – fatigue, stomach upset, feeling cold, forgetfulness, and the clay eating – and these findings, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. One possibility is iron deficiency anemia. Eating clay can actually cause iron deficiency. Another is a possible thyroid issue, which could explain the fatigue, feeling cold, and some of the other symptoms. And, given the tenderness in your abdomen and the slow eye movements, we need to rule out any neurological concerns. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on, and we need some tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a complete blood count , a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. I'm also going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function. We should also check your iron levels. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly. It's always something with doctors. Fine. Do your tests. But I expect results. And I expect you to explain them to me in plain English, alright? None of that medical jargon. And don't expect me to come back if you can't tell me what's wrong. I haven't got time for this. So get it done quickly. Now, how am I supposed to get these tests done? And when will I hear back?
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. I understand your frustration. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form. You’ll need to provide a blood sample. It shouldn’t take long. The lab technician will explain everything to you. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. Once I have them, I’ll review them and give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. I promise to explain everything in plain English. I understand your concern, and I want to assure you that I’ll do everything I can to get to the bottom of this. Here's the requisition form. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…don't keep me waiting. I have things to do, you know. And don't expect me to be happy if you tell me it's just…stress. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to get this over with.
