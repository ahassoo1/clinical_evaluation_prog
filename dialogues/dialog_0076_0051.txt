DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Nini, yes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s me. Nini. Darl Nini. Though, everyone just calls me Darl. It’s… it’s a bit of a long story, how I got that nickname. Don’t rightly remember why anymore, just that I’ve been Darl for… well, a long time. I think I’m here about my blood type? My son… he said something about needing to know.
DOCTOR: Blood type… yes, right. Your son mentioned that. Honestly, people come in here with the most… peculiar requests. Look, I'm Dr. Ruocco. We can check that, I suppose. Though, frankly, I’m not sure why it requires me. It’s a simple test. But… alright. Have you ever had your blood type determined before?
PATIENT: Oh, Dr. Ruocco, is it? Lovely to meet you. No… I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Everything gets a bit… fuzzy these days. I used to work with ropes, you see. Rigging, mostly. Big boats, mostly. Though, that was… a long time ago. Does that matter? Is it something they would have checked then? I don’t… I honestly couldn’t say.
DOCTOR: Ropes… fascinating. No, I doubt they checked your blood type when you were… handling ropes. Look, Mrs. Nini, we're getting sidetracked. It's a straightforward procedure. I'll need to draw a small sample of blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or… anything, really?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I remember. I used to get stung by bees sometimes, working outside, but that was just… a sting! A bit painful, that's all. Latex… is that in gloves? The doctor's gloves? I don't recall ever having a problem with gloves. But, honestly, my memory… it’s like trying to hold water in my hands. It just slips away.
DOCTOR: Right, "slips away." Look, Mrs. Nini, if you think you might be allergic to latex, just tell me. It's important. We have non-latex gloves if needed. Otherwise… just try to relax. It’s a small prick. We’ll get this done quickly, and then you can go. Do you have any… conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, conditions… well, I’m seventy-nine! What doesn't ache at this point? No, nothing the doctor needs to worry about. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. My son, he worries so. Always has. He said something about needing this for… insurance? Or maybe a will? I really don't remember. Is it important to tell you if my bones creak a lot?
DOCTOR: Bones creaking… no, Mrs. Nini, that's generally not something I need to document. Your son mentioned the will, yes. Alright. Let’s just get this blood draw done. Please, roll up your sleeve. And try to stay still. I haven't got all day.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This arm… it's a bit stiff today. Used to be strong as an ox, you know. All that rope work. But time… time takes its toll on everything. Just do your best, Doctor. I’ll try to stay still. Though, no promises, if it starts to hurt!
DOCTOR: There. Just a little prick. See?
PATIENT: Ooh! A little prick, you say? That’s… rather more than a little, isn’t it? It feels… cold. And tingly. Is it almost done? My son… he always said I had thin blood. Is that why it’s taking so long?
DOCTOR: Thin blood… it’s a myth, Mrs. Nini. Everyone has roughly the same amount of blood. It’s filling the tube now. Just hold this here for a few minutes. And please, try to relax. We’ll send this off to the lab. It should be back within a couple of business days.
PATIENT: Red… that's a lot of red, isn’t it? A couple of days, you say? My son will be relieved. He worries so much about everything. What will they do with it, this blood? Is it for… science? Or just to know what kind of blood I have? I always thought it was just… red.
DOCTOR: It's for identification, Mrs. Nini. For legal purposes. The will, remember?
PATIENT: Oh. The will. Right. Well, that’s good, I suppose. Though, I don't rightly recall making a will… or telling anyone about a will. My son… he has a very good memory, though. Always has. Perhaps he knows more than I do. Is there anything I need to do? Any forms to sign? Or… or is it all done now?
DOCTOR: No, nothing further from you. Just let the lab handle it. Next. Is there anything else you wanted to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh. No… I don’t think so. Just the blood. And… and the will, I suppose. Though, I still don't remember… Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. I hope it wasn't too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all. Have a good day, Mrs. Nini. Next.
PATIENT: Doctor? Just… tell my son it was nice meeting you, alright? He’s a good boy. Always worrying… always remembering.
