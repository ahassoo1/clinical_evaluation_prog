DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. A bit…down, you could say. It’s rather bothersome, and I thought it best to get it checked. I haven’t much time, if you don’t mind a quick consultation.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you'd like to keep this brief, and I'll do my best to be efficient. “Down,” you say… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… it’s hard to explain. Just… not enjoying things. Used to love my work – lifeguarding, even the ski patrol – kept me active, you know? Now… it feels like a chore. Little enthusiasm. I sleep alright, I suppose, but wake feeling… empty. It’s been going on for a few months now, and my daughter suggested I come see someone. She worries, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. A loss of enjoyment in activities you previously found pleasurable, and a feeling of emptiness… that's helpful to know. And it's good your daughter encouraged you to seek help. A few months is definitely long enough to warrant a look. Now, just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My appetite… no, not really. I eat about the same, I think. Perhaps a little less, now that I think about it, but nothing drastic. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. I’m a fairly large woman, always have been, so it’s not something I obsess over. I suppose I haven’t noticed any significant changes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is. Changes in appetite can be associated with a number of things, so it's good to ask. Alright. And have you been experiencing any difficulty with your sleep besides waking up feeling empty?
PATIENT: No, the sleep itself is…fine. I fall asleep without trouble, and I sleep through the night. It’s just… not restful, if that makes sense. Like I haven’t accomplished anything even after eight hours. It’s a strange feeling. I’m not tired, exactly, just… drained. Is this what people mean by fatigue? I always thought fatigue was physical, from hard work, but this feels… different.
DOCTOR: That is different, Ms. Derasmo. You're describing a lack of restorative sleep, and that's important. Fatigue can definitely be more than just physical; it can be emotional and mental as well. Now, have you noticed any changes in your concentration or memory lately?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that you mention it… yes, a bit. I used to be very good at remembering faces, names, things like that. Part of the job, you know. Now… I have to concentrate much harder. And sometimes… words just escape me. Not all the time, but enough to be… irritating. I find myself repeating things, or forgetting what I was about to say. It’s rather embarrassing, truthfully. I’m not getting any younger, of course, but it feels… quicker than it should.
DOCTOR: I understand. Changes in concentration and memory are definitely something we want to explore further. Have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, or a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy, aside from the lifeguarding and ski patrol?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… that’s a strong word. I wouldn’t say hopelessness, exactly. More… a lack of motivation, perhaps. I used to enjoy gardening, reading… even socializing with my friends. Now… I just don’t feel like it. It’s not that I’m sad, necessarily. Just… empty. Like there’s no point. I know that sounds dreadful, but it’s difficult to explain. I keep telling myself to snap out of it, but it doesn’t work. Is this…depression? My daughter used that word too. I always thought depression was for younger people.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to believe depression only affects younger people, Ms. Derasmo, but that’s not true. Depression can present differently at different ages, and it's certainly possible. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any changes in your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. Terribly low. I used to be a very active woman, always on the go. Now… I find myself just wanting to sit. Or lie down. I get tired very easily. Even simple things, like walking to the shops, feel like a monumental effort. And it’s not a physical tiredness, like I said before. It’s… a draining of my spirit, almost. I used to get up early, eager to start the day. Now… I dread getting out of bed. It’s a vicious cycle, really. Is this normal? I feel rather foolish admitting all this. A 75-year-old woman complaining of…low spirits. Perhaps I’m just getting old.
DOCTOR: You're not foolish at all, Ms. Derasmo. It takes courage to talk about these things, and you’re not simply “getting old.” It sounds like you're experiencing a number of symptoms that are concerning, and we need to investigate further. Now, have you experienced any physical symptoms, such as headaches, stomach problems, or changes in your bowel habits, recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, now that you mention it, my stomach has been a bit unsettled lately. Not terribly so, just… a general feeling of queasiness. And I’ve been rather…irregular, if you understand. But I put that down to my age, truthfully. And I do get the occasional headache, but I suffer from those anyway, so I haven’t paid it much attention. Nothing that would warrant a visit to the doctor, I thought. It’s all rather…minor, really. Is this relevant? I’m starting to feel rather silly listing all my little ailments. Perhaps I should just try to pull myself together.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Derasmo. These details are important. Sometimes physical symptoms can be connected to emotional well-being, and it’s important to consider everything. Let me just take a quick look at your medical history here… I see you have a history of hypertension, well-managed with medication, and some occasional migraines. No recent blood work or significant changes noted. Now, before we go any further, have you experienced any thoughts of death or suicide?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a rather…direct question, Doctor. No, absolutely not. Never. I’ve always been a very practical woman, a survivor, you could say. I’ve seen a lot in my life, and I’m not one to give up easily. The thought never even crossed my mind. I love my life, my family… I just haven’t been enjoying it lately, as I’ve explained. I certainly wouldn’t…harm myself. That’s dreadful to even think about. I hope you didn’t think I was…like that. This is all very upsetting. Perhaps I should just leave.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Derasmo, please don’t leave. I apologize if that question was jarring. It's a standard part of evaluating someone with these symptoms, and it's important to rule out any serious concerns. I absolutely did not think you were "like that." I’m simply trying to understand everything that’s going on. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of symptoms – loss of enjoyment, fatigue, changes in sleep and concentration, and some physical discomfort. Based on what you've told me, it's possible you're experiencing a depressive episode. However, we need to rule out other potential causes first. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Blood work… yes, that sounds sensible. If it will help determine what’s wrong, then I’m happy to do it. I just want to feel…normal again. To enjoy my life, as I used to. My daughter will be relieved to hear I’m taking this seriously. She’s been worried sick. I suppose… I’ve been trying to tough it out, but it’s clearly not working. And Doctor… thank you. For listening, and for not dismissing me as a silly old woman. It means a lot. Now… what do I need to do about the blood work? Can it be done here? I do hope it doesn't take too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon… although, truthfully, I doubt I'll be much good.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It’s my job to listen, and you’re absolutely not silly. Yes, we can do the blood work right here in the clinic. It will take about 15-20 minutes, and the results usually come back within a few days. I’ll have the nurse draw the samples after our consultation. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a brief questionnaire to fill out – it’s called the PHQ-9, and it’s a standardized tool to assess the severity of your symptoms. It will help me get a clearer picture of how you’re feeling. While we wait for the results, I would like you to focus on some simple self-care strategies – regular sleep schedule, healthy diet, and gentle exercise, if you're able. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re feeling overwhelmed. And don’t worry about the bridge game. Just do what you’re comfortable with. Here you go. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Very kind. I hope I understand what it’s asking. It's been a long time since I've had to fill out forms like this. I suppose it's good to be thorough, though. Perhaps this will finally get to the bottom of things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. Alright. This confirms what you’ve already told me – you’re experiencing significant symptoms of depression. The score is moderately severe. Based on everything we’ve discussed and the results of the questionnaire, I believe you would benefit from treatment. I'm recommending a trial of antidepressant medication, along with regular talk therapy. I can refer you to a psychiatrist and a therapist in the area. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Medication… and therapy? Oh dear. I’ve always been a bit wary of medication. I prefer natural remedies, if possible. And therapy… well, I’ve never really spoken about my feelings to anyone. It feels rather…intrusive. I suppose I’m old-fashioned, but I believe in toughing things out. Is medication absolutely necessary? Perhaps if I just try to keep busy, get more fresh air… I don't know. This is all rather overwhelming. Is there…anything else I can try first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Derasmo. It’s perfectly normal to be wary of medication and to feel uncomfortable talking about your feelings. And you’re right, it’s important to explore all options. While keeping busy and getting fresh air are certainly helpful, they may not be enough to address the underlying chemical imbalance that can contribute to depression. Think of it like this: if you had a broken leg, you wouldn’t just try to walk it off, would you?
PATIENT: That’s a fair point, Doctor. A broken leg is different, of course. But… medication does have side effects, doesn’t it? And I’ve heard stories… people becoming… different. Losing their personality. I wouldn’t want to become someone else. I'm quite content with who I am, even if I am feeling a bit down at the moment. And therapy… well, I suppose I’m just a private person. I don’t like burdening others with my problems. I've always managed on my own, and I'm not sure I'd be comfortable sharing my feelings with a stranger. Perhaps I should just try to…wait it out. See if things improve on their own.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Derasmo. It’s important to be informed and to weigh the risks and benefits of any treatment. And you're right, medication can have side effects, but many of them are manageable, and we can work together to find a medication that’s right for you, with minimal side effects. Modern antidepressants are very different from the ones you might have heard about. They’re generally well-tolerated, and they’re not about changing your personality – they’re about restoring the chemical balance in your brain so you can feel like yourself again. As for therapy, it’s not about burdening anyone – it’s about having a safe and confidential space to explore your feelings with a trained professional. A good therapist will help you develop coping strategies and work through your challenges at your own pace. However, I respect your wishes. If you’re not ready for medication or therapy at this time, we can try a different approach. We can focus on lifestyle changes – regular exercise, healthy diet, social activities, and mindfulness techniques. We can also schedule regular check-ups to monitor your symptoms and see if they improve. But I want you to know that if your symptoms worsen, or if you start having thoughts of harming yourself, it’s important to seek help immediately. Would you be willing to try the lifestyle changes for a few weeks, and then we can reassess?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Lifestyle changes… that sounds manageable. I can certainly try to be more active, eat healthier, and spend more time with my friends. And regular check-ups… that’s reassuring. I suppose it’s a good compromise. I’m not ready for medication or therapy at the moment, but I’m willing to try other things first. I just need some time to adjust to the idea, and to see if things improve on their own. And thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for not pushing me into anything I’m not comfortable with. You’ve been very understanding. What do I need to do next? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And is there anything else I should be aware of? Perhaps a list of helpful resources, or a website I can visit?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. I’m glad we could come to an agreement that you’re comfortable with. Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with some resources on managing depression, including websites, support groups, and local exercise classes. I’ll also write down the number for a crisis hotline, just in case you need it. It’s important to be patient with yourself and to remember that recovery takes time. Don’t be afraid to reach out if you’re struggling, and don’t hesitate to schedule an earlier appointment if your symptoms worsen. Here you go. This handout has information on coping strategies, healthy eating, and local support groups. And this is the number for the crisis hotline, if you ever need to talk to someone immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate your patience. I suppose I’ll be off then. I have that bridge game to prepare for, after all. Thank you again for everything. I’ll see you in four weeks.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Derasmo. It was a pleasure meeting you. Enjoy your bridge game, and please take care of yourself. I look forward to seeing you in four weeks.
