DOCTOR: Right, well. Have a seat, Mr. Croonquist. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yes. Right. Just… the lab work. The usual. Doctor said I need it done, you know. Yearly thing, I think. Honestly, I don't recall exactly what they're looking for. Just… the blood tests. Can we just get it over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “The ‘usual’ isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. Croonquist. We need to know what tests were ordered. It’s not just about getting it ‘over with’, you know. There’s a reason your previous doctor requested them. Do you have a list from them, perhaps?
PATIENT: A list? Hmm… no. No, I don’t think so. I usually just… show up when they tell me to. They send a notice, I come. I think it was… something about my kidneys? Or maybe my liver? Honestly, it all blurs together after a while. Look, is it really necessary to know exactly what they want? Can't you just… check what they usually check for a man my age? I'm 73, you know. Things wear out.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, ‘what they usually check’ is… imprecise. We need to be specific. It impacts the interpretation of the results. It’s important. Do you recall who sent the notice?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Dr. Ahmadi, I believe? Yes, Ahmadi… He was… younger. Had a nice office, though. Over on Elm Street. He left, though. Said he was moving. That was… a year ago? Maybe two? I just started coming here after that. They transferred my records, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Alright. Let’s see… Dr. Ahmadi. Yes. It appears he ordered a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a PSA test… six months ago. Were there any specific concerns he mentioned at the time?
PATIENT: Comprehensive… what now? Look, I really don’t keep track of these things. He just said I needed blood work. Something about… keeping an eye on things. Maybe my cholesterol? My wife, bless her soul, always worried about my cholesterol. But she’s… gone now. And that was… a long time ago. Just… do the tests, please. Whatever Dr. Ahmadi ordered. I need to get home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We'll proceed with the tests Dr. Ahmadi ordered. It will take a few minutes. We'll need to draw some blood. I’m going to have my assistant come in and start an IV line. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other sensitivities I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm… I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with bandages, you know. And no, nothing really bothers me. I used to work around… chemicals, at the power plant. Didn’t bother me none. Just… a little tired sometimes. But that was the work, you know. Power plants are exhausting. Just… hurry it up, please. I'm not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Very well. The assistant will be right in. She’s quite good. It shouldn't take long. Just try to relax. And please, if you feel any discomfort during the blood draw, let her know immediately.
PATIENT: Right. Relax. Easy for you to say. Just… get it over with. The quicker the better. .
