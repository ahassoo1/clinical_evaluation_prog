DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston, have a seat. Look, I’m Dr. Pehrson. Busy day, so let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um... well, it's about a test, I think? Something they wanted me to do. Honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It was something to do with... checking things. For work, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, "checking things." Okay. So, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms, just a vague request for testing?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms, not really. Just… they said I needed a drug test. For my job. I operate…big machines. Paving stuff. That's what I do. I don't really understand why they need a test, though. Is everything alright?
DOCTOR: Paving stuff…right. Look, Ms. Hughston, I'm a family doctor, not a…employment physical specialist. But if your employer requires a drug test, that's usually standard procedure for safety reasons. Have you had one before?
PATIENT: Oh. Safety, right. Yes, that makes sense, the machines are big. I… I think I might have, a long time ago. It’s hard to remember. Everything just feels…blurry. Was it painful? I don’t like needles much.
DOCTOR: Painful?
PATIENT: No, not really painful. It's just a quick little prick. They'll take a small sample, and send it off to the lab. It's pretty routine. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter? Or…anything else? Vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's try to be thorough here, Ms. Hughston. It's important. Vitamins can sometimes interfere with tests, believe it or not. Don't leave anything out. It’s all confidential, you know.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my knees, sometimes. They ache, you see. Dr. Abernathy prescribed it, a little orange pill. And… I think I have a multivitamin, but I haven’t taken it in ages. It's in the kitchen somewhere, probably. I don't really keep track of things like that anymore. It was…before my husband… oh dear. Everything is so mixed up. Is it alright if I just... don't remember?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Hughston, I understand things are…difficult. But something for your knees?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. A little orange pill. I think it's for arthritis. Dr. Abernathy said something about…inflammation. It helps a little, mostly when it's really cold. I try not to take too many, though. It makes me…sleepy. And sometimes I forget if I've already had one. It’s a mess, really. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, “little orange pill for arthritis”. Do you know the name of the medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I don't. I just ask the pharmacist to fill it, you know? He's a nice young man. I just show him the paper Dr. Abernathy wrote. I'm really not good with names. Or numbers, really. Everything gets…lost. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fine. Let’s move on. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um… not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a girl, running around in the fields. But that was… a long time ago. I don't think I'm allergic to anything now. Nothing I've noticed, anyway. Is that alright? Should I be noticing something?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hughston, you don’t need to be noticing something. Just trying to cover all the bases. Okay. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… my husband had a heart problem. That was… very sad. And… I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. It was silly, really. Nothing major, I don’t think. Just… normal things, I suppose. Does that help? Everything feels so…distant. It’s like looking through a fog.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you need, Doctor. I don't mind. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. My knees are a bit achey today. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t. Just routine. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… I’ll take a quick look at your knees too. Please, have a seat on the table. Blood pressure is 140/90 – a little elevated. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs are clear. Knees show mild crepitus and some tenderness to palpation bilaterally. No visible swelling.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that bad, Doctor? The blood pressure, I mean. Everything always sounds so… complicated. My husband always used to tell me not to worry about it, but… well. He's gone now. Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s slightly elevated, yes. We’ll want to keep an eye on it. It could be stress, it could be a number of things. Don’t panic. For now, let's focus on the reason you're here – the drug test for your employer. Do you know when you need to take it?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. The test. I think… they said today? Before the end of the week, at least. It was something about… paperwork. And… well, I just want to get it over with. Is it going to be a long process? I have… things to do, you know? Gardening, mostly. And… remembering. Trying to, anyway.
DOCTOR: It's standard urine test. I'll write you a referral to the lab down the street. Just take your ID and the form. It shouldn’t take long. I'm going to write down some information about blood pressure management, and some resources to help with memory. It looks like you are dealing with a lot. Here. I’m running behind, so if you don’t have any other concerns, I think we're done here. Stop by if anything changes.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. Gardening is important, you know? It keeps me… grounded. I will try to remember everything. And… thank you again. I think… I think that's all.
