DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Belan is fine. Look, I just... wanted to get checked. For, you know... that thing. HIV. Better safe than sorry, I always say. Though, honestly, I doubt I need it. My wife and I are… careful. But Medicare covers it, so why not, right?
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. Better safe than sorry is a very sensible approach. And taking advantage of your coverage is a smart move. So, just to be clear – you’re interested in an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The test. It's… a routine thing, isn't it? I mean, for responsible people. Not like some of the others I see around. Honestly, you wouldn’t believe the things people do these days. But me? No, I’m a pretty straight-laced guy. Just want to confirm everything’s good, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a very common and responsible thing to do. We offer routine testing to all our patients. It’s good you’re thinking about this. Before we proceed with the test, could you tell me a little more about your risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors? Honestly, Doctor, I just told you. I'm married. Been with my wife for… well, a long time. We don’t… fraternize with others, if that’s what you’re getting at. I find the question a bit… insulting, actually. Are you suggesting something? I’m a very loyal husband, you know. And a respectable member of this community. It's a bit forward, asking like that.
DOCTOR: Oh, my apologies, Mr. Belan. That certainly wasn’t my intention. I didn't mean to imply anything at all. The question is simply part of the standard assessment – we ask all patients about potential exposures to provide the most accurate care, even if the risk seems very low. It's just protocol, really. To clarify, have you ever shared needles, or received any blood transfusions before?
PATIENT: Needles? Blood transfusions? Absolutely not! Doctor, honestly. Where are you going with this? I’ve never touched a needle in my life, and I certainly haven’t needed a transfusion. I eat well, exercise, and I take care of myself. It's… a bit demeaning, frankly, being grilled like this. I came here for a simple test, not an interrogation. Are you sure this is standard procedure? Perhaps I should speak to your manager.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Mr. Belan, and I apologize again if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It seems I’m not explaining things very well. Let’s just focus on the test itself. We can perform a simple blood draw, and the results will be available in a few days. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Finally! Yes, just the test, please. That’s all I asked for. A simple blood draw. No more questions, no more… implications. Honestly, the whole experience has been rather… unsettling. I hope the results are quick, and I hope they’re negative, obviously. And I hope you’ll be a bit more considerate with your questioning next time. I'm a busy man, you know. This is taking up my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Belan. I understand. I will make sure the blood draw is quick and efficient, and we’ll get the results to you as soon as possible. I’ll just need to ask a few basic questions for the record - allergies, any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: Allergies? Just dust, really. A bit of a nuisance, but nothing serious. Medications? Just a multivitamin, every morning. Keeps me regular, you know. Nothing else. I'm a very healthy man, Doctor. Truly. Now, can we please get this over with? I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon. And I’d rather not be late because of… unnecessary questioning.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. No problem at all. Just dust and a multivitamin, noted. Alright, if you could just roll up your sleeve… we'll get this done in a moment. It'll be a quick prick, and then you'll be all set. I'll have the lab technician come in to draw the blood. Is there a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Left arm is fine, I suppose. Doesn’t really matter to me. Just... be quick about it, alright? I really don’t have all day. And please, try not to make a mess. I have a very important suit on, you know. It’s Italian. Very expensive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. Left arm, noted. I will be as quick and careful as possible. The technician is just outside, and will be with you in a moment. They are very experienced and will ensure everything is done efficiently and without a mess. Just relax, and try to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, the technician will just need a moment to prepare. She’ll explain everything to you before she starts. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all.
