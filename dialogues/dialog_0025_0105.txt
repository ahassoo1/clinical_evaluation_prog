DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. It's a pre-surgery thing, right? I don’t really remember all the details. It’s…bariatric, I think she said?
DOCTOR: Bariatric, yes. That’s weight loss surgery. And it is good your wife is involved; it’s a big decision, and support is crucial. Honestly, it’s a little unusual to come to me just for pre-op; usually, there’s a whole team involved – a surgeon, a nutritionist… But we can certainly get things started. First, let's clarify. You’re interested in exploring weight loss surgery. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Exploring… I guess so. I mean, I want to lose weight, definitely. It’s just… everything happened fast, and I don’t really know what’s involved. My wife did a lot of the talking to people, I think. I just… agreed. Does that make sense? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… blank sometimes.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. A lot of people feel overwhelmed when faced with a big medical decision like this. It sounds like your wife has been doing a lot of the initial legwork, which is helpful, but we need to make sure you are informed and comfortable. Let's start with the basics. Before we even think about surgery, we need to get a thorough understanding of your current health. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Um… a physical? I think so. A few years ago, maybe? I had some blood work done at the pharmacy, for cholesterol, I think. But a full… doctor visit? Not really. I mostly just go when something really hurts. I get nervous, you know? I don’t like doctors much. Does that count as helpful information?
DOCTOR: It is helpful information, Mr. Kochubey, thank you. It's good to be honest about your feelings. And it explains why you might feel a bit unprepared. Okay, so, a few years since a full physical. We're going to need to do one today. It’s standard procedure before any surgery, especially bariatric. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but I don’t take anything for it. And… I had a bad knee when I was younger, playing soccer. But that was ages ago. I don’t really remember anything else. I’ve been pretty healthy, I think. Just… heavy. Does that make sense? I'm really sorry I'm not more helpful. I wish I could remember things better.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. We'll piece things together. High blood pressure is important, even if you're not on medication. That needs to be checked. And the knee injury – that's good to know too. We need to assess your overall fitness for surgery. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… vitamins. Yeah, my wife makes me take a multivitamin every day. And sometimes I take something for heartburn, like Tums, when I eat something spicy. Other than that… no. Nothing regular. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I don't even remember the name of the heartburn stuff. Sorry. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not “bad,” Mr. Kochubey. It’s good to know. Multivitamins and occasional Tums are fine. We just need a complete picture. Now, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but my wife says that’s just pollen. And I think I had a rash once when I was a kid, but I don’t remember what caused it. No serious allergies, though. I can eat pretty much anything. I like food a lot. Does that… help? I feel like I'm just rambling.
DOCTOR: It does help, Mr. Kochubey, to know what you don’t have. No known allergies is good. Alright. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Definitely not. I don't smoke, never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And… no, nothing like that. I work a lot, mostly. Retail. It keeps me pretty busy. My wife worries about me being stressed, though. Does that… matter? I feel like I'm not giving you the right answers.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Kochubey. Stress is a significant factor in overall health. And your work is helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. Family history… That’s a tough one. My mom… she had some heart problems, I think. And my dad… he was overweight, like me. And my aunt… I think she had diabetes. But honestly, I don’t know much about it. We don’t really talk about medical stuff. It’s… not a thing in my family. Sorry. Is that… bad? I really wish I could remember more. It feels like my brain is foggy.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s not “bad” that you don’t have detailed family history. Many families don’t discuss these things. We'll work with what you do know. Heart problems and diabetes are important, so thank you for mentioning those. Okay. Before we move on to the physical exam, I want to ask about your weight loss attempts. Have you tried to lose weight before?
PATIENT: Yeah, lots of times. Mostly diets. You know, the kind my wife finds on the internet. Or those shakes. I tried one where you just eat salads. That lasted a week. And another where you cut out all carbs. I love bread too much. Honestly, they never work for long. I lose a little at first, then I get hungry and… it all comes back. It’s really frustrating. I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle. Does that… explain why I'm here?
DOCTOR: It explains a lot, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like you’ve tried a lot of things without lasting success. That's perfectly understandable. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I just want to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and feel your abdomen. It won’t be anything extensive, just a baseline assessment. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Uh… okay. If you have to. I just… don’t like being poked and prodded. And I get nervous when someone listens to my chest. But if you have to, I guess. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me what you’re doing, so I don’t get surprised. Does that sound okay? I really appreciate you explaining things. My wife says I ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. I understand your nervousness, and I’m happy to explain everything as I go. I want you to be comfortable. I will certainly be gentle. Alright. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment. Okay… 150 over 92. A little elevated. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. I'm going to ask you to take a deep breath in... and out...
PATIENT: Okay… I’m breathing… Just… a little hard. This is making me nervous. Is that normal? My heart always races when the doctor listens to it. I feel like it's going to jump out of my chest.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. It is normal to feel nervous during an exam, and that can absolutely make your heart rate increase. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 98 beats per minute. And I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. I’m checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if anything feels painful. Just relax your stomach muscles as much as possible. Okay… I do feel some slight tenderness in your upper abdomen, but nothing too concerning at this point. It could be related to diet or stress. Alright. That’s all for the basic exam. We need to run some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health – complete blood count, metabolic panel, lipid panel, and thyroid function tests. We’ll also want to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… like a lot. Blood work and… an EKG? What does that even do? I really don't like needles. And I get claustrophobic in small spaces, so an EKG sounds scary. Is there a way to avoid it? I’m starting to feel really anxious now. Maybe I should just go home. This is too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Kochubey. It is a lot, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. The blood work will give us a baseline of your health – checking your organ function, cholesterol levels, and looking for any underlying conditions. As for the EKG, it’s a simple, non-invasive test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It helps us rule out any heart problems before proceeding with surgery. It doesn't involve any needles. You lie on a table, and we attach a few small stickers to your chest. You're not in a small space, and it only takes a few minutes. Look, we can take things slowly. We don’t have to do everything at once. How about we start with the blood work?
PATIENT: Okay… blood work. If that’s all we do for now. But I need to know where. And will it hurt? My wife always says I'm a baby when it comes to needles. She says I faint sometimes, but I don't remember. I just... get really lightheaded. And I need to sit down while they do it, okay? And maybe someone should hold my hand? This is so much. I just wanted to lose weight. I didn't realize it would be this complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. You are not a baby. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about needles. And we will absolutely accommodate your needs. We can go to the lab right across the hall. They’re very good there, and they’re used to dealing with anxious patients. You absolutely can sit down, and someone can definitely hold your hand – I can ask one of the nurses to come with us. You can also lie down if that makes you more comfortable. Let me just call the nurse to let her know we'll be coming over, and she can be ready to assist us. Just take a few deep breaths, and remember, we're taking things one step at a time. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds better. Yes, please. Call the nurse. And… thank you. For being patient with me. And for explaining everything. I really appreciate it. This is… a lot less scary knowing someone is going to be there. Maybe. Just… please don't let them poke me too hard. And tell me when it’s going to happen. A warning, okay? I hate surprises.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. That's what I'm here for. And absolutely, I will make sure they warn you before each poke, and they will be as gentle as possible. Hi, this is Dr. Fourney. I have a patient, Bradlee Kochubey, who is a little anxious about getting his blood work done. Could you please have a nurse meet us in the lab across the hall?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s head over to the lab then. Just take your time, and remember, we're in this together. .
