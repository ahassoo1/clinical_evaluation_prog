DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rover, so what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, uh… it's about… long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. Said I needed to get looked at for… insurance. I don't really… remember all the details. It's a bit fuzzy, you know? I just… want to make sure things are okay for when… well, for later on.
DOCTOR: Right. “For later on.” Okay. So, it sounds like this is a preventative visit, prompted by your daughter, focusing on long-term care planning and insurance eligibility. And you're feeling a little unsure about why exactly you're here, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that sounds right. My daughter, bless her heart, she worries. She’s always takin’ care of things. I just… I get confused easy these days. Things don't stick like they used to. It's not a big deal, mostly. Just… hard to remember what folks tell me sometimes. So, insurance… is that about helpin’ with, you know, if I need… a place to stay later? Or somethin'?
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like memory concerns are a part of this, which is good to know. And yes, the insurance component is likely related to potential future long-term care needs – assisted living, nursing homes, or in-home care if that becomes necessary. To get a better picture of what’s going on and if you do qualify for any benefits, we need to do a bit of a check-up. I'll ask some questions about your overall health, and we’ll do a brief physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… take it slow, okay? And if I get somethin’ mixed up, just tell me. I won't be offended. I'm Cleo, by the way. Cleo Rover. It's… nice to meet you.
DOCTOR: It's nice to meet you too, Cleo. And absolutely, we'll take it slow. No need to rush, and please, don't hesitate to correct me if I'm not clear or if you need me to repeat anything. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Um… I used to. Dr. Hansen, back in… Anchorage. But that was… a while ago. I moved here after… after my wife passed. Haven’t really… kept up with it, to be honest. Just haven’t felt the need, you know? I try to stay active, do little jobs here and there, keep busy. But… I don’t really see a doctor much. Does that make sense? I forget to schedule things, mostly. And… it feels silly botherin’ them for nothin’.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Cleo. Many people fall out of routine with regular check-ups. And it's not silly to bother a doctor for anything, especially if you have concerns. Okay, so no regular doctor visits recently. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past that you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I broke my arm once, when I was a kid. Fallin’ out of a tree. And… I had my appendix out, a long time ago. That was… painful. Other than that… nothin’ major, I don't think. I had the flu a few times, like everyone else. And… my wife, she was sick for a while. But that wasn’t… me. Does that help? It’s… hard to remember. Everything feels so long ago now. Especially things that weren't… recent.
DOCTOR: Right. Broken arm as a child, appendectomy, and occasional flu. And your wife was ill. Okay. We'll try to get a more complete picture if we can, but that's a good start. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see… I take somethin’ for my knees. They get achy, you know, from the work. It’s… a white pill. I think it’s naproxen? Or somethin’ like that. My daughter gets it for me. And… sometimes I take Tylenol, for headaches. Other than that… no, not really. I don't like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel… funny. Especially those strong ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for knee pain, and Tylenol as needed for headaches. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… I don’t think so. Never been allergic to nothin’. But… I get a rash sometimes, if I spend too much time in the sun. But that's just… a sunburn, I guess. Not a real allergy. And… my wife, she was allergic to bee stings. But that wasn't me. I don't think I’ve ever had a bad reaction to anything. But… it’s been a while since anyone’s asked me that question. So… I could be wrong. Sorry. I get confused easy, like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Cleo. We're just trying to cover all the bases. Okay, so no known drug or food allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, and it… it wasn't a good sight. And… I don't drink much. Maybe a beer with supper once in a while, on a special occasion. But that's about it. And… no, definitely no… recreational drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I like my sleep too much. And… I gotta be clear-headed for work, you know? It's… important. I take pride in my work.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. Whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, okay? My back’s been a little sore lately, from liftin’ things. And… I don't like folks pokin’ around too much. But… I trust you. Go ahead. Just… let me know if you need me to do somethin’. Like… breathe deep or somethin’. I’m a bit… slow sometimes, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Just relax, and breathe normally. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs right now. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute. And I hear some mild crackling in your lower lungs, bilaterally. Now I’m going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Crackling? What does that mean? Is that… bad? I try to stay active, you know? I don't sit around much. I’m always movin’. I lift things, carry things… that’s how I make a livin’. Is the crackling… from that? I worry about my lungs. My grandfather had… somethin’ with his lungs. But I didn't smoke, like I said. Is it… serious? I’m gettin’ a bit… nervous now. Sorry. I… I don’t do well with… medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo, let’s not jump to conclusions. “Crackling” – it’s called rales, technically – can mean a few things. It could be related to your activity level, especially if you're lifting heavy objects. It can also be a sign of fluid buildup, or even just a little bit of congestion. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is 142/90, which is slightly elevated. That can be caused by stress, or… other factors. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen and check your reflexes. Just relax your stomach muscles.
PATIENT: Reflexes? What do you need reflexes for? I’m a laborer, not… I don’t know… a football player. I lift things, I carry things, I don’t need good reflexes. I need a strong back. Is this… is this really necessary? I’m gettin’ a headache now. And… my knees are achin’. I think I should probably… sit down. This is too much. I just wanted to get this insurance thing over with. So my daughter wouldn’t worry. This is… makin’ me worry. Can we just… skip the reflexes? Please? I’m not feelin’ so good. It’s… hard to explain. Just… kinda dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. You're right. Let's slow down. You're clearly feeling overwhelmed, and that's not helpful. We can skip the reflexes for now. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, and you're feeling dizzy, which tells me we need to take a different approach. Let's take a moment. I'm going to order some blood work to check your basic health, including kidney function, and we'll do a chest x-ray to get a better look at your lungs. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Is… is somethin’ wrong with my lungs? I thought you said it wasn’t serious. Now you’re talkin’ about x-rays. I don’t like x-rays. They… they give you cancer, don’t they? My wife… she had cancer. I don’t want an x-ray. I just want to go home. This is too much. I need to sit down. And… I need my daughter. Can I… can I call my daughter? I… I don’t feel so good. I think I’m gonna be sick. This is all… too much. I just wanted this insurance thing over with. This is… awful. I just wanna go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. You're right. This is too much. You're feeling anxious and overwhelmed, and we're not helping by rushing through this. You’re perfectly right to feel this way. We're going to stop everything right now. I'm going to get you a glass of water and a chair. No x-rays. No more tests. We'll focus on getting you feeling calmer. And yes, absolutely, you can call your daughter. We'll get a nurse to help you with that. First, let's just sit here for a minute and take some deep breaths. Okay?
PATIENT: Thank you. Thank you… I… I just… I get confused easy. And… I worry a lot. My daughter… she worries about me. And… I don't want to worry her. Just… a glass of water would be good. And… maybe just… sit for a little while. I… I don’t feel so good. This is… awful. Just… please. No more tests. Please. I just… wanna go home.
DOCTOR: You're right. No more tests. I promise. Just a glass of water. And we'll sit here. The nurse will be here any second. Just focus on your breathing, Cleo. Deep breath in… and out… That’s good. The nurse will help you call your daughter. And we'll figure things out. It's alright. You're safe here.
PATIENT: .
