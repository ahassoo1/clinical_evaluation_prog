DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit… strange, honestly. I've been feeling really tired and kind of yellow-looking, and it started after I ate some fava beans. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but that's when it really started becoming noticeable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Haggard. Feeling tired and noticing a yellowing of the skin – that’s something we definitely want to investigate. And it's helpful that you mentioned the fava beans. Just to clarify, when you say "yellow-looking", where are you noticing this the most?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. It’s mostly in my eyes, I think. And my skin feels… warm, and a little bit yellow overall, but the eyes are the most obvious part. It’s hard to tell exactly, maybe? It’s not like a bright yellow, more… a dull kind of shade. I noticed it in the mirror a couple of days ago and it scared me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Yellowing of the eyes, which we call jaundice, along with the skin changes you're describing, is something we need to take seriously. And noting that it began after consuming fava beans is quite important, Ms. Haggard. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, my stomach has been a bit upset, actually. Not full-on sick, but just… queasy, and a little bit of discomfort. And I’ve been feeling weaker than usual, not just tired, but like I don’t have much energy. Oh, and I think I've been a bit short of breath lately, too, but I thought that was just from walking up the stairs in my building. Is that all connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Haggard, those symptoms could certainly be connected. The upset stomach, weakness, and shortness of breath are all things we'll need to consider. To help me understand this further, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction, nothing like swelling or trouble breathing. I eat pretty much everything. That’s why this whole thing with the fava beans is so confusing! I’ve eaten them before, a few times even, and nothing ever happened. It's only been the last couple of weeks, maybe a month, that this started.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, Doctor, I’m not on any regular medication. I take a multivitamin every other day, just a standard one, nothing special. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. Otherwise, no, nothing at all. I try to stay as natural as possible, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for that information, Ms. Haggard. Given your symptoms – the tiredness, yellowing of the skin and eyes, stomach upset, weakness, and shortness of breath – and the association with fava bean consumption, I'm concerned about a possible enzymatic deficiency called G6PD deficiency. It’s a genetic condition that can cause a reaction to certain foods, medications, or infections. To confirm this, I'd like to perform a physical exam and order a blood test to check your G6PD levels and other relevant markers. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency… that sounds a bit scary. But yes, Doctor, if that’s what you think is best, please go ahead. A physical exam and blood test sound fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on and feel better. I’ve never been really sick before, so this is all a little worrying. What exactly will the physical exam involve?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Haggard. It’s good we're addressing this proactively. It's often manageable once diagnosed. The physical exam will be fairly standard. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver or spleen, and examine your skin for signs of jaundice or other abnormalities. I’ll also check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. I’ll also gently palpate your abdomen. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Before we begin, do you have any questions about the exam or the blood test?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything you've explained. Checking my heart and lungs and looking at my skin sounds… normal enough. And the blood test… well, I don’t love needles, but I’ll manage. I suppose it’s necessary. Should I eat anything special before the blood test, or avoid anything? Like, should I definitely stay away from fava beans for now?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Haggard. Yes, for now, it's best to avoid fava beans completely until we have the results of the blood test. Also, please avoid any medications containing oxidising agents if possible - those are often used in cold and flu remedies. You don't need to fast before the blood test, but please drink plenty of water. And no need to worry too much about the needle, we'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you're comfortable, let's start with the physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. The sooner I know what’s happening, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please sit or lie down on the examination table, that would be great. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds, like murmurs or wheezes. Take deep breaths for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezes or crackles detected. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement of the liver or spleen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t detect any significant tenderness or enlargement. Although, there’s a slight discomfort in the upper right quadrant when I press, but it’s very mild.
PATIENT: Okay, I did feel a tiny bit of something when you pressed there, on the right side. It’s not really painful, just… aware of it, I guess. Like a dull ache, very faint. It comes and goes. I haven’t really paid much attention to it before.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Haggard. That’s helpful information. Mild discomfort in the upper right quadrant, intermittent… It could be related to a number of things, including your liver. Given your symptoms and this finding, it reinforces my concern about investigating potential causes for your jaundice and fatigue. Now, I’ll just take a quick look at your skin and eyes again to assess the extent of the yellowing. The jaundice is noticeable in your sclera – the whites of your eyes are definitely yellowish – and your skin has a pale, yellowish tinge overall. It's not severe, but it’s present. Now, I’m going to order a blood test to check your G6PD levels, liver function, complete blood count, and bilirubin levels. The results should be available in a couple of days. Do you have any questions before I send you to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything. Liver function, G6PD, bilirubin… it all sounds very serious. A couple of days… that feels like a long time to wait, but I suppose it is what it is. So, just to be clear, you think this could be a problem with my liver because of the beans? And the G6PD thing could explain why the beans are causing problems? Is that right? And will the blood test definitely tell us what’s going on?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good summary, Ms. Haggard. Yes, it’s possible the fava beans are triggering a reaction due to a potential G6PD deficiency, which affects how your red blood cells process certain substances. This can cause a buildup of bilirubin, leading to the jaundice and other symptoms you're experiencing. The blood test will give us a clearer picture. The G6PD level will tell us if you have a deficiency. The liver function tests will assess if your liver is functioning normally. The complete blood count will check for any signs of anemia or other abnormalities. The bilirubin levels will confirm the presence and severity of the jaundice. While it won't necessarily give us a definitive answer immediately, it will help us narrow down the possibilities and guide our next steps. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we'll investigate this thoroughly. I’ll give you a lab requisition form and instructions. The lab technician will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. Do you have any difficulty with blood draws or any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, no problems with blood draws. And I don't have any latex allergies. I’ve given blood before, so I know what to expect. Okay, so I just go to the lab and they'll take some blood. Then I wait for the results. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Like, any foods I should avoid besides the beans, or anything I should be watching out for? I’m a little worried about getting worse before I know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a very reasonable question. For now, continue to avoid fava beans. I also recommend avoiding foods and drinks high in oxidising agents, as those could potentially exacerbate a reaction if you do have a G6PD deficiency. This includes things like grapefruit juice, and certain herbal supplements. I can provide a list if you’d like. More importantly, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any of the following, go to the emergency room immediately: Severe abdominal pain Dark urine Pale stools Fever Difficulty breathing Confusion or drowsiness Otherwise, try to rest and stay hydrated. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for a few days after you receive the blood test results, so we can discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Rest, hydration, avoid certain foods, and watch out for those symptoms. And a follow-up appointment when the results are in. Okay, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I feel a little bit better knowing what we’re looking for. I appreciate you taking the time. I guess I’ll go to the lab now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggard. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
