DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Alanes, it's nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… off. Really off, for a bit now. I keep getting diarrhea, and it's just… persistent. I remember the doctor mentioning something about… something I can’t quite recall… something with how I digest food? It's been going on for a while, and it's getting pretty annoying, to be honest. I'm married, by the way, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, "off" and persistent diarrhea. And you mentioned a previous doctor discussed something related to digestion. Do you recall approximately when this started, Jase?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? That's tricky. I'm really bad with dates. I want to say… maybe a few months ago? It wasn't sudden, it kind of… gradually got worse. I'm not sure exactly when though. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like it's been a really long time, but time just… blurs together sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. “A few months ago, gradually worsening” is helpful enough. And yes, time can certainly blur. Can you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Um… well, it's… watery, mostly. Sometimes it's just a few times a day, other times it feels like I’m constantly running to the bathroom. It doesn't usually have… anything alarming in it, if you know what I mean. Just… watery. And it makes me feel really tired afterwards, like all the energy’s been drained out of me. And sometimes my stomach cramps really bad before it happens. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jase. Watery stools, frequency varying, no blood or alarming matter noted, fatigue afterwards, and abdominal cramping preceding the diarrhea. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this, such as nausea, vomiting, fever, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… maybe? It’s hard to tell, I haven't really been keeping track. I feel a little thinner, but I also haven't been eating as much because… well, because of my stomach. I haven’t had a fever or been sick, though. No vomiting, either. Sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but that usually goes away pretty quickly. I'm on Medicare, by the way, if that changes anything?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jase. Knowing you’re on Medicare is helpful for billing purposes. And it’s good to know you haven’t experienced fever or vomiting. You mentioned not eating as much due to your stomach issues. Has there been any change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, my appetite has definitely gone down. I used to eat pretty normally, but now I just don’t feel hungry as often. And when I do eat, it feels like my stomach can’t handle much. Certain foods just… don’t sit well, you know? I don’t really know which foods anymore, it just feels like a guessing game. I try to stick to bland things, but even those sometimes cause problems. It's just really frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jase. A decreased appetite and difficulty tolerating foods are certainly concerning. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… oh dear. That’s… tricky. I know the doctor did mention something before, about… something with how my body processes food. I think it was a long word… something about being intolerant to something. And I think it involved tests? But honestly, it's all a bit blurry. I've had the usual things, colds and flu, but nothing major. I’m married, so my husband might remember more details if that helps? I think it had something to do with my stomach when I was younger, too. But I really don't have a good memory for all that stuff. Sorry, I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s common to forget details, especially regarding past medical issues. Your husband’s recollection would be helpful, and we can certainly look into your records if you’d like. Do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No known allergies, no. And no medications either. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I've been trying to just… manage it on my own, mostly. Just eating bland food and trying not to stress about it. But it’s not really working, which is why I’m here. I just want to feel normal again. Is Medicare okay with covering tests, by the way? I worry about bills sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no known allergies or medications. We can definitely discuss coverage for tests with Medicare, Jase. That’s part of my job, to help navigate those things. Now, to get a clearer understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. A physical exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Just… try to be gentle, please? My stomach’s been pretty sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jase. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. First, let’s start by having you lie down on the examination table, if you’re comfortable doing so. I'll begin by listening to your bowel sounds. Okay. Your bowel sounds are… slightly hyperactive, which can be consistent with diarrhea. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that’s a little tender. Not awful, but… yeah, definitely feels a bit sensitive there. Everything else feels okay, I think. It's hard to tell, honestly, because my whole stomach is kind of sore. But that spot… yeah, that's a bit worse. It feels… crampy, even when you're not pressing on it. Is that bad? I'm on Medicare, so I hope any further tests are covered. I just want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know, Jase. Tenderness in the lower left quadrant, along with the cramping you describe, is significant. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. I don’t detect any rebound tenderness or guarding, which is reassuring. Based on your symptoms and this brief examination, I suspect you may have Irritable Bowel Syndrome or possibly some degree of inflammatory bowel disease. However, we need to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work and a stool sample to assess for inflammation, infection, and malabsorption. I also recommend a colonoscopy to visually examine your colon and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… oh dear. That sounds… intense. I’ve heard those aren’t very pleasant. Blood work and a stool sample, that’s okay, I guess. But a colonoscopy… is that absolutely necessary? I'm on Medicare, so I'm worried about the cost. And honestly, the thought of it just makes me nervous. Is there anything else we could try first? I just want to feel better, but I’m not sure I can handle a colonoscopy. What would happen if I just… waited to see if it gets better on its own?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Jase. A colonoscopy is not the most pleasant procedure, and it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous about it. However, it’s the gold standard for ruling out more serious conditions, such as colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. Waiting to see if it gets better on its own is an option, but it could delay a diagnosis and potentially allow a more serious condition to progress. Considering your persistent symptoms, weight loss, and tenderness in the lower left quadrant, I strongly recommend proceeding with the colonoscopy for diagnostic clarity. We can discuss the preparation process in detail, and I can assure you we'll do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. Medicare does typically cover colonoscopies for appropriate indications, and we'll verify your coverage beforehand. Before we proceed, let’s discuss some alternative options. We could start with a trial of dietary modifications and a medication to help manage your diarrhea symptoms. However, if your symptoms don’t improve or worsen, a colonoscopy will still be necessary. Would you like to explore those options first?
PATIENT: Okay… dietary modifications and medication first sounds… less scary. Yes, let’s try that. What kind of dietary changes are we talking about? And what medication would you recommend? Something gentle, if possible. I just… I really don’t want to go through a colonoscopy if I don't have to. And can we definitely check with Medicare before anything happens? I just want to be prepared for the cost. I'm on Medicare, so it's a bit of a concern, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. We will definitely check with Medicare before proceeding with any tests or procedures. Your financial concerns are completely valid, and we’ll make sure you’re fully informed about the costs involved. Alright, let's discuss dietary modifications. I recommend starting with a low-FODMAP diet. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides, and Polyols. Essentially, it involves reducing certain types of carbohydrates that can trigger IBS symptoms. I can provide you with a list of foods to avoid and foods that are generally well-tolerated. As for medication, I recommend starting with Loperamide, an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication. It can help slow down bowel movements and reduce the frequency of diarrhea. It’s generally well-tolerated, but it’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. We can also consider a low dose of Hyoscyamine, which is an anticholinergic medication that can help reduce abdominal cramping. However, it can cause some side effects, such as dry mouth and constipation, so we’ll start with a low dose and monitor your response. I'll write you a prescription for Hyoscyamine, and I'll provide you with detailed instructions on the low-FODMAP diet and the use of Loperamide. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response to these treatments. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Two weeks is fine. A prescription for Hyoscyamine and the diet instructions… okay. I’ll try my best to follow everything. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any warning signs I should look out for that mean I need to see a doctor sooner? I'm on Medicare, so I want to make sure I'm using it wisely and not waiting too long if something gets really bad.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Jase. It’s important to be aware of potential warning signs. If you experience any of the following, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room: High fever Bloody stools Severe abdominal pain that doesn’t improve with medication Persistent vomiting Inability to keep down fluids Significant weight loss These symptoms could indicate a more serious condition, such as an infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or a blockage in your intestines. We’ll also need to monitor your response to the medication. If you experience any side effects, such as severe constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, or difficulty urinating, please let me know immediately. I'm confident we can manage your symptoms with these treatments. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Alanes. You've been very helpful. And you explained everything really well. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and not rushing me. I'll try my best to follow your instructions and I'll be sure to contact you if anything gets worse. I'm on Medicare, so I'll keep that in mind too. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you the best of luck with the dietary modifications and medication. Have a good day, Jase.
