DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's this…problem. It’s been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested, and it just…won't stop. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, really.
DOCTOR: Well, embarrassment doesn’t get anyone better, does it?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Look, I don’t have time for a lot of…chat. I work for a living, you know? I paint houses. It's not exactly a job you can do running to the bathroom every hour. What do you need to know, just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Right. Practical. Very well. Let’s start with…when did this “problem” begin, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. It was…sometime in July, I guess. Maybe the beginning of the month? It started kinda slow, just a little upset stomach. I figured it was something I ate. But then it just got worse and worse. It's been pretty constant since then, just varying degrees of…bad. I don't keep a calendar of my bowel movements, if that's what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: No, no, a calendar isn't necessary. Just trying to get a timeframe. And “varying degrees of bad” isn't terribly helpful, Ms. Woodring. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, it's diarrhea. A lot of it. Sometimes it’s watery, sometimes…not so much. And it’s frequent. Like, multiple times a day. It’s not just a little rumble in the tummy, it’s…debilitating. Happy now? I don't need a detailed description of the consistency, I just know it’s awful and it won't go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I see you have a history of…well, not much in the way of medical problems, according to this. Any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. A little nauseous sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up. Just…really weak and tired. And constantly running to the bathroom. I've lost a few pounds too, which is not a good thing when you’re doing physical labor all day. It's affecting my work, you know. I can't keep climbing ladders if I'm…indisposed.
DOCTOR: Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: No. Look, I would know if there was blood. I'm not an idiot. It’s just…diarrhea. A lot of it. I’ve already said that. I don’t understand why I have to answer a million questions about it. Are you going to give me something that actually works, or are we just going to sit here all day?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I’m trying to gather information to determine the cause of this diarrhea, not simply treat the symptom. It’s important. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No! I haven't been anywhere. I live here, I work here. Rural, remember? Where am I going to travel to? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I've tried over-the-counter stuff, it's not working, and now you're grilling me like I'm a criminal. Just…give me something stronger. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then we’ll talk about possible medications. But I need to rule out a few things first. Lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry it up, will you? I have a job to get to.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is…tender, especially in the lower left quadrant. No masses that I can feel. Bowel sounds are…hyperactive. And you're significantly dehydrated. Have you been able to keep any fluids down?
PATIENT: A little. Mostly water. Soda, sometimes. But it goes right through me, if you know what I mean. It's like…it doesn’t even stay in my system for five minutes. And I'm tired of drinking water! It doesn't help. It just makes me have to…go more. Honestly, I feel awful. Weak, shaky, and completely exhausted. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't be wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given the dehydration and persistent diarrhea, I’m going to order a stool sample to rule out any infection. And I'm going to start you on an IV to rehydrate you. It’s likely a viral gastroenteritis, but we need to confirm. And frankly, given your symptoms, I'm not comfortable sending you back to work just yet. You need fluids, rest, and we need to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Ugh, an IV? Really? Look, I don’t do hospitals. I have a schedule. And a job. I can’t just…lay around all day getting poked with needles. Is there anything else? A stronger pill? Something I can take and just…get better? I don't have time for all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand you have a busy schedule. However, you are significantly dehydrated and could become seriously ill if this isn't addressed properly. A pill isn't going to fix this. I’m ordering the IV fluids now. It's the quickest way to get you rehydrated and feeling better. I also want you to take it easy for the next 24 hours. No heavy lifting. No climbing ladders. We'll get the stool sample done quickly, and then we can determine the best course of action. I'm not guessing here, Ms. Woodring; I'm trying to help.
PATIENT: Fine! Just…get it over with. But if I lose a day’s pay because of this, I’m holding you personally responsible. Just…do it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, the fluids are starting. It’ll take a few hours to rehydrate you. I’ll also need a stool sample now. There’s a collection kit in the bathroom. Please bring it back when you're finished. And try to relax. It will make things easier. .
