DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, as the paperwork states, I requested a general wellness check. Just hoping to get a good look at how things are holding up, if you understand. I like to stay on top of these things, you see. Preventative care is very important, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Mombrun, I couldn't agree more. Preventative care is vital. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Not particularly, no. I've been quite fortunate, really. I had the usual childhood things – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. As an adult, just the occasional bad cold, nothing that required a visit to the hospital. I broke my wrist once, helping a friend with some roofing, but that was decades ago. It healed up perfectly fine, thanks to a good doctor in Caracas. It was a bit of a foolish endeavor in retrospect.
DOCTOR: Good to hear it healed well. And no surgeries at all, even the wrist?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no surgeries on the wrist or anywhere else, thankfully. Just a cast for a few weeks. My wife, Elena, always said I was too stubborn to let anyone operate on me! She's a practical woman, that one. Always looking out for me. She’s the one who encouraged me to schedule this check-up, actually. Said it was time to be sensible.
DOCTOR: Wives are often right, aren't they?
PATIENT: You are absolutely correct, Doctor! Elena has a very… discerning perspective. I’ve learned to trust her judgment implicitly over the years. She keeps me grounded, you see. Now, what about medications? Are you currently taking anything, even over-the-counter remedies regularly?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No medications currently. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I’ve ever known of, at least. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, traveling as I have, and never had a reaction. Shellfish, nuts, pollen... everything seems to agree with me. I suppose I could say I’m quite lucky in that regard as well. Though, I do try to avoid overly processed foods. Elena is quite strict about that, too!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies, good to know. And you mentioned traveling – do you currently travel much, or was that more in the past?
PATIENT: Mostly in the past, Doctor. I used to travel quite extensively for work – construction projects all over Venezuela, and even a few stints in Colombia. Now, Elena and I prefer shorter trips, mostly to visit family in Maracaibo. It's become a bit more difficult to get around, you understand. The knees aren't what they used to be. But we still enjoy seeing the world when we can, even if it’s just a drive to the coast.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Let's talk a bit about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, and my mother had arthritis in her later years. It wasn't terribly severe, but it did slow her down. As for my grandparents… I don’t recall any major illnesses, truthfully. They both lived long lives, but it was a long time ago, and records weren’t kept as meticulously back then. My sister, Isabel, she had some trouble with her cholesterol, but she managed it with diet and exercise. Otherwise, we've been a fairly healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And, just to get a complete picture, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Elena wouldn’t allow it! She’s quite adamant about healthy living, as you might have gathered. I enjoy a good cup of coffee, and perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s the extent of my vices. I always believed in taking care of my body. A strong body is a happy body, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: I absolutely agree. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just standard things – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your abdomen. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I have no objections whatsoever. Please, proceed at your leisure. I trust your professional judgment entirely. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your heart. Take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs sound clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Ears appear normal, tympanic membranes are clear. Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do feel a little… fullness sometimes after meals, but no real pain or tenderness. Please proceed. I will let you know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. I always appreciate a thorough assessment. It's reassuring to know everything is in working order, or to identify any potential issues early on.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-distended, no guarding or rebound tenderness. I do note some mild resistance in the lower quadrants, but nothing overly concerning given your age and reported fullness. Lymph nodes are normal in size and consistency. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Okay, Mr. Mombrun, physically everything seems within normal limits, though the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. I’d like to order some routine blood work, just to get a baseline and check your cholesterol, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds very sensible, Doctor. Monitoring the blood pressure is a good idea, and the blood work will give us a more complete picture, as you say. I am happy to comply with any recommendations you have. Elena will be pleased to know we are being proactive. She always says prevention is better than cure. Now, will you be sending me to a separate lab for the blood work, or can it be done here?
DOCTOR: We can do it right here in the clinic, Mr. Mombrun. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly. It will just be a standard draw, and shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. While we wait, do you have any concerns or questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your patience and attentiveness. Fifteen minutes is no trouble at all. Perhaps while we wait, you could tell me a little about yourself? You mentioned being from Norway, is that correct? It must be a beautiful country. I’ve always wanted to visit.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am originally from Norway. It is a beautiful country, though very cold! I moved here about ten years ago for a position at the hospital. It's certainly different than the fjords and mountains back home, but I enjoy it here. I specialize in Family Medicine, so I enjoy taking care of patients of all ages and backgrounds. It’s a rewarding field. Ah, here’s the phlebotomist now, to get you started with the blood work. We’ll take things from there. Do you have any questions before they come in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I’m all set. I appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions as well. It’s comforting to know I’m in capable hands. Please, let me know if there's anything I should do to prepare, or if there are any special instructions for after the blood work.
DOCTOR: Just try to relax, and sit comfortably. The phlebotomist will explain everything to you. After the blood work, just apply a little pressure to the site for a few minutes to prevent bruising. Avoid heavy lifting with that arm for the rest of the day. Otherwise, you should be fine. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and clear instructions. I’m ready when you are. Thank you both. .
