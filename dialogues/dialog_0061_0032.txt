DOCTOR: Bula! And hello to you. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Mr. Krok. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, well. It’s… a delicate matter, Doctor. A most unpleasant matter, really. I haven’t… experienced this in quite some time, not since… well, a very long time ago. It’s a discharge, you see. From… down there. It’s rather bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. A woman, always fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing a discharge and it's causing you some concern, and your wife encouraged you to get it checked out. That's good of her! It is always best to get these things looked at. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More details. Always more details. Well… it’s… wet. Naturally. That's what a discharge is, isn’t it? It's not a particularly large amount, thankfully. Just… noticeable. And… slightly discolored. Not bright red, thankfully. More… off-white, I suppose. Or a pale yellow. It's difficult to say, really. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be. And there’s… a slight odor. Not terrible, mind you, but… present. I certainly wouldn’t call it pleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Krok. It sounds like it’s a pale yellow or off-white discharge with a slight odor. Not a large amount, but enough to notice. And you said you haven’t experienced this in a long time?
PATIENT: Yes, a very long time. Decades, I should think. When I was… younger, of course. Before I was married, even. A different life entirely. It was… a different time, you understand. Things were… less discussed. One didn’t simply go to the doctor for these sorts of things. One suffered in silence, or… found other solutions.
DOCTOR: I understand. Times have certainly changed, and it’s good that you’re comfortable coming in to discuss this with me now. It's much better to address things directly. Now, has there been any pain, burning, or itching associated with this discharge?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… not precisely pain. More… discomfort. A slight stinging sensation, perhaps, when… well, when I urinate. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… an annoyance. Itching, no. Not that I’ve noticed. Though my back does ache a bit these days, but that’s just old age, I suspect. And perhaps a bit too much gardening. I do enjoy puttering about in the yard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no real pain, just some discomfort or a stinging sensation when you urinate. And the backache you attribute to gardening and age, which makes sense. Now, Mr. Krok, do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. My wife has been remarking that I’ve been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, she says. I do take my naps, you understand. A man needs his rest. And… my appetite hasn’t been quite what it used to be. Though, to be fair, the food these days isn’t what it used to be either. Everything tastes… bland.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness and a decreased appetite. And you've noticed the food doesn't taste as good as it used to. I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history. A long and tedious subject. Let me see… The doctor, back in Iran, he told me my blood pressure was a bit high at one point, many years ago. They put me on a little pill for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Seemed to make me feel… sluggish. And my wife insists I have a touch of arthritis, but I don’t see it. Just a bit of stiffness in the mornings. Nothing a good stretch can’t fix. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. I do enjoy a sweet pastry now and then, but who doesn’t?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you managed for a while, and some stiffness that your wife attributes to arthritis. No known diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Yes, actually. When I was quite young, I had my appendix removed. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… Oh, yes. A hernia repair, many years later. Something to do with lifting heavy farm equipment, I believe. My wife insisted I take it easy after that, but a man has work to do, you understand. One doesn’t simply stop working because of a little discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had your appendix removed and a hernia repair. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides what you previously mentioned briefly for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the occasional aspirin for a headache. And my wife gives me a multivitamin every morning. Says it’s good for my health. She’s very insistent about that. Oh, and a little something for my… waterworks. Makes it easier to… empty things. She picked it up at the pharmacy. I don’t pay much attention to the names. Little pills, all the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, so aspirin as needed, a multivitamin, and a medication for your prostate, which your wife helps you manage. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. Though I do find that certain pollens make my eyes itch a bit in the springtime. But that’s just a minor annoyance. My wife gives me some eye drops for that. And… Oh, I recall once having a bit of a rash after eating some shellfish, many years ago. But I haven't eaten shellfish since. Best to avoid things that don’t agree with you, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mild pollen allergies that you manage with eye drops, and a past reaction to shellfish. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a rather long and complicated story. My father… he lived to a ripe old age, thankfully. Though he suffered from… some sort of heart trouble in his later years. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young. I don’t recall much about her health, to be honest. And my siblings… well, we’ve scattered to the four winds. I haven’t seen most of them in decades. I believe one of my brothers had some trouble with his… sugar levels, perhaps? But I’m not entirely sure. My wife would know more about these things. She has a very good memory for family matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father had heart trouble, and one of your brothers may have had diabetes. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father was very strict about that. Drink alcohol… Occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner. A small glass, mind you. Mostly for the taste. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. A man has to keep a clear head, you understand. Especially when dealing with farm equipment. A dangerous profession, you know. One wrong move…
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, occasional small glass of wine, and no recreational drugs. Alright, Mr. Krok, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much better picture of your overall health. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well… I suppose so. I’m not particularly fond of being poked and prodded, but if it will help… Very well. Just… try to be gentle, please. And do let me know what you’re doing before you do it. I do prefer to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything as I go and be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Then I'll check your abdomen. After that, I'll need to do a quick external exam of the genital area. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. The genital area… Well. That is rather… personal. But if it’s necessary… Very well. Just… try not to take too long, please. And do be discreet. One doesn’t simply discuss these things with strangers, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your concern, and I will be as quick and discreet as possible. Your heart and lungs sound okay, though your heart rate is a little slow. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Abdomen… Gentle palpation… Hmm. No, not particularly. A little tender here and there, perhaps. But that’s just from years of… bending and lifting, I suspect. Nothing to worry about. I do have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. Easily upset.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, if you would please lie on your back, I will need to quickly examine your genital area. I'll be looking for any signs of inflammation, discharge, or abnormalities. I'll explain everything before I do it. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Lie on my back… This is rather awkward. Very well. But do be quick, please. And do explain everything as you go. I do prefer to know what’s happening. A man likes to be informed, you understand. And… try not to make a mess, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible and explain everything. I'm just looking at the area now. I notice a small amount of pale yellow discharge, as you described. There is some mild redness around the opening of the urethra. I don't see any obvious sores or lesions. There is some tenderness when I palpate along the urethra. It doesn’t seem to be a significant amount of pain, but you are sensitive to the touch in that area, which is consistent with your report. Okay, Mr. Krok. Thank you for your patience. That completes the physical exam. I have a better idea of what's going on now.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That was… unpleasant. But I suppose it had to be done. So, what did you find? Is it something serious? Do I need… injections? Or surgery? My wife will be most insistent if it comes to surgery.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krok. It wasn’t a pleasant exam, I agree. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have urethritis – an inflammation of the urethra. The redness and tenderness, along with the discharge, are consistent with that. It's not necessarily serious in the sense that it’s life-threatening, but it does need to be treated. It could be caused by a few different things – most commonly a bacterial infection, but sometimes it can be caused by irritation or, less commonly, sexually transmitted infections. We're going to need to get a urine sample to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. And yes, it is very likely to require antibiotics. We will want to rule out other causes, but we will start with antibiotics. Thankfully, it typically doesn’t require surgery or injections. Antibiotics are usually very effective. We will need a urine sample to determine which antibiotic is most appropriate. Would you be able to provide a urine sample for me now?
PATIENT: Oh. Antibiotics… Well, that’s… a relief. I do dislike the thought of injections. And surgery… absolutely not. A little pill, then? Yes, that I can manage. A urine sample… Yes, I suppose so. Where do I… Well, it’s been a while since I last had to provide one. Do you have one of those… containers? And… instructions? A man is not accustomed to this sort of thing, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand. We have a sterile collection cup and I will walk you through the instructions. Here's what I'd like you to do. First, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Then, clean the area around the opening of your urethra with the antiseptic wipe I'll provide. This will help prevent contamination. After that, relax and allow a small amount of urine to flow into the cup. Try to catch the midstream – the urine that comes out after the initial stream. Then, carefully tighten the lid on the cup and bring it back to me. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Midstream… Midstream. Hmm. That sounds… complicated. And antiseptic… Is that safe? Won’t it sting? I do have… sensitive skin, you see. And I’m rather unsteady on my feet these days. I wouldn’t want to make a mess. Perhaps… could you demonstrate? Or at least provide a diagram? A man likes to understand what he’s doing, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand your concerns. Let me demonstrate. You’ll start by washing your hands thoroughly. Then, use the antiseptic wipe to clean the area – just gently wipe from front to back. This is to remove any bacteria that could contaminate the sample. Now, when you urinate, let the initial stream go into the toilet. Then, collect the midstream – the urine that follows. You only need about an ounce or two – just enough to fill the cup about halfway. Try not to touch the inside of the cup to prevent contamination. And if you’re unsteady, please take your time and let me know if you need assistance. We can always try again if necessary. Would you like me to show you the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that is helpful. A diagram, and a demonstration… Yes, that clarifies things considerably. The bathroom… Yes, if you wouldn’t mind. I’m not particularly familiar with the layout of this establishment. And… perhaps a steadying hand? Just in case. A man doesn’t like to ask for assistance, but… well. It’s better to be safe than sorry, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Absolutely. Here we are. The bathroom is just here. I will wait just outside for you. Please take your time, and let me know if you need anything at all. Don't hesitate to call out if you have any trouble. I will be right here.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. A man appreciates a helping hand.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Doctor. That was… uneventful, thankfully. Here you are. I do hope it’s sufficient. A man isn’t accustomed to these sorts of procedures, you understand.
PATIENT: Thank you, Mr. Krok. Yes, this looks perfect. Now, we will send this off to the lab for testing. It typically takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic, just to get started. It’s better to be proactive, you understand. If the lab results indicate a different antibiotic is needed, we can adjust the prescription accordingly. Do you have any allergies to any medications? And do you have a preferred pharmacy?
DOCTOR: Oh. Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything. And my preferred pharmacy… Yes, there’s a small one down the street – Miller’s Pharmacy. Old Mr. Miller is a good man. Knows everyone in town, you understand.
PATIENT: Excellent. Miller's Pharmacy it is. Here you are. This should be good for a ten-day course of treatment. Take it as directed, even if you start feeling better before you finish the course. It's important to complete the entire course to ensure the infection is completely cleared. Now, a few final instructions. Drink plenty of fluids – water, juice, anything to keep you hydrated. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the urethra. And if you experience any side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, or a rash, stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
DOCTOR: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything rather thoroughly. Drink plenty of fluids… Avoid caffeine… Complete the course… Yes, I think I can manage that. You’ve been very patient and understanding, Doctor. A man appreciates that. It’s not easy discussing these… delicate matters. Thank you for your assistance. I do feel considerably better knowing what’s going on and what needs to be done.
PATIENT: You are very welcome, Mr. Krok. It’s my pleasure to help. And please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns or questions in the future. We're here to help, you understand. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. I hope you feel better soon.
