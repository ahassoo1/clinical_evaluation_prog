DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Soodeen. I see you're here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it's good for everything. I simply want to know if I qualify. At my age, one likes to be prepared, you understand. And frankly, I don't want to be left behind.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential treatment option. To determine if you qualify, we'll need to discuss your current health status and any conditions you may have. We'll follow the guidelines established by the state, of course. First, can you tell me a bit about what specifically you're hoping it would help with?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, that’s a rather…direct question. My daughter says it helps with…well, everything. But I haven't been specifically diagnosed with needing help with anything. I simply read an article – a very reputable article, I assure you – about its preventative qualities. It's about staying ahead of things. You know, maintaining…vigilance. Is that sufficient? Or do I need to invent a complaint?
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Ranells. It's good you're being proactive about your health. However, medical marijuana authorization requires a qualifying medical condition, as defined by state law. It isn’t prescribed for preventative purposes alone. To clarify, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or have you been diagnosed with a medical condition – such as chronic pain, arthritis, glaucoma, or another condition covered under the state’s medical marijuana program?
PATIENT: Chronic pain? Heavens, no. I may be 74, but I still do my own gardening, thank you very much. Arthritis? A little stiffness, perhaps, after a long weeding session, but nothing a warm bath can't fix. Glaucoma? I have my eyes checked regularly, and they’re perfectly fine. This isn't about being sick, Doctor. It’s about…future-proofing. Honestly, all this paperwork for something so…sensible is quite ridiculous. Are you certain there isn't some exception for…discerning individuals?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ranells. Unfortunately, state regulations are quite specific. Without a qualifying medical condition, I'm unable to authorize a medical marijuana card. Let's review your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you had any other significant health issues in the past – perhaps heart problems, lung conditions, diabetes, or any neurological concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. My blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but my regular doctor manages it with a small pill. And I had a touch of bronchitis when I was traveling in the Caribbean last winter, but that cleared up with rest and a good strong tea. Other than that… nothing. I’ve always been a very healthy woman. Perhaps…perhaps you could just make a note that I’m a particularly robust 74-year-old and that should suffice? Really, all this questioning feels rather…intrusive.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Ranells. So, you have managed hypertension and a history of bronchitis. And you generally consider yourself to be in good health. Just to be complete, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Years ago, when I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. And…and when I broke my wrist falling off a horse, goodness, that was decades ago! A minor fracture, really. And I was in the hospital for a few days with a bad bout of the flu back in…oh, I don't even recall the year. But nothing serious. Truly, Doctor, I am a remarkably healthy woman for my age. Are we getting anywhere with this? Because frankly, I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I appreciate your patience. However, based on the information you've provided – your generally good health, managed hypertension, and history of tonsillectomy and a past wrist fracture – you do not meet the criteria for medical marijuana authorization under state law. I understand you are interested in being proactive about your health, but medical marijuana is intended for specific, diagnosed conditions. I am happy to discuss other preventative health measures that might be appropriate for you, such as lifestyle modifications or recommended screenings. However, I cannot, in good conscience, authorize a card without a qualifying medical condition. Would you like to discuss those options?
PATIENT: Well. I must say, I am rather disappointed. All this time, and for what? It seems a complete waste of my afternoon. Lifestyle modifications? Screenings? Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own lifestyle. And I have regular check-ups with my primary physician, thank you very much. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though, frankly, it was rather unproductive. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Ranells. I understand your disappointment. If you develop any new or concerning symptoms in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out to your primary care physician. Have a pleasant afternoon. .
