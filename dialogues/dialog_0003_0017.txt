DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Uh... well, the young man at the desk said something about a check-up. For… sports. I think. It’s for a team. A baseball team, maybe? Honestly, things are a little fuzzy these days. I just want to make sure I’m… able. You understand? Able to play.
DOCTOR: A sports physical, then. Right. I see a note here… vaguely. And you’re 51, correct?
PATIENT: Fifty-one, yes. That sounds about right. Though time… it flies, doesn’t it? I used to be a much stronger man, you know. A real athlete. Not like these kids today. All… soft. But yes, fifty-one. Is that a problem? Should I be… younger? I don't quite follow.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, simply confirming. It’s… standard procedure. We have slightly different protocols for patients of different ages. Now, let’s get some basics down. Have you been experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Well, my back gets a little stiff after a long day. And my knees… they aren't what they used to be, naturally. But pain, like real pain? Not really. Just… old age, I suppose. Is that what you’re asking about? Because if so, yes. Everything hurts a little when you get older, Doctor. It's just... life.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications for this… stiffness, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… …My daughter, she gives me things sometimes. Little pills. For my… pressure, maybe? Or cholesterol? I don’t really keep track. She handles all that. I just… take them. Is that alright? Should I have a list? I don’t recall having a list.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful, Mr. Bartok, if you knew what you were ingesting. We need accurate information for your safety. Do you recall the names of any of these medications?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I’m here to see if I am safe enough to play baseball, not to recite a pharmacy catalog. My daughter… she’s very organized. She tells me what to take, when to take it. Honestly, I just try to stay out of her way. Names? No. Little white pills, mostly. And sometimes a yellow one. Is that enough? Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat… mostly everything. Except maybe oysters. Those always tasted a little funny. And I think I got a rash once from poison ivy when I was a boy, but that wasn’t a medication, was it? Is dust an allergy? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes, don’t they? This is getting… complicated. I just want to play a little baseball, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's just perform a basic physical exam. It will give us a clearer picture. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. It's standard, even if you're only playing… baseball.
PATIENT: Lie down? Like… like a patient? Is that really necessary? I feel perfectly fine. Can’t you just… ask me some more questions? Or maybe just watch me swing a bat? I’m sure that would tell you everything you need to know. I don't like being poked and prodded, Doctor. It’s undignified. But… alright. If you insist. Just be gentle, please. And quick. This is a very uncomfortable table.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, Mr. Bartok. In and out. Now, I’m hearing… some slight wheezing. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, or a persistent cough?
PATIENT: Wheezing? I don’t know what that is. I cough sometimes, yes. Everyone coughs in the winter. It’s the cold. And I do get a little… winded, after I climb the stairs. But I’m not sick. I just… get older. Is that what you’re looking for? A reason to tell me I can’t play baseball? Because honestly, Doctor, that’s a little rude. You’re pressing very hard.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is also a bit elevated. And I'm detecting some… irregular rhythm. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart condition?
PATIENT: Irregular? Now that doesn’t sound good. Heart condition? No. Never. My father had a strong heart. Worked on the docks his whole life. Maybe it’s just… excitement? I get nervous at tryouts. Always have. I want to make a good impression. Does that make your heart beat faster? I don’t know what you’re talking about, Doctor. I just want to play some baseball! Are you sure everything is alright? I’m feeling a little… faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, that's enough for now. I'm going to need to get an EKG, and possibly a chest X-ray. It's standard procedure given these findings. I'm also going to recommend you consult with a cardiologist immediately. You're not cleared to play baseball at this time. I’m ordering those tests now. A nurse will be in shortly to assist you.
PATIENT: Wait! Hold on! Cardiologist? Tests? X-rays? Doctor, you’re scaring me! I just came in for a simple check-up! I don't need any of this! I feel fine! A little winded, maybe, but that’s it! This is ridiculous. I’m leaving. I’m perfectly healthy. You’re overreacting. Just tell me I can play baseball and let me go. This is… this is outrageous! I need my daughter. I need to call my daughter! .
