DOCTOR: Hi Murry, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just… pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It’s been… a while since it started, I think. Not sure exactly how long. Everything feels a bit foggy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. That’s a good place to start. It’s alright if it is hard to explain, we'll figure it out together. You said it's been going on for a while... when you say a while, would you say weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… months, I think. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? I used to work a lot, construction… lots of lifting and bending. Maybe it started then? Honestly, my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I get tired trying to remember things.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or longer. And you used to do construction work, with a lot of lifting and bending. That's helpful information. Do you remember anything specific that might have started the pain, like a particular injury or strain at work?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… always aches. It wasn’t one big thing, you know? More like… slowly getting worse. Lots of heavy stuff, always carrying things. I don’t remember falling or anything. Just… old age, maybe? Everything starts to ache when you get old. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it was a gradual onset, not a sudden injury. “Old age” doesn’t cause pain, but it's true that things can wear down over time. Okay, so it’s a consistent ache that's gotten worse over the past six months, and it's worse when you take deep breaths. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Right… here. It's hard to say exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, more… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like it goes all the way around. And sometimes… up here. It’s… all connected, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a dull ache in your chest and ribs, and sometimes it radiates around to your upper back. That gives me a better idea. Does anything make the pain better – like resting, or taking certain positions?
PATIENT: Resting… a little, maybe. Lying down helps some. But not much. Sitting up straight doesn’t feel good. And… when it’s cold, it’s worse. Always worse when it’s cold. I don't know why. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Okay, resting helps a little, lying down is best, and cold weather makes it worse. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask you some general health questions, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. I'll try to remember. But… don't expect too much. Things slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, we’ll take our time. First, have you noticed any coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing along with this pain?
PATIENT: Coughing… sometimes. A little bit. Mostly in the morning. Not a bad cough, just… a tickle. Shortness of breath… not really. I get tired easily, but I just figured that was… getting old. Wheezing? I don’t think so. What does that even sound like?
DOCTOR: That's good information. Wheezing is a whistling sound when you breathe, like a tea kettle. No whistling sound. Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I know of. No chills. Night sweats… maybe? I do get warm at night sometimes. But I always sleep with a lot of blankets. It’s cold in my apartment. I can’t remember ever waking up soaked, though. Not recently, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent fever, chills, or significant night sweats. And you sleep with a lot of blankets because it’s cold in your apartment. Now, do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… lots of things, probably. My knees hurt. My back hurts, besides this. And… the doctor told me I had high blood pressure a long time ago. But I haven’t been to the doctor in… well, a long time. I stopped going. I didn't like going. And I don't really have insurance, so… it's hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain, back pain, and a history of high blood pressure. And you haven’t been to the doctor recently due to insurance and not liking going. That's all good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your knees, back, or blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Not anymore. I used to take pills for the blood pressure, but the doctor… he retired. And I didn’t bother getting a refill. I figured… what’s the point? It didn’t seem to make much difference anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. And you haven't been taking anything for your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp, but that’s it. It’s not a bad itch, just… a little bit. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible mild reaction to shrimp. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. But don’t expect too much. My chest is… sensitive. Be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Okay. I’m listening to your heart now… Your heart sounds a little fast, but otherwise regular. Now, I'm going to gently press on your chest to check for any tenderness… Does that hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: Ouch… yes, right there. And… a little here too. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side of your chest, below your collarbone, and a little higher up towards your shoulder. It feels tight. Now, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 90. And your pulse is 92. Now, let’s sit up and I’ll check your breathing. Take a deep breath in… and out… Okay. I notice you’re using some extra effort to breathe, but your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: That’s… hard. It feels like I can't get enough air. Always feels that way now. Doctor, is something… seriously wrong? I get scared sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Murry. It’s good you came in. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. The tenderness you feel, the pain with breathing, and your slightly elevated blood pressure and pulse rate could be caused by a number of things, including muscle strain, inflammation of the cartilage in your ribs, or even something more serious like pneumonia or a lung issue. Given your age and medical history, we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I would like to order a chest X-ray to check your lungs, and a blood test to look for signs of infection or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. And… how much will it cost? I don't have much money, you know. I'm worried about the bill.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Murry. Let me explain the options. The X-ray itself will cost approximately $200 to $300, and the blood tests will be around $100 to $200. I'll speak with the billing department to see if we can offer any financial assistance or payment plans given your insurance situation. We can also explore options for a lower-cost imaging center if that’s something you’d be interested in. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage the discomfort while we wait for the test results. It’s important to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about the testing or the pain medication?
PATIENT: $200… $300… That’s a lot of money. But… I guess I have no choice, right? I need to know what’s wrong. Yes, please… talk to the billing people. And… thank you. What kind of pain medication is it? Will it make me sleepy? I need to be able to get around.
DOCTOR: I understand it's a lot, Murry, and I want to help in any way I can. I’ll do my best to find the most affordable options for you. The pain medication is naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. It can sometimes cause a little drowsiness, but usually not significantly. If you do feel sleepy, please avoid driving or operating machinery. It's best to start with one dose and see how you feel. I'll write the prescription for a low dose. We’ll get the order for the X-ray and blood tests sent to the lab right away. You can go at your convenience, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once I have those results, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest tightness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please call me as soon as you have the results. I don't like waiting. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Murry. It's my pleasure. I completely understand your anxiety about waiting, and I promise I'll call you as soon as I have the results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and try to rest. We’ll figure this out together.
