DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… a headache. Back of my head. Been happening a few days now. Not… real bad, but it’s there. Always there, kinda. Like a weight.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. "A few days," right. And you describe it as… a weight. Hmm. Most people don't describe headaches like that. Alright. And is it constant?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, constant. All day. Not like… bam headache, gone, then back. It’s… steady. Like I said, a weight. Been working the rail yard… always working. Maybe that? I don’t know. I'm old, Doctor. Things hurt.
DOCTOR: The rail yard…right. And you’ve been doing that for… a long time, I presume?
PATIENT: Si, Doctor. A long time. Almost… sixty years, maybe more. Started with my father. He worked the dinkey, I followed. Then my son… but he moved to the city. Different life. Sixty years moving steel. It’s hard work. Always has been. Maybe… it’s catching up.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sixty years is… a considerable amount of time. And physical labor like that can certainly contribute to… various aches and pains. Is this headache different from headaches you’ve experienced before?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, different. I get headaches. From the sun, from being tired… normal things. This… this is back here. And it doesn’t go away with rest. Usually, a little lay down, some water… gone. This… stays. It’s… bothersome. Not a pain, exactly, but… always there. Like something is… tight.
DOCTOR: "Tight," you say. Interesting. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Maybe… a little tired. But I am old. Eyes get tired, back gets tired… everything gets tired. No blurry vision, no dizziness… nothing like that. Just… the headache. And… a little trouble sleeping. But that’s been happening for years, too. Old man problems, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None of that. No fever. No chills. My stomach is good. I eat simple food. Rice, beans, some chicken… nothing fancy. No sickness. Just… this headache. It doesn't come and go with eating, either. Doesn't matter what I eat. It’s just… persistent. Is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Persistent" headaches… well, they can be a number of things, Mr. Brum. We need to rule out anything serious. Let's do a quick neurological exam, just to get a baseline. It's standard procedure. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Si, Doctor. I can follow. I can see okay, for an old man. Not like my son, he has perfect eyes. But I can see. Go slow, please, Doctor. My neck isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This might be a little startling. Just relax. Two plus on both sides. Not bad for your age, actually. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Si, Doctor. It's… hard. My hands aren't what they used to be. Worked too long with steel, I think. Not as strong as they used to be. Everything is getting old, Doctor. Even me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. No obvious neurological deficits. It’s likely a tension headache, given your history of manual labor and the… persistent nature of the discomfort. Stress can also contribute to these types of headaches. Perhaps you should try to reduce your workload.
PATIENT: Reduce my workload? Doctor, I am the workload. I've been working the rail yard since I was a boy. It's all I know. I don’t have a choice. I need to work. What if it’s not just a tension headache, Doctor? What if it’s something… serious? Is there something I should be looking for? Something that means I need to stop working?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Brum, I understand you need to work. But it’s important to listen to your body. If you experience any sudden changes – like vision problems, weakness, fever, or a severe headache that doesn’t respond to over-the-counter pain relievers – then, then you need to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, I recommend taking ibuprofen as needed. And… try to get some rest when you can. It’s probably just muscle tension. We’ve ruled out anything serious, so I don’t think there’s a need to worry excessively.
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… okay. I have some at home. My wife… she used to buy it. I will try. And… I will look for those things. Vision problems… weakness… Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time. I better get back to work. They need me on the line. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care of yourself, Mr. Brum. And don't hesitate to come back if things worsen. .
