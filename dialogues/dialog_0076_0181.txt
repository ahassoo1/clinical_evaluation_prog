DOCTOR: Right, yes. Alroy Mombrun, 74. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, a full lab panel, if you will. Just wanting to see how things are holding up, you understand. I like to keep an eye on everything, and frankly, my wife, Elena, insisted. She worries so.
DOCTOR: A “full lab panel,” yes. Everyone wants those these days. Fine. Though honestly, at your age, it's usually something specific that brings people in. Still. Alright. Let's just get this over with. Have you been feeling anything specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, now that you mention it… my knees have been a bit creaky lately. Not terrible, just… older. And I tire a bit easier when I’m working, but I’m a construction laborer, Doctor. That’s to be expected after all these years, isn’t it? Nothing that keeps me from my work, mind you. Just… a little slower getting up from a squat, if you follow.
DOCTOR: Knees. Laborer. Of course. Look, aches and pains come with the territory. It’s… probably just wear and tear. Do you have any… other complaints?
PATIENT: Other complaints… hmm. Let me think. My appetite hasn’t been quite as robust as usual, perhaps. Elena makes wonderful arepas, you understand, but I haven’t been finishing my plate lately. And I’ve been… a bit more forgetful than usual, I suppose. Though, at my age, is that truly surprising? I do recall everything perfectly, actually. It's just... retrieving the names sometimes takes a moment longer.
DOCTOR: Appetite. Forgetfulness. Right. Well, these things can be normal with age. But we'll humor your wife and get some blood work done. Have you noticed any changes in your… bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh. Well, Doctor, that’s… rather personal, isn’t it? They are… regular enough. Perhaps a little less… substantial than they once were, but nothing alarming. I eat plenty of fiber, you understand, Elena is very particular about that. Is that what you were getting at, Doctor? It feels a bit forward to ask about such things so directly.
DOCTOR: Look, it's my job to ask these questions. It's called a medical history. Don't get offended. Just answer the question. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never. Elena would have my hide if there was blood in my stool! She’s very vigilant, you understand. No, Doctor, no blood. I assure you. This line of questioning is… unsettling, frankly. Is something concerning you specifically?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No blood. Fine. Let’s move on. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? No, no heart trouble that I’m aware of. My father lived to be 92, strong as an ox until the very end. Chest pain… occasionally a little discomfort, but I attribute that to indigestion. Elena’s cooking is usually wonderful, but sometimes she adds a bit too much spice, you understand. It’s a fleeting sensation, nothing persistent. Really, Doctor, I feel quite robust for my age. It’s just a general check-up, isn’t it? I’m starting to worry I’ve offended you with my explanations.
DOCTOR: Right. Indigestion. Look, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Then we'll get that lab work ordered and you can be on your way. Sit back, please. Don't overthink it.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Please, do. I understand you have many patients and a great deal to do. I simply wanted to be thorough in my explanations. Elena always says I overshare, but I prefer to be upfront. Proceed at your leisure.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular. A little… muffled, but probably just weight. Lungs are clear. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again. Alright. Looks… fine. We'll just order those blood tests. Routine stuff. CBC, CMP, lipid panel. You'll get the results in a few days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up if anything concerning comes up.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. CBC, CMP, lipid panel… Elena will be pleased to hear we’re being so thorough. Is there anything you would specifically recommend, Doctor? Any lifestyle changes perhaps? I do enjoy a good glass of rum on the weekends, you understand, and I’m quite fond of Elena’s arepas. Perhaps a smaller portion, if you think it prudent.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm a specialist. Internal Medicine. I don't do lifestyle coaching. Eat a balanced diet, get some exercise. Standard advice. And don't overdo the rum. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood.
PATIENT: Ah. Yes, of course. I understand. Well, thank you, Doctor Ruocco. I appreciate your time, and the blood work. Elena will be very relieved. I suppose I’ll let the nurse take it from here. Good day to you, Doctor. And… thank you again. .
