DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, it's about a letter. A letter for my… companion. You see, I need a piece of paper saying I can keep him. Some people are being difficult, if you catch my drift. It's a bit ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: A letter… to keep someone?
PATIENT: Well, not a person person, Doctor. Heavens no! It’s… it’s a pet. A lovely creature, really. Very… discerning taste. But the building management… they have rules. And some people, they just don't understand a good thing when they see it. It's just paperwork, isn't it? I thought doctors did paperwork.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while I appreciate you seeking my assistance, I am a medical doctor. I provide healthcare. I do not, as you put it, simply "do paperwork" for… pet ownership disputes. This is… not within my purview. Have you consulted with a legal professional regarding this matter?
PATIENT: Legal…? Oh, darling, no. I thought… well, you're a doctor! You write things down, you sign things... It seemed simple enough. Honestly, the things people ask you to do these days. It’s for a dog, you know. A very special dog. He needs me. Surely a doctor can write a little note saying he's good for my health? It’s emotional support, really.
DOCTOR: Emotional support... Ms. Wrye, I am obligated to adhere to established medical standards and ethical guidelines. Fabricating documentation for the purpose of circumventing property regulations is… inappropriate. And frankly, a misuse of my professional position. Now, is there a legitimate medical concern you wish to address today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, don’t get all technical on me, Doctor. It’s just a small favor! I barely remember why I needed to come in… something about… well, my back, maybe? It aches sometimes, but it’s nothing a good lie-down doesn’t fix. Honestly, I’m probably fine. This whole thing is just causing me stress, which isn’t good for my… companion. Perhaps if I just had the letter…
DOCTOR: So, you are experiencing back pain… intermittently?
PATIENT: Intermittently… yes, that sounds right. It comes and goes, like everything else, really. Sometimes when I bend over, it’s a bit of a… struggle. Mostly it's just a dull ache. But it's been bothering me more lately, now that all this fuss is going on. It's probably the stress, as I said. You know, worrying about my… friend.
DOCTOR: And how long has this back pain been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a while, I suppose. Years, maybe? I honestly can’t quite recall. It's never been terribly serious. I just… ignore it. You know how it is. Life goes on. But it's… aggravated now. Definitely aggravated. Especially when I have to deal with difficult people and… regulations. Honestly, it's a wonder I haven't completely fallen apart.
DOCTOR: You mentioned it has been present for years. Have you sought any prior medical attention for this back pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Doctors and hospitals… all that fuss. I'm a strong woman, Doctor. I've always managed. A bit of this and a bit of that… a hot bath, a lie-down. That’s always been enough. Perhaps some… herbal remedies. But nothing serious. Honestly, I don't have time for all that nonsense. I have a… a life to live. And a companion to look after.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, you have been self-treating this back pain for years with no formal medical evaluation or intervention?
PATIENT: Formal… intervention? Heavens, no. Look, it’s a backache, not a… a plague! I get it when I bend, when I lift… when I’m stressed, which, admittedly, has been quite frequent lately. Honestly, all this fuss with the building management is making it worse. I just want to be left alone with my… friend. A simple letter, that’s all I ask. Is that really too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. We will document the presence of chronic, non-specific back pain, self-treated for an unspecified duration. However, given the lack of prior evaluation, I recommend a radiograph to rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. And a consultation with a physical therapist would be beneficial to establish a proper exercise regimen. We will also document your recent stress levels. Are there any other symptoms you wish to report at this time?
PATIENT: Radiographs? Physical therapy? Oh, darling, no. All that… poking and prodding. Honestly, I’m quite alright. A little stressed, perhaps, but who isn’t? And the backache… it’s just a backache. It comes and goes. I really don’t see the point of all those tests and… exercises. It’s just a waste of time and money, really. And frankly, it’s making me even more anxious. Perhaps… perhaps if I could just get the letter… .
