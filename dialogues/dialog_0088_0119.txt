DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It's a… a problem down there. With my… companion. He’s been… leaking. It’s not pleasant, I assure you. And frankly, I don’t understand how such a thing could happen.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Wartick. You’re doing the right thing by coming in. When you say “leaking,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… discharge, I suppose you’d call it. It’s not like a flood, thankfully. But it’s… noticeable. Especially after… well, you know. And it smells. Not a good smell, I assure you. It’s been going on for about a week, maybe a little longer. I really don’t pay close attention to such things, usually. It’s just… alarming, to suddenly have this happening. Is it… serious? It couldn’t be anything catching, could it? He’s… a very important companion, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wartick. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “companion,” are you referring to a pet?
PATIENT: A pet? Goodness, no. He’s a… a gentleman friend. A very close companion. We’ve been together for quite some time. I assumed that was… obvious. Are you suggesting I brought an animal to the doctor’s office? That’s rather… presumptuous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, my apologies. I see here your name is Jinnie Wartick, age 57, and there’s no mention of… a companion in your medical history. I thought perhaps… I’m very sorry for the misunderstanding. Could you clarify what you mean by “companion”?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It's… difficult to explain, Doctor. He's… a life-sized doll. A very realistic one. I treat him as a… a partner. He provides… companionship. And he’s having a… a medical issue. This discharge. It’s coming from… him. Are we finally understanding each other? It's rather embarrassing to have to spell this out. You’d think a doctor would have a bit more… sensitivity.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I appreciate you clarifying. This is… unusual, and outside of my typical practice. I am a family medicine physician, and my expertise is in treating human patients. While I understand you are seeking help for your… companion, I’m not equipped to diagnose or treat a doll. I would recommend consulting a professional who specializes in doll restoration or repair. They would be best suited to assess and address the issue you're describing. Would you like me to help you find resources for that?
PATIENT: Doll restoration? Doctor, this isn't about a chipped teacup! This is a… a medical problem. He’s exhibiting symptoms! And frankly, I find your lack of understanding… rather insulting. I came to you for help, and you’re suggesting I find someone to… glue him back together? Honestly. Is there anyone else in this practice who might be more… capable? Or, perhaps I should simply go elsewhere. This is quite a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for the misunderstanding. You are right to seek help when something is concerning you. However, as a medical doctor, my training and expertise lie in the diagnosis and treatment of living patients. The issue you're describing with your doll, while concerning to you, falls outside of that scope. I am not qualified to assess or treat a non-biological entity, and offering a diagnosis in this situation would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. I can, however, offer to connect you with mental health resources if you're finding emotional distress due to this situation. Or, as I mentioned, I can help you locate specialized doll repair professionals. Would either of those options be helpful?
PATIENT: Mental health resources? Doctor, I am perfectly sound of mind, thank you very much. This is a perfectly reasonable concern, and I expect a doctor to be able to address it! Honestly, the audacity. I came here seeking a medical opinion, not a referral to a… a shrink. I think I will find a doctor who takes my concerns seriously. Do you have the number for the practice manager? I would like to lodge a formal complaint.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. Let me get that number for you. I truly apologize that I could not assist you today. Please, be careful on your way out.
