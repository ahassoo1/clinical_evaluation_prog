DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Tippens. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Yes, it’s good to be here, I suppose. Though I don't much like being in doctors' offices, if you know what I mean. I just need some papers signed… verification of some health forms. It’s for… well, a thing. A long story. Is that what you do here? Sign things?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Tippens, I can certainly assist with completing medical forms. However, as a physician, I also want to ensure I have a complete understanding of your current health status before signing anything official. It’s standard practice, and helps ensure the forms are accurate and appropriate. To clarify, is this verification related to a specific program or benefit you're applying for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, when you put it that way… it's for a little bit of help with rent, dear. I never thought I’d be needing that, you know? I’ve always worked… I was an anesthesiologist for… a very long time. But things change, don’t they? It’s just… paperwork. Lots and lots of paperwork. I don’t really understand half of it. And they want a doctor to sign off on it. Is that alright? Am I explaining this right? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly, Ms. Tippens, and you're not a bother at all. It's perfectly reasonable to need assistance with these forms, and I’m happy to help. Knowing you were an anesthesiologist is helpful information as well, thank you for sharing. To proceed, could you tell me a bit about your current health?
PATIENT: Oh, my health… Well, I’m 76, so things are starting to… creak a bit. My knees aren’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. And I get tired easier. A lot easier. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… well, a long time. Honestly, I just try to keep moving. Walk when I can. Eat… reasonably. I don't have any big problems, I don’t think. No diabetes or heart trouble. Just… old. Is that good enough? Or do you need specifics? I don’t have a list, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: That’s a good start, Ms. Tippens. It’s good you're able to stay active. We’ll definitely need more specifics, but don’t worry, we’ll take it one step at a time. Could you describe the tiredness you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I collapse or anything. It’s just… by the afternoon, I feel… drained. Like the battery is low. I used to be able to work all day and still have energy for things in the evening. Now, I usually just sit. Watch a little TV. Maybe read. It’s… frustrating, honestly. I used to do things. And I've noticed it's gotten worse lately. It wasn't this bad even a few months ago. Do you understand? It’s a slow fading, not a sudden crash. And I don't sleep well, either. I wake up a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly, Ms. Tippens. That sounds quite tiring, and I appreciate you describing it so clearly. The gradual onset and the impact on your daily activities are important details. Let’s talk about your sleep for a moment. How many hours of sleep would you say you typically get per night?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… that’s a good question. It’s not… consistent, not at all. Some nights I might get six hours, if I’m lucky. Other nights it’s more like four, and then I’m awake for a long stretch in the middle of the night. I try to go to bed around ten, but I toss and turn a lot. My mind just… races. I worry. About everything, really. It's not a peaceful sleep, that’s for sure. And getting back to sleep after I wake up is the hardest part. It just… doesn’t happen sometimes. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Tippens. Six to four hours, with difficulty falling back asleep – that definitely paints a picture. Worrying can certainly disrupt sleep. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My appetite hasn’t been great, I suppose. I used to enjoy cooking, but now I mostly just eat… simple things. Toast, soup. Nothing fancy. And I’ve lost a little weight, I think. Not a lot, but enough that my clothes feel a bit looser. Oh, and my hands… they sometimes tremble a little. Not constantly, but enough to make things like buttoning a shirt difficult. Is that important? I’m probably just rambling now, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Ms. Tippens. This is all very important information. Decreased appetite, some weight loss, and hand tremors – those are all things we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if you have any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My knees, mostly. They ache, especially when it's cold or damp. It’s just… old age, I suppose. I try to ignore it. And sometimes my back will bother me, just a dull ache after I’ve been sitting for too long. But nothing… terrible. I don’t take any pain medication, if that matters. I don’t like taking pills. It just feels… wrong, somehow. Is there anything else you need to know? I feel like I’m taking up all your time.
DOCTOR: You are not taking up all my time, Ms. Tippens. It's important to me that we get a complete understanding of your health concerns. Knowing about your knee and back pain is helpful, and I understand your reluctance to take medication. Now, let’s talk about your medications. You said you don't take any pain medication currently, but do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, dear. Nothing at all. I used to take a multivitamin, years ago, but I stopped. I just… don't bother with them anymore. I try to eat healthy, that’s all. And I drink plenty of water. I don’t want to fill my body with things it doesn’t need. Is that alright? I know doctors like people to take pills, but… well, I just don't. Do you think we can just sign the papers now? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Tippens. I respect your choices regarding medication. Knowing you don't take any supplements or other prescriptions is also important. Before we proceed with the paperwork, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I haven’t had one of those in… goodness, decades. I suppose it couldn't hurt. But please be gentle, dear. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I’m a little… sensitive. I don’t want to make a fuss. Just… quick and easy, if you can. I really need to get going after this. I have a thing, you see. A meeting. It's important. Do you need me to change? I'm wearing a fairly sensible dress.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. We will take things very slowly and gently. No need to change your dress; we can work around it. I will be mindful of your knees and will do my best to keep things as comfortable as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Go ahead. But please, be gentle. And don’t take too long, if you don't mind. My knees are already starting to complain. I really wish I hadn't worn this dress. It’s a bit… restricting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tippens. Your blood pressure is 140/85, and your pulse is 78 and regular. That's a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. I'm trying. It’s a bit difficult, you know? My lungs aren't what they used to be. It feels like… something is tight. Is that normal? I always get a little… winded easily. It's probably just old age, though. I really shouldn't have eaten that soup yesterday. It was a little… salty.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Tippens. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I'm hearing a very faint murmur. It’s not necessarily cause for concern, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Your breath sounds are a little diminished, as you noted, but that could be due to a number of factors. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms and legs?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Be careful, though. I’m not as steady as I used to be. And don't hit me too hard with that little hammer thing. I bruise easily, you know. Old age, again. It’s a terrible thing, this aging process. It just… takes away everything, doesn't it? Even your reflexes. Is that necessary, really? It’s probably just fine. I’m sure it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Your reflexes are a little diminished, as you noted, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m just going to quickly check your neurological function. Could you please close your eyes and tell me if you can feel me touching your fingers?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Go ahead. But be gentle, please. I’m a little sensitive. And don’t startle me! I hate being startled. It makes my heart race. I really don't like any of this, you know. It's just… unpleasant. I'm sure everything is fine. It always is. Can we please just sign the papers now? I really need to get going. I have an important meeting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Your sensation is a little diminished in both hands, but nothing overly concerning. Okay, that completes the brief physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve found during the exam, you are experiencing fatigue, some weight loss, decreased appetite, hand tremors, and some knee and back pain. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and I noted a slight murmur and diminished reflexes. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I recommend we order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your Vitamin D levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More tests? I really don’t like tests, dear. I just want to get this paperwork signed and be on my way. But… if you think it’s necessary. I suppose I can’t argue with a doctor. Just… please make it quick. And don’t take too much blood. I get faint easily, you know. Old age, again. It’s just… awful. Can we just get it over with? The paperwork, and then the tests? I really need to get to my meeting. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Tippens. We will take it as quickly and gently as possible. We will only draw the necessary amount of blood, and I will ensure you’re comfortable throughout the process. The lab technician is very experienced and will be careful. First, let me write the orders for the blood work. Then, I’ll explain the paperwork to you again, and we can get it signed. Once that’s done, you can go to the lab, and they will take care of the blood draw. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Just… please make it quick. And be sure to explain the paperwork very carefully. I don’t understand half of it, you know. It’s all just… medical jargon. And I really need to get to my meeting. It’s very important. I have to be there on time. I just… hope everything is alright. I really don’t want any bad news. This whole thing is just… awful. Can we please just get it over with? I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. As I write this, I’ll explain each test. First, a Complete Blood Count - that checks for things like anemia, infection, or other blood disorders. A Metabolic Panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And finally, the Thyroid Panel checks your thyroid hormone levels, which can cause fatigue and weight loss if they're not functioning properly. Now, let's look at the paperwork. This is a verification form for rental assistance. It asks for your medical history and confirms that you have certain health conditions that qualify you for assistance. I’ve already filled in some of the information based on what you’ve told me, but we need to review it together to ensure everything is accurate. Here, this section confirms your fatigue… and this section is for your weight loss. Does this sound accurate to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So much writing. It’s all just… a blur. Yes, I suppose that sounds right. I am tired, and I have lost some weight. But I don't understand all these medical terms. What's "comorbidity"? And "differential diagnosis"? It's just… confusing. Can you just… tell me what I need to sign? I don’t want to mess anything up. I just want to get this done and go to my meeting. I'm sure everything is fine. Just tell me where to put my signature. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Tippens. You don’t need to worry about the medical jargon. It’s mostly for documentation purposes. All you need to do is sign here, which confirms that the information on this form is accurate to the best of your knowledge. Before you sign, just let me quickly summarize everything we’ve discussed. You are experiencing fatigue, some weight loss, decreased appetite, hand tremors, and some knee and back pain. We are ordering some basic blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. I’ve signed it. Just… please make it quick. I really need to get to my meeting. It’s very important. And I hope everything is alright. I’m just… a little worried. This whole thing is just… stressful. Can I go now? Can I go get the blood work done and then finally go to my meeting? I’m ready when you are. Just tell me where to go. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. Here's the lab order. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. The receptionist will take this order and get you checked in. They will draw a few vials of blood, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are available, you can either call the lab and give them permission for me to access the results, or you can call my office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s everything. Just… please, if anything is seriously wrong, call me. I’m… a little worried, you know? But I trust you. Just… please be careful. And thank you. Thank you for everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to go to my meeting. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Tippens. I understand. I will review the results as soon as they become available and will contact you if anything concerning arises. And please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I hope your meeting goes well. And please, take care of yourself.
