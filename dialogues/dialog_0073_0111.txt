DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… well, it’s this skin, you see. Darkening. And the tiredness, of course. Utterly debilitating. I haven’t much time for this, Doctor. A simple explanation would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Darkening skin and tiredness… alright. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. Some time ago, I suppose. Years, perhaps? I’ve a business to run, you know. Reinforcing iron doesn't allow for meticulous self-observation. It just… happened. Is it serious? Because I really haven't the patience for a drawn-out investigation.
DOCTOR: Right. Years… that makes it a bit harder to pinpoint. And you said it's just… darkening?
PATIENT: Yes, darkening! It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? A sort of…bronzing, I suppose. My wife pointed it out. She's always been observant of such things, though overly critical, if you ask me. It’s accompanied by this…weakness. I used to be able to work all day, now…now I need frequent rests. Is there a test for this, or can you simply tell me what it is?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Drahota, simply telling you without a proper examination wouldn't be responsible medicine, would it?
PATIENT: Responsible medicine? Honestly. I’ve lived eighty-five years, Doctor. I think I have a reasonable grasp on my own…condition. But very well. Examine away. But do be quick about it. I have a shipment arriving this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a quick look at your skin. Please, roll up your sleeves and pant legs a bit. I'll need to visually assess the areas you mentioned. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Hmph. I trust this won't be an overly invasive procedure, Doctor. My wife will have my hide if I return with red marks. And do try not to comment on the state of my legs. Years of honest labor, you understand. It’s hardly a cosmetic issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some darkening, as you mentioned. It does appear somewhat generalized. Your skin also feels a little dry. Heart rate is regular, and lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds, which is not uncommon in someone your age. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I feel… tired. Weak. As I’ve repeatedly stated. And my appetite is…irregular. Sometimes I eat well, sometimes not at all. Though I assure you, Doctor, that’s hardly a novel complaint for a man of my years. Is this…darkening…contagious? My wife is rather…particular about cleanliness.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Drahota, it’s not contagious. Irregular appetite, along with the tiredness… and this darkening… Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Good heavens, no. I haven’t stepped on a scale in decades. Why would I? I feel lighter, perhaps? But that could be the…weakness. Honestly, Doctor, you ask the most peculiar questions. Is this leading somewhere, or are we simply cataloging the inevitable decline of a perfectly functional…well, formerly functional…man?
DOCTOR: Alright. We're trying to gather information, Mr. Drahota. It’s a bit difficult without specifics. Let's talk about your history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Nothing of any consequence. A touch of arthritis in my knees, but who doesn’t have that at my age? And I had a bad fall a few years back, broke a rib. Healed perfectly well, mind you. I’ve always been a strong man. That’s all. No… chronic ailments or anything of that nature. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good brandy now and then. Is this relevant, Doctor? Because truly, I’m starting to question the utility of this entire exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your family?
PATIENT: Family? What about them? My wife, of course. Still alive, thankfully. A demanding woman, but…reliable. And a son, somewhere in California, I believe. Haven't seen him in years. Doesn’t call. Not much of a family man, if you ask me. Why is this relevant? Are you investigating my personal life now, Doctor? This is most irregular. Is this darkening related to… filial ungratefulness? Because frankly, I wouldn’t put it past the universe.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I'm asking about family medical history. Do any of your relatives have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or… problems with their skin?
PATIENT: Diabetes… skin problems… Good heavens, Doctor, you expect me to recall the medical ailments of distant cousins? My mother… she had a weak stomach, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, like myself. Never sick a day in his life. As for skin… I don’t recall anyone having any particular problems. Perhaps a bit of sun damage? We spent a lot of time outdoors. But nothing serious. This is a futile exercise, Doctor. Truly. I suspect this is simply…old age. A natural decline. Can we not simply accept that and be done with it? I have a shipment arriving shortly. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Given your age and limited information, and the fact that you are otherwise relatively stable, I can order some basic blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count. We'll also check your blood sugar. This will help rule out some of the more common causes of fatigue and skin changes. However, given your…disinclination to provide a detailed medical history, I recommend you see a dermatologist regarding the skin discoloration. It would be prudent to get a professional opinion on that specifically. I'll write you a referral. Do you have any allergies to medications?
