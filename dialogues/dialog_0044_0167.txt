DOCTOR: Good morning, Emiliano. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… my foot. It’s been botherin’ me. A sore, you see. A bad one. It won’t seem to get better. It’s on my foot, and it hurts when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you and hurts when you walk. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started small, maybe a little cut. I don’t even remember how I got it, truthfully. But it just… stayed. And got bigger. Now it’s… well, it’s red, and kinda deep. And it makes my foot ache, especially after I’ve been standin’ for a bit. It’s on the top of my foot, I think. Hard to see good these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started as a small cut, you’re not sure how you got it, and it’s gradually gotten bigger and redder, becoming deeper and causing you pain with standing. And it’s located on the top of your foot. Do you remember when this started, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That’s a hard one. I… I think it was after the holidays. Maybe January? Or February? Time… time gets away from me, you know. It feels like a long time now, though. A few months, for sure. I don’t remember exactly when, but after New Year’s, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months ago, after New Year’s. That gives us a good starting point. Has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’’s really made it better, I’m afraid. I’ve been tryin’ to keep it clean, washin’ it gentle-like. That seems to help a little with the… the smell, maybe. But the pain, that stays pretty much the same. Standin’ makes it worse, like I said. And… well, sometimes when I’m tryin’ to sleep, it kinda throbs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so keeping it clean helps with the smell, but the pain and throbbing remain, especially with standing and at night. Have you noticed any pus or drainage coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? Drainage? Oh… I… I don’t know what that looks like, exactly. There’s… sometimes a little wetness. Clearish, maybe. Not a lot, though. Just a little bit. I wipe it away with a towel. I thought it was just from washin’ it, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, some clearish drainage that you’ve attributed to washing. That's helpful to know. Have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell at all?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. I haven’t been feelin’ sick, no. Just tired, you know? Old age, I suppose. But no chills or nothin’ like that. Just… achy. Mostly in my foot, but sometimes all over.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, just general tiredness and achiness, primarily in your foot. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had scrapes and bruises, of course. But not a sore that just… won’t heal. This is new. It worries me a little, to be honest. I used to be so active, you know? Walkin’ every day. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Emiliano, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's definitely concerning that it hasn't healed and is causing you pain. Let’s take a look at it, if you don’t mind. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine your foot?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. It’s a little tight, these old bones don’t move like they used to. There you go. Be careful now, it might be a little… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore here on the top of your foot. It is red, inflamed, and there appears to be some depth to it. There's some surrounding skin discoloration as well. It does look a bit sensitive, as you mentioned. I'm not seeing any signs of active infection right now, but it's definitely not healing as it should. I'm going to gently palpate around it. Tell me if anything is particularly painful.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s tender, Doctor. Right there. Not terrible, but… yeah, that’s where it hurts the most. It’s kinda a deep ache, not a sharp pain. And… it feels warm, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tender to palpation, a deep ache, and warm to the touch. That's consistent with inflammation. I'm going to check your pulses in your foot to make sure the circulation is good. Pulses are present and feel normal, which is good. Now, I'd like to get a quick look at your medical history, if you don't mind. I have access to your records here. Do you have any known allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. As for medications… let me think. Just the usual, I suppose. For my blood sugar. I have diabetes, you see. Been havin’ it for a long time. The doctor… Dr. Nakamura, she gave me somethin’ to take every day. A little white pill. That’s all. And sometimes somethin’ for my arthritis, when it’s bad. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have diabetes and take a white pill daily for that, and sometimes medication for arthritis. Do you remember the name of the medication for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names… I’m terrible with names. Dr. Nakamura, she just tells me to take one every mornin’ with my breakfast. It’s a little white pill, roundish, I think. I keep it in a little bottle on the kitchen counter. I wish I could remember the name, but it just slips my mind.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can look it up in your records. Okay, here we are. You’re currently taking Metformin 500mg twice a day for your diabetes and occasionally Naproxen for your arthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! Metformin… that’s the one. Twice a day, you say? I thought it was just once. But maybe I’m forgettin’. And Naproxen… yes, for my achin’ joints. You have a good memory, Doctor. Much better than mine, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: It's my job, Emiliano. Now, given your diabetes and the fact that this sore isn’t healing, I’m a little concerned about a possible infection and the potential for it to affect the tissues deeper down. Because of your diabetes, your body doesn’t heal as quickly, and infections can be more serious. I think we need to get this properly assessed. I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I also think it would be best to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there’s any underlying bone involvement. Do that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray… yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want this sore to get better, so I can walk again. I miss my walks. And I don’t want any trouble, you know? So, yes. Let’s do what you think is best. It’s a little scary, but… I’ll do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’m glad you agree. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology right away. They'll call you to schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, it's very important to keep the sore clean and dry. Continue to wash it gently with soap and water, and cover it with a clean bandage. Also, try to avoid putting too much weight on that foot as much as possible. Do you have any difficulty walking at all?
PATIENT: Well, it’s uncomfortable, Doctor. I limp a little. And it hurts after I’ve been standin’ for a bit. I’ve been tryin’ to take it easy, but… I still have to do things, you know? Cook, clean, little chores around the house. I don’t want to fall, though. That would be terrible. So I try to be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re walking with a limp and experiencing pain with prolonged standing. We’ll get those tests done to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. I'm going to write you a prescription for a short course of oral antibiotics, just as a preventative measure. If you notice any increased redness, swelling, pain, or drainage from the sore, or if you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Antibiotics… yes, that sounds good too, Doctor. Preventative, you say? That makes me feel better. I don’t want it to get worse. And I will, I promise, if I see anythin’ different, I’ll call right away. Thank you for takin’ such good care of me. You’ve put my mind a little at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. That's my job. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on foot care for people with diabetes. It has some helpful tips on keeping your feet healthy. We’ll get those tests done, and then we’ll formulate a plan to get you back on your feet, literally! Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everythin’ very clearly. I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. And thank you again for takin’ the time to listen to me. I feel much better knowin’ we’re takin’ care of it. I’ll be sure to call if anythin’ changes.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. Here are the prescriptions and the foot care handout. The lab and radiology departments will contact you to schedule your appointments. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. I’ll see you back here once we have the results. Take care, Emiliano, and try to rest your foot as much as possible.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Rest my foot. Take care now. Goodbye.
