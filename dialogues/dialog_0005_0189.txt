DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Look, I don’t hold with all these newfangled doctors, but my daughter insisted. Said I needed to get this… looked at. It’s my, well, my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning, she said. And frankly, I think she just likes getting me out of the house.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. That is something we should take a look at. And your daughter is… prudent to suggest you come in. Now, how long has this been happening, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Prudent? Hmph. She worries too much. Now, let me think... it's been... a couple of times now. Maybe three? Within the last week, I’d say. It wasn't every day, thankfully. And it wasn't pouring out of me, you understand. Just… streaks. Like raspberry jam, only… not so pleasant. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, I don’t spend that much time examining it, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Streaks, like raspberry jam.” I understand. And is it always bright red blood, or has it been darker, perhaps more… maroon colored?
PATIENT: Maroon? Goodness, no. I’d remember that. It was bright red, mostly. Like I said, streaks. Not a huge amount, but enough to notice. I’ve always had a strong constitution, you see. Never been one for complaining. This just… felt off. And my daughter, well, she makes a mountain out of a molehill. Still, better safe than sorry, I suppose. Though I haven't been feeling any different. No stomach pain, no weakness, just… the blood.
DOCTOR: No stomach pain, no weakness… That’s good. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What kind of a question is that? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. It's not something I discuss with doctors! Though… now that you mention it, maybe it’s been a little… looser than usual. Not diarrhea, mind you, but not… firm, either. Old age, probably. Everything goes a bit soft eventually. I'm 88 years old, you know. Things aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, sir. And has this looseness been happening around the same time as you noticed the blood?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re asking a question I can answer! Yes, actually. It started around the same time. A few days before I noticed the… streaks. Though I’m not one to keep meticulous records of my… movements. My daughter would probably have a fit if she knew I was discussing this with you. Honestly, she thinks I need to be poked and prodded for every little ache and pain. It's ridiculous. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve been perfectly capable of looking after myself until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diverticulitis, hemorrhoids, or anything else involving your digestive system?
PATIENT: Digestive system? Goodness, no. I've always eaten a good, healthy diet. Mostly fish, you know. And the occasional steak. No fancy foods, no processed nonsense. As for being “diagnosed,” I haven’t got time for doctors telling me what’s wrong with me. I’ve always been a robust fellow. My father lived to be 95, and he didn’t see a doctor a day in his life. Hemorrhoids… well, maybe a little discomfort now and then, but nothing a bit of rough paper couldn't handle. This whole thing is probably just a temporary thing. A bit of a stomach bug, maybe? I don’t need a whole battery of tests, you know. Just tell me it’s nothing serious and let me get on with my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your… reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. However, given your age and the presence of blood in your stool, it would be irresponsible of me not to investigate further. Now, have you ever had any abdominal surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Now there’s a thought. Let me see… back in the war, I had a bit of shrapnel removed from my side. Nothing major, mind you. A quick in-and-out job. And… oh, yes! Appendicitis when I was a boy. Must have been around ten years old. They whisked me away and… well, that was a long time ago. I barely remember it. Just a lot of white coats and a funny smell. Aside from that, nothing. I’ve always been careful. A bit of a scrape here and there, but nothing requiring a surgeon. Honestly, I’m starting to think your daughter sent me here just to run up a bill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What exactly are you looking for? My father, like I said, lived to be 95. Healthy as an ox, right up until the end. Mother died of… well, old age, I suppose. Nothing spectacular. As for anyone else… my brother had a bit of trouble with his heart, but that was years ago. And my sister… she always had a weak stomach. Complained about everything she ate. Not much help, if you ask me. No one in my family had any of these… digestive problems, if that's what you mean. We were a hardy bunch. Fishermen, mostly. We need strong stomachs to survive out on the water. This whole thing is just… unsettling. I don’t like being poked and prodded and asked about my… bodily functions. It’s undignified.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I don’t believe in all that pharmaceutical nonsense. A bit of fish oil now and then, that’s about it. I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but it didn’t do much good, just made me feel sluggish. I stopped taking it. I prefer to manage things myself. A bit of exercise, a healthy diet, that’s all you need. I don’t need a doctor telling me what pills to swallow. It's just… unnecessary. Though my daughter keeps offering me all sorts of things, vitamins, supplements, all sorts of potions and pills… I tell her, “No, thank you.” I’m perfectly fine on my own. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit tired of all these questions. Can we just get this over with? Tell me what you think, and let me go home. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Seriously? At my age? I’ve been eating fish and breathing air for 88 years, young man. If I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now! No, I don’t have any allergies. Never have. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather insulting. Are you implying I’m some sort of delicate flower? I’ve weathered storms on the North Pacific, survived a war, and lived a long and full life. A few streaks of blood in my stool aren't going to make me keel over from an allergic reaction. I’m perfectly robust, thank you very much. Can we please move on? I’m wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination then. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and we'll need to do a digital rectal exam. This is standard procedure, Mr. Rowbottom, and will help me assess the situation. It's necessary, despite your… reservations.
PATIENT: Hold on just a minute! A what? You’re going to… poke around down there? Absolutely not! I will not be subjected to such indignity! I came here because my daughter insisted I get checked out, not to be… violated! This is outrageous! I’ve lived 88 years without anyone sticking their fingers… Never! I refuse. I’m perfectly capable of assessing my own condition, thank you very much. This is completely unacceptable. I want to see another doctor. Or, better yet, I want to go home. Now. This is preposterous!
