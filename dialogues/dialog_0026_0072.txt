DOCTOR: Good morning, Ebony. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Finco. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, really. I've been… forgetting things. Little things at first, but it's been getting worse, and it worried me enough to come in.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Forgetfulness can be concerning, and it's always best to explore what's going on. When you say "getting worse," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started with, like, where I put my keys or missing appointments. Nothing huge. But now… now I sometimes have trouble remembering people’s names, even people I’ve met a few times. And yesterday, I completely forgot what I was making for dinner, mid-recipe. It just… vanished from my head. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: That does sound unsettling, Ebony. It's good you’re paying attention to these changes. Okay, let's try to get a clearer picture. When did you first notice these memory issues starting, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, roughly… maybe six months ago? It was around February, I think. It was gradual, like I said, so it's hard to pinpoint exactly. I just remember thinking I was more stressed than usual with work and dismissed it at first. But it hasn't gotten better, so… that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Six months... okay. And would you describe the stress as unusually high, or just a normal level of work pressure?
PATIENT: It was… more than normal, I think. We had a new hire who wasn't really pulling their weight, so I was covering a lot of extra. Plus, my aunt was sick for a while, so I was trying to help my mom with things. It was just a lot all at once, and I didn't really slow down until recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. That certainly sounds like a stressful period. Now, besides the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been a little more… irritable, maybe? Not like, shouting angry, but just quicker to get annoyed. And I’ve been feeling tired, even when I get enough sleep. It’s hard to explain. Like… mentally drained, I guess.
DOCTOR: Mentally drained is a good way to put it. And you said this fatigue persists even with adequate sleep?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. I try to get at least eight hours, usually more on the weekends. But I wake up feeling… not refreshed. Like I haven’t really rested. It’s frustrating. I used to jump out of bed, ready to go. Now… it’s a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually… I think I've lost a little weight. Not a huge amount, maybe five or ten pounds. I haven’t been as hungry as usual, and I’m not really craving anything specific. I just… don’t feel like eating as much. I haven't been trying to diet or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me a bit about your medical history, Ebony?
PATIENT: Sure. I've generally been pretty healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, but that’s about it. No major surgeries or anything like that. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Oh, and I wear glasses, of course. I'm 38 now, things start to go, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I've been on it for about five years now. It seems to keep things stable, my doctor checks it regularly. Honestly, I'm a bit worried this memory thing is a side effect of the medication, maybe? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ebony, and a reasonable concern. Lisinopril can have some cognitive side effects, though it’s not common. Let’s make a note of that to consider. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I'll take ibuprofen. Nothing else regularly. I used to take St. John's Wort for a while, but I stopped that a long time ago. I read it can interact with medications, and I didn't want to risk it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No St. John’s Wort is good to hear. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tough one. My grandmother, on my mom’s side, she had Alzheimer’s. It was really sad. She didn't recognize anyone towards the end. And my uncle on my dad’s side, he had Parkinson's, but I don't think there was any memory loss specifically. Other than that, not that I know of. It's not something we really talked about much as a family.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I've cut back a lot recently. Maybe once a month now. And definitely no recreational drugs. I don't even like coffee, can you believe it? I'm not much of a… partier, I guess. I prefer a quiet evening at home.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, thank you. Okay, Ebony, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. Let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your basic vitals. Can you sit up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here we go. Is there anything special I need to do?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Those are all within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’ll do a quick balance test. Can you stand up, close your eyes, and put your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It's a little wobbly, but I think I'm okay. I'm trying not to fall!
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly like that. You’re doing great. There's a slight sway, but nothing overly concerning. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I'm following it… it's a bit hard with my eyes closed, but I'm trying. Is that what you wanted? I feel a little dizzy now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was perfect, and thank you. It’s okay that you feel a little dizzy; it’s a common side effect of the test. We’ll take it easy. Now, I'm going to do a very brief cognitive test, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I'm ready. I just hope I don’t mess it up because I'm nervous!
DOCTOR: You won’t mess it up, I promise. We're just getting a baseline. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date... Hmm. It’s August… the 2nd. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I think so. It feels like time is just… flying by lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Good. Now, can you tell me the names of three things we talked about earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… that’s hard. Let me think… We talked about… my memory, I think. And my grandmother… she had Alzheimer’s. And… Lisinopril! Was that one of them? I’m so worried I’m going to fail this test!
DOCTOR: Those are all perfect, Ebony. Don’t worry at all. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words, and I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Okay. Apple… table… penny. Those are easy enough. I think I can remember those. Apple, table, penny. I hope I can still say them later!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's talk about your current mood. Have you been feeling sad, anxious, or depressed lately?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say depressed, exactly. But I’ve definitely been more… down than usual. And worried. Constantly worrying about forgetting things, about what it means. It’s stressful, and that makes me feel anxious, too. It’s a vicious cycle, really. I miss feeling… normal.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ebony. It's understandable to feel that way given the circumstances. Okay, that completes the physical and neurological exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out potential causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. What are those potential causes? And… are you thinking it could be Alzheimer's? That's my biggest fear, honestly. Is there anything I can do about it?
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question. Given your age, and the gradual onset of symptoms, Alzheimer's is something we need to rule out, but it’s less likely at your age. Other possibilities include vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, medication side effects – as we discussed with the Lisinopril – and even stress and anxiety, which can definitely affect memory. In some cases, mild cognitive impairment can occur, which is a slight decline in memory and thinking skills, but it doesn’t interfere with daily life as significantly as Alzheimer’s. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and a neurologist. Okay. I just… I really want to know what's going on. And I want to stop feeling so… scared. What does the cognitive assessment involve? Will it be a hard test?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ebony. That's why we're doing these tests. The cognitive assessment is a series of simple tasks and questions that evaluate different aspects of your memory, thinking skills, and language abilities. It’s not a hard test, and it’s not meant to be stressful. It's more of a detailed check-up for your brain, so to speak. It involves things like recalling lists of words, solving simple puzzles, and answering questions about your orientation and recent events. The neurologist will interpret the results and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan if needed. I'm going to write up the orders for the blood tests now, and I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much, and make sure you're getting enough rest and managing your stress levels as much as possible. We'll figure this out together. Do you have any questions about the tests, the referral, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think you've explained everything very clearly. Dr. Ramirez… I’ll write that name down. Okay. Rest… and manage stress. Easier said than done, but I'll try. Thank you, Dr. Finco. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explaining everything so thoroughly. I feel a little better knowing there's a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I'm glad I could help. Remember, you're not alone in this, and we'll work through it together. I'm going to print out the lab orders and the referral information now. Please let me know if you have any questions after you review them. And don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here are the lab orders, and this is the referral to Dr. Ramirez. They are a wonderful neurologist. I'll also send a summary of our conversation to Dr. Ramirez. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Finco. I really appreciate it. I'll go schedule the appointment with Dr. Ramirez now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. I wish you all the best.
