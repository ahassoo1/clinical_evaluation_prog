DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. My name is Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. My husband... he said I should come. Something about... learning things? I work with metal, so... not much time for doctor stuff, you know? It's just... a check-up, I think? I don't really remember what he said.
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. That’s perfectly fine. It's good your husband encouraged you to come in. Sometimes it helps to have someone else remind us to take care of ourselves. And working with metal does sound demanding. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about what you mean by "learning things?
PATIENT: Ugh, he said something about… safety? And… not getting sick. Like, things you should know when you… work with my hands all day. Honestly, I've been doing this for a long time. I haven't gotten sick yet. He worries too much. It's probably nothing. Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about potential health risks related to your work. That’s very thoughtful of him, and it’s good to be proactive. We can definitely make this as efficient as possible. Just to be thorough, let's go through a quick history. Have you experienced any specific symptoms lately – anything new or unusual, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I get tired, but that's just from the work. Sometimes my hands ache, but that’s normal, right? Metal is heavy! And… oh! My back. It clicks sometimes. But I always crack my back, so… I don't know. Is that a symptom? Everything hurts a little after a long day. It's just… being a worker, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, hand aches, and some clicking in your back. It’s good you’re able to distinguish what feels normal for you versus something new. The aches and fatigue from physical work are certainly understandable. The clicking in your back…that's something we should explore a little further. Has the clicking been getting worse, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I think. It's always been there. I just... ignore it. It doesn’t stop me from working. Maybe it's just old age? I'm not… young anymore, I guess. Thirty-three… is that old? My husband says I push myself too hard, but someone has to make the money. He doesn't understand. Is this about my back? Can you just fix it?
DOCTOR: Thirty-three is certainly not old! It sounds like you're very dedicated to your work, and it's admirable that you're so resilient. And I understand your concern about your back. We can definitely take a closer look. Before we focus specifically on your back, let's just quickly cover some basics to get a broader picture of your health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh… not really. I think I had the flu once, when I was little. And I broke my arm falling out of a tree when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. They fixed it. I don't… go to the doctor much. It's expensive, and I'm always busy. I don't have insurance, either. My husband keeps saying we need to get it, but… well, you know. Things are tight. Is this going to cost a lot?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to know you haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. And I appreciate you letting me know about not having insurance – that's important information. We can discuss options at the end of the visit. Okay, no major medical history. How about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mom is okay, I guess. She's… old. Lives in China. I don't see her much. My dad… he passed away a long time ago. Heart problems, I think. And my brother… he's fine. He works in an office. Boring job. No health problems that I know of. Why do you need to know about them? Is something wrong? Are you going to give me a shot? I hate shots.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Knowing your family history helps us understand potential risks and be more thorough in your care. It’s not necessarily that something is wrong, just gathering information. And no, I’m not planning on giving you a shot right now. Given your father's history of heart problems, it's good we discussed that. Now, let's talk a little about your daily life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh. My husband always tells me not to smoke. He says it's bad for my health. So, no. I have a beer sometimes with dinner, maybe one or two. Nothing big. And no, definitely not drugs. I have to be strong for work, you know? I need to be focused. My husband drinks a little more than me, but he's always complaining about his stomach. Is that because of the drinking? He's always going on about his stomach...
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption – that's helpful to know. And yes, frequent alcohol use can definitely contribute to stomach problems. Now, just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not really. I think I was itchy once after eating shrimp, but that was years ago. Maybe I just didn’t like the shrimp? My husband is allergic to cats, but I don't have cats. I'm not sure if that counts. He sneezes a lot. Is that important? I just want to get this over with. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known significant allergies. A possible sensitivity to shrimp years ago, but no current allergies. That's good to know. Alright, let's move on to a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don't poke me too much. I need my hands for work. And don't make it take long, okay? I have deadlines. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll be as efficient as possible. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your back. I'll also take a quick look at your hands, just to assess their condition. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be quick. My hands are probably fine. I use them all the time. Metal is tough on them, but… I'm used to it. Hurry up, okay? I can feel my time slipping away. This is costing me money just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128/78, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No abnormal sounds detected. Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness along your lower back, and I do detect some muscle spasm. Do you feel pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that hurts! See? I told you. My back always hurts. Especially when I lift heavy metal. You don't need to press so hard. It's just… sore. It's always sore. What does it mean? Is it broken? I need my back for work! Is it going to stop me from working? I have bills to pay!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. It doesn’t feel like anything is broken, but there’s definitely some muscle tension and tenderness. It's likely a muscle strain or spasm, probably related to the physical demands of your work. Your hands show some calluses and minor abrasions, consistent with manual labor. I notice some redness on your knuckles. Is that new, or is that usual for you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Redness? Yeah, that’s usual. Metal… it’s rough. I get cuts and scrapes all the time. Doesn’t mean anything. I just… bandage them up and keep working. It’s part of the job. I don't have time to sit around and let them heal. I have deadlines, okay? What are you going to do about my back? Is it serious? I need to know if I can still work. I have a family to feed!
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’ve been managing these minor injuries effectively. It's good you're proactive about caring for them. Regarding your back, it doesn't seem to be anything serious like a fracture or dislocation. It’s likely a muscle strain, which we can treat with some simple measures. However, it’s important to address it to prevent it from becoming a chronic issue. Given your symptoms and the physical demands of your work, I recommend the following: rest when possible, ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. To prevent this from recurring, I also suggest focusing on proper lifting techniques and considering some stretching exercises. Would you be open to me showing you a few simple stretches you can do at home?
PATIENT: Stretches? I guess. But they have to be quick. I don't have time to spend all day stretching. And ibuprofen… is that expensive? I don’t have a lot of money. My husband said we need to cut back on spending. Can I just wrap my back in a bandage and keep working? That's what I usually do. It helps a little. I just want to get back to work. I have bills to pay, okay? What about the redness on my hands? Is that something I should worry about? Metal is tough on my skin. I can't avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time and money. We can absolutely keep the stretches quick and simple – just a few basic movements to help loosen up your back muscles. Ibuprofen is relatively inexpensive – a generic brand should be quite affordable. And wrapping your back can provide some temporary relief, but it won't address the underlying muscle strain. Regarding the redness on your hands, it could be a sign of irritation or mild dermatitis from the metal. It's not immediately concerning, but if it worsens or becomes painful, we should consider a referral to a dermatologist. For now, let's focus on the back strain. I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension and pain. It’s a low dose, and it should help you get through your workdays. I’ll also provide you with some information on proper lifting techniques and simple stretches. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A prescription… okay. That’s good. But is it expensive? I don’t have insurance, remember? My husband will kill me if I spend too much money. He said we need to save for… things. I don’t remember what things. And what about the stretching? Can you show me now? Quick, okay? I have deadlines. And the lifting… I’ve been lifting metal for years. I know how to lift. It’s just… heavy. I need to know if I can still work. Is this muscle relaxant going to stop the pain? I have bills to pay, okay? I just want to get back to work. This is costing me money just sitting here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. I'll write you a prescription for the most affordable muscle relaxant available. I can also call the pharmacy to check the price for you before you go. Now, regarding lifting techniques, even experienced lifters can benefit from a quick refresher. The key is to keep your back straight, bend your knees, and keep the weight close to your body. Avoid twisting while lifting, and use your leg muscles to lift, not your back. As for stretches, this one is good for your lower back. Gently bend forward, keeping your back straight, and reach towards your toes. Hold for 10-15 seconds, and repeat a few times. The muscle relaxant will help to ease the pain and muscle tension, but it's important to also rest and take care of your back. It’s unlikely it will completely stop the pain with heavy lifting, but it should make it more manageable. I'm happy to write a note for your work recommending lighter duties for a few days if you think that would be helpful. Do you think that’s something you would be interested in?
PATIENT: Lighter duties… maybe. My boss is… difficult. He doesn't understand. He just wants the work done. But… a note might help. Okay, write a note. But make it short. He doesn’t like reading. And the stretching… it looks hard. I don’t have much space at work. But I’ll try. Maybe. If I have time. Okay, write the note and give me the prescription. And tell me how much it costs. My husband is going to kill me if it’s expensive. I have bills to pay, okay? I just want to get back to work. This is costing me money just sitting here. This has been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s a note for your employer recommending lighter duties for a few days, if possible. I’ve also written the prescription for the muscle relaxant. I’ve just checked the pharmacy’s website. The muscle relaxant should cost around $20-$30, depending on the brand. I also want to reiterate the importance of proper lifting techniques and stretching. And if your back pain worsens or doesn’t improve after a few days, please come back to see me. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: $30… okay. That's… manageable. My husband won't kill me. Yet. No. No more questions. I just want to go. This has been a long time. I need to get back to work. Thank you. I guess. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, please take care of yourself and listen to your body. Don't hesitate to come back if you need anything. Have a good day, Airam. And good luck with your work. .
