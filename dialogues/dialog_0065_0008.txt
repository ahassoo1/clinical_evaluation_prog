DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… right. My ear. It feels… full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Been that way for… a while now, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is a rather vague description, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes, right. Hmm. It's not painful, exactly. Just… muffled. Like you're underwater, a little. And sometimes, when I move my head, I get a… a whooshing sound? I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. It’s not constant, either. Comes and goes. Honestly, I mostly just ignore it when I can. But it's been worse lately.
DOCTOR: So, muffled hearing in your right ear, with occasional whooshing sounds when you move your head. And it's been worsening recently. Have you noticed any dizziness or ringing in your ear accompanying this fullness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I get a little unsteady sometimes, but I figured that’s just… getting older, you know? And ringing… hmm. Maybe? It's quiet here, so I might be imagining things. I don't think so, but… it’s hard to say. I wouldn’t know what ringing even sounds like, really. Sorry, I’m not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s helpful that you’re telling me what you are experiencing. Let's try to be more precise. When you say “sometimes,” how often are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Honestly? It varies. Some days it’s barely noticeable. Other days, like today, it’s pretty constant. Maybe… three or four times a week it bothers me enough to notice? It’s been worse this past month, definitely. I mostly work outside, you see. Lots of wind. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don't know. It's just… a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent muffled hearing in your right ear, occurring roughly three to four times a week, worsening over the past month, and you suspect potential connection to your outdoor work. Now, let’s move on to some general questions. Do you have any history of ear infections, or have you ever had any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… I think so, when I was a child? A long time ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. As for injuries… let me think. No, not to my head or ears, not that I recall. I’ve fallen a few times working, but never hit my head. I work in agriculture, you know, inspecting fields. Lots of walking… and sometimes things are uneven. But never a direct hit, no. My wife… she would have remembered if I had. She had a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Right. No reported ear infections as an adult, no head or ear injuries. And you mentioned working in agriculture. Are you exposed to any loud noises during your work?
PATIENT: Loud noises… hmm. Tractors, sometimes. And… occasionally machinery being tested. It's not constant, like working in a factory or something. More… sporadic. I try to avoid being near it when it's really loud, honestly. I’m not as young as I used to be, you see. Everything bothers me a little more these days. I wouldn’t say it’s a big problem, but it’s there. Is that relevant? I’m sorry, I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, you're not rambling. The intermittent exposure to loud noises is relevant. Now, let's briefly go over some other things. Do you have any allergies, and if so, to what?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, but I just figured that was the pollen. Never been officially diagnosed with anything. My wife always handled all the doctor’s appointments, you see. She was very organized. I just… did the work. Sorry, I'm not much help with this part. I don’t really pay attention to those sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. That’s about it, really. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking pills when I can, honestly. My wife always said… well, never mind. It's not important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Medication for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen. Now, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears. Please lean forward. Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – buildup in your right ear canal. It's not excessive, but it could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The ear canal itself appears normal, and the eardrum is intact, although slightly dull in appearance. I don’t see any signs of infection. Okay, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Based on what you’ve told me, and my examination, it seems likely that your symptoms are due to cerumen impaction – a buildup of earwax – potentially exacerbated by your outdoor work and intermittent noise exposure. However, the slight dullness of your eardrum warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Further investigation…? Oh dear. What does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? I just wanted something to clear up this fullness… not… whatever that was. I'm not good with this sort of thing, Doctor. Honestly. I just want to hear properly again. Is it going to require… surgery? Or something complicated? I don't like complicated.
DOCTOR: Please don't panic, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. “Further investigation” simply means we need to rule out other possibilities, and ensure there isn't anything more serious going on. It doesn’t automatically mean surgery, or anything complicated. I want to be thorough. The slight dullness of your eardrum could indicate a very mild fluid buildup, which is not uncommon. To investigate further, I recommend a tympanometry test – it’s a quick, painless test that measures the movement of your eardrum and helps us assess middle ear function. We can do that here in the clinic today. Additionally, I would like to order an audiogram – a hearing test – to establish a baseline and see if there’s any measurable hearing loss. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… right. More tests. Oh dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose. I just… I don't like being fussed over, you know? But if it will rule things out and make sure it’s not serious… then yes. Let’s do the tests. Just… please try to explain everything clearly, okay? And don’t use too many big words. My wife always said I was terrible with medical terms. And… how long will they take? I have things to do this afternoon. Fields to inspect, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I understand. I will explain everything as clearly as possible, and avoid unnecessary jargon. The tympanometry test will only take a few minutes – we simply insert a small probe into your ear canal, and it measures how your eardrum responds to sound. It’s completely painless. The audiogram – the hearing test – will take a little longer, perhaps 20-30 minutes. You’ll wear headphones and listen to various tones, and indicate when you can hear them. I’ll have my assistant, Maria, come in and get you set up. She will explain the process in detail. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It's likely the issue is simply earwax, but we need to be certain. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… acceptable. Twenty to thirty minutes. I can spare that, I suppose. Maria, you say? Right. Just… please hurry if you can. Those fields won’t inspect themselves, you know. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I really do. It's… comforting, knowing what’s going on. Even if it involves tests. Just… let's get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I’ll speak with Maria and ensure everything is done as quickly and efficiently as possible. We want to get you back to your fields as soon as we can. Maria will be in shortly to begin the tests. In the meantime, please sit comfortably and relax. Maria, could you please come to examination room three?
