DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 49 years of age. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Eaddy. Yes, that’s right, 49. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It’s different than it used to be. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but it’s enough that I noticed, and a friend mentioned it, so… that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… I see. While not a typical complaint, it is certainly something we can explore. It’s… unusual to present with this specifically. Now, Ms. Purtee, has this change been sudden, or has it developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, definitely gradually. It wasn't like bam, overnight. More like… over the last few months, I've just noticed it getting… stronger, and different. Hard to explain. Not necessarily worse, just… not me. I always smelled kinda… floral, if that makes sense? Now it's… musky, maybe? I don’t know. It’s confusing me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Floral, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what people always told me, anyway. It was subtle, but I always used a lavender soap, and folks would comment on it. Now… not lavender. More like… well, I don't even know what it smells like. It’s not a bad smell, exactly, just… unfamiliar. It's just concerning, you know? I’ve never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: It’s… curious. Changes in scent can occur, though often they are linked to dietary shifts or… hygiene practices. Have there been any alterations to your usual soap, deodorant, or laundry detergent?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’ve been using the same lavender soap for years, the same deodorant – a natural one, unscented – and the same detergent. I haven’t switched brands or anything like that. I even double-checked to make sure my friend hadn't accidentally used a different laundry soap when she did my wash a couple weeks ago, but she swears she didn't. It’s just… me. Or what’s happening to me, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this has been developing over the last few months?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four months now. It started very faintly, and I thought maybe I was imagining things. But it’s definitely more noticeable now. It’s not constant, either. Some days it’s barely there, and other days… well, other days I can smell it on myself, even after showering. It's unsettling, honestly. I've always been very… clean.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, I must say, this is… an atypical presentation. It's possible, though unlikely, it could be a minor skin condition or a reaction to something. However, given your description, we shouldn't rule out underlying medical factors. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No fever, no weight loss, no rashes. I’ve been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? I do a lot of physical work with the floor laying, so I just figured it was from that. My appetite is normal, and everything else feels… regular. No changes in my bathroom habits, if you don’t mind me saying. Just… the smell. And the fatigue, but I didn't connect it to the smell until you mentioned it.
DOCTOR: Fatigue… Alright. And you mentioned you do floor laying. Is that a new occupation, or have you been doing that for some time?
PATIENT: I've been doing floor laying for about five years now, after my divorce. It's hard work, but I like it. Keeps me busy. It's not new, no. I’ve been doing pretty much the same amount of work each week for the past few years. Maybe a little more this summer because business has been good, but nothing drastic. I’ve always been pretty strong, I've never had trouble keeping up. It’s just… the smell is really bothering me, and now the tiredness. I’m worried something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Ms. Purtee, while I understand your concern, it’s important to remember that the human body is complex. Fatigue can stem from numerous sources, and a subtle alteration in body odor is rarely indicative of a serious medical condition. However, to be thorough, I think it’s prudent to run a few basic tests. We’ll do a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Perhaps a thyroid check as well, given the fatigue. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, I’d rather be safe than sorry, right? If it puts my mind at ease, I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and thyroid check… yes, that all sounds fine. When can we do those? I’ve got a job scheduled for Friday, so maybe before then?
DOCTOR: Very well. We have a phlebotomist available this afternoon. We can draw the blood now, and the results should be back within three to five business days. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the procedure to you. While we wait for the results, I'd also like you to keep a detailed log of your daily activities, diet, and stress levels. It might provide some clues. And try not to dwell on this excessively. It’s likely a minor issue. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds like a plan. I can do a log of my activities, diet, and stress levels. I’ll try not to worry too much, but it’s hard when something feels… off. Thank you, Dr. Eaddy. I appreciate you taking my concern seriously. I’m ready when the nurse is. And just one quick question… will these tests tell us why my smell is changing?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us rule out any underlying medical causes for your fatigue, and possibly provide some insight into the odor change, although it’s unlikely to be a direct indicator. We are simply gathering data at this stage, Ms. Purtee. It’s a process of elimination. I will have the nurse come in now. Do you have any other immediate questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again. It’s good to know you’re looking into it. A process of elimination… alright. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you, Dr. Eaddy.
