DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It started a couple weeks ago, just a little bit, and now it’s… persistent, you know? It’s driving me a bit crazy, to be honest. Not painful, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say. And it’s been about two weeks?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly two weeks. Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, it was so gradual. I thought maybe it was just dry skin at first, with the summer heat and all, so I started using lotion, but that didn’t really help. It’s all over, arms, legs, back… even my stomach. It doesn’t seem to be getting better.
DOCTOR: All over… not localized to one area. And lotion isn’t providing relief. Hmm. Have you noticed any rash accompanying the itching, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No rash, Doctor. That’s what’s so strange. Just… the itching. No bumps, no redness, nothing like that. Just… an insistent itch. It’s not like anything I’ve ever felt before, really. It's… frustrating. I keep scratching, of course, but that doesn’t help help, does it?
DOCTOR: No, scratching rarely does. Alright. And have you tried any other remedies, beyond the lotion?
PATIENT: Let me think… I tried some calamine lotion, just on my arms mostly, but that didn’t do much either. Oh! And my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she suggested some oatmeal baths. I tried one of those a couple of nights ago, but it didn’t seem to make a difference. I'm really at a loss, honestly. It’s just… constant. It keeps me up at night, too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Oatmeal baths… right. And it’s interfering with your sleep. Any fever, chills, or fatigue accompanying this, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or anything like that. I’ve been feeling… normal, energy-wise, I suppose. A little tired, maybe, but that’s probably just… getting older, you know? I haven't been sick or anything. Just… itchy. It’s hard to describe. It’s not like a bug bite itch, it’s more… internal, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Internal" is… descriptive. We’ll need to rule a few things out. Let's go through some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to work in a garden center for years, around all sorts of plants, and never had any problems. My wife, bless her heart, always said I was immune to everything. She’s gone now, though. About five years. But she always kept track of those things. I’m fairly certain I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Just Medicare, mostly. I take a low-dose aspirin, doctor’s orders after a little… heart flutter a couple of years back, but that’s it. Nothing else. And I haven't changed anything recently, no new vitamins or supplements or anything like that. Just the aspirin, every day.
DOCTOR: Low-dose aspirin… okay. And have you had any significant medical conditions in the past, beyond the heart flutter?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had pneumonia when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major since then, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? My wife, she used to say I was as tough as an old boot. She was always good at making me feel better. But no, nothing serious, nothing that I can think of that would be connected to this itching.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… eczema, I think it was. When she was a girl. It was mostly on her hands and elbows. She managed it with creams, I think. And my father… he was a healthy man, lived to be eighty-five. No skin problems that I ever knew of. My wife’s family… they were mostly healthy too, as far as I know. Nothing stands out in my memory, anyway. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move onto your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife couldn’t stand it. And I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe three or four times a week. Nothing heavy. And definitely no drugs. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Just enjoy a quiet life. Mostly gardening, reading… and trying to figure out why I’m so itchy!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ve covered quite a bit. Now, I’m going to need to examine you. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I hope you can find something. It’s driving me a bit mad, you know?
DOCTOR: I don’t see any visible rash, Mr. Ferneding. No hives, excoriations… the skin appears normal in texture and coloration. Let me check your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Your heart and lungs sound clear on auscultation. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. This is… unusual. We need to consider some blood work. A complete blood count, liver function tests, and a thyroid panel. It could be anything from a mild allergic reaction to something more systemic.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. I just want to get to the bottom of it, you know? A bit unsettling when things just… start happening without a reason. Blood work sounds good. Is there anything else I need to do?
DOCTOR: I’ll have the nurse draw the blood samples now. While we wait for the results, I recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine. Something like cetirizine or loratadine may help alleviate the itching. And avoid any harsh soaps or detergents. I'm also going to order a stool sample analysis, just to rule out any parasitic infection. It's a long shot, given your history, but we need to be comprehensive. I'll have the nurse give you the necessary forms and containers. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Antihistamine, gentle soap, stool sample… I can do that. The nurse will explain everything, I presume? I guess I don't have many questions right now. Just… when can I expect the results? It's just… frustrating, not knowing. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: The lab usually takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back. The nurse will contact you with the findings. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. Try not to worry too much, Mr. Ferneding. It's likely something relatively minor. And please, avoid scratching as much as possible. We will get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. 24-48 hours… I’ll try to be patient. And I’ll try to keep from scratching, though it’s easier said than done. Thank you for your time, Doctor Nestingen. I appreciate you looking into this. I suppose I’ll just go home and try not to think about it. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Ferneding. The nurse will see you to the door. Goodbye.
