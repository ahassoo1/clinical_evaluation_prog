DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, have a seat. I’m Dr. Pehrson. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Thank you. I want… test, for my family. My… where I come from, you know? DNA test. I hear you can do that.
DOCTOR: A DNA test?
PATIENT: Yes. My… my parents, from islands. Long time ago. I want know… more about where everything come from. My kids… they want know too, but they live far away. I want to give them something… real, you know? Not just stories.
DOCTOR: Look, sir, this is a family practice. We deal with things like colds, flu, high blood pressure... not genealogy. I’m a doctor, not a historian. You’d need to go to a specialist for something like that, or… one of those mail-in services. Honestly, those aren’t always very reliable. Is there anything medically wrong that I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. No… no sick. Just… want to know. My… my bones tell story, maybe? I am old man. Maybe test can show… everything? I thought… doctor know things, about body. And body tell story of where you from, right?
DOCTOR: Sir, with all due respect, your bones telling a story is… not a medical diagnosis. We can do blood work, check your vital signs, maybe a basic physical, but that's about it. I'm seeing you are 85 years old. Are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Little bit in my leg, sometimes. Old leg. But I walk. I still make things. Wood things. Not so fast like before, but… still make. Not big pain. Just… old. Is that what you mean? Like, is that why I am here? Because my leg is old?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with this leg pain. How long have you been having it?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… two, three years? Comes and goes. Mostly when I walk too much. Or… when rain comes. Old bones, I think. It is just… part of being old man. Not something to worry about, you think? I just… wanted to know where I come from. That is all.
DOCTOR: Well, even “old bones” can have underlying issues. We should at least rule out anything serious. Do you have any swelling in the leg?
PATIENT: Swelling? Sometimes. Not always. Mostly… at the end of the day. When I sit too long. A little bit. Like… water inside. Not big swelling. Just… puffy. Is puffy bad? I don’t know these words, Doctor. I just know my leg. It gets tired. And puffy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned you still make things with wood. Is that difficult with the leg pain?
PATIENT: No… no too hard. Just… slow. I used to… I used to build boats. Big boats! But that was long time ago. Now I make little things. Boxes. Birds. For my grandkids. It is good to keep hands busy, you know? It keeps… mind busy too. Leg pain… not stop me. Just… make it take longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no fever, no chills, no shortness of breath, no chest pain… Just tired leg, occasional puffiness. Let’s take a look at it. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes. Okay. Slow. I am slow today. Rain coming, I think. It always makes my bones talk. Careful… careful now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. Let me just take a look. Hmm. There is some tenderness here, along the shin. And a little bit of swelling, as you mentioned. Capillary refill looks good. Your pulses feel normal. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your foot or toes?
PATIENT: Numbness? No… not really. Sometimes… feel cold. Very cold. But not… numb. Just… cold. Like… water cold. Like fish cold. Maybe that is the rain? I always feel the rain in my bones. Before it even come. You think I am crazy, Doctor? Old man talk about rain in bones…
DOCTOR: No, sir, I don’t think you’re crazy. It's just… a bit unusual. Okay. Can you point your toes like this?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… this? It is hard. It… tighten. It does not want to go so far. My leg… it does not like that. It says… “Stop.” Like little voice inside. You hear the voice, Doctor? Old leg talk… always talk. You think… it is just old?
DOCTOR: Well, it appears you have some limited range of motion and some tenderness in your lower leg. Given your age and the fact that you've been experiencing this for a while, it's likely some arthritis. We can try some over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – and see if that helps. I recommend you also try to elevate your leg when you’re resting and do some gentle stretches. Now, I understand you were hoping for something more regarding your family history, but honestly, that's not something I can assist you with. Perhaps a genealogy service would be more helpful. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Arthritis… That is what Mama had. In her hands. Hurt so much. Ibuprofen… is that the little white pill? I take those sometimes, for my headache. Gentle stretch… like this? Okay. Okay. Gentle stretch. Ibuprofen. So… no magic test? No story from my bones? No help to find my people? Thank you, Doctor. For trying. Maybe I just… old man with old bones. .
DOCTOR: Alright, well, if the pain gets any worse, or you experience any swelling, redness, or warmth in your leg, please come back immediately. And, honestly, if you're really concerned about your family history, I suggest you look online for genealogy resources. Have a good day, Mr. Scobie. .
