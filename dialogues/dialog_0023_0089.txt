DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, I suppose. Lower part. It’s been hurting, quite badly at times. I… honestly, it comes and goes, and I can’t quite recall when it started, exactly. It feels… like a deep ache, mostly. And sometimes sharper, but not always. It’s been… troubling. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… SLE? Is that right? I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. SLE, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, is a possibility we'll need to explore. It’s good you brought that up. We'll get to the bottom of this. To start, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Yes, Lupus. It sounds… serious. Specific… well, it’s… difficult. It’s not a constant thing, you see. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a dull discomfort. Other days… well, it feels like a weight pressing down, and it makes it hard to… to even sit comfortably. And like I said, sometimes there are sharp pains, almost like cramping, but not quite. It doesn't seem to be related to what I've eaten, if that makes sense. I’ve tried to pay attention, but… everything feels a bit hazy these days. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Glymph. The intermittent nature is important, as is the lack of clear relation to food intake. You mentioned cramping… is that accompanied by any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… bowel habits? Well… now that you mention it… sometimes. Not always, but… occasionally, I find myself needing to go more frequently. And… it’s not always… solid, if you understand. But again, it’s not every time I have the pain. It’s all rather… unpredictable, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… it all feels like a jumble, honestly. Does that… help clarify things at all?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Glymph. Thank you for sharing that, even if it feels jumbled. We’ll try to sort it out. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the stomach pain and bowel changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, I have been rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes my joints ache. My hands, mostly, and my knees. But I always assumed that was just… getting older. It seems to come and go, like everything else. And… oh! There was that rash, a few weeks ago. On my face. It was… rather red and flaky, I remember. It faded after a few days, though. Is that… important? I’m trying to recall everything, but it’s… difficult, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Glymph, all of that is important. The fatigue, joint pain, and rash are certainly things we need to consider, especially in light of your previous physician mentioning SLE. Let's move on to some basic questions. Have you had a fever recently?
PATIENT: A fever… Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I haven’t taken my temperature recently, to be honest. I haven’t felt feverish, but… I don’t always notice these things, you see. I tend to… not pay much attention to minor ailments. It’s probably nothing, really. I hope I’m not being a bother, asking so many questions. It's just trying to piece everything together is proving… challenging.
DOCTOR: You're not being a bother at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s my job to gather as much information as possible. Alright. And what about any changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Weight… Well, I… I believe I've lost a bit of weight, actually. Not intentionally, mind you. I haven't been eating much less, but… my clothes feel a little looser than they used to. It’s not a dramatic amount, but noticeable. Perhaps a few pounds. I apologize for being so imprecise. It’s… hard to keep track of these things. I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, and it all seems a bit blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, given your symptoms – the intermittent abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, fatigue, joint pain, rash, and unintentional weight loss – along with the previous mention of SLE, a thorough examination is warranted. I'd like to begin with a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A thorough examination. Yes, please. I trust your judgment completely. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready whenever you are. I suppose… you’ll need me to… change into a gown? Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m quite… willing to cooperate. It’s good to finally be getting to the bottom of this, honestly. I’ve been feeling rather… unsettled for quite some time now.
DOCTOR: Yes, if you could change into a gown, that would be helpful. There’s a private area just down the hall. Take your time, and we’ll begin when you’re ready. I'll start with your vital signs while you change, then we'll move on to a more comprehensive examination of your abdomen, joints, and skin. And Ms. Glymph, please don’t hesitate to let me know if you're uncomfortable at any point during the exam.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I shall be right back. And… I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. It’s… a bother, I know.
