DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice meet you too. I want... test. For my family. Long time ago, family come from... many places. I want know where, exactly. DNA test, you know? I hear about them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're interested in a DNA test to learn more about your family history and where your ancestors came from. That's certainly something a lot of people are interested in these days. Just to clarify, are you experiencing any health concerns that prompted you to come in today, or is this solely for genealogical purposes?
PATIENT: No problems, Doctor. Just... curious. Always curious. My mother, she tell stories. Islands, different islands. But old stories, you know? I want see if true. Not for sickness, just... knowing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. It’s good to be curious and want to learn about your heritage. So, to be clear, you’re requesting information about getting a DNA test done through the clinic, not necessarily a medical examination or treatment?
PATIENT: Yes. That right. Test. See where my people from. You can do that here? I hear it cost money. Is okay with Medicare? I have that.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Unfortunately, Mr. Scobie, routine ancestry DNA tests are generally not covered by Medicare. They are considered elective, meaning you choose to have them done for personal reasons, rather than for a medical necessity. However, there are some genetic tests Medicare will cover if they are related to a medical condition. It doesn't sound like that's what you're looking for right now, but I want to be thorough. We don’t actually perform the DNA testing here at the clinic, but I can certainly provide you with information and resources for reputable companies that do. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh. No sickness test. Just... family. Okay, no Medicare. That's... okay. Maybe. You write down names? For the test people? Reputable… you say? That good word. Yes, please. Write down the names. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here’s a list of a few companies that offer ancestry DNA testing. I've included a brief description of each and their websites. These are all generally considered reputable, but it's always a good idea to do your own research and read reviews before choosing a company. They vary in price and the amount of information they provide. Some also offer options for additional genetic health reports, if you ever become interested in that. Do any of these names sound familiar to you, or would you like me to go over them with you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. This good. 23andMe... I hear that one before. AncestryDNA... yes, that too. What is… “raw data”? It say here, “download raw data”. What that mean? Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Scobie. "Raw data" refers to the uninterpreted genetic information that the testing company collects from your sample. It's basically a long string of letters and numbers representing your DNA sequence. Most people don't need to worry about the raw data. The companies typically analyze it for you and provide a report explaining your ancestry. However, some people choose to download the raw data so they can upload it to other websites that offer different analysis or additional reports. It's a bit technical, and not usually necessary for basic ancestry testing. Do you think you'd be interested in exploring those other websites, or would you prefer to just stick with one of the companies on the list for a straightforward report?
PATIENT: No. Too much… computer. I just want know where my family come from. Simple report. One company. Not need raw data. 23andMe... you say? That sound easy. Is expensive? How much money?
DOCTOR: 23andMe has a few different packages. Their basic ancestry service, which tells you your ethnic origins, currently costs around $99, plus shipping. They often have sales, so the price can fluctuate. They also offer a health + ancestry package for more money, which includes information about your genetic predispositions to certain health conditions, but that’s definitely more expensive. For your purpose – learning about your family history – the basic ancestry service would be sufficient, I believe. Does that sound like something you’d be interested in pursuing?
PATIENT: $99… Okay. That not so bad. Not too much money for knowing. Shipping… how long to get the test? And then… how long for the answer? I am patient man, but… old. I want know before I get too old!
DOCTOR: That's a very fair question, Mr. Scobie. Shipping usually takes about 5-7 business days. Once they receive your sample, it typically takes 6-8 weeks to process and receive your results. Sometimes it can be a little longer, depending on their current workload. They'll send you updates via email throughout the process. And you're right, it’s good to get it done sooner rather than later! Do you have a way to order online, or would you prefer I print out some information on how to order through their website?
PATIENT: I... not good with computer. My grandson, he can help. He good with those things. Can you write down the website address? Big letters, please. And maybe a little note, “ask grandson to help”? That good. Thank you, Doctor. You very helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Scobie. Here you go. www.23andMe.com Ask grandson to help with ordering. You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That all. Thank you again, Doctor. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful day as well, Mr. Scobie. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
