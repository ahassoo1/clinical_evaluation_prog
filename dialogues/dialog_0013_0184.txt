DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Trendler, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it's about my… appearance. Not happy with it, you see. Been this way a long time. Waste of good money, probably, but my daughter insisted. She says I look… old. And she's usually right about things, even if she is a bit too forward sometimes. I just want to know if anything can be done about it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about changes in your appearance and are hoping to explore options. It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in – it’s helpful to have a support system when thinking about these things. When you say “changes,” could you be a bit more specific about what you’re noticing?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. Well, look at me! Everything’s… dropping. Skin is wrinkly, like a prune. And I used to be a strong man, you know? Pile driving is hard work! Now… I just look… weak. And tired. Is that enough detail for you, Doctor? Don’t need a whole life story. Just want a fix, if there is one. Don't got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. Changes in skin texture – wrinkles – and a sense of losing muscle mass and overall strength. It sounds like you're feeling quite frustrated with these changes, and wanting to address them. To get a better picture, let's go through a few things. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels besides just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Energy levels? Well, I don't run marathons, if that's what you're asking. Used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now, I get winded walking to the mailbox. My daughter does the gardening now, I can barely bend over. It's… embarrassing, frankly. And I don't like being useless. Is this going somewhere, Doctor, or are we just talking about my life now?
DOCTOR: No, we’re definitely getting somewhere. It sounds like there's been a gradual decline in your stamina and physical function. That's helpful information. Now, have you experienced any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Mostly in my back. Old injury from… well, a long time ago. Nothing that stops me, usually. Just aches, you know? Gets worse when the weather changes. But I’m not here about my back. I’m here because I look like something the cat dragged in. Focus on the appearance part, please. I don’t want to waste your time – or mine – with old aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can focus on your concerns about your appearance. Just want to rule things out. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? I think I've lost a bit. Clothes are a little looser. Not intentionally, you understand. Just… haven't been eating as much. Not much of an appetite these days. Everything tastes like cardboard, if I'm honest. My daughter keeps trying to feed me fancy meals, but I just push it around the plate. It's not like I'm trying to starve myself. Just… not hungry. Is this important? Because if it isn't, let's just get to the point.
DOCTOR: It is important, thank you for telling me. Unintentional weight loss and a decreased appetite can be related to a number of things, so it’s good we’re talking about it. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – experienced similar changes in their appearance as they got older, or had issues with unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmph. My mother lived to be ninety-two, strong as an ox until the very end. Always working in the garden, baking, cleaning… never complained about a thing. My father… he was a farmer. Worked hard all his life. Didn’t spend much time looking in the mirror. He died young, heart trouble. Neither of them were worried about wrinkles, I can tell you that much. This whole thing is ridiculous, really. But my daughter… she'll never let it go. I doubt either of them lost weight like this, though. They ate everything put in front of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. No family history of similar changes or weight loss. And I understand your frustration. Now, quickly, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had a problem with any medicine. Took some antibiotics for a bad tooth once, years ago. That's it. Perfectly healthy, always have been. Until recently, of course. Don't see why that matters, though. Can't fix old age with pills, can you? I just want to know if there’s something… something visible you can do.
DOCTOR: You're right, pills aren't going to fix aging! But it's important to have a complete picture. Last question, quickly - are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. My daughter makes me take it. Says it's good for my health. That's it. Nothing else. Really, Doctor, are we almost done? I got things to do. This is taking a long time. I just want a quick answer. What can you do? Or can't you do anything? Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. No medications other than a multivitamin. Alright, Mr. Trendler, let's talk about your concerns. I hear you’re frustrated with changes in your appearance, loss of muscle mass, decreased appetite and unintentional weight loss. Let me quickly examine you, and then we can discuss possible options. It will just be a basic check – listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But make it quick. Don't want to be lying around all day. And no poking and prodding, you hear? Just a quick look. I got a lawn to oversee. Don't waste my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning right now. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness when I press here on the left side. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Your weight is 122 pounds, which is a decrease from previous records. Do you have any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Hmph. A little, yes. Just a dull ache. Nothing major. Always been a little tender there, since the accident. Pile driving is not a gentle profession, you know. And I told you, I don't want a whole life story. Let's get back to the appearance part, Doctor. Is there anything you can do or not? I’m wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. The tenderness is likely related to your previous injury. Given your concerns about your appearance, loss of muscle mass, unintentional weight loss, and decreased appetite, I think it’s important to investigate a bit further before we discuss cosmetic options. I want to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. I recommend a blood test to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. I also think a basic metabolic panel would be helpful to assess your kidney and liver function. Finally, I’d like to do a stool test to rule out any digestive issues. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood tests and stool tests? Really, Doctor? You think I lost weight because of my stool? This is ridiculous! My daughter will be furious if I come home covered in… well, never mind. Look, I came here about my face. About looking old and weak. You want to poke around with blood and… that… before you even look at fixing the problem? No. I don't like it. I want to know if there's a cream or something you can give me, or maybe a procedure. That’s what I came for. If you can’t do that, I’m leaving. I don’t have time for this. Tell me straight. Is there anything you can do to make me look better, yes or no? Don’t bother with the tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration, and I respect your wishes. While I strongly recommend the tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I can discuss cosmetic options with you. However, it's important to understand that without addressing the potential underlying causes of your weight loss and decreased appetite, any cosmetic improvements may be temporary or ineffective. There are several options we could consider. Topical creams containing retinoids can help improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. We could also discuss procedures like chemical peels or microdermabrasion to exfoliate the skin and stimulate collagen production. For deeper wrinkles, we could consider fillers or Botox, but these are more invasive and come with potential risks. Do any of those options sound appealing to you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fillers or Botox… those sound… promising. But invasive? What does that even mean? And risks? I don't want to end up looking worse than I already do. What are the risks? Be specific. And how long will it take? And how much will it cost? I don't want any surprises. My daughter handles the finances, but she’ll be asking questions. So, tell me straight. What’s involved, what are the risks, and how much is it going to cost? Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk specifics. Fillers, typically hyaluronic acid-based, involve injecting a substance under the skin to restore volume and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Botox, or botulinum toxin, relaxes the muscles that cause wrinkles. Both procedures are considered minimally invasive, meaning they don’t require surgery, but they are not without risks. Risks of Fillers: Common side effects include redness, swelling, bruising, and tenderness at the injection site. These usually resolve within a few days to a week. More rare but serious complications include infection, allergic reaction, and, very rarely, vascular occlusion, which can cause skin damage. Risks of Botox: Common side effects include temporary bruising, swelling, and headache. More rare complications include drooping eyelid or eyebrow, which is usually temporary, and allergic reaction. The procedures typically take about 15-30 minutes each. You can have both done in the same visit. The cost for fillers varies depending on the amount of product used, but typically ranges from $600-$800 per syringe. Botox costs around $200-$400 per area treated, depending on the number of units used. Before proceeding, I would need to do a thorough assessment of your facial anatomy and discuss your goals in detail. I also strongly recommend starting with a conservative approach, using a small amount of product to see how your skin reacts. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. $600 to $800 a syringe? And $200 to $400 an area? My daughter is going to kill me. But… maybe. Maybe if it’s just a little… a little bit. What areas do you think need it the most? Don’t be polite. Tell me straight. And what about the… drooping? I don't want to end up looking like a melted wax figure. And how long does it last? If I’m going to spend that kind of money, it better not be gone in a month. Quickly. Tell me everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns. Looking at your face, I think addressing the nasolabial folds – the lines running from your nose to your mouth – would make a significant difference. Also, adding volume to your cheeks would restore some of your facial structure and give you a more youthful appearance. Finally, we could address any fine lines around your mouth and eyes. The amount of product needed will depend on your desired results, but I would estimate needing about 1-2 syringes for the nasolabial folds and cheeks combined. Fillers typically last 6-12 months, depending on the type of product used and your individual metabolism. Botox lasts 3-4 months. We can discuss using a longer-lasting filler if you prefer, but these are typically more expensive. Regarding the “drooping,” that is a rare complication, but it’s important to be aware of the risks. I am very experienced in administering fillers and Botox, and I take meticulous care to avoid complications. I will also use a very conservative approach, starting with a small amount of product to see how your skin reacts. Before proceeding, I need to obtain your informed consent and discuss any potential risks and benefits in detail. I also need to review your medical history to ensure you are a suitable candidate for these procedures. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Let's get it over with. Medical history… I don't have much. High blood pressure, controlled with medication. Had a pile driving accident years ago, but it’s old news. Other than that, perfectly healthy. You said you take "meticulous care"? What does that even mean? Are you going to… measure everything? Poke around a lot? I don't like needles. And I don't want to end up looking… different. Just… better. Can you show me some… before and after pictures? Of someone who looks like me? Not some young lady. Someone… older. Quickly. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns. “Meticulous care” means I will carefully assess your facial anatomy, use precise injection techniques, and monitor you closely for any signs of complications. I will also use a small needle and a topical numbing cream to minimize discomfort. I will review your medical history in detail to ensure you are a suitable candidate for these procedures. High blood pressure is manageable, but it's important to be aware of the potential risks. I will show you some before-and-after pictures of patients with similar facial structures and concerns. These are a few examples of patients who have undergone filler and Botox treatments. You can see how the procedures can restore volume, reduce wrinkles, and give a more youthful appearance. These results are typical, but individual results may vary. Do these examples give you a better idea of what to expect?
PATIENT: Hmph. Those… aren't bad. The lady on the left looks… less tired. And the wrinkles are gone. But she doesn't look… fake. That's good. Okay. Let’s do it. But just… a little. Not too much. I don't want to look like a different person. Just… better. And no poking around too much. And I want to be sure you know what you're doing. You said you were experienced? How many of these have you done? Quickly. Tell me straight. And what’s the first step? Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler, I understand. "A little" is a good starting point. We can always add more later if you’re not satisfied. I have performed over 500 filler and Botox treatments in the last five years. I pride myself on achieving natural-looking results and prioritizing patient safety and comfort. The first step is to thoroughly cleanse your skin and apply a topical numbing cream to minimize any discomfort. Then, I will carefully mark the injection sites and administer the filler or Botox using a small needle. The entire procedure typically takes about 30 minutes. Before we begin, I need you to sign the informed consent form, acknowledging that you understand the risks and benefits of the procedures. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hmph. 500? That’s… a lot. Alright. Consent form. Let’s get it over with. No more questions. Just… do it. And make sure it doesn't hurt too much. And don't make me look like a… clown. Quickly. Where do I sign?
DOCTOR: Here you are, Mr. Trendler. It outlines the procedures, potential risks and benefits, and post-procedure care instructions. Please read through it carefully, and feel free to ask if anything is unclear. You can sign here with your finger. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Take your time. Once you've signed, we can get started.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. There. Done. Let's just get it over with. Quickly. Don’t keep me waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Just relax and try to breathe deeply. I'm going to apply a topical numbing cream now, which will take about 10-15 minutes to fully work. It will feel cool and slightly tingling. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. We'll take it slow and steady. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just… don't poke me too much. And tell me when it's done. I got things to do, you know. Don't want to spend all day here. Just… get on with it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Just relax for a few minutes while the numbing cream takes effect. I’ll let you know when we're ready to begin. So, do you have any plans for the rest of the afternoon?
PATIENT: Hmph. Plans? Just got to oversee the lawn crew. They never do it right. Always leaving clippings everywhere. And the roses need pruning. Don't have time for fancy plans. Just… work. Always work. And now, this. Wasting my afternoon getting poked with needles. Quickly. Is that cream working yet? I feel a little… tingly.
DOCTOR: Yes, it seems to be working well. The area is quite numb now. You shouldn't feel much discomfort at all. Okay, Mr. Trendler, we're ready to begin. I'm going to start with a small amount of filler in your nasolabial folds. I'll inject it slowly and carefully, and we'll assess the results after each injection. Just try to relax and breathe deeply. You might feel a slight pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pressure, yeah. Feels… weird. Not exactly painful, but… unsettling. Like something’s under my skin. Stop poking me for a minute. Let me… adjust. And how much have you put in? Don’t want too much. Just… a little. Quickly. And tell me how long this is going to take. Don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve injected just a small amount of filler so far. We’ll assess the results and add more if needed. I want to make sure we achieve a natural-looking result that you're happy with. I've only injected about half a syringe into each nasolabial fold so far. It shouldn't take much longer, perhaps another 10-15 minutes to complete. We can also take breaks if you need them. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmph. Feels… a little better. Still weird, though. Like… swollen. Is it supposed to be swollen? And is it symmetrical? Don't want one side looking different from the other. My daughter would never let me hear the end of it if it's uneven. Quickly. Show me. A mirror. Let me see what you’ve done. Don’t waste my time. I need to see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. Here you are. Take a look. I’ve already assessed the symmetry and everything looks balanced so far. It is normal to experience some mild swelling after the injections, but it should subside within a few days. You can see how the nasolabial folds are already softened. We can add a little more filler if you’d like, but I recommend waiting a few minutes to see how the initial injections settle. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well… it’s… less wrinkly. I’ll give you that. But it does look… puffy. And yeah, maybe a little uneven. My left side always looks a bit… droopier. You fix that. Add a bit more to the left side. But not too much. Just… even it out. Quickly. And tell me again what happens if it goes wrong. What if it gets all… lumpy? Or… infected? Don’t sugarcoat it. I want the truth.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your concerns, Mr. Trendler. I'll add a small amount of filler to your left side to even out the symmetry. It's very important to me that you're satisfied with the results. As for potential complications, it's rare, but possible to experience mild swelling, bruising, or redness after the injections. These side effects usually resolve within a few days to a week. In very rare cases, it's possible to develop a small lump or infection, but I take meticulous care to minimize these risks. If you experience any signs of infection, such as excessive pain, redness, or swelling, please contact me immediately. I can prescribe antibiotics if needed. Now, let’s take another look. How does that look now?
PATIENT: Hmph. Better. Yeah, that’s… more like it. Still puffy, but… less uneven. I think… I think that’s enough. Don’t want to look like a… balloon. Stop poking me now. What happens next? And how long does it take to… settle? Can I go home now? Quickly. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you’re satisfied, Mr. Trendler. I think we’ve achieved a natural-looking result that softens your wrinkles and improves your overall appearance. Now, it’s important to avoid strenuous activity for 24-48 hours. You may experience some mild swelling and bruising, but it should subside within a few days to a week. You can apply ice packs to reduce swelling and take over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. Here's a care sheet with everything you need to know. It’s also important to avoid rubbing or massaging the treated areas for the first few days. Yes, you can definitely go home now. Just remember to follow the aftercare instructions. If you have any concerns or experience any complications, please contact me immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Trendler. I hope you enjoy your refreshed appearance.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t expect me to come back. And tell your daughter to stop telling me what to do. Quickly. .
