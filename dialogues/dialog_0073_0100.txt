DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. Something about a test? A screening, I think. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Something the folks at the…the place…said I needed. It's for work, I believe. Is that right?
DOCTOR: A screening…yes. I see here you had a mammogram scheduled as part of your annual wellness check, covered by Medicare. And a note about needing documentation for work. Honestly, it’s quite disorganized. Do you recall when you had the mammogram?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A mammogram… that was… sometime last year, I think? Maybe spring? It was at the hospital, the big one about an hour from here. I don’t really…keep track of dates, you know? It all just sort of blends together. I just went when they told me to. I'm terrible with remembering things like that. Was it necessary to have it done again so soon?
DOCTOR: Well, the standard recommendation is annually, Ms. Hughston. Let me pull up the results from last year… Ah, here we are. It showed…some areas of concern, which is why they recommended a follow-up. Do you recall being told about this at the time?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Areas of concern? No, I don’t think so. Nobody told me anything. They just…took pictures. And I went home. I definitely would have remembered something like that. Maybe they sent a letter? I get so much mail these days, it all gets piled up… honestly, I probably just threw it out with the junk. It wouldn't surprise me at all.
DOCTOR: It’s…unfortunate that the results weren’t communicated effectively. Sometimes these things happen with larger facilities. Well, regardless, we need to address it now. Do you currently experience any pain or discomfort in your breasts?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not that I've noticed, anyway. A little ache now and then, but nothing I'd pay much attention to. I'm an old woman, things ache all over! Is this about… something serious? I don't like worrying, you see. It doesn’t do any good.
DOCTOR: It’s best to be thorough, Ms. Hughston. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just lie back on the table, please. I’ll need to palpate your breasts and check your lymph nodes. It’s a standard procedure, nothing to be alarmed about.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s best. I always feel a bit silly doing these things. But go ahead. I’ll just close my eyes and pretend I'm on vacation. Just be gentle, dear. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just feeling for any lumps or abnormalities. Hmm. And now the right side. A few slightly enlarged lymph nodes here, but not significantly concerning. I do feel a small, firm nodule in the upper outer quadrant of your right breast. It’s about a centimeter in size, non-tender. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A nodule? That doesn't sound good at all. Is it… bad? I mean, is it cancer? My mother had… well, she had something, a long time ago. She didn't talk about it much. I don’t want to end up like her. What kind of investigation? More pictures? Will it hurt? I'm getting anxious now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Hughston, let’s not jump to conclusions. A nodule doesn’t automatically mean cancer. It could be a benign cyst, a fibroadenoma… many things. However, given its presence, we need to obtain a biopsy to determine its nature. A biopsy involves taking a small sample of the tissue for examination under a microscope. It’s a relatively simple procedure, usually done with a needle. There will be some mild discomfort, a brief pinching sensation. I’ll send you to radiology for a stereotactic biopsy, it’s more accurate than a manual one. We'll get definitive results that way.
PATIENT: A needle? Oh, my. That doesn’t sound very pleasant at all. Stereo… what-tic? Is it going to leave a scar? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t like waiting. It’s the waiting that gets to me, Doctor. Will it interfere with my work? I'm a heavy equipment operator, you know. I can't be off sick for too long. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it’s a small needle. The discomfort is minimal, and any scarring will be barely noticeable. As for your work, I’ll have the radiologist take that into consideration. The results typically take about 5-7 business days, depending on the lab. Frankly, your concern over a few days of potential disruption is…unnecessary. We need to prioritize determining the nature of this nodule. I will write a referral to Dr. Albright at the imaging center. He’s very good. We'll schedule the biopsy as soon as possible. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye or local anesthetics?
PATIENT: Oh... alright. Five to seven days. It feels like an eternity. I suppose you're right, I shouldn't worry about work just yet. Contrast dye... hmm. I don't think so. I've had injections before, for my arthritis, and I didn't have any problems. But I can't honestly remember. My memory is just… a fog, you know? Maybe I should ask my daughter? She keeps all my medical records. She's very organized. Does it matter if I'm a little unsure? Would that change anything?
DOCTOR: It’s best to be certain, Ms. Hughston. Please have your daughter verify your allergy status. It’s a simple precaution. I’ll write a note on the referral form requesting that information. Here is the referral to Dr. Albright. He’ll contact you to schedule the biopsy. Please bring your insurance card and any relevant medical history you can gather. I will also send a copy of my notes to his office. Now, is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I will ask my daughter as soon as I get home. She’s very good at these things. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… the biopsy. I'm a little scared, if I'm honest. But I suppose it has to be done. Will they call me with the results, or will I have to come back here? And… what if it is bad? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Dr. Albright’s office will contact you with the results, Ms. Hughston. And frankly, speculating about “what ifs” is unproductive at this stage. We’ll address that if and when we have a diagnosis. I recommend you focus on following up with Dr. Albright and avoiding unnecessary stress. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
