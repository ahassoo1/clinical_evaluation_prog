DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, right? Look, honestly, it’s a bit fuzzy. Something about… not sleeping so great, and feeling like I should probably be doing something about getting in better shape. My wife… well, she always said I needed to look after myself more. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. It was a while ago, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you’re experiencing some sleep difficulties and are considering improving your overall health. It’s very common to feel that way, and it's good you're addressing it. When you say “not sleeping so great,” could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… Right. Well, I don’t exactly fall asleep instantly, if that’s what you mean. I toss and turn a bit, I suppose. And I wouldn’t say I wake up feeling… refreshed. More like… aware. And a little stiff. It’s not like I’m exhausted all day, but it’s not ideal. Honestly, I haven't really thought about it much until recently. It's just… been like that for a while. Do you need specifics? Because I’m really not good with details.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. Any information you can provide is helpful. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty falling asleep and perhaps not getting the restorative sleep you need. “A while ago” is a bit vague – would you say this has been going on for weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Longer, definitely longer. Months… years, probably. Honestly, it’s hard to say exactly. After… well, after my wife passed, things kind of blurred together. I just… got used to it, I suppose. I don't make much of it. I've always been a light sleeper, to be fair. Not the deepest guy, you know? Does that help? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: That does help, Mr. Redfern, thank you for sharing that with me. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that your sleep – and many other things – were affected. It’s not uncommon for grief to manifest in physical ways, like changes in sleep patterns. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: My typical day? Hmm. Well, I wake up… whenever. No real schedule, you see. I own a little shop, repair instruments. Mostly violins, cellos, that sort of thing. It's quiet work, thankfully. I go in when I feel like it, work until I’m tired of it, then come home. I eat… something. Usually. I wouldn’t say I’m a gourmet, if that’s what you’re asking. I read a bit, sometimes watch the news, but not much. It’s all very… routine. And quiet. I don’t really do much anymore. Is that helpful? It's probably a terribly boring answer.
DOCTOR: That’s not boring at all, Mr. Redfern. It gives me a good picture of your lifestyle. It sounds like you have a fairly solitary routine. Do you have any pets?
PATIENT: Pets? No, no pets. My wife… she loved cats, had a whole collection of them. But after she… well, I just couldn’t. Too many memories. Plus, who would look after them, you see? I barely look after myself these days. No, no pets. Quiet is good, honestly. A bit too quiet, perhaps. But good.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to prefer quiet, especially given your circumstances. Now, let’s talk about your physical health a bit. Do you have any current medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Well, the doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a few years back, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t seem to be doing much, and I didn't like the side effects. Other than that… nothing I can think of. I used to be quite active, played a bit of soccer when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I get a bit of stiffness in my back, but that's just from bending over instruments all day, I suppose. Nothing a bit of stretching doesn’t fix. Or at least, it used to. Is that… enough information? I really am terrible at this, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Redfern. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember every detail. Stopping medication without consulting your doctor is something we should address later. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that is a difficult one. My wife’s family was very healthy, as far as I know. Lots of long-lived relatives. My side… Well, my father had some heart trouble, I think. And my mother… she had a bit of everything, if I’m honest. Arthritis, some breathing problems. She wasn’t a very strong woman. It was a long time ago, though. I don’t remember specifics. We weren’t very close. Does that… help? I feel like I’m just rambling again. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s common to not have all the details of your family history. Knowing about heart trouble and arthritis is helpful, though. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I've never had any serious allergies. Maybe a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but nothing a tissue can't handle. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I don't go out of my way to try new things, mind you, but I haven't had any reactions to anything. Is that… useful? I feel like I'm not being very helpful. Everything is just… bland, you know? No surprises, no problems, just… quiet.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. Sometimes, not having allergies is helpful information. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not anymore, like I said. I stopped the blood pressure pills. And I used to take a multivitamin, but I ran out a while ago and never bothered to get another one. Honestly, I don't really see the point. It's all just… a lot of fuss, you know? I eat when I'm hungry, sleep when I'm tired. Not much to it, really. Is that… everything? I feel like I'm taking up your time.
DOCTOR: No, you haven’t taken up my time at all. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Redfern. It sounds like you're generally a very self-sufficient person. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… don’t expect too much, alright? I’m not exactly in peak condition. As you can probably tell. Go ahead, then. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Redfern, just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We can re-check it later to see if it’s consistently high. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are a little irregular, and your breathing sounds are a bit diminished. Nothing to be overly alarmed about at this point, but we’ll need to investigate further. Reflexes are normal. Now, could you stand up for me and let me check your posture and gait?
PATIENT: Alright. It’s a bit creaky, mind you. Haven't moved much lately. Just go ahead, Doctor. Get it over with. Don't expect any Olympic performance. I used to be able to run for hours, you know, back in the day. But that was a long time ago. A very long time ago. .
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Redfern. I notice a slight forward lean and a shuffling gait. That could be contributing to your back discomfort. Now, I’m going to quickly listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. Alright, that concludes the physical exam for now. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it seems like you're experiencing some sleep difficulties, possible mild hypertension, and some musculoskeletal issues likely related to your posture and activity level. Your grief is undoubtedly a contributing factor to many of these symptoms. It's important that we address all of these areas. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Hypertension? Is that… bad? And what about the musculoskeletal… whatever you said? Is that just my back being old? Honestly, Doctor, it all sounds… complicated. I was hoping for something simple, like… take a pill and go away. Is that too much to ask? And will this take long? I've got a shop to run, you see. People rely on me. . I just… want to feel normal again. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to want a simple solution, Mr. Redfern, and I wish it were always that easy. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is something we need to take seriously, but it’s very manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. It increases your risk of heart attack and stroke if left untreated, but we can work to get it under control. As for your back discomfort, it's likely a combination of your posture, reduced activity level, and potentially some muscle stiffness. It’s not necessarily just “old age,” although that can play a role. It’s something we can address with physical therapy and exercises. It sounds like we have a few things to focus on. I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. I also want to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. I think it would also be beneficial for you to see a physical therapist. They can help you develop an exercise program to improve your posture, strengthen your muscles, and alleviate your back pain. And finally, have you considered talking to someone about your grief?
PATIENT: Blood work… more tests… it all sounds… exhausting. And a physical therapist? I barely have time to sleep, let alone go to appointments. As for talking… no. No, I haven't. I prefer to… deal with things myself. It’s just… not something I’m comfortable with. I appreciate your concern, Doctor, I really do. But I’m not sure I want to go down all those roads. Is it… necessary? Can’t we just… try a pill for the blood pressure and see how it goes? I just want to be able to sleep and run my shop, that’s all. I don’t need… all this fuss. Honestly, I just feel… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how overwhelmed you feel, Mr. Redfern. It's a lot to take in, and I respect your desire to keep things simple. However, simply prescribing a pill without a full understanding of your situation wouldn’t be the best course of action. It’s important to address the root causes of your symptoms, and that requires a more comprehensive approach. I’m not trying to overwhelm you, but I want to ensure you receive the best possible care. We can take things one step at a time. How about we start with the blood work?
PATIENT: One step at a time… alright. Fine. Blood work. But that’s it. Just the blood work. No physical therapist, no talking, just the blood work. And then we’ll see, alright? Then we’ll see how I feel. And can you please, please, make it quick? I've got a shop to run, you know. People are counting on me. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. I just miss my wife. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Redfern. Just the blood work. We’ll get that ordered right away, and we’ll make it as quick and efficient as possible. I understand you have responsibilities and that time is precious. I’m also very sorry for your loss. Grief is a powerful emotion, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re expecting you. I’ll give you a requisition form and instructions. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. Just… tired. Always tired. And lonely. But that’s just… part of life, I suppose. Fine. Blood work. Let's just get it over with. And can I please have the requisition form? The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can get back to my shop. Honestly, I just want this day to be over.
DOCTOR: Here you are. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re open until 5 PM. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ve also printed out some resources on managing grief and coping with loneliness. They’re optional, of course, but I thought they might be helpful. Once you’ve had the blood work done, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results and create a plan to address your symptoms. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the blood work. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll see you when the results are back. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Redfern. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
