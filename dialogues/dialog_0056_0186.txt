DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Kingan, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Amussen. Lamark Kingan. Uh, it’s for a sports team tryout. Physical, they called it. Gotta get checked out before I can, you know, actually try out. Hopefully I pass. Don’t want to waste anyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical. Good idea to get that done. We'll make sure you're cleared. Just so I have everything right, you said your name is Lamark Kingan?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. Lamark Kingan. K-I-N-G-A-N. People get it wrong sometimes. And I’m 62. Just… want to get this over with quickly, if that’s alright. Got a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: K-I-N-G-A-N, 62, got it. And I understand you're in a hurry, Mr. Kingan. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. First, can you tell me a little bit about the sport you're trying out for?
PATIENT: It's… well, it’s a bit unusual. It’s Mongolian wrestling. Buh. It’s what I grew up with. Not exactly… gentle. Lots of grappling, lifting, throwing. That sort of thing. It's… strenuous.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling, okay. That is strenuous. Good to know. Have you been actively training for this tryout, or is this more of a return to the sport after some time off?
PATIENT: Training… yeah, a little. Been doing some practice with some old friends, mostly. Not as much as I used to. Getting older, you know? Joints aren't what they used to be. But I can still handle myself. Hopefully. It's mostly just keeping up the stamina, I think. Trying to, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, stamina is important. And you've noticed some joint issues?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly in my knees and… my lower back. Nothing serious, not like needing a doctor all the time serious. Just… they get stiff. A little ache after a hard practice. Old man stuff, really. But I don't want it to hold me back during the tryout, obviously. Can you… check those out?
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll definitely take a look at your knees and back. Before we do that, can you tell me about any past injuries you've had, even if they were a long time ago?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I twisted an ankle pretty bad when I was younger, maybe… forty years ago? It healed alright, never really bothered me much after that. And I had a shoulder strain once, lifting something heavy. Nothing broken, just… sore for a while. Other than that… honestly, I've been pretty lucky. Buh. Maybe that’s why my joints are complaining now, though. Old age catching up!
DOCTOR: Okay, ankle twist and shoulder strain. Good to know. And no other major injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. No surgeries. Just… a few bumps and bruises over the years, you know? Wrestling isn’t exactly a gentle sport. But nothing a bit of ice and a good rest couldn’t fix. Are we gonna… do x-rays or something? I really am kinda short on time.
DOCTOR: We'll start with a physical exam, and then we can discuss if any imaging is needed. It's unlikely we'll need x-rays right away, but we'll see how your joints feel during the exam. Let’s start with your knees. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Let’s get this over with. Just tell me what you want me to do. Honestly, these old bones aren't as cooperative as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, if you could just sit here on the edge of the table. I'm going to gently bend and rotate your knees, just to check the range of motion and look for any tenderness. Tell me if anything feels painful, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Gently, you said? Because 'gentle' and wrestling aren't usually in the same sentence. But yeah, go ahead. Just… be careful. Buh.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m just feeling around your knee now. And can you straighten your leg out for me, as much as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There… there it is. Just a little bit of stiffness. It’s not sharp pain, more like… a ache. Like it needs a good oiling. It's been like that for a bit now. Not terrible, just… annoying. Especially when it's cold. Is that… bad? I just want to know if I’m wasting my time even trying out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tightness in your knee joint, and you're right, a bit of discomfort with extension. It doesn't sound like anything acute, but it is something we need to address. Let's check the left knee now. Same thing – just straighten it out as much as you can, and tell me if you feel any pain. And I’m noting your range of motion as we go.
PATIENT: This one's a little better. Still a bit stiff, but not nearly as much ache as the other one. You can feel a little… pop sometimes, when I bend it. Probably just old age again. It doesn’t hurt hurt, just… feels it. I’m telling you, I'm too old for this. But I keep trying. Buh. It's in my blood, you know? Wrestling. It’s hard to quit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I felt a little crepitus – that's the popping you're describing – and some mild tightness. Now, let’s move on to your back. Can you bend forward, as far as is comfortable, and then stand back up straight?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… not pretty. It’s not a sudden pain, more like… everything just seizes up. Like rusted hinges. It gets worse when it’s cold, or if I lift something heavy. Not a lot of lifting these days, thankfully. But even bending over to tie my shoes can be a challenge. Is this… arthritis or something? I just want to know if I should forget the whole thing. Buh. It's probably a waste of everyone’s time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some limited range of motion and some discomfort with forward bending. It could be early signs of arthritis, but we would need some imaging – an X-ray – to confirm that. Now, I'm going to gently press on different areas of your lower back. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. And just so you know, it's good you're getting this checked out. We'll figure out what's going on and see what we can do. It's certainly not a waste of time.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle. Seriously. This back has seen better days. Buh. I knew I shouldn’t have gotten back into it. But old habits… you know? Just… poke around and tell me what you think. Hopefully it's nothing too serious. I just want to be realistic about this tryout. If it’s going to cause me more trouble than it’s worth… I need to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness along your spine and some tightness in the muscles on either side. I'm also noticing some muscle spasm. It doesn't sound like anything acutely injured, but it does indicate some chronic inflammation and muscle tension. Now, just to complete the exam, can you try to twist gently to the left and then to the right?
PATIENT: Oof. That's… not great either. It's not a sharp pain, more like a grinding sensation. Like… rocks rubbing together. Honestly, I feel like I’m falling apart. And I’m only 62! Buh. This is probably a fool's errand. Just tell me straight. Should I even bother with the tryout? Is it going to make things worse? I need a realistic answer, doctor. I'm too old for this… and probably too stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. I've completed the exam, and what I’m finding is consistent with some chronic lower back strain and some early signs of osteoarthritis in both your knees and lower back. You’re right to be concerned about potentially making things worse. The tryout could exacerbate these issues. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean you can't try out, but you need to be realistic about your limitations and be prepared to stop if you experience any significant pain. I wouldn’t recommend pushing through anything sharp or debilitating. We can order X-rays of your knees and lower back to get a clearer picture of the joint space and rule out any other underlying issues. We could also discuss some conservative management options like physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, and pain relief strategies. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: X-rays… and medication… sounds about right. I figured it would come to this. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised. Buh. I guess… let’s do the X-rays. Get a clear picture. And maybe some of that physical therapy. I don't want to be completely useless, you know? But I'm not sure about medication… I don't want to be relying on pills. Is there anything else? Like… exercises I can do myself? Before the therapy? Just to… keep things moving? And honestly, doctor, what's the realistic chance I’m going to pass the tryout in this condition? I need to be honest with myself. I’m too old for this… and probably too stubborn.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. I understand your concerns. X-rays are a good first step. And you’re right to ask about exercises. Before starting physical therapy, you can focus on some gentle range-of-motion exercises, like slow knee bends and back stretches, as long as they don't cause any pain. I can print out a handout with some examples. It’s important to listen to your body and stop if you feel any discomfort. Regarding medication, we can discuss some over-the-counter options like ibuprofen or naproxen, which can help reduce inflammation. We can also consider a prescription for a stronger anti-inflammatory if needed, but we’ll start with the simplest approach. As for the tryout… honestly, it’s difficult to say. Your condition is certainly not ideal, and your chances are lower than someone without these issues. However, that doesn't mean you can’t try. If you go in with realistic expectations, listen to your body, and avoid pushing yourself too hard, it might be worth a shot. I’ll write up a referral for the X-rays, a handout with exercises, and a prescription for ibuprofen. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and create a more comprehensive treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That… sounds alright. X-rays, exercises, ibuprofen. A week… yeah, that gives me some time to think. And maybe… accept reality. I appreciate your honesty, doctor. It’s not what I wanted to hear, but it’s what I needed. And a handout with exercises… that’s good. I can at least try something. Okay. Let's get the referral and the prescription. And maybe… maybe I’ll just go easy on myself. It’s probably time to hang up the wrestling boots anyway. But I gotta try, right? It's in my blood. Buh. Thank you, doctor. That’ll be all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Here's the referral for the X-rays and the prescription for the ibuprofen. And here’s the handout with exercises. Remember, listen to your body, and don't push yourself too hard. And please, schedule a follow-up appointment next week so we can discuss the results and create a plan that works for you. If you experience any significant pain or discomfort before your appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. And good luck with everything. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. You too. I appreciate your… realism. And I will… try to listen to my body. It’s not always easy. Buh. Goodbye. .
