DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. It’s… my stomach, I guess. Feels puffed up, okay? Like I swallowed a beach ball. It’s been happening on and off, and honestly, it's annoying. Is that enough for you to, you know, figure out what’s wrong? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, and we'll try to be efficient. "Puffed up" is a good start, but could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Ugh, “a little more”? What do you want to know? It just… gets bigger. Like, noticeably bigger. And sometimes it's uncomfortable, kinda gassy. Not painful, usually. Just… there. Look, I eat normal stuff. I work hard, I don’t sit around thinking about my stomach all day. I don’t know what else to tell you. It just happens. Is it… serious? Because I really don’t have time for serious.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Not painful, mostly just uncomfortable and gassy…and it comes and goes. How long has this been happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Jeez, lady. I don’t keep a log of my bloating. Maybe… a few months? A while, okay? It's not new. It comes and goes like the tides, I guess. Look, my wife… she would always know these things, but… it's been a while since then, alright? Everything's a blur. It's just been happening off and on for a bit. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months, off and on. And you said your wife usually kept track of things like this… I'm sorry to hear that. Let’s try to narrow it down. Does anything specific seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Specific? No! If I knew what caused it, I wouldn’t be here, would I? I eat. I work. Sometimes my stomach swells up. It's not rocket science. Maybe… sometimes after I eat something… heavy? Like, a big meal? But then again, sometimes it happens when I haven’t eaten much at all. Honestly, it feels random. Look, I’m a pile driver operator, I don’t think about what I eat triggering my… bloating. Do you need a list of everything I've eaten for the last six months? Because I don't have that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no list needed. So, it seems to happen regardless of what you eat, and it’s been going on for a few months. Do you notice any other symptoms when this happens?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t get sick. I just… feel full. And a little uncomfortable. That's it. Look, I don’t get fevers, I don’t throw up, I don't have… anything else going on. It’s just my stomach getting bigger. Honestly, it's probably nothing. Maybe I just eat too much? Is that what you want me to say? Can we just skip to whatever you’re going to do to fix it? I got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. Let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Look, I really don’t have time for poking and prodding. I’m a grown man, and I don't need you telling me my stomach is bigger than it used to be. I can feel it, alright? But fine, if that’s what you need to do to… make this go faster. Just please be quick. And don’t tell me I need to lose weight, okay? I work hard for what I have.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It will be a quick listen and feel. Could you lie down on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I’m not comfortable with this. And don’t judge, okay? I’m a practical man. I build things. I don’t spend my time worrying about… this. Just hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening and feeling your abdomen now. It is somewhat distended, as you mentioned. I hear normal bowel sounds…though they are a bit active. No tenderness to the touch, which is good. Do you normally have regular bowel movements?
PATIENT: Look, are you asking me about my… pooping? Really? I’m a grown man, I’m not discussing this with you. Of course I do! Everyone does! Is that what this is about? Look, it’s normal. It happens. I’m not constipated or anything. It’s just… regular. Can we move on? This is ridiculous. I’m wasting valuable time here. And don't judge me, alright? I eat fiber, okay? I’m not some caveman. Just tell me what's wrong, if anything is wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand you prefer not to discuss the details. Just confirming you have regular bowel movements is helpful. Given your description and the exam, it could be something as simple as increased gas production. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently, even small ones?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I eat! I eat what I always eat. I haven’t been experimenting with new cuisines or anything. I haven’t switched to some fancy diet. I’m a pile driver operator, alright? I eat to fuel my body. Burgers, fries, sometimes a steak. Normal stuff! I haven’t changed a thing. Look, I’m starting to feel like you’re accusing me of something. Is that it? Are you saying I need to eat more… salad? Because that's not happening. Just tell me if there’s something seriously wrong, or if I can just go back to work. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dietary changes. Given your symptoms, the physical exam, and your normal bowel habits, it's likely some degree of functional bloating—meaning your digestive system is a little sensitive and producing extra gas. It’s common, and often related to how quickly you eat and swallow air. I do want to rule out anything more serious, though. Have you ever had any testing done for similar symptoms in the past?
PATIENT: Testing? Look, I told you, I haven’t been spending my time at the doctor’s office. I work. I haven't had tests done for… gas! That's ridiculous. No. Never. I've never had any testing for this before. This is… insulting. I'm a grown man, alright? I'm not some hypochondriac. Look, can we just skip to a solution? Or should I just go to another doctor? I'm not paying for a bunch of tests for… functional bloating! Is that what you're telling me? This is a waste of my money. Honestly. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Lawton. Since you haven’t had any testing done before, and given your description, we can try a conservative approach first. I’m going to recommend over-the-counter simethicone—it helps break up gas bubbles. Also, try to eat slower, chew your food thoroughly, and avoid carbonated beverages. If those things don’t help after a week or two, or if your symptoms worsen—specifically, if you experience any weight loss, blood in your stool, severe abdominal pain, or changes in your bowel habits—then we should consider further testing, like a stool sample and possibly some imaging. Does that sound reasonable?
