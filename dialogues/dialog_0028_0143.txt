DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Well… it’s a bit… complicated. My… a friend, she wants to… have a baby. And I think… maybe it’s good to check things first? Before… you know. To make sure everything is okay. It's… been a long time. I don't remember much about… all that stuff.
DOCTOR: A… friend. Right. And you're concerned about your… overall health in relation to this… potential situation?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. That's it. Overall health. It’s just… I’m not young anymore, Doctor. And… well, I haven’t really been to a doctor in years. I just want to be sure… everything can be okay. Is that… is that a silly thing to worry about?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Mr. Verrall. Prudence is… commendable. Let’s start with a little history then. Can you tell me about any significant medical problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… hard. Let me think. I had… something with my stomach, a long time ago. When I was younger. They… cut it open, I think? But I don't remember what it was for. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy. Playing football. Does that count? I don’t… I don’t really remember being sick, sick. Just… things happened. Is there a way to… find this out? Maybe in some papers somewhere?
DOCTOR: We can certainly try to access any records we have on file, though given your… lack of regular care, it’s unlikely to be extensive. The stomach issue is… relevant. Do you remember approximately when this surgery took place?
PATIENT: Oh… surgery. Yes. It was… a long, long time ago. Maybe… forty years ago? Or more? I was living in… well, it doesn’t matter where I was. It was a hot summer, I remember that. And I was in the hospital for a while. I think. It was… a big operation. But I don't remember why they did it. Does that… help? It's very fuzzy, Doctor. Everything feels… distant.
DOCTOR: A very long time ago, and… vague recollections. Yes, well. Alright. Any family history of significant illness?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s… tricky. My… my parents are both gone now. And I didn’t… I didn't see them much in later years. My father, he had… something with his heart, I think? But I don’t know what. My mother… she was always very strong. Never sick a day in her life, as far as I know. I have some cousins… but I haven't spoken to them in years. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Not ideal, no. Alright. And currently, are you taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never have been much for taking pills. And allergies… let me think. I think I get a little sniffly sometimes with… with dust, maybe? Nothing serious. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. It’s… mostly just the dust. And sometimes the sun, if I’m out in it for too long. But that's… not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. So, no significant medical history, no medications, minimal allergies. Now, given the… circumstances, we should at least perform a basic physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Blood pressure, pulse… heart and lungs. Okay. I hope it doesn't take too long. I… get a bit nervous around doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please remove your shoes and socks. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Pulse is regular at 78. Lungs are clear, though I do hear some… diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Not immediately concerning, but warrants further investigation. Let's check your abdomen. Lie back, please. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated? Is that… bad? I don’t… I don't usually worry about numbers. And… A little bit, yes. Just… there. On the left side. Not a sharp pain, more… a dull ache. It’s been there… on and off for a while. I thought it was just… old age.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some mild tenderness, and a slight… guarding. Given the history of a previous abdominal surgery, we need to rule out any complications or adhesions. I'm going to order some basic blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also want a urinalysis, just to be safe. Finally, I think we should schedule an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at what’s going on in there. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. That… sounds like a lot of tests. Is it… is it something serious, Doctor? The ultrasound… that doesn’t sound good. And… blood work? I don't like needles. But… if you think it's necessary… Yes, okay. Whatever you think is best. Just… please tell me what it all means, if you find anything. I just want to make sure… everything is alright. For… my friend.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Verrall. We're just being thorough. The tests will help us establish a baseline and rule out any potential problems. The ultrasound is non-invasive. And yes, I'll explain the results to you. Here. This is the requisition for the blood work. Go to LabCorp on Elm Street. And here's the referral for the ultrasound. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. I'll have my nurse give you the instructions for the blood work. Now, given your age and… the situation, I also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. High blood pressure is not something to ignore. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Oh. So many things… a cardiologist? Is that… is that my heart again? Elm Street… right. And the ultrasound… Okay. I… I don’t think so. Not right now. I just… I just need to process all this. It’s a lot to take in. Can I… can I at least think about the cardiologist? I need to… talk to my friend, first.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Verrall. But I strongly advise you reconsider. Ignoring a potential heart condition is… unwise. My nurse will show you out. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. Chest pain… okay. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll go find the nurse, then. .
