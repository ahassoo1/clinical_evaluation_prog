DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, and I keep getting these… water infections, I think they call them. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, right side pain and recurrent water infections – that's helpful. To clarify, when you say “a little while now,” could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's been… probably about six months, maybe a bit longer. It started gradually, just a dull ache now and then. But the infections… they’ve been more frequent in the last three months, I’d say. They knock me about a bit, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, six months for the pain, increasing frequency of infections in the last three months. And when you say they “knock you about,” could you describe what those infections feel like?
PATIENT: Well, a burning feeling when I… go to the toilet. And a sort of ache all across my lower back. I feel quite tired, too, and a bit shaky sometimes. Not terribly ill, but definitely not myself. It makes it hard to get about, even just doing the gardening.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, lower back ache, fatigue, shakiness… I'm noting all of that. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no blood that I’ve seen. And my… bowels are as they always have been, if you don’t mind me saying so. Regular, you know? Nothing different there.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. Years ago, a doctor told me I had something with my kidneys… Polycystic Kidney Disease, that’s what he called it. I don’t really understand what it means, to be honest. He just said my kidneys have… little bubbles on them. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, but they haven't really said much about it.
DOCTOR: Polycystic Kidney Disease… right. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just the usual… a bit of flu now and then, but nothing serious enough for a hospital. I’ve always been a pretty healthy man, all things considered. Until this, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had kidney trouble too, as I recall. She was often tired, and she had a lot of aches and pains. I don’t know if it was the same thing as me, but she did see a doctor about her kidneys. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never a day's illness in his life, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you taking any medications right now – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamin D, Doctor. The doctor said I was a bit low in it, so he suggested I take a small tablet every day. And sometimes, if I'm feeling stiff, I’ll take a paracetamol. But that's about it. As for allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D daily, paracetamol as needed, no known allergies. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint the source of your pain. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead, please. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm noticing some tenderness in your right flank, and a little bit of discomfort lower down on your right side when I press here. No guarding or rebound tenderness, thankfully. Your abdomen is soft otherwise. I'm also going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I think it would be helpful to order a urine sample to check for infection, and a blood test to assess your kidney function. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable indeed. A urine sample and a blood test, you say? Yes, please do. I’m happy to do whatever you think is necessary to find out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample, and then we’ll draw some blood in the lab. While we wait for those results, I'd like to talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And certainly no recreational drugs. I’ve always lived a pretty quiet life, you see. Gardening, church… that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Very good. And what about your occupation?
PATIENT: I was a receptionist, Doctor. At the doctor’s surgery, actually! Retired now, though. Been retired for about ten years. It was a good job, mostly just answering phones and making appointments. Not very strenuous, which was good as I got older. I keep myself busy in the garden now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so retired receptionist, gardening is your main activity. Good to know. Now, do you have any difficulties with mobility, or any problems with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I do sometimes forget things. Little things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, or the name of that actor in the film. Nothing serious, mind you. Just… getting old, I suppose. My mobility is alright, thank you. I can still get around the garden, though it takes me a bit longer these days. I get a bit tired if I overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some minor memory lapses and fatigue with exertion. We’ll keep that in mind. Alright, Mr. Espinueva, to summarize, you’ve been experiencing right flank pain and recurrent urinary tract infections for about six months, with increased frequency in the last three months. You have a history of Polycystic Kidney Disease, and your mother also experienced kidney problems. You take Vitamin D and occasionally paracetamol, have no known allergies, and live a quiet life. You also report some minor memory lapses and fatigue. We’ve ordered a urine sample and blood tests to assess for infection and kidney function. While we wait for those results, I’m going to start you on a short course of antibiotics to treat the potential infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that all sounds very sensible. Antibiotics… yes, please. Thank you for listening to me so patiently. I feel much better knowing that you’re taking this seriously. I do hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. The nurse will bring the prescription to you before you leave. Once the lab results are back – usually within a couple of days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. If you experience any worsening symptoms – fever, chills, severe back pain, or inability to urinate – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll also have the nurse give you a handout about Polycystic Kidney Disease so you have some more information. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll wait for the nurse with the prescription, and I'll keep an eye out for those worsening symptoms. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse should be with you shortly. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
