DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, I just moved here. I think… something about getting checked out ‘cause I’m new? My husband said something about it. I don’t really remember all the details. It’s kinda… a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s very common to feel a little overwhelmed with a move. A general check-up is a wonderful idea when you’re establishing care with a new doctor, just to get a baseline. It sounds like your husband was looking out for you. Let’s start with a little bit about what's been going on with you lately. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or feeling unwell in any way?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Not really, I don’t think so. I feel… okay? Maybe a little tired sometimes, but everyone gets tired, right? I work with machines all day, so my back aches a bit, but that's normal too. It’s hard to say if anything feels different, ‘cause… well, I can’t really remember how I felt before. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Emileigh. It can be difficult to pinpoint changes when you're adjusting to a new environment. Fatigue and back pain are common, as you mentioned. We’ll definitely take those into account. Just to be thorough, and to get a better picture, let’s go through a few things. Do you have any pain anywhere besides your back?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of? Sometimes my hands get a little sore from working with tools, but it goes away pretty quick. I don’t get headaches or anything like that. Oh! And my knees kinda creak when I stand up, but… that’s probably just getting older, right? I’m not that old, am I? Sorry, I’m probably rambling.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Emileigh. You're not rambling. It’s helpful to hear everything, even what you think might be insignificant. Sore hands, and knees that creak are good things to know. Now, thinking more broadly…have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… hmm. I eat, I think? My husband cooks really good food, so I always eat when he makes something. Weight… I haven’t really checked. I’m… kinda bigger, I guess? I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. I just wear comfy clothes, you know? I don’t know if I’ve gained or lost weight, sorry. It’s just not something I think about. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Everyone has different priorities, and it's absolutely fine if weight isn't something you focus on. It’s good to know. Alright. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health history, if you don't mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. I… honestly don’t remember. I think I had the flu once, when I was little? And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really know about anything else. My husband usually takes care of all that stuff, like doctor’s appointments and stuff. He’s really good at remembering things. I feel bad that I can’t tell you more. Is this making things harder?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Emileigh. It’s completely understandable, and it's perfectly alright that you don't recall specific details. We'll take things slowly. It’s very common for details to become fuzzy over time. Your husband sounds very supportive. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was really little, but I don’t really remember it. It’s just something my mom told me, I think. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I don’t have any scars that I know of. Does that help? Sorry, I feel like I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Emileigh. Every little bit of information is valuable, and it’s perfectly fine that you don’t remember everything. Knowing about the tonsillectomy is helpful. Now, thinking about your family… do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… hard. My mom passed away a long time ago, and I didn’t really know my dad. My husband’s family is really healthy, I think. He said his grandma had something with her heart, maybe? And I think his uncle had… something with his sugar? But I don’t really know the details. Sorry, I’m really bad at remembering family stuff. It’s kinda… a blur. Does it matter if I don’t know?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh. It’s perfectly common not to know specific details about family history. We can work with what you do know. Knowing about the potential heart condition and sugar issues in your husband’s family is helpful. It’s good to be aware of those possibilities. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, definitely not. I don’t smoke, and I only have a little bit of wine sometimes with dinner, like… special occasions. And I definitely don’t do any of that other stuff. My husband doesn’t drink much either. He likes to stay healthy. Is that good? I try to eat healthy too, when I can. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Emileigh. That’s very good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or vitamins?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. And I take something for my back, when it really hurts, but it’s just… over-the-counter stuff, like ibuprofen. Nothing fancy. My husband gets it for me. I think it’s okay to take with my other stuff, but… I don't really pay attention to the labels. Sorry, I'm really bad at remembering this stuff. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Emileigh. It’s good to know about the multivitamin and ibuprofen. It’s always helpful to have a complete picture, even if it’s just over-the-counter medications. We can review these later to ensure there are no interactions. Now, just a final question for this part. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so? I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I might be a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but that’s just sneezing, you know? Nothing serious. I don’t wear a lot of jewelry because I think I might be allergic to some of the metals, but I’m not really sure. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with this stuff. Is it okay if my husband comes in to help me remember things? He’s really good at details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It's perfectly fine that you don’t know all the details, and it’s very thoughtful of you to ask if your husband can join us. Yes, absolutely! It would be wonderful if he could come in to help. Before he arrives, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, okay. That sounds… good. As long as it's quick, that’s fine. I don't really like being poked and prodded, but I understand it's important. What are you gonna do? Sorry if that's a silly question.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s not a silly question at all! I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. I’ll also feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to relax. This cuff feels a little tight… is that normal? Sorry, I just get a little anxious at doctor’s offices. I don’t really like being… measured. Is this gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, the cuff does feel a little tight, that's normal, Emileigh. It needs to be snug to get an accurate reading. I understand you're feeling anxious, that’s very common. It doesn’t hurt at all, it just squeezes your arm briefly. Okay, here we go… Your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not a major concern at this point. We can monitor it over time. Your pulse is 72, which is a normal rate.
PATIENT: Okay… good. That doesn’t sound too bad. Is that a good number? Sorry, I don’t really understand what all those numbers mean. What’s next? I feel kinda silly asking so many questions, but… I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You're not silly at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly alright to ask questions – it’s my job to explain things! 130/80 is a little above the ideal range, but it can fluctuate depending on various factors. It's something we'll keep an eye on. Next, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. I just need you to take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm not hearing any unusual sounds.
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths. This is kinda weird, but… I don’t think I’m breathing right. What are you listening for, exactly? Is something wrong? Sorry, I’m probably being a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a bother at all, Emileigh. You're doing great. I'm listening for any unusual sounds, like wheezing or crackling, that could indicate something's going on in your lungs. Everything sounds normal right now, but it’s important to check. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. This might feel a little cool, but it shouldn’t hurt. Your ears look clear, no signs of infection or wax build-up.
PATIENT: Okay… cool. That is kinda cool. Is everything okay? What about my nose? I get a stuffy nose sometimes, especially in the winter. Sorry, I’m probably rambling again. Is my husband here yet?
DOCTOR: Everything looks good so far, Emileigh. Your ears are healthy, and your nose looks clear too. I don’t see any significant congestion or polyps in your nasal passages. A stuffy nose can be common, especially with seasonal changes. I don’t see your husband just yet, but I'm sure he'll be here shortly. Now, I'm going to just feel your abdomen. Please relax your stomach muscles. I’m just checking for any tenderness or unusual masses. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don't feel any unusual masses.
PATIENT: Okay… relaxing. This is kinda weird, but… I don’t know if I’m doing it right. Is everything okay? It feels kinda strange. Sorry, I’m probably being a bother again. I just get nervous at doctor’s offices, you know? I don't like people poking and prodding me.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Emileigh. It is a little strange, and it’s perfectly alright to feel nervous. I’m just gently pressing on different areas of your abdomen to check for any tenderness or unusual masses. You're not being a bother at all – it's my job to make you feel comfortable. Everything feels normal. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs for me. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Alright, that completes the quick physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, do you mind if I ask a few questions about your lifestyle and any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Uh, okay. That sounds… good. I guess. Questions are okay, as long as they're not too personal. What kinda questions? Sorry, I just get a little anxious, you know? I don't like talking about myself very much. Is my husband here yet? He's really good at answering questions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. I’ll keep the questions general and just need a little bit of information to get a better understanding of your overall health. We can stop at any time if you're not comfortable. I still don’t see your husband yet, but I’m sure he'll be here soon. First, let’s talk about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Um… well, my husband does most of the cooking, so it depends on what he makes. Usually, we have eggs for breakfast. Sometimes toast. Then for lunch, maybe sandwiches or soup. And for dinner… he makes all sorts of things. Pasta, chicken, fish… I eat what he makes. I don’t really have a lot of favorites. I try to eat healthy, but I also like sweets sometimes. Does that make sense? Sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. I don’t really pay attention to what I eat very much.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It sounds like you have a pretty varied diet, which is great. And it’s perfectly alright to enjoy sweets sometimes! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t think so? I haven’t really had any bad reactions to anything, as far as I can remember. I might be a little sensitive to pollen sometimes, but that’s just sneezing, you know? Nothing serious. I don’t wear a lot of jewelry because I think I might be allergic to some of the metals, but I’m not really sure. Sorry, I’m not very helpful with this stuff. Is it okay if my husband comes in to help me remember things? He’s really good at details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s completely understandable that you don’t know all the details. It’s very common. It’s good to know about the potential pollen allergy and sensitivity to jewelry. And yes, absolutely! It would be wonderful if your husband could join us. It sounds like you've had a lot on your mind. Let's pause here and wait for him to arrive. That way, he can help fill in any gaps and ensure we have all the information we need. Would you like me to get you a glass of water while we wait?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that sounds good. A glass of water would be nice. Thank you. I just… I feel kinda lost, you know? Moving here and everything… it’s a lot to remember. I hope my husband gets here soon. He always knows what to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with a move. It takes time to adjust. I'll get you that water, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Here you are. Take your time. We'll wait for your husband to arrive.
