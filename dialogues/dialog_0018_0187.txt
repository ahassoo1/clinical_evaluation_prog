DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes. Okay. Chest… feels funny. And heart… goes bump-bump-bump too fast sometimes. Blood pressure… wife says it’s high. She always worries. I don’t like coming to doctors. Waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. We'll try to make this as efficient as possible. It's good you came in, and it’s wonderful that your wife is so attentive to your health. So, this “funny” feeling in your chest… could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Describe? It’s… tight. Like someone sitting on it. Not pain, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. Happens when I walk up the stairs. Or when I get… annoyed. Yes, annoyed. My neighbor… always with the loud music. That makes it worse. And the bump-bump-bump… that happens at night, mostly. Keeps my wife awake. She yells at me to do something about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. So, the tightness in your chest is not a sharp pain, but more of a constricting sensation that occurs with exertion – like climbing stairs – and also when you’re experiencing emotional stress, such as with your neighbor’s music. And the rapid heartbeat, or palpitations, as we call them, happen primarily at night. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Long…? Oh, jeez. A while. Maybe… six months? Longer? I don’t keep track of these things. Wife does. She says it’s getting worse, that's why she made me come. I told her it’s just old age. Everything gets worse with old age. But she… she worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good your wife is so proactive about your health, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. It's understandable not to keep precise track of these things. Six months is helpful, though. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, besides the stairs and the neighbor’s music?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… I drink coffee. Every morning. Always have. Maybe that? Wife says I drink too much. But I need my coffee. And… sometimes when I eat a lot of salt. Like… kimchi. I like kimchi. But she says… oh, never mind. It’s just food. I’m a Korean man, I eat Korean food.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, coffee every morning and kimchi are part of your regular diet. We’ll certainly consider those. Now, Mr. Sobkowicwicz, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, as your wife mentioned, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me years ago. Gave me pills. I took them for a while. Then I stopped. Felt better without them. Wife yelled at me. But I didn't like taking pills. And… I had my gallbladder taken out. Long time ago. That’s all I remember. No other… problems, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. It's helpful to know about the previous diagnosis of high blood pressure and that you’re no longer taking medication for it. And the gallbladder removal. Do you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: When...? Oh, geez. A long time ago. Maybe… twenty years? More? I don’t remember exactly. I was younger then. I just remember being in the hospital. It was… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Approximately twenty years ago. Now, Mr. Sobkowicwicz, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family...? My mother... she had… something with her heart. I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he worked very hard. Always tired. But nothing… serious, really. Just… old age. Everyone in my family just got old and died. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements. And also, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. Medications… just… vitamins. My wife makes me take them. Every day. For… everything. I don’t even know what they’re for. And sometimes… pain reliever. For my knees. They bother me in the cold weather. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. My wife would kill me. She hates smoking. Always has. I don’t need that. Bad for the heart, she says. And… bad for everything, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Just a little. With dinner. A glass of wine. Or… sometimes soju. With my friends. Not much. My wife… she lets me. But not too much. She watches me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Sobkowicwicz, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, and a quick assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Finally. Yes, yes. Get it over with. The sooner I’m done, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 160 over 95. And I’m hearing a slightly rapid heart rate, and a very faint murmur. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart again. I am hearing a murmur, which could be benign, but we'll want to investigate further. Do you experience any shortness of breath or dizziness?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. Not usually. Maybe when I climb the stairs… but everyone gets tired when they climb stairs. Dizziness… sometimes. But I think that’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Your pulse is a bit fast, as we discussed. And your extremities appear normal. I'd also like to briefly check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which can be common with age, but we'll want to keep that in mind. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is elevated, and you’ve described symptoms suggestive of palpitations, potentially related to a rapid heart rate. The murmur I heard requires further investigation. I’d like to order some tests, including an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests… Hmph. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don’t like going to the hospital. And I don’t want to be stuck here all day. Can I get this done quickly?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. We'll do everything we can to make this as efficient as possible. The ECG is a quick and painless procedure that can be done here in the clinic, and the blood test will only take a few minutes. We'll send the blood sample to the lab, and the results should be available within a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low dose blood pressure medication to help manage your blood pressure, and I would like to recommend that you reduce your salt intake and limit your coffee consumption. While we await the test results, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmph. No. Just… get the prescription. And the tests. I want to go home. My wife is probably worried.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. Here is the prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication, Amlodipine 5mg, to be taken once daily. The pharmacy will send a notification when it’s ready. I’ll also have my nurse schedule you for the ECG and blood test. They’ll contact you to arrange a convenient appointment time. Here’s a handout with information about managing high blood pressure and a list of symptoms to watch out for. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. And remember, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Sobkowicwicz. I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever.
