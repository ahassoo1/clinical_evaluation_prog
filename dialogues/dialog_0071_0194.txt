DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Terasa. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… well, my hearing. It comes and goes, you see. And with it, this spinning feeling. Makes me quite unsteady. It's been happening for a little while now, and my daughter, bless her heart, she insisted I come get it checked. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Right, hearing loss and dizziness… a bit unsteady, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, unsteady is a good way to put it. Like… being on a boat, maybe? But it doesn’t last long, thankfully. Just… moments. And it seems to happen when the hearing goes. Though, I can't really say why. It just… does. My husband… he had something similar, years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have these "moments" been happening, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. It's been… a while. Years, I suppose. Not constantly, you understand. It comes and goes in waves. A few weeks where I'm fine, then a little spell of it. I honestly can't put a date on it. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's okay. We'll try to piece things together. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmm… not that I can recall. No loud noises, no bumps to the head… nothing like that. It just… happens. Sometimes when I'm resting, sometimes when I’m out and about. It’s quite frustrating, really. I feel like I’m always waiting for it to happen again.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be unsettling. Let’s talk about your other health issues. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I get a bit of aches and pains, what old woman doesn't? And my doctor, the one before… he said my blood pressure was a little high sometimes, but I'm on medication for that. Oh, and I have Medicare, of course. That's about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is good. And you mentioned medication for high blood pressure… do you recall what that medication is called?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I leave all that to my daughter, bless her. She handles the pills and the doctors appointments. I just take what she gives me. It’s a little white one, I think? Or maybe beige. Honestly, they all look the same after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s alright, we’ll sort it out. Let’s talk about your ears themselves. Do you experience any ringing in your ears, or any pain, fullness, or discharge?
PATIENT: Ringing… sometimes. A very faint ringing. Not all the time. And no, no pain or anything coming out of them. Just… the spinning, and the quietness when it happens. It’s a strange feeling, truly. Like someone turned the volume down on the world.
DOCTOR: Okay, Terasa. I’d like to take a look in your ears and do a brief balance test, if that’s alright with you. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted. It’s been a worry for so long.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just lean back… Let me take a look at your ears first. Hmm… your ear canals are clear. The eardrums look a bit… normal in color, no obvious perforations or fluid. Okay, and with the tuning fork… the Weber test is normal, but the Rinne test… slightly diminished air conduction in both ears. That could indicate some conductive hearing loss.
PATIENT: Diminished…? Oh dear. Is that bad, Doctor? I don't understand all this… conductive whatsit. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Terasa. Conductive hearing loss just means there’s something affecting how sound travels through your outer or middle ear. It can be as simple as earwax buildup, or sometimes fluid. The Rinne test just helps us narrow down the possibilities. It doesn't tell us why it's happening, just that there's some difficulty. Given your dizziness as well, I think it would be best to refer you to an audiologist. They can do a more thorough hearing test and assess your balance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An audiologist… more tests. Oh dear. But if you think it’s best, Doctor, then yes, of course. I just want to get to the bottom of it. My daughter will be relieved. She’s always worried about my hearing.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm happy to do that. I'll send a referral to a good audiologist nearby. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if your dizziness becomes severe, or you experience any new symptoms like headache, fever, or trouble walking, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening, and for taking the time. It's been a weight off my mind, just getting it checked. My daughter will be thrilled.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes, don't hesitate to reach out. Here’s a copy of the referral information and a summary of what we discussed today. Have a good day, and please give your daughter my best. .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I will. And thank you again. Goodbye now.
