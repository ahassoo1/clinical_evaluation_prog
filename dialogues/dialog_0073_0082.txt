DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh... travel. I need... something for travel. My wife and I... we were gonna go. But she... she passed. Now I'm still going, I think. Needed... shots, maybe? I don't really know what I need. It was her job to remember these things.
DOCTOR: Travel, right. And you’re going alone now. I see. “Shots,” as you put it, are vaccinations. It's important to be up-to-date, especially when traveling internationally. Where exactly are you planning on going, Mr. Tayar?
PATIENT: Uh... Nepal. Back to Nepal. Where I'm from. It's... complicated. I go to see family. Not much happens there. It's... dusty. Why do I need shots to go home? It feels silly.
DOCTOR: Well, even returning to your country of origin doesn’t necessarily mean you’re immune to everything. Your exposure has changed living here, and things can be different even within Nepal, depending on the region. It's less about needing them and more about being… prudent. Let's see… Are you planning on traveling outside of Kathmandu, or staying primarily in the city?
PATIENT: Kathmandu… mostly. My cousin has a place there. We... mostly stay inside. Drink tea. Talk. Not much walking around. The air… it's bad there too, you know? I don't want to get sick from the city, if that makes sense. What kind of sicknesses are we talking about here anyway? It's just Nepal!
DOCTOR: “Just Nepal,” as you say, does have its share of… considerations. Even within Kathmandu, air quality isn’t the only concern. We need to think about things like typhoid, hepatitis A, and potentially Japanese encephalitis, depending on the time of year and your activities. Now, have you had any vaccinations recently?
PATIENT: Vaccinations? Um… a long time ago. When I was a kid, maybe? I don't remember. My wife always handled all that. She kept a book. It's… somewhere in the house. A big book. I haven't really looked at it since... well. I don't know what I've had. Sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, no. We’ll need to assume you're not up-to-date on several things, then. Let's start with a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I work. Aircraft stuff. It's... physical. They check you. Make sure you're okay. Strong. I'm healthy. Well, was. Everything's been... strange since. But physically, I'm okay. I think. I don't get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Just... the usual colds. Nothing bad. My wife... she had some problems with her heart. But that was her. I never needed much doctoring. I try to avoid it. It doesn't usually help. Just makes you feel worse, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Tayar. But preventative care is important, even if you feel generally well. Let's move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh... I think I'm allergic to dust. But everyone is, right? In Nepal, it's everywhere. Makes me sneeze. And... maybe some kind of pollen. Itchy eyes. Nothing serious. No shots ever made me sick, if that matters. I don't think I've ever had a bad reaction to anything. Except... except losing my wife. That's a bad reaction. But not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Right. Noted. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, herbal supplements—anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel... funny. My wife, she took some things for her heart. But I never needed anything. Just… tea. Strong tea. Does that count? It helps me sleep. But it’s just tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history—or lack thereof—and your travel plans, I recommend a few vaccinations. Typhoid, hepatitis A, and a tetanus booster, at a minimum. We should also discuss Japanese encephalitis, depending on the season and your exact location. And, given the air quality concerns you mentioned, I'd suggest a consultation with a pulmonologist before your trip. It's best to be cautious. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Japanese… what now? That sounds… complicated. And a pulmonologist? Is that a… a heart doctor? My wife saw a lot of doctors. I just want to go visit my family. Do I have to get all these shots? Can’t I just… be careful? Wash my hands? Maybe wear a mask?
DOCTOR: A pulmonologist is a lung doctor, Mr. Tayar. Your concern about air quality suggests it’s a prudent step. And while hygiene is important, it's not a substitute for vaccination. These diseases are quite common in Nepal, and while you can attempt to mitigate the risk, you're significantly increasing your chances of getting sick. It's your choice, of course, but I strongly advise against traveling without being properly protected. As for the vaccinations themselves, we can discuss the potential side effects and schedule them at your convenience. Do you want me to proceed with scheduling those now, or would you like more time to consider?
PATIENT: Consider. I need to… think about it. And talk to my cousin. He’s lived there longer. Maybe he knows something. He doesn't get sick. He’s... tough. I don't want to spend my whole trip feeling sick, but I also don’t want to fill my body with… things. I need a day. Maybe two. Then I'll… call. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Tayar. You can take your time. However, please be aware that these vaccinations require a series of doses, and it takes time for them to become effective. The sooner you schedule them, the better. Here’s my card. The number is on it. Please call the office within the next week to schedule an appointment. And do consider your cousin’s advice, but remember I am the medical professional here. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s all. Thank you. I… I need to go. It’s a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Tayar. And do call when you've decided.
