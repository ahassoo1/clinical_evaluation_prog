DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I am here for… a check-up, I think? The lady on the phone said something about a telehealth… but I am here now, yes? My back has been… not so good lately. A little pain.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you were initially scheduled for a telehealth visit, but we're happy to have you in person today. That’s perfectly fine. And you’re here because of some back pain. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, you understand. More like… a dull ache. It is mostly in the lower part of my back. It is worse when I… bend over, or lift things. Even sometimes when I sit for too long. It has been going on for maybe… two months now? Perhaps a little longer. I am not so good with dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower back, worse with bending, lifting, and prolonged sitting. About two months, give or take. That gives me a good starting point. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, yes. Some days are better than others. Today… it is a little bit worse, perhaps. When I wake up in the morning, it is usually… not so bad. But by the afternoon, after I have been doing things… it is more noticeable. I work with cars, you see. It is… physical work.
DOCTOR: Working with cars – that certainly can be physically demanding. So it sounds like the pain tends to worsen with activity. And you said it's been present for about two months. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain – like resting, stretching, or any particular position?
PATIENT: Yes, resting helps, of course. When I sit very still, it is… better. But I cannot sit still all day, you understand. I have work to do. Sometimes… a warm bath helps a little. But not for very long. And… I try to stretch sometimes, but it is difficult. I am not very flexible. My husband… he used to help me stretch. But… he is gone now.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Benites. It sounds like you've been managing this pain for a while now and trying to find things that help. You mentioned stretching. Do you have any pain radiating down your legs, or any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. No numbness. The pain stays in my back, mostly. Sometimes… it feels a little stiff in my hips, but that is all. Not in my legs. My feet are fine. I walk a lot, you see. I have to, at the garage.
DOCTOR: Okay, no radiating pain, numbness, or tingling. Stiffness in the hips, but pain localized to the back. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general health questions, if that’s alright. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is alright. Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And I have… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take a pill for it, every day. And… I had a little problem with my knee once, but that healed. That was from… falling, at the garage. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a past knee injury. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… I do not remember the name, Doctor. I just… take the white pill. The doctor gives me refills every month. I give it to the pharmacy, they give me the pills. I am not very good with remembering names. I have so many pills already, for… things. I can ask my neighbor, maybe, she is a nurse.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We can likely get the information from your pharmacy records. No need to worry about that right now. And you mentioned "other pills." Are there any other medications or supplements you take regularly?
PATIENT: Just… vitamins. A multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my joints are feeling stiff, I take something for that. It is… over the counter. Ibuprofen, I think? Or naproxen? One of those. I buy it at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasionally ibuprofen or naproxen for joint stiffness. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Not that I know of. I have eaten… everything. I have never had a problem. My husband… he was allergic to cats, but I am not. He would sneeze all the time, poor man. But I like cats.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke, but he stopped many years ago. It is… bad for you, you see. I always told him so.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I drink… sometimes. A little glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Not very often. Maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more. I do not drink very much. It is… not good for the blood pressure, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional wine with dinner. And finally, could you tell me a little about your work at the garage?
PATIENT: Yes. I have worked there… for almost thirty years now. My husband and me… we started it together. I do… everything. I fix cars, I help customers, I do the paperwork. It is… hard work, but I like it. I know a lot about cars. I am good at it, you see. I have to be, to keep it going. It is… my life.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. It sounds like you’re very dedicated and skilled. Okay, Ms. Benites, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your back, and we’ll take your blood pressure just to confirm your medication is working. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Please, go ahead. I hope it is not too bad.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll just have you lie down on your side on the examination table, if you’re comfortable doing so. I’ll start by gently palpating your back to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasm. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, can you tell me if this feels tender here… and how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. That is… a little sore. Not too bad, but… yes, right there. It is always a little bit sore there, especially when I have been working hard. Like… a dull ache, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can feel some tenderness and tightness in that area. It seems to be localized to your lower back, which is consistent with what you’ve been describing. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. I'd like you to bend forward, backward, and side to side, as comfortably as you can. Please stop if you experience any sharp pain. Okay, can you bend forward slowly… and now backward… and now try to touch your knees with your elbows, side to side.
PATIENT: Ooh… that is… difficult. I cannot bend very far. It is… stiff. No, I cannot do that very well. It hurts a little. And… no, I cannot reach my knees. I am not very flexible, you see. It has always been that way. I used to be able to bend more, but… not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, particularly with bending and twisting. It appears we have some muscle tightness and possibly some inflammation contributing to your discomfort. Now, I’m going to listen to your back with my stethoscope just to make sure everything sounds normal. Everything sounds clear on that front. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Ms. Benites. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it appears you have a muscle strain in your lower back, likely aggravated by your work at the garage. It's not something that immediately requires imaging like an X-ray or MRI, but we should manage it conservatively first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… sense. A muscle strain. I understand. I have strained muscles before, working on the cars. It is… hard work, you see. What does “conservatively” mean, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "Conservatively" means we’ll try less invasive treatments first, before considering things like imaging or more aggressive interventions. In your case, that includes things like rest, ice or heat application, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen – the ones you mentioned you sometimes use – and gentle stretching when you’re feeling up to it. I also recommend being mindful of your posture when lifting objects and avoiding any movements that significantly aggravate your pain. I’d like to start with that approach. Do you think you can manage that at home?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I can rest more. And I have the ibuprofen, yes. I will be careful lifting things, also. I always try to be, but… sometimes I forget. I will try to remember, Doctor. I will be more careful. How long… should I do this for? Before… I need to see you again?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. It’s common to slip up sometimes, especially with a physically demanding job. Try to consistently apply these measures for two weeks. If you’re not seeing significant improvement after two weeks, or if your pain worsens, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we can consider other options like physical therapy or further investigation. If you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, or if you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. Two weeks. And contact you if… it gets worse, or if I get a fever. I will remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel better already, just knowing what it is. It is not something… serious, yes?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help. No, it doesn’t sound like anything serious at this point. It's a common muscle strain, and most people recover fully with conservative management. I’ll send a summary of our discussion and these instructions to your pharmacy and to your home. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. It was nice to meet you. I hope you have a good day.
DOCTOR: It was very nice to meet you too, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. And you as well. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. You have a good day as well, and take care of your back.
