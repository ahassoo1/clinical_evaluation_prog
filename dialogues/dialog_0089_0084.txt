DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain. I’ve been getting… shorter of breath, I think. And my mouth and eyes feel very dry. It’s been happening for a while now, but it feels… worse lately, perhaps? I apologize if that’s not very clear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Ms. Kobler. It's perfectly alright if it's hard to explain, and it’s common for things to be a little fuzzy when you’re not feeling your best. “Shorter of breath and dry mouth and eyes… worse lately.” Okay. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It doesn't happen all the time. It’s more… when I’m doing things. Like, walking upstairs, or even just… carrying something. It’s not a sharp pain, more like… I have to stop and catch my breath. And it feels like I can’t quite get enough air, you see? It’s unsettling. I don’t remember ever feeling this before, not like this.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s exertional – meaning it happens with activity – and you feel like you aren’t getting enough air. And it’s new. Good to know. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Approximately… that is a difficult question. Perhaps… a few months? It started very gradually. I noticed I was pausing a little more often when I was gardening, and then… it just seemed to get a bit more frequent. I honestly couldn’t say precisely. It’s all a bit… blurred. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully. It just… crept up on me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Ms. Kobler. Gradual onset is helpful information. And a few months… okay. Now, let’s talk about that dry mouth and dry eyes. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, I think. Especially the dry mouth. I find myself reaching for water all the time. My eyes… they feel gritty, even with drops sometimes. It’s not painful, just… very uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to concentrate. I often have to blink a lot. I assumed it was just… getting older, perhaps. Or the weather. We’ve had a dry summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant dry mouth and eyes, worsened by the dry summer. You're right to consider that. Let's go through some other things to get a better picture. Do you have any other symptoms – anything at all – that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I’ve been feeling… a little tired lately, I suppose. But then, who doesn’t? It’s hard to say if that’s related. And… my appetite hasn’t been very good. Not that I’m not eating, just… not as much as usual. It’s difficult to pinpoint anything specific, honestly. I don’t feel unwell, exactly. Just… not quite myself. Perhaps a bit… listless. Is that a word?
DOCTOR: "Listless" is a perfect word, Ms. Kobler. And it’s good you’re telling me everything, even if it seems small. So, fatigue and decreased appetite, along with the shortness of breath, dry mouth and eyes. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: That's another difficult question, Doctor. I was… divorced some time ago, and my ex-husband handled most of the paperwork. I think I have high blood pressure, but I haven’t seen a doctor regularly for… quite a while. And I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Other than that… I honestly couldn’t say. I have a very poor memory for things like that. Would my previous doctor have records?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kobler, your previous doctor would absolutely have records. We can certainly request those. And it’s good to know about the potential high blood pressure and the gallbladder removal. Do you happen to know the name and location of your previous doctor’s office?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a challenge. It was a long time ago, and I’ve moved a few times. I believe his name was… Dr. Abernathy? And the office was… in Anchorage, I think? It was a larger practice. I’m terribly sorry, this is not very helpful, is it? My memory is just… fragmented. I really wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Ms. Kobler, you're doing the best you can. “Dr. Abernathy in Anchorage” is a start. We can certainly try to track down those records. Now, let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just the occasional pain reliever for aches and pains. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I take ibuprofen, perhaps, if I have a headache. And I use eye drops, as I mentioned. But nothing regularly. I don’t like feeling… reliant on pills, if you understand. I’ve never been a fan of taking medicine.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Kobler. Ibuprofen as needed and eye drops. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I don’t have any known allergies. I eat most things, and I've never had a problem with pollen or dust or… anything like that. I don’t think I'm particularly sensitive to anything, actually. Though, that doesn’t mean I’m certain. My memory… you see. I tend to forget these things.
DOCTOR: Right, no known allergies. Okay. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly sensible. I apologize if I fidget. I’m not very comfortable with… procedures, if you understand. But please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kobler. No need to apologize at all. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, blood pressure is 148 over 92. A bit elevated. Pulse is 88, regular. Hmm. Breathing sounds a little… diminished in both lower lobes. Not dramatically, but I do hear some… slight crackles. It’s subtle. Do you have any history of smoking?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother… she had a bad cough, so I always avoided it. I find it… unpleasant. The smell, mostly. And I’ve always been fairly active, so I’ve never felt the need. Is that… concerning? The crackles, you said? I apologize for asking so many questions. I’m just… anxious.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be anxious, Ms. Kobler, and your questions are perfectly reasonable. The crackles are a little concerning, but not necessarily alarming. They could be caused by a number of things. Given your symptoms - shortness of breath, dry mouth and eyes, fatigue, decreased appetite, slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds - I'd like to order a few tests. We’ll do a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest x-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. I appreciate you taking everything so seriously, Doctor. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an x-ray. Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for my constant questions. I just like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kobler. It's good you ask questions. For the blood tests, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. And for the chest x-ray, you shouldn’t need any special preparation. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is that understood?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly clear. Fast for eight hours, no preparation for the x-ray, results in 24 to 48 hours. And go to the emergency room if things worsen. I've written that down. Thank you, Doctor. I feel… a little better now, just knowing we’re doing something to figure this out. I really appreciate your patience and kindness. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps a specific type of exercise to avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kobler. I’m glad you’re feeling a little more reassured. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid strenuous exercise until we have the test results back. Gentle walking is fine, but don't push yourself. And stay well-hydrated. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I truly appreciate your time and patience. Thank you again for everything. I will follow your instructions and avoid strenuous exercise and stay hydrated. I'll be sure to call if anything changes. It was very kind of you to see me today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kobler. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. Have a good day, and I'll talk to you soon.
