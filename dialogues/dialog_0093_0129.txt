DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Hatchard. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's get right to it. It's my… well, it's my stool. It’s black. Like, really black. And it's been happening for a bit now. I take pills, you see. For the aches. Always have. Always will, probably. They're just… strong pills. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mrs. Hatchard. I appreciate you being direct. Black stool can be a sign of something we need to investigate, so it’s good you brought it to my attention. And yes, knowing about your medications is very important. You mentioned “strong pills” for aches. Could you tell me the name of the medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Names… I don’t bother with names. Too much to remember. They're the red ones. Little red pills. And sometimes the white ones, when my knees are really bad. I've been taking them for… oh, decades, I suppose. My husband gets them for me. He knows the pharmacist. Honestly, you doctors always want to know everything. Does it really matter what they're called if they help?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mrs. Hatchard, and you're right to prioritize what works for you. However, knowing the specific medications, even approximately, helps me understand potential interactions and side effects. It's important for your safety. Let's try this: Do you know where your husband gets these medications?
PATIENT: Honestly? Probably that big chain pharmacy, you know, the one on Highway 12. The one with the drive-through. Everyone goes there. It’s not like I go traipsing around in there. He handles all of that. I just take what he gives me. It's easier that way. I don't have time for all that fuss. And frankly, he's better at remembering things than I am.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Knowing it's the pharmacy on Highway 12 allows me to access your medication list electronically, with your permission, of course. We can verify exactly what you're taking. Now, regarding the black stool – has it been consistently black, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's been… mostly consistent. Dark, you know? Like… tar. Not a pretty sight, I can assure you. It’s not like it’s bright red or anything. Just… dark. And it smells awful, naturally. It’s been like this for a couple of weeks, maybe? I don’t pay that much attention, to be perfectly honest. It's not like I'm examining it under a microscope. Does that answer your question? Because I really need to get back to my garden. The tomatoes are ripening fast.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mrs. Hatchard. “Like tar” for a couple of weeks. We need to rule out a few possibilities. Black, tarry stool can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which is why it’s important to investigate. I’d like to ask a few more questions, then I'll perform a quick physical exam. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the black stool?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Bleeding? Honestly, you doctors always jump to the worst conclusion. I haven't noticed anything… except maybe a bit tired, but I’m seventy-three! What do you expect? And sometimes my stomach feels a little… unsettled. But that's probably just the pills. I take them with my breakfast, you see, and sometimes breakfast doesn’t agree with me. Is that what you want to know? Look, I just want a quick fix. Something to make it stop being… dark. I don't need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mrs. Hatchard, and I assure you I’m not jumping to conclusions. However, it’s my job to consider all possibilities to ensure your health and safety. The tiredness and unsettled stomach could be related to the pills, as you suggest, but they can also be symptoms associated with the potential cause of the black stool. To help me understand what's happening, could you describe what you mean by "unsettled stomach"?
PATIENT: Oh, just… queasy. Like I might throw up, but I usually don't. Just a feeling of… discomfort. It comes and goes, mostly after I eat. And honestly, everything tastes a bit funny lately. Not awful, just… not right. Like something's off. But I’m an old woman, doctor. Things are always “off”. It’s part of getting old. I don’t need you to tell me about indigestion. I’ve had indigestion my entire life. Can we please just get to the bottom of this black stool and be done with it? I have tomatoes to can.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Hatchard. We will try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. To help me assess the situation, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But be quick about it. I don't have all day, you know. And please, don’t poke around too much. I bruise easily. Just listen and poke a little. That's all. Tomatoes are calling my name. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Hatchard. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are present, although slightly diminished. I’m gently pressing on your abdomen… No significant tenderness to palpation, although you do seem to have some mild discomfort in your upper abdomen. I'm checking your pulse and blood pressure now… your pulse is 78 and your blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mrs. Hatchard. Based on the information you’ve provided and the preliminary physical exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, potentially related to your medications. However, we need to confirm this with some further testing.
