DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good mornin’ to you too, doctor. Well, somethin’s… leakin’. Down there. It’s been happenin’ for a little bit now, I guess. Not sure how long, really. Old lady problems, probably.
DOCTOR: “Leaking,” you say. Alright. And when you say “a little bit,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Oh, jeez. You want me to measure it? I dunno, not much. Just… noticeable, you know? When I go to the bathroom. And sometimes on my… underthings. It's not like a flood, if that's what you're askin'. It's just… icky.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. “Icky” is a perfectly acceptable description. It's helpful to try and quantify it, though. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually worsening?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Maybe. Honestly, my memory ain’t what it used to be. Everything kinda feels the same these days. It’s been… a while since I noticed it, definitely. Not a big thing, just… there. I thought it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any burning or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Not really. A little uncomfortable sometimes, just… old age, I reckon. Things don't work like they used to. But not painful, no. Not like a scrape or nothin’.
DOCTOR: And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you're askin’ me somethin' fancy. What does that even mean? I go to the bathroom when I need to go, same as always. Everything comes out normal, if that’s what you want to know. Sometimes a little hard, but that’s just from not drinkin’ enough water, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. Just checking. And are you experiencing any… unusual vaginal odor?
PATIENT: Vaginal… oh, jeez. You gotta ask so many questions. I dunno. I smell like… an old lady? I use soap, if that's what you mean. I don’t smell bad, not that I know of. My grandson says I smell like lavender, but he's just bein’ nice.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on. Have you noticed any blood in your urine, or with this leakage?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I've seen. I always check, ya know? After I go to the bathroom. Not like a whole lot, not like a wound or nothin’. Just… pinkish sometimes, but that's probably just somethin’ I ate, right? Beets or somethin’. I eat a lot of beets.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve checking your abdomen, and a brief pelvic exam. It'll help me understand what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Pelvic exam? Oh, jeez. You're askin’ for a lot, doctor. I’m an old lady, ya know? Not really in the mood for… pokin’ around. But I guess… if you have to. Just be gentle, okay? And quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please undress from the waist down, and I'll leave you to get settled. A gown is in the closet if you prefer. I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: Oh, lord. I really don't like this. Fine. mumbles to herself Old age… nothin' good comes from old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. Let’s take a look. Please lie back, feet flat on the table. I’m going to start by palpating your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's cold! And… ooh, a little sore. Right there. Not bad bad, just… sensitive. I get a lot of gas, if that matters. Maybe it's just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. And what about here?
PATIENT: A little bit here too. It’s kinda hard to say, everything feels kinda achy these days. Like a dull pain, nothin' sharp. Is this gonna take long? I got bingo at three.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm just going to take a look at the external area now. I see some mild redness, but no obvious signs of infection. I’ll need to perform an internal exam to get a better assessment. I'll explain everything as I go. It might be a little uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Internal exam? Oh, jeez, doctor. I really don't think so. I'm too old for all this pokin' around. I’m tellin’ ya, it’s just old lady stuff. Probably somethin’ that’ll go away on its own. No need to go stickin' things... you know. Can't we just give me somethin’ for it? Like a cream or somethin’?
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your reluctance. However, without a proper examination, I can't determine the cause of your leakage and recommend the correct treatment. It could be a simple urinary tract infection, stress incontinence, or something else entirely. A cream wouldn't address the underlying problem. I strongly advise completing the internal exam. It's a standard part of assessing these types of symptoms, and it's the best way to ensure I provide you with the appropriate care. If you absolutely refuse, I can offer a referral to another physician, but they will likely recommend the same thing. I'm simply trying to do my job and ensure you receive the best possible medical attention.
PATIENT: Oh, lord. You're makin' a big deal outta nothin', doctor. Fine. Sighs heavily Do it quick, okay? And be gentle. I'm warnin’ ya, if it hurts, I'm gonna yell. This is just ridiculous. Old ladies shouldn't have to put up with this kinda stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Deep breaths. This might feel a little pressure. Okay, just a quick swab to check for infection. And now, I’ll gently check your pelvic organs. Alright, everything seems… normal structurally. No large masses or tenderness. Okay, that's all done. I’ll send the swab to the lab for analysis. It'll take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and doing some pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegels. I can provide you with a pamphlet on those.
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises? Kegels? Oh, for goodness sake. More things to remember. Fine. Whatever you say, doctor. Just… I hope it ain’t nothin’ serious. I got bingo to get to. And my grandson’s comin’ over for dinner on Saturday. I don’t wanna be sick. Just tell me if it's somethin' I should worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab results will take about three to five business days. If the swab comes back positive for an infection, we'll start antibiotics. If it’s negative, we'll discuss other possible causes and treatment options. This pamphlet explains how to perform Kegel exercises. They can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and reduce leakage. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop immediately. Unless you have any further questions, I believe that concludes our consultation today. I will have the receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment once the lab results are available. Have a good day, Ms. Genard.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. . Fine. Thank you, doctor. I hope it ain't nothin’ serious. You youngsters always make a big deal outta nothin’. . Alright, bye.
