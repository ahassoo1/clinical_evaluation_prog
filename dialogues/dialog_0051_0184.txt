DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, it's about this. It's…sagging. Always been a proud man, kept myself fit, you understand? But now…it's just not right. And my wife… she woulda said something. She always did. So I figured I’d get it looked at.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's always best to address these things. When did you first notice this change, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Change? Well now, let me think. It weren’t no overnight thing, you know? Gradual. Started… maybe six months after… well, after she passed. January, February maybe? Hard to say exactly. I was… distracted. Still am, truth be told. But it's definitely gotten worse since then. It just…hangs there now. Disgusting.
DOCTOR: I see. So, roughly around January or February, after your wife passed, you started to notice a change in your abdomen. And it’s progressively worsened since then. Can you describe the change for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? You want me to describe it? It’s… loose. Like a bag. A bag of… well, never you mind. It used to be firm, you know? Muscle. Pile driving ain’t easy work. Years of it. Now it’s just… soft. And it sticks out. Even when I pull my belt tight, it’s still… there. I don't like it. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, loose, softer than it used to be, and protruding even when your belt is fastened. I appreciate you being so open with me, Mr. Trendler. Has this been accompanied by any pain, discomfort, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. A little ache sometimes, but nothing a strong man can't handle. Bowel habits… well, they’re regular enough. I eat my porridge every morning, keeps things moving, you see? No… problems there. It's just… the look of it. It’s unsettling. Makes me feel old, even though I ain't that old.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, regular bowel movements. You're concerned about the appearance. Now, have you noticed any other changes at all, perhaps with your appetite, weight, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Appetite... not much different. Still eat a good breakfast, bit of fish most nights. Weight… hmm. Probably lost a few pounds, truth be told. Didn’t weigh myself regularly, never had reason to. Energy levels… less than they used to be, I suppose. But who has energy at my age? It’s probably just getting older. I used to be able to swing a hammer all day, now… I get tired quicker.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some weight loss, and decreased energy levels. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me think… Had a bit of arthritis in my knees years ago, doctor gave me some pills for it. Took 'em for a while, then just…stopped. Didn’t like taking pills. High blood pressure, maybe? Doctor mentioned it once, but I don’t remember much detail. Never been in hospital, never had surgery. Always been a strong man, always looked after myself. That's about it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, some arthritis in the knees, possible high blood pressure. And no hospitalizations or surgeries. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a fan of pills, remember? Maybe a bit of ibuprofen now and then for my knees, but that's it. And I don’t take it often. I try to tough it out, you see? Builds character. My wife… she always tried to get me to take something for everything. But I wasn’t having it.
DOCTOR: I understand. No regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Eat anything put in front of me, really. Dust bothers me a bit, makes me sneeze, but that's all. Nothing serious. I've lived a long life, been around a lot of things. Never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father lived to be 85, strong man, worked the land his whole life. Mother died young, heart trouble, I think. Got a brother, still living, bit of a drinker, always been weak. And a sister, she’s… well, she’s gone now. Cancer, I believe. Didn't get along with her much. But that’s about it. Nothing much else to tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Father lived to 85, mother died young of heart trouble, brother is alive and a drinker, and a sister passed away from cancer. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Alcohol… I have a glass of rum sometimes, on a Saturday night. Keeps me warm. Just one glass, mind you. Not a heavy drinker. And… no, nothing else. Never had any interest in… that sort of thing. A simple man, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional rum, and no other substance use. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Physical exam, eh? Well, I suppose so. Get it over with then. I ain't got all day, you know. But don't poke around too much. And be gentle!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of a murmur, but likely benign given your age. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. It is soft, and there is some fullness. No obvious masses or tenderness. Pulses are present and regular in all extremities. Reflexes are normal. Okay, Mr. Trendler. Based on the exam, and what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing some abdominal fullness, likely due to a weakening of your abdominal muscles over time. This is common with age and can be exacerbated by weight loss and decreased physical activity. However, to rule out any other potential causes, I would like to order some blood work. This will help us check your organ function and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, eh? More poking and prodding. Honestly. Look, I ain't keen on needles. But… if you say it's necessary, I suppose I can do it. Just get it over with quickly, alright? And tell me what it all means afterwards. I don't want any fancy medical jargon, understand? Simple English only.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns about the needles, and I’ll make sure it’s as quick and comfortable as possible. And I promise, I will explain everything in simple English. No jargon. The blood work will check things like your kidney and liver function, your blood sugar, and your complete blood count, which will help us look for any signs of infection or other underlying issues. We will also check your electrolytes, just to make sure everything is balanced. I'll give you a requisition form for the lab. They're just down the hall. Once you've had the blood drawn, you can come back and we’ll discuss the results when they are available. It usually takes a couple of days. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A couple of days, eh? Fine. Just… what if it's something bad? My sister… she didn't have good results. I don't want to end up like her. And what about this… this sagging? Can you fix it? Is there anything you can do to make it look better? I don’t want to be walking around looking like a deflated balloon.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, it’s understandable to be concerned, especially given your sister's experience. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. The blood work is simply a precaution to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. Many things can cause abdominal fullness, and often it's not something serious. We’ll know more once the results are back. As for the "sagging," as you put it, there are some options we can explore. Exercise, specifically core strengthening exercises, can help to improve muscle tone. There are also some non-surgical procedures, like skin tightening treatments, that can help to reduce the appearance of loose skin. However, these procedures are not always necessary and come with potential risks and benefits that we would need to discuss in detail. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done and then we can discuss the results and potential next steps. Would you like me to write down some basic core exercises you can try in the meantime?
PATIENT: Core exercises… Hmph. I used to swing a hammer all day, that was exercise enough. But alright, write 'em down. Can't hurt, I suppose. Just make sure they're simple. I ain't got the flexibility I used to have. And… what if the blood work shows something bad? What then? What kinda things are we talkin' about? Just give it to me straight, understand? No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Here you are. These are basic exercises you can try. Start slowly and listen to your body. If anything causes pain, stop immediately. Now, regarding the blood work, if it were to show something concerning, it could be a number of things. It could indicate issues with your kidneys or liver, which can cause abdominal swelling and fatigue. It could also show signs of infection, inflammation, or even certain types of cancer. However, I want to emphasize again that these are just possibilities. The vast majority of the time, these tests come back normal or show minor issues that we can manage with lifestyle changes or medication. If we do find something concerning, we'll discuss all of your options in detail. We can schedule further tests, consult with a specialist, or explore treatment plans if necessary. We'll work together to make the best decision for your health. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough for now. Just… get the blood work done, alright? And tell me what it means, in simple English. I don’t want any fancy talk. Right. I'll be going now. And I expect a clear explanation of these results, understand? .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand. I'll make sure to explain everything in simple English. I'll also make a note on your chart to ensure clear communication. Here's the requisition form for the lab. They're just down the hall to your left. Please let the receptionist know when you've had the blood drawn. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you again when the results are back. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Trendler.
