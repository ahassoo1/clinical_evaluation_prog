DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Dhanoa. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now and it's really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, ringing in the ears. We call that tinnitus. And how long exactly is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… let me think. Probably… around three months, maybe a little longer? It started kinda quiet, I barely noticed it at first. But it's definitely gotten louder and more constant. It's hard to say exactly, to be honest. I don’t really keep track of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Three months… right. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, but sometimes it feels like it's in both. It’s weird. It's not like a loud ringing, more of a… high-pitched whine, you know? Like when a TV isn’t quite on the right channel.
DOCTOR: A high-pitched whine… yes, I understand. And has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not that I can really pinpoint, no. I work at a restaurant, it's pretty noisy there, maybe that's it? Lots of chatter, music, clanging dishes… it's a busy place. I didn't really notice it getting bad right after a particularly loud shift, though. Just kinda… slowly got worse.
DOCTOR: Well, noise exposure is a common culprit. But there are many other possibilities. Have you noticed any hearing loss alongside the ringing?
PATIENT: Hearing loss? Not that I've noticed, no. I can still hear fine, as far as I can tell. People don't usually complain when I talk, do they? I mean, maybe I should ask my family, but they're pretty good at ignoring me anyway.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any dizziness, nausea, or any other symptoms along with the tinnitus?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the ringing. It’s… annoying, that’s all. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when it’s quiet. I just want it to stop, honestly. It’s driving me a bit crazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Dhanoa. I'm going to do a quick examination of your ears, and then we’ll check your hearing with a simple test. It shouldn't take long. If you could just have a seat.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Let’s get this over with, eh? I got a shift starting soon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Open wide… Just looking in your ear canal now. Hmm… Both ear canals appear clear. No obvious signs of wax buildup or infection. Now, let’s do a quick hearing test. I’m going to put headphones on you, and you’ll indicate when you hear a tone in each ear. Just a series of beeps, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds easy enough. Headphones, beeps… yeah, no problem. Just get it done quickly if you can, please. I really don’t want to be late for work.
DOCTOR: Alright. The hearing test shows a slight decrease in hearing sensitivity at higher frequencies in your right ear. It’s not dramatic, but it correlates with your complaint of tinnitus. It appears you have mild high-frequency hearing loss in the right ear, likely due to noise exposure.
PATIENT: Noise exposure, huh? Like you said before. That restaurant is loud. So… is there anything you can do about it? Is it serious? I don’t want to go deaf or anything.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely you'll go completely deaf, Mr. Dhanoa. However, persistent exposure to loud noises can worsen hearing loss over time. The tinnitus is likely a symptom of the initial damage. We can try a few things. I recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible—earplugs are essential at your workplace. I’m going to recommend a course of Vitamin B12 and Magnesium supplements; these may help with the tinnitus, although results vary. We can also consider a referral to an audiologist for a more comprehensive hearing evaluation and to discuss hearing aids if the hearing loss progresses. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay, earplugs, vitamins… that sounds… doable. I can get earplugs. And I guess I can try the vitamins. What about… is there any medication that can just make the ringing stop? I really just want it gone. And how long before the vitamins might help, if they do at all? I don't want to take something that's not gonna work.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there is no medication to cure tinnitus, Mr. Dhanoa. Many medications claim to help, but the evidence is largely anecdotal. The vitamins are a relatively low-risk intervention that some patients find beneficial. It typically takes several weeks—at least 8—to see if there is any improvement. I’m prescribing a high-dose Vitamin B12 supplement, 1000 micrograms daily, and 400 milligrams of Magnesium. I’ll also write a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, an excellent audiologist in the area. She can assess the extent of your hearing loss and discuss potential assistive listening devices. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Right… no cure. Okay. That's… disappointing. But alright, I'll try it. Earplugs, vitamins, see the audiologist. I guess that’s all I can do. No, I don't think so. That's everything. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your time. Gotta run.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Dhanoa. I’ll document everything in your chart. Remember, protect your hearing. If the tinnitus worsens or you experience any dizziness or pain, contact the clinic immediately. Have a good day.
