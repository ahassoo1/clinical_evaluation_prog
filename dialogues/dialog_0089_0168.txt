DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… rather concerning, to be frank. I’m dating someone new, and I simply want to ensure everything is… as it should be. One doesn't want unpleasant surprises, you understand. I prefer to be proactive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela, that's very sensible of you. Proactive health maintenance is always a good idea. So, you're wanting a general check-up, specifically related to your new relationship?
PATIENT: Precisely. I've always been… particular about my health. And, frankly, one can never be too careful with these things. I wouldn't want to… compromise myself, or him, naturally. It’s simply good manners, wouldn't you agree? And a bit of prudence.
DOCTOR: I completely agree. Okay. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I generally feel… quite well. I watch what I eat, mostly. Not a great deal of… excess, you understand. I do try to maintain a certain standard. I have Medicare, of course, and I see my dentist regularly. No major complaints, thankfully. Though I do find myself a bit… tired sometimes, but that’s probably just the summer heat. I am married, have been for quite some time. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's all good information, Esthela. And yes, your marital status is relevant - it helps me understand your overall health context. You mentioned feeling tired sometimes. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a debilitating fatigue, Doctor. More of a… listlessness. A lack of pep, if you will. It comes and goes, mostly in the afternoons. I find myself needing a bit of a… lie-down, sometimes. I chalk it up to being a woman of a certain age, naturally. But I suppose it's best to mention it, just in case. I wouldn’t want anything… untoward to be overlooked. And it has been rather warm, as I said. Perhaps it's simply dehydration.
DOCTOR: Okay, listlessness and needing a lie-down, more common in the afternoons. And you suspect it might be dehydration. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me consider. Not particularly, no. No fever, no chills, no aches. My appetite is perfectly normal, perhaps a bit too normal, if I’m being honest. I do enjoy a good meal. And my… regular functions are all as they should be. I suppose I’ve been a little more… irritable lately. But that’s likely due to the stress of… starting something new. A new relationship requires a certain amount of… vigilance, you understand. One must be on one's guard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or aches, normal appetite, and some irritability, possibly related to the new relationship. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A bit of a… fluctuation, actually. I wouldn't say drastic, but noticeable. I believe I've gained a few pounds. It’s rather discouraging, to be frank. I try to be mindful of my figure, you understand. I'm approximately 166 centimeters tall and weigh… around 93 kilograms. It's the summer, of course. Clothes don’t fit as nicely. But it’s nothing excessive, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately 166 centimeters and 93 kilograms, with some recent weight gain. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none whatsoever. I've always been rather fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take anything, without issue. I don't even get mosquito bites, which is quite remarkable, really. I suppose my constitution is simply… robust. My husband often remarks on it. He says I'm a very… grounded woman. It's a compliment, naturally. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m quite careful about what I ingest, naturally. One doesn’t want to tempt fate.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to rely on… natural remedies, if possible. A bit of chamomile tea for relaxation, perhaps. But nothing… pharmaceutical. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you understand. Proper diet, adequate rest, and… sensible company. I don’t care for pills. They seem… artificial. My husband has a few medications for his… condition, but I don’t take anything myself. Nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications at all. Alright, Esthela, that’s a good start. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. I expect a thorough examination, naturally. One wouldn't want to leave anything… unexamined. I do have a bit of a… sensitivity about my blood pressure, though. It tends to rise when I'm nervous, which is rather inconvenient. But I trust your expertise, naturally. Proceed at your own pace. I prefer… efficiency, but thoroughness is paramount, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll take it slow. I'll start with your blood pressure, and we can try to relax while we do it. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly… reasonable. Blood pressure first, you say? I shall endeavor to remain… calm. Though I must warn you, Doctor, I do have a rather… strong pulse. It’s another one of those… robust qualities, my husband says. And I do tend to… fidget when I'm anxious. Please forgive me if I move about a bit. I simply want to ensure everything is… as it should be. Proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: Okay, Esthela. Just relax your arm, and take some slow, deep breaths with me. We’ll take a couple of readings just to get an accurate number. I'll start now. Hmm, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148/92. Not terribly high, but higher than ideal, as you suspected. Let's take another reading in a few minutes after you've had a chance to settle in a bit. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Precisely as I feared. A bit of nervousness, you see? It does tend to… interfere. Yes, a second reading is… advisable. I shall endeavor to remain… still. Though I must confess, Doctor, waiting does tend to… exacerbate the anxiety. But I trust your judgment. Perhaps a bit of small talk would… distract me? Though I confess, I find most conversation… rather superficial. But I am willing to… cooperate. Proceed as you see fit, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly chat while we wait. Or, if you prefer, we can just sit in silence. Whatever makes you more comfortable. In the meantime, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. If you could just take some nice, deep breaths for me, that would be great. Everything sounds clear so far, but I'll continue to assess as we go.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Silence is… acceptable. Though I do find a bit of… discourse preferable to complete stillness. But I shall endeavor to… cooperate. Do proceed. My heart is… quite strong, you know. It always has been. I lead a… relatively active life, despite my age. I do enjoy gardening, you see. And I do tend to… pace about a bit, which undoubtedly contributes to its… robustness. Do let me know if you detect any… anomalies. I prefer… directness.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds strong and regular, as you said. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It might be slightly cool to the touch, so just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Anything feel tender at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. My abdomen is… quite well-maintained, I assure you. I do watch my diet, you see. And I do tend to… exercise my core muscles, naturally. Gardening requires a certain amount of… physical exertion. Do proceed, Doctor. But do be gentle. I do have a… sensitive disposition, you see. And I do prefer… efficiency. I have an appointment later, you understand. Not that I am… rushing you, naturally. Simply stating a fact. Do let me know if you detect any… irregularities. I prefer… directness.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal so far. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. It's a quick little tap with this small hammer. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. And that one. Everything seems normal on both sides.
PATIENT: Perfectly unremarkable, as expected. My reflexes are… quite robust, you know. I maintain an… active lifestyle, naturally. And I do tend to… pace about a bit, which undoubtedly contributes to their… vigor. Do let me know if you detect any… anomalies. I prefer… directness. Though I confess, I do find these… percussive examinations rather… jarring. But I am willing to… cooperate. Do proceed as you see fit, naturally. Simply stating a fact. Are we nearing… completion?
DOCTOR: Yes, we're almost done. Just a quick check of your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat looks clear as well. So, overall, everything looks good. Your heart and lungs sound clear, reflexes are normal, ears and throat look clear. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but that’s likely due to anxiety, as we discussed.
PATIENT: Precisely as I suspected. A bit of nervousness, you see? It does tend to… interfere. Though I confess, I do find this… clinical assessment rather… perfunctory. But I am willing to… cooperate. And the blood pressure, of course. Do let me know if you detect any… anomalies. I prefer… directness. What are your… recommendations, Doctor? Simply stating a fact. And do be concise. I have an appointment later, you understand. Not that I am… rushing you, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, Esthela. My recommendation is to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. You can purchase a home blood pressure cuff at most pharmacies. Record the readings each day and bring them with you to a follow-up appointment in two weeks. We’ll see if it consistently remains elevated. Also, I recommend trying some relaxation techniques to manage your anxiety. Things like deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can be very helpful. Finally, since you mentioned feeling tired, we can run a basic blood test to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other underlying causes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A home blood pressure monitor… acceptable. I shall endeavor to… comply. Though I confess, I do find the act of… self-measurement rather… tedious. But I shall endeavor to… comply. Relaxation techniques… acceptable. Though I confess, I do find the very notion of… stillness rather… unsettling. But I shall endeavor to… comply. A blood test… acceptable. Though I confess, I do find the act of… puncturing my epidermis rather… unpleasant. But I shall endeavor to… comply. Simply stating a fact. Do you require a… referral for the blood test, Doctor? And do you require a… specific time for the follow-up appointment? Simply stating a fact.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll write you a referral for a basic blood panel. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. The results will be sent to me directly. As for the follow-up, how does two weeks from today sound?
PATIENT: Two weeks from today… acceptable. Though I confess, I do find the concept of… prolonged waiting rather… unsettling. But I shall endeavor to… comply. Simply stating a fact. Do you require any… further documentation, Doctor? And do you require a… detailed itinerary for the blood test? Simply stating a fact. I believe that concludes our… discourse, does it not?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe it does. No, I don't require any further documentation or a detailed itinerary for the blood test. The lab will provide you with all the necessary instructions. I'll have the nurse print out a summary of our conversation and the referral for the blood test. Thank you for coming in today, Esthela. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Acceptable. Though I confess, I do find the act of… prolonged clinical interactions rather… tedious. But I shall endeavor to… comply. Thank you, Doctor. Though I confess, I do find the act of… perfunctory farewells rather… unsettling. But I shall endeavor to… comply. Good day to you as well. .
