DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I believe I was advised to inquire about… paperwork. Something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? It was suggested to me, but the details are… rather hazy. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly common to feel a bit overwhelmed by these documents. An Advance Directive and a POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – are both important tools for ensuring your healthcare wishes are respected, should you be unable to communicate them yourself. Let's clarify things. An Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your overall wishes for medical care, whereas a POLST form is a more specific set of orders for immediate medical treatment. To start, perhaps we can discuss what an Advance Directive entails, and whether it’s something you’d like to pursue?
PATIENT: That… that sounds right. Something about broader wishes… Yes. I believe that is what I was told. It’s just… I’ve a poor memory, Doctor. Divorced, you see. A lot of… upheaval. It’s difficult to focus on these things, even when I try. But I understand the importance. So, an Advance Directive… what sort of things would it cover? I confess, I haven’t the faintest idea where to begin.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Buoniconti. Life can certainly be… disruptive, and it’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed. We can take this at a very comfortable pace. An Advance Directive essentially allows you to specify what types of medical treatments you would – or would not – want if you were seriously ill and unable to make decisions for yourself. This could include things like mechanical ventilation, CPR, feeding tubes, and dialysis. It also allows you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. We'll go through each aspect step-by-step. Do you have any initial thoughts on who you might want to designate as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… someone to… speak for me? That is… a weighty responsibility. Let me see… my sister, perhaps? Anya. She lives in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, but she’s… reliable. Very sensible. Though, communicating across the distance might be… difficult. I haven’t spoken to her in some time, truthfully. Several months, at least. Perhaps not the best choice, given the circumstances. I’m truly not sure, Doctor. It's… difficult to think clearly. Do I need to name someone immediately? Could we perhaps revisit that point later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. There's no need to rush into naming a healthcare proxy if you're not comfortable doing so right now. It's more important to choose someone you truly trust and who understands your values, and it's perfectly acceptable to take time to consider that. We can certainly revisit that point later in our discussion. For now, let's focus on your general wishes regarding medical treatment. If you were facing a serious illness with little chance of recovery, would you want aggressive medical intervention to prolong your life, even if it meant significant pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Aggressive intervention… prolonging life… even with pain… That’s… a difficult question, Doctor. I’ve always valued… dignity, I suppose. And quiet. A peaceful existence. I don’t think I would want to be… kept alive artificially, if there was no hope of recovery. The pain… the discomfort… no. I would prefer… comfort, if possible. And to be allowed to… pass peacefully. Is that… is that clear enough? I apologize if I’m rambling. It’s just… a morbid topic.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly clear, Ms. Buoniconti, and you're not rambling at all. In fact, you've articulated your wishes very thoughtfully and eloquently. It sounds as though you prioritize quality of life and a peaceful passing, and you would not want life-prolonging treatments if there was no realistic hope of recovery. That's incredibly valuable information. We can document that as your preference for end-of-life care. To clarify further, would you be comfortable with receiving pain management medication, even if it potentially hastens your death?
PATIENT: Pain management… even if it… hastens death… That’s… a delicate balance, isn’t it? I believe… I believe I would want to be comfortable. If the pain was unbearable, yes. Absolutely. I wouldn't want to suffer needlessly. As long as it was understood that the primary goal was to alleviate suffering, and not… to actively end my life. Is that… possible? I want to be clear on that point. I’m not seeking… assisted anything. Just… comfort. If pain relief necessitates a quicker passing, then so be it. But it shouldn’t be the intention. Does that make sense? I’m probably not phrasing this very well.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconti. You've articulated your wishes very precisely. We will document that your priority is pain management and comfort care, and that any medication used for that purpose is intended to alleviate suffering, not to hasten your death. We’ll make a note to clearly differentiate between palliative care focused on comfort and any discussion of end-of-life options. Now, are you familiar with the concept of a "Do Not Resuscitate" or DNR order?
PATIENT: Do Not Resuscitate… I believe I’ve heard that phrase somewhere. Is that… refusing CPR? If my heart stops? I… I’m not sure. I always assumed… wouldn’t doctors try to save me, regardless? It feels… strange to refuse life-saving measures. Is that… a common request? I apologize, I'm feeling rather overwhelmed now. This is all quite… unsettling.
DOCTOR: You’re not at all overwhelmed, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s perfectly natural to feel unsettled when discussing these topics. And you're right, it is unusual to consider refusing life-saving measures, which is why it’s important to be fully informed. A Do Not Resuscitate, or DNR, order is a legal document that instructs healthcare providers not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation – CPR – if your heart stops beating or you stop breathing. It’s often chosen by individuals who wish to avoid aggressive interventions that are unlikely to be successful or would significantly prolong suffering. Many people choose to have a DNR in place to ensure a peaceful passing, without the trauma of CPR. However, it is entirely your decision. It’s also important to note that a DNR only applies to CPR; other life-sustaining treatments would still be provided unless specifically excluded in your Advance Directive. Would you like to discuss the potential benefits and risks of having a DNR order?
PATIENT: A peaceful passing… That sounds… appealing, I confess. But… the thought of not being saved… it’s… frightening. What are the risks, you say? If I have a DNR, and then… then something happens, and I could have been saved? Would they… would they just let me go? I apologize, I’m probably asking foolish questions. It’s just… I’ve never considered this before. This feels… very final. Perhaps we should revisit the healthcare proxy… I feel I need someone to discuss this with. This is too much to process alone.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking foolish questions at all, Ms. Buoniconti. These are very important considerations, and it's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. You’re right; this is a lot to process. Let's address your concerns about a DNR. It's not about "letting you go"; it's about respecting your wishes if your heart stops beating and resuscitation is unlikely to be successful. Healthcare providers are still obligated to provide all other appropriate medical care, such as pain management, comfort care, and symptom relief. The decision to have a DNR is based on your overall health and prognosis, and it's always discussed with your healthcare team. If you were to have a DNR and then experience a cardiac arrest, providers would still assess the situation and provide appropriate care based on your condition. You are absolutely right to consider discussing this with someone you trust. Let's revisit the healthcare proxy. Perhaps identifying someone to share these thoughts with will make the process more comfortable. Do you have anyone in mind?
PATIENT: Anya… my sister. She’s a doctor, actually. A very practical woman. Sensible. Though, as I said, we haven’t spoken in some time. Several months, at least. I’m hesitant to… burden her with this, without reconnecting first. It feels… rude. Perhaps I should attempt to contact her. Before making any decisions. I need to… gauge her willingness to… participate. And frankly, I need to… rebuild that relationship. This feels… wrong, springing this on her after so long. I think… I think I’ll postpone discussing any Advance Directives or POLST forms for now. I need to speak with Anya first. Perhaps then, I’ll have a clearer understanding of my wishes. And someone to share the burden with. Is that… acceptable?
DOCTOR: That is absolutely acceptable, Ms. Buoniconti. In fact, it sounds like a very wise decision. Reconnecting with your sister and discussing these matters with her before making any choices is a wonderful idea. It’s important to feel comfortable and supported in these discussions, and having someone you trust to share the burden with is invaluable. We can certainly postpone any further discussion of Advance Directives and POLST forms until you’ve had a chance to speak with Anya. In the meantime, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that will be all. You’ve been very patient and understanding. Thank you. I appreciate your time and… your reassurance. I feel… a little less overwhelmed now. Perhaps I’ll schedule another appointment once I’ve spoken with Anya. Thank you again, Doctor Abady. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm glad I could help, and I commend you for taking the time to consider these important matters. Please do schedule another appointment when you’ve had a chance to speak with your sister. I'm here to support you in any way I can. Have a good day as well, Ms. Buoniconti. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
