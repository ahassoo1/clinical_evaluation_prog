DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara, welcome. I'm Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… troubling. I find I am… forgetting things. Small things, usually. But more often now. And my blood pressure… it has been high for some time, the doctor before… he said it was something to watch. I do not like this feeling.
DOCTOR: “Something to watch,” yes. Convenient, isn’t it?
PATIENT: It was… not very helpful, Doctor. I prefer knowing what to watch for. And what it means. I am a manager, you see. Properties, community… many details. I need to remember things. It is… important. Is this the high blood pressure? Is it making me forget?
DOCTOR: A manager, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Several properties in the city. And the homeowner’s association for Willow Creek. It is… a great responsibility. People depend on me. But lately… I have had to ask my assistant to repeat things. Appointments, requests… even names, sometimes. It is very… unsettling. I do not wish to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's not jump to conclusions. Memory issues can be related to blood pressure, certainly, but there are… many other possibilities. We'll need to get a good history. First, how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… difficult to say precisely, Doctor. Perhaps six months? It started small. Misplacing keys, forgetting a small task. But in the last two months, it has become… noticeable. I had to ask my assistant three times yesterday for the name of the plumber. Three times! And I just spoke with him last week. It is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Six months… and worsening. Alright. Now, are these memory lapses accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No dizziness, no headaches. I have been… more tired, perhaps. But I always work very hard. It is difficult to say if that is new. And sometimes… I feel a little… confused. Not lost, exactly. But… like my thoughts are slow. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: “Slow thoughts,” hmm. And is this confusion constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It is not… all the time. Usually in the afternoons, I think. When I am most tired. And when I am trying to do many things at once. I have many responsibilities, you see. Willow Creek has a meeting next week and the budget needs finalising. It is… stressful. Does stress cause this? I have always managed, but… now I worry.
DOCTOR: Stress doesn’t cause things, Ms. Alvara. It exacerbates them. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the blood pressure. I have always been… strong. Healthy. I eat well, mostly. I try to get some exercise, but my work… it keeps me very busy. No other diagnoses. I do not take any medications, except sometimes a small pill for my nerves when the Willow Creek board is… difficult. But very rarely.
DOCTOR: And what is this pill for your nerves?
PATIENT: Oh. It is… a mild tranquilizer, Doctor. My previous physician prescribed it. For anxiety. The board… they can be… demanding. I only take it when absolutely necessary. Perhaps once a month, or less. It helps me to… focus. And to sleep. I do not believe it is causing the memory problems. But I will tell you everything. It is called… Diazepam, I think. A small blue pill.
DOCTOR: Diazepam, yes. And how long have you been taking that, even intermittently?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… perhaps five years now? The physician… he said it was okay, for occasional use. I do not take it regularly. Only when I am very stressed. The Willow Creek annual meeting, for example. Or dealing with difficult homeowners. It is… a small comfort. But I do not wish to be dependent on it. It is… unsettling to think of relying on a pill.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Alvara, occasional use for five years is… less than ideal. Now, family history. Are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer’s in your family?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question, Doctor. My mother… she became forgetful in her later years. But we thought it was just age. She lived to be ninety-two. And my father… he had many health problems. I do not recall specifically any diagnosis of… dementia. But it was a long time ago. And my family… we did not talk much about such things. It was… considered a private matter. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: It’s… something. Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment. Just to get a baseline. It won’t be extensive, but it's a starting point. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I have always been… robust. I can proceed. I understand the need for the examination. And I hope it will give us some answers. I am… anxious to understand what is happening. The forgetting… it is frightening.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat… Let's start with your blood pressure. 150 over 90… not surprising. Lungs clear, heart rate slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and some basic cognitive function. Just follow my instructions. Close your eyes and extend your arms.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I am ready. Please proceed. I will do my best to follow your instructions. I just wish… I knew what was causing this. It makes it difficult to concentrate. Even on simple tasks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you recite the alphabet backwards for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Backwards? That is… challenging. Let me think… Z… Y… X… W… V… U… T… S… R… Q… P… Oh dear. This is… difficult. I am usually very good with… words. But backwards… It is… slipping my mind. I apologize, Doctor. I seem to be… losing my train of thought.
DOCTOR: Yes. Well, that’s… not unexpected. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your current medications and daily routine. Just to get a fuller picture. What time do you usually wake up in the morning?
PATIENT: Usually… around six o’clock, Doctor. I have many responsibilities, you see. The properties need attention. And Willow Creek… there are always issues. I like to start the day early. To be prepared. Although… lately, I have been… more tired. It takes longer to wake up. And I sometimes… forget things. Like where I put my glasses. Or the name of a client. It is… unsettling. But I manage. I always have.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fatigue, memory lapses, and difficulty with simple tasks. The Diazepam, the anxiety… It's a complex picture, Ms. Alvara. I'm going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin B12 level. We also need to rule out any underlying infections. And I'm going to recommend an MRI of the brain to get a better look at what's going on. It's important to be thorough.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… necessary, Doctor? It sounds… serious. And expensive. I do not have… insurance. What are you looking for? Is it… something terrible? I just want to understand what is happening. And to… regain my memory. It is… frightening to feel myself slipping. I manage so many things. I cannot afford to… forget.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, I understand your concerns. An MRI is not necessarily indicative of something terrible, but it is the most effective way to rule out any structural issues. And, frankly, given your symptoms, it's a prudent step. As for the cost, we can discuss payment options with the billing department. We have programs available for uninsured patients. Now, let’s be realistic. While the MRI is pending, I'm going to recommend you immediately stop taking the Diazepam. It's likely contributing to your cognitive impairment. And I’d like you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and the MRI. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stop the Diazepam… immediately? But… the board! They are… difficult. They become very… agitated without it. And I have the annual meeting next month. It will be… chaos. But… if you think it is necessary. Very well. I will stop taking it. And the meeting… I will manage. I always do. Two weeks… for the results? I understand. What about… something to help me remember in the meantime? Is there anything? Perhaps a… supplement? I just… I cannot afford to forget. It is… my livelihood.
DOCTOR: Supplements are largely ineffective, Ms. Alvara. And frankly, relying on them is a waste of time and money. The most effective thing you can do right now is to minimize stress and focus on simple tasks. Keep a detailed calendar, write everything down, and ask for help when you need it. And avoid situations that trigger anxiety. As for the board meeting, perhaps it’s time to delegate some responsibility. I’m also going to write you a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion. It's always good to get another perspective. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: A neurologist… another doctor? It seems… a great deal. And the board… they do not allow delegation. They insist on being involved in every… minute detail. It is… exhausting. No. I do not think I have any other questions, Doctor. I just… I hope you are right. I hope it is nothing serious. I just want my memory back. Thank you, Doctor. I will schedule the appointments. .
