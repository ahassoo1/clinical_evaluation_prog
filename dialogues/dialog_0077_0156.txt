DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Pirl, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good. I’ve been having a lot of diarrhea lately. Honestly, it's been going on for a while, but it just… won’t stop. I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like ages.
DOCTOR: I see. “A while” can be quite vague, unfortunately. Do you recall if anything specific happened around the time it began?
PATIENT: Ugh, you're right, I'm terrible with dates. Let me think… no, not really. Nothing jumps out. I… I think it maybe started after a particularly stressful week at work? But honestly, work is always stressful, so that probably doesn't narrow it down much. I don't know if that's helpful. I'm sorry.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Jase. It’s common for stress to affect the digestive system. And it's perfectly normal not to recall the precise date. Let’s try to get a better understanding of the diarrhea itself. Could you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Okay, um… well, it’s… watery, obviously. Sorry, that’s probably too much information. It’s… frequent. Like, several times a day. And… sometimes it's just… urgent. I have to go right away, you know? And it's… not always just water. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but I haven’t really… looked closely. I feel bad even talking about this. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Jase. You’re in a safe space here, and describing these details is essential for me to understand what’s happening. It’s much better to be thorough. Frequent, watery stools, especially with urgency, certainly warrants investigation. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood… I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen, anyway. I usually just… try to get it over with quickly, if you know what I mean. Mucus… maybe? It’s hard to say. It’s kind of… slippery? Is that mucus? I really don't pay that much attention, I'm embarrassed to admit. I feel like I should be, but it's just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jase. It’s perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable discussing these things. Slippery stools can indeed indicate the presence of mucus. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Um… yeah, actually. I’ve been really tired lately. More tired than usual, even for me. And… my stomach cramps a lot. Not constantly, but it comes and goes. It’s like… really bad gas pains, but… lower down? And sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't actually been sick. Oh! And I’ve been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. It could just be from not eating much, though, because my stomach feels bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, cramping, nausea, and unintentional weight loss… that gives me a clearer picture. Now, have you had a fever or noticed any blood in your vomit?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And no blood in my vomit, thankfully. Just… the diarrhea. It’s mostly just that, really. It's just… it feels like it’s never-ending. And it’s really exhausting, to be honest. It’s hard to even go to work sometimes, because I'm worried about… you know. I hope this isn't something really bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jase. It’s good that you’re taking this seriously. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions or allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… well, my doctor told me a while ago I might have something with my stomach. Something about… inflammation? And something about not being able to eat certain foods properly? He sent me to a specialist, but I… I never really followed up. I was really busy at work, and it didn't seem that bad at the time. He mentioned something about IBD… or celiac? I don't remember which. And… I have a slight allergy to penicillin, I think. It just gives me a rash. That’s about it, I think. I’m really bad with remembering medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I see. Potential inflammation and a possible diagnosis of IBD or celiac disease are important pieces of information. And a penicillin allergy, noted. Have you taken any medications recently, including over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Not really. Just some paracetamol for headaches sometimes. And… I tried some anti-diarrheal stuff from the pharmacy a few times, but it didn’t really help. It just… stopped working after a while. Honestly, I’m starting to think nothing works. I mostly just try to stick to bland foods, like toast and rice.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any gastrointestinal issues – like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother, on my mum's side, she had a really bad stomach. I think she had something… autoimmune? She was always going to the doctor. And… I think my uncle had something similar, but I'm not sure. Nobody really talks about it much. It was kind of a sensitive topic. That’s about all I know, honestly. My family isn’t very good at talking about health problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families to avoid discussing such topics. Now, let’s briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't smoke. I don’t really drink alcohol either, maybe a glass of wine at Christmas sometimes. And definitely no drugs. I’m really not into any of that. I mostly just like to relax at home with my husband after work. It's not a very exciting life, but it’s peaceful.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, Jase, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on, you know? It's just been so long, and I'm really tired of feeling sick. Do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Try to relax and breathe normally. Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Your bowel sounds are slightly hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. There doesn't appear to be any significant masses or organomegaly. I’m also going to check your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is 37.2 degrees Celsius, which is within the normal range. Your blood pressure is 128/80 mmHg, also within the normal range. Based on this initial examination, I suspect we need to investigate this further. I recommend we run some blood tests to check for inflammation, infection, and to rule out celiac disease. We also need a stool sample to rule out any bacterial or parasitic infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is necessary. Blood tests and a stool sample, okay. Will the blood tests tell us if it’s the IBD thing? And… what if it is something bad? I’m just… worried. It's silly, I know, but I get anxious about medical stuff easily.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all, Jase. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious in this situation. The blood tests will help us assess the level of inflammation in your body and can provide clues about potential underlying conditions, including IBD. They will also help rule out other possibilities. The stool sample is important to identify any infectious causes of your diarrhea. If it turns out to be IBD, it's important to remember that it’s a manageable condition with appropriate treatment. There are various medications available to help control the inflammation and alleviate your symptoms. We’ll discuss all your options thoroughly if that is the diagnosis. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. I'll give you a requisition form for the blood tests and a container for the stool sample. Please try to collect the stool sample as soon as possible and bring it back to the clinic within 24 hours. We'll get the results sent to me, and I'll contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood tests and a stool sample. Within 24 hours, right. I can do that. And you’ll call me with the results? And… what should I do in the meantime? Should I keep eating bland foods? Or is there anything I should avoid completely? I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll call you with the results as soon as they become available. And in the meantime, it’s best to continue with the bland diet – toast, rice, bananas, and clear liquids. Avoid dairy products, caffeine, alcohol, sugary drinks, and fatty or fried foods. These can all exacerbate your symptoms. Also, stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day. It's important to listen to your body. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here are the forms and the container. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Bland foods, stay hydrated, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. I can remember that. Thank you, Dr. Pirl. You’ve been very helpful. I just… hope it’s not anything too serious. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I understand your concerns, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon.
