DOCTOR: Good morning, Mande. My name is Dr. Solero. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Solero. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and…yellow, for a few days now, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It’s a long story, but that’s the gist of it.
DOCTOR: Weakness and yellowing… and it seems to be connected to eating fava beans. That is interesting. Can you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can’t do things, but I get tired really easily. Even just walking up the stairs leaves me breathless. And it’s not a muscle weakness, more like… just drained, you know? Like my battery is always low. It started a couple of days after I had a big plate of stew with fava beans in it. I love stew, so I had quite a lot. Then I started feeling sick, and noticed my skin looking… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the weakness is more of a general fatigue, not a specific muscle issue, and it started a couple of days after a fairly large serving of fava bean stew. And you've noticed a change in your skin color. Can you describe that skin change a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s…yellowish. It’s hard to explain. Not like a bright yellow, but a sort of…pale, sickly yellow. I noticed it first on my eyes, actually – my whites looked a bit off-color. Then I realized my skin was looking the same. My husband pointed it out, too, and he's usually not one to notice these things! It’s definitely more noticeable now than it was a couple of days ago. I'm a little worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – what we call jaundice – is something we definitely need to investigate. And the connection to the fava beans is very important. Before we go further, let’s go through some basic questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing, but nothing serious. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life, really. No major surgeries or anything. I’ve always been careful with what I eat, and I try to get enough sleep. I did have a bit of trouble with my gallbladder a few years ago, but they said it wasn’t anything to worry about. Just a little inflammation. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a healthy history overall, with childhood illnesses and some past inflammation of the gallbladder. That could be relevant, so thank you for mentioning it. Was that inflammation treated?
PATIENT: Yes, it was. They did some tests and said it was mild, probably just from a rich diet. They told me to cut back on fatty foods and it cleared up on its own. No surgery, no medication, just dietary changes. It was about five years ago, I think. I’ve been pretty good about watching what I eat since then, until the stew, of course. I just really love stew.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mande. It's good to hear it resolved on its own. And no worries at all about the stew! Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of anemia, liver problems, or unusual reactions to food?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… My mother had some trouble with feeling tired all the time, but the doctor just said it was “women’s trouble” back then, so I don't really know if that was anemia or not. It was a long time ago. My father was pretty healthy, as far as I know, but he died young, from a heart attack. And I have a brother, but we haven't spoken in years. I don’t know anything about his health. As far as food reactions go… no, not that I’m aware of. My husband doesn’t have any allergies either.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some fatigue in your mother, but nothing definitive, and a healthy father who passed away young. And no known food allergies in the family. Now, let's briefly touch on your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been a bit of a health nut, so I’ve never touched a cigarette. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that’s it. I try to stay active, too. I enjoy gardening, and I go for walks when the weather is nice. I’m retired now, so I have plenty of time for those things.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mande. Staying active and healthy is excellent. And just to complete the picture, do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a multivitamin, really. I take one every morning, just to be on the safe side. And sometimes, if my joints are bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that’s not very often. Maybe once or twice a month. I don't take anything else, I promise. I try to avoid medications as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and occasional ibuprofen for joint pain. Thank you for that information. Now, Mande, given your symptoms – the weakness, the yellowing of your skin and eyes, and the connection to the fava beans – I'm concerned about a possible condition called Favism. It's a genetic condition where people are deficient in an enzyme, and eating fava beans can cause a breakdown of red blood cells. To confirm this, I'd like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Favism… that sounds serious. A genetic condition… I see. Well, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. I want to know what’s going on. A physical exam and blood tests sound fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm a little scared, to be honest, but I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mande. It’s good to be proactive, and we’ll get to the bottom of this. Let’s start with the physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and examine your skin more closely. It won't take long. Take a deep breath for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay. I feel a little silly, but go ahead. I'm ready. I'm just hoping it's nothing too serious. I have a gardening club meeting next week, and I really don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, good. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Again, take deep breaths in and out for me. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. Let me know if anything feels painful. Do you feel any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. That doesn’t hurt. Ooh, maybe just a little there, on the right side. It’s not painful exactly, more like… a dull ache. It’s been there on and off for a couple of days, actually. I thought it was just indigestion.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the right upper quadrant. That’s good to know. Now, let's take a closer look at your skin and eyes. Yes, there’s definitely some jaundice present in your sclera. And I can see a slight yellowing of your skin as well. Your skin feels normal in terms of texture. Okay, Mande, based on the physical exam and your history, I’m even more concerned about Favism, or another liver-related issue. The jaundice is the most concerning finding. To get a definitive diagnosis, I’m going to order a complete blood count , a liver function test , and a G6PD enzyme assay to check for the enzyme deficiency. Would you like me to explain any of these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I don’t really understand all that medical terminology. What exactly is a complete blood count, and what does a liver function test tell you? And what about this G6PD thing? Is that a painful test? I'm a little nervous, I admit.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous, and I want to make sure you understand everything. A complete blood count, or CBC, is a simple blood test that checks the levels of different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can tell us if your red blood cell count is low, which could be a sign of Favism. A liver function test, or LFT, checks the levels of certain enzymes and proteins in your blood. These levels can indicate whether your liver is damaged or inflamed. And finally, the G6PD enzyme assay is the most important test. G6PD is an enzyme that protects your red blood cells. If you have a deficiency in this enzyme, your red blood cells can be easily damaged, especially after eating fava beans. It’s a simple blood draw, and it doesn’t cause any pain beyond the usual pinch of a needle. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that explains it much better, thank you. So, basically, they’re looking to see if my red blood cells are okay, if my liver is working properly, and if I’m missing that enzyme thing. Fava beans mess up my red blood cells if I don't have the enzyme… that sounds about right. And if it is Favism… what happens then? Is there a cure? Is it serious? I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Mande. It’s good to be informed. If it is Favism, there is no cure, unfortunately. However, it’s very manageable. The main treatment is strict avoidance of fava beans and other triggers, such as certain medications and infections. The severity of Favism varies. Some people have mild symptoms, while others can experience more serious complications, such as anemia and jaundice. We’d monitor your blood counts regularly and manage any symptoms as needed. It's important to be aware of triggers and to seek medical attention promptly if you experience any symptoms. In the meantime, I’m going to order these blood tests. I’ll also want you to refrain from eating any fava beans or products containing fava beans until we get the results back. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials that I should be aware of before we draw the blood?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. And okay, no more fava beans. That’s going to be hard, I have to admit. I really do love stew. But it’s worth it if it means figuring out what’s wrong. So, where do we go to get the blood drawn? And how long will it take to get the results back? I have that gardening club meeting next week, and I was hoping to be feeling better by then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We have a lab right here in the clinic, so you won’t have to go anywhere else. The phlebotomist is ready to draw the blood now, and it should only take a few minutes. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or dark urine, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Solero. You’ve been very patient and helpful. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on, and what we’re going to do about it. Let's get the blood drawn, and hopefully, we'll have some answers soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. Let's head over to the lab then. I'll let the phlebotomist know to expect you. Please, come this way.
