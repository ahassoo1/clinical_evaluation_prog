DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Oriley, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, I find it rather… unnecessary to state my name as if confirming a simple detail. I assure you, I am who I say I am. Now, let’s not dawdle. I have a rather important afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Efficiency is important, I suppose. Though verifying information is simply standard procedure. Now, tell me – in your own words, and try to be concise – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Concise, you say? Very well. I require a… certification, as you undoubtedly know. It’s for my profession. Something to do with ensuring I can continue… practicing. Honestly, the details are quite fuzzy. Bureaucracy, really. I simply need the stamp of approval, whatever tests are required, and then I can be on my way. It’s rather irritating, to be frank. I’ve been doing this for decades.
DOCTOR: A certification… for your profession. Right. And what is your profession, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Really? You don’t know? One would think a clinic would have some record. It's in the… healthcare field. Technical work, of a sort. It's not important, truthfully. Just something I do. Though, it requires… regular assessments. To ensure competence, naturally. I wouldn't want to be… lacking. Now, is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: It appears you've been seen here before, Mr. Oriley, but the notes are… surprisingly vague. "Technical work" doesn't exactly narrow it down. Are you a technician of some kind?
PATIENT: “Of some kind”? Really, must you be so imprecise? It’s… specialized. Involving instruments, calibrations… things beyond the understanding of most, I assure you. Think of it as ensuring things function correctly. That is all that is necessary for you to know. And frankly, I resent the implication that my profession requires… explanation. It’s rather demeaning. Now, can we proceed with the examination? I’m losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with a basic physical exam, then. It will help me determine what tests, if any, are needed. Now, have you been experiencing any recent changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age? One expects a few… minor inconveniences. A creak here, a groan there. Nothing of consequence. My hearing is… adequate, I suppose. Though perhaps not what it once was. And my vision… well, it’s sufficient for reading the newspaper, which is all that truly matters. No, no significant changes. Don't bother with frivolous questions, doctor. Let’s simply get this over with.
DOCTOR: Right. We'll start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, actually. And your breathing sounds… slightly wheezy. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: Wheezy? I assure you, my constitution is perfectly sound. A slightly elevated heart rate is merely… anticipation, I suspect. This whole process is rather unnerving, you know. And a cough? Perhaps a tickle in my throat. Nothing to concern oneself with. It’s likely just dust. I spend a considerable amount of time… amongst equipment, as I mentioned. Now, are we nearing a conclusion? I have a rather important appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is quite high, Mr. Oriley. Significantly higher than it should be, even accounting for… anticipation. And given your history – or lack thereof, frankly – and these findings, I’m going to need to run some tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG, at the very least.
PATIENT: Tests? Now you want tests? After dismissing my profession and questioning my constitution? This is preposterous! I came here for a certification, not a complete overhaul of my health! I assure you, my blood pressure is perfectly normal when I am not subjected to… this indignity. And an EKG? Really, doctor, this is excessive. I suspect you are simply attempting to inflate your billing. I shall require a detailed explanation of these… unnecessary procedures before I consent to anything. And frankly, I’m beginning to question the competence of this entire establishment. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, I am obligated to ensure your well-being. Your blood pressure is dangerously high, and ignoring it could have serious consequences. These tests are not optional, they are necessary. If you refuse, I will be forced to recommend you seek care elsewhere. And as for inflating my billing… that is a rather unprofessional accusation. Do you consent to the tests, or shall I prepare a referral form?
