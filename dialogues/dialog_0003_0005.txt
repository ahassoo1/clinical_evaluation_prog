DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, let’s try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Yackey. It is a pleasure to meet you. Concise is fine with me. I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice. I believe we are here to make sure I am fit for the Willow Creek facility?
DOCTOR: Yes, the facility. Right. A pre-admission evaluation, as it were. To ascertain your suitability. Frankly, some of these facilities… well, let's just say preventative measures are often necessary. Now, could you tell me, in your own words, why you believe you require this evaluation?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve been living on my own for quite some time now. A very long time, actually. And while I manage… mostly… my daughter, bless her heart, thinks it’s time I had a little help. She worries. She says I’m getting on in years and that Willow Creek would take a load off her mind. I don’t mind a bit of company, and if it eases her worries, I am happy to oblige. It’s more her insistence than my own need, truthfully. But I understand her concerns.
DOCTOR: Daughter’s concerns, naturally. Very common. And how long have you been “managing” independently, as you put it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… since my wife passed, nearly thirty years ago. Thirty-two, to be exact. August of '93. I’ve kept the house up, the garden growing, baked bread for the town… all the usual things. I’ve always been a practical man. A man who does for himself. But lately… well, things have become a bit more… taxing.
DOCTOR: “Taxing.” An imprecise term, Mr. Tkac. Can you be specific?
PATIENT: Specific… yes, of course. Well, the stairs, for one. They aren't as forgiving as they used to be. I find myself holding onto the railing more often. And the garden, while I still enjoy it, requires a good deal more rest afterwards. Simple things, really. But they add up. And my baking… I’ve dropped a loaf or two lately. Burned a batch of cookies. Small mishaps, but…uncharacteristic. I pride myself on my baking. It’s always been a comfort.
DOCTOR: Right. So, diminished stamina, some balance concerns, and… culinary imperfections. Do you experience any dizziness, weakness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No dizziness, Doctor, not at all. And my vision is… well, it's not what it used to be, but I wear glasses. I’ve had them for years, and the prescription is up to date. Weakness… sometimes my hands feel a bit stiff in the mornings, but a little kneading usually works that right out. Mostly it’s just… slower. Everything is slower now. I used to be able to whip up a batch of bread dough before you could say ‘Lakota’—now it takes a bit longer.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Changes in memory… Now, that’s a tricky one. I don't think so. I can recall details from decades ago perfectly well, dates, names, events… but sometimes I misplace things. My glasses, for example. Or where I put the flour. And occasionally… I struggle to recall a name right off the bat, a name I know I should know. But it always comes to me eventually. It's not a complete loss, you understand. It’s more like… a slight delay. I am still quite sharp, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: "Sharp." Very subjective, Mr. Tkac. Let’s move on. Any history of falls, even minor ones, in the past year?
PATIENT: No falls, Doctor, thank goodness. Not a single one. I am careful, always have been. I watch my step. My daughter worries about me being stubborn, and perhaps she is right. But I maintain my independence as long as I am able. It's important to me. I tripped once, about six months ago, over a rug in the hallway. But I caught myself on the table. No harm done. Just a bit shaken. It was a silly rug, really. Should have been removed years ago.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions—diabetes, heart trouble, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I take a small pill for my blood pressure. Just a little thing, the doctor prescribed it a few years back. Nothing major. And I have a touch of arthritis in my hands, the kind that comes with age, I suppose. It flares up sometimes, especially in the cold weather. But I manage it with a bit of heat and some liniment. Other than that… I've been remarkably healthy, all things considered. I’ve always eaten well, stayed active, and avoided… well, foolishness. A simple life, Doctor. That’s what I’ve always believed in.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There we are. A little slower these days, as I mentioned, but steady enough, I believe. Is there anything specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to check your vital signs, then assess your balance and reflexes. Please, follow my instructions as closely as you can. First, I'll check your blood pressure. 148 over 82… not terrible, but elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s see… Heart sounds are normal, clear lung sounds bilaterally. Now, I want you to close your eyes and extend your arms straight out to the sides. Noticeable tremor in both hands. Moderate. Now, can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger with yours?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There we are. A bit wobbly, perhaps, but I managed it. Was that satisfactory? It’s a bit disconcerting to close one’s eyes, you know. Throws one off balance. But I did my best.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, I want you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes again. Don’t move. Minimal sway, but present. Alright. That’s sufficient for now. Please, have a seat. We’ll review your chart and discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is good to know what you are looking for. This is all very thorough, I must say. I appreciate your diligence. So, what do you think? Is Willow Creek a good fit, or should I be expecting a stern lecture about stubborn old men? I confess, I’m rather curious to hear your assessment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tkac, your physical assessment reveals some expected age-related changes—mild tremor, slightly elevated blood pressure, some balance impairment. However, there are also cognitive concerns, albeit subtle. Your ability to recall recent events is… less consistent than expected, and your performance on the Romberg test—balance with eyes closed—was less than optimal. Based on these findings, I believe a stay at Willow Creek would be… prudent. It’s not a matter of “stubbornness,” Mr. Tkac. It’s about ensuring your safety and well-being. A supervised environment, with assistance available, would mitigate potential risks. We will also need to rule out other potential causes for your cognitive decline, which I will discuss further with your daughter. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Cognitive decline… that is a rather alarming term, Doctor. I confess, I hadn't considered that a possibility. I thought it was merely… a bit of absentmindedness, the natural consequence of growing old. I understand your concerns about my safety, of course. And I trust your judgment. But… would a trial period be possible? Perhaps a week or two at Willow Creek, to see how I adapt? I would not want to be a burden, or a cause for undue worry. And I would like to maintain some semblance of independence, if possible. Could we discuss that option?
DOCTOR: A trial period is… permissible, Mr. Tkac. However, it will be contingent upon your daughter’s agreement and a thorough assessment by the facility’s staff. We’ll need to discuss your medical history in detail with them, and they will conduct their own evaluations. I must stress, though, that Willow Creek is best suited for individuals who require a certain level of assistance with daily living. If your cognitive decline progresses, or if your safety is compromised, a longer-term stay may be necessary. I’ll prepare a referral form and a summary of your examination findings. I'll also contact your daughter to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything… for now. Thank you for your time, and for your honest assessment. And please, extend my gratitude to your staff. This has been… enlightening, to say the least. I will speak with my daughter, and we will proceed as you suggest. I appreciate your diligence, Doctor. Perhaps… perhaps it is time to accept a little help. One last question, if you don’t mind… do they have a good baker at Willow Creek? It’s a small thing, but a good loaf of bread can make all the difference.
DOCTOR: A baker… Honestly.
