DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh… good morning. My husband… he make appointment for me. Something about… learning? I forget. I work with metal, you know. All day. Very hard work. Not much time for… things.
DOCTOR: “Learning,” alright. And you work with metal… a trade, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes! Sheet metal. Very strong metal. I cut it, bend it… make things. Roofs, mostly. Very important work. Not easy. Lots of… lifting. My back… sometimes it hurts. But I keep working. We need money.
DOCTOR: I understand needing to work. But "sometimes it hurts" is rather vague, Ms. Fontanazza. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Pain…? Uh… it’s like… old. Like it’s always been there a little. And when I bend a lot… or lift… it gets… sharper. Not like a broken bone sharp. More like… a bad ache. Lower back. It’s… annoying. I take… pills sometimes. The red ones. My mother give them to me.
DOCTOR: "The red ones"… Do you happen to know the name of those pills, Ms. Fontanazza?
PATIENT: Uh… no. I don’t think so. Small bottle. Red cap. My husband get them for me sometimes too. He… he know more about these things. I just… take them when it hurts. They… help a little. Mostly I just try to ignore it and keep working. It's… a job. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, ignoring pain isn’t usually the best course of action, Ms. Fontanazza. We need to understand what's going on. Let's start with a bit more detail about this pain. Does it radiate anywhere – down your legs, perhaps?
PATIENT: Radiate…? You mean… go somewhere else? Sometimes. Down my… left leg. Not all the way to my foot. Just… the back of my leg. Like… a tingling. And… sometimes I feel it in my… butt. Sorry. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. A lot. When I stand for too long. Or lift heavy things. Which is… all day.
DOCTOR: So, pain in your lower back radiating down the back of your left leg, accompanied by tingling. Worse with standing and lifting. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Years, I think. Maybe… five years? Hard to say. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s okay. Sometimes it’s really bad. I just… get used to it. I don't complain. My husband work hard too. We both do. We don’t have time for… doctors. Unless… he make the appointment. Like now.
DOCTOR: Five years is a considerable time to live with pain, Ms. Fontanazza. Ignoring it for that long could lead to further complications. Now, besides the pain and tingling, have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness…? Uh… sometimes. When I’m really tired. My legs feel… heavy. Like I can’t lift them very high. Especially at the end of the day. But I just… rest. And then it’s okay. I don’t… fall or anything. Just… tired. A lot. Maybe that’s just from working so hard. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any numbness or changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Bowel… and bladder…? What do you mean? I… go to the bathroom normally. Everything is… okay down there. I don’t… leak or anything. Sorry if that’s… too much information. My husband always says I don’t need to tell the doctor everything. But he make me come here, so… I’m trying. It's just… I don’t understand what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: It’s important, Ms. Fontanazza. Sometimes, nerve issues in the back can affect bowel and bladder control. So, to be clear: Have you noticed any difficulty starting or stopping urination, or any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, or incontinence?
PATIENT: No! No changes. Everything is… normal. I eat… regular. I go to the bathroom… regular. I don’t… leak. I don’t… struggle. My husband always say I eat too much sugar, but… that's it. I don’t understand why you’re asking so many questions. This is… uncomfortable. Can I go now? He say it’s just… learning. Not… this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand your discomfort. However, it’s important for me to gather a complete picture of your health. Before we proceed further, let me quickly review your medical history. I see here you haven’t had a primary care physician listed. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Uh… no. I don’t think so. I eat… everything. Sometimes my skin gets itchy… from the metal dust. But that’s… normal. I wear gloves. Most of the time. My mother say I’m strong. I don’t get sick easily. I just… work. And then I rest. That’s all. Is this… finished? I have to go home. My husband is waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your lack of a medical history and your reluctance to provide details, a full diagnosis is difficult at this point. However, based on your description, it sounds like you may be experiencing lower back pain with possible radiculopathy – irritation of a nerve in your lower back. We need to rule out anything serious. I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination… table? Lie down…? I… I don’t like hospitals. Or… doctors touching me. I just… want to learn. My husband say it’s for safety. But… touching? Is it… necessary? Can't you just… tell me what to do? I work with my hands all day. I’m very strong. I don't need… examining.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, the physical examination is necessary to determine the cause of your pain and ensure there are no serious underlying issues. It’s not a matter of whether you need it, it’s a standard part of a medical evaluation. I assure you, it will be brief and professional. I will explain everything as I go. If you absolutely refuse, I can only offer very limited advice, and I strongly advise you to reconsider. Now, will you please allow me to examine your back?
PATIENT: … Fine. But be quick. And… gentle. I don’t like… poking. My husband will be very mad if I’m in more pain. He made this appointment, so… you have to be careful. I trust his judgement. But… I don’t trust doctors. They always… touch. Just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie face down on the examination table. I’m going to palpate your lower back to assess for tenderness and muscle spasms. Tell me if you feel any sharp pain or discomfort at any point. Hmm… there is definite tenderness here, along the lumbar spine. And some muscle guarding – your muscles are quite tense. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ouch! That hurts! Not… much. It’s hard. My back… it’s always tight. I can’t… reach my toes. Not even close. It feels… stuck. Like something is… blocking me. And… it hurts more when I try. Please… be gentle. I have to work tomorrow. I can’t be… broken.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I see. That's enough for now. Now, let’s try some neurological tests. I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Hmm… your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes… I can feel it. It's… tingly. Not like… pain, just… a buzzing. And… colder. My left leg always feels colder than my right. Even in the summer. It's… annoying. Is something wrong? Please… just tell me if I need to… stop working. That's all I want to know.
DOCTOR: The sensation is slightly diminished in your left leg, and you report a sensation of coldness. Given your symptoms – lower back pain, limited range of motion, radicular pain down your left leg, diminished sensation, and tingling – it is likely you have a lumbar disc herniation or spinal stenosis impinging on a nerve root. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we need imaging – an MRI of your lumbar spine. This is the only way to definitively determine the cause of your pain and guide appropriate treatment.
PATIENT: MRI…? What is… MRI? Is that… more touching? More… machines? My husband said something about… pictures. But… I don’t like machines. And… if it’s touching, I don’t want it. Is it… expensive? We don’t have much money. Can’t you just… give me something for the pain? Like… stronger pills? I just want to work. Please. No machines. No touching. Just… fix me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, an MRI is a painless imaging test that uses magnetic waves to create detailed pictures of your spine. It doesn’t involve any touching in the sense of a physical examination. You will lie still on a table while the machine takes the pictures. It’s not expensive in the grand scheme of things, but it does have a cost. I understand your reluctance, but without an accurate diagnosis, I cannot provide appropriate treatment. Simply giving you stronger pills would be irresponsible and could mask a serious underlying problem. It's possible the pain is a minor muscle strain, but based on your symptoms, I need to rule out something more significant. I can write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever and muscle relaxant to help manage your symptoms in the meantime. However, I strongly recommend you schedule an MRI as soon as possible. I can provide you with a list of affordable imaging centers in the area. If you're unable to afford it, we can discuss options for financial assistance. But please, let’s not ignore this problem. It’s not going to go away on its own. Do you understand?
PATIENT: …Pictures. Okay. If it’s just… pictures. No touching. My husband will be mad if I keep complaining. He say I’m strong. But… I need to work. Okay. Pictures. And… pills. But… please, write down the names. So I can tell my husband. He knows… everything. And… the places for the pictures. Affordable… you said? Please. Just… make it easy. I don’t want any trouble. And… is the machine loud? I don’t like loud noises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Yes, the machine is rather loud, but we can provide you with earplugs. I'm prescribing you Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain and Cyclobenzaprine 10mg at bedtime for muscle relaxation. Please take these as directed. Here’s the list of affordable imaging centers. I’ve included their phone numbers and addresses. I also wrote down the names of the medications and the dosage instructions. The imaging center will likely require a referral from me, so I’ll fax that over to them once you schedule an appointment. And please, if your symptoms worsen at any time – increased pain, weakness, numbness, or bowel/bladder changes – seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: … No. I think… that’s everything. Pictures. Pills. Husband will know… what to do. Thank you. I… need to go. Work tomorrow. Very early. Tell your mother… thank you too. For… everything.
