DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Hainley. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Right, well, it's my bruising. It's gotten…worse, I guess. I’m on something for my blood, and I keep getting these big bruises just from, like, bumping into things. It's not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising that's getting worse even with medication… that's certainly something we need to look into. You said you’re on something for your blood… could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s a little orange pill. Warfarin, I think? The doctor back home – I just moved here – started me on it after I had a funny turn. Something about blood clots, but I honestly didn't really listen properly, I was just happy to feel better. I’ve been taking it for…oh, maybe six months now? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Six months… okay. And you said a funny turn?
PATIENT: Yeah, like I was really dizzy and short of breath. It happened out of nowhere. I ended up in the hospital for a couple of days, they did some tests, and then my old doctor put me on the Warfarin. Everything was fine for a while, then these bruises started appearing. At first, it was just little ones, but now…well, I showed up with a new one on my arm this morning, and it’s pretty big. I didn’t even do anything!
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness, shortness of breath, then bruising… Right. And you haven’t had any falls or injuries that you recall?
PATIENT: No, definitely not. I mean, I’m a bit clumsy, but nothing major. I bump into furniture sometimes, that’s it. The bruising is way bigger than it should be for a little knock, that’s the problem. I’m starting to worry, honestly. It’s not like I’m getting beaten up or anything!
DOCTOR: Okay. It's good you're bringing this to our attention. We need to understand what's going on. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising. Then we can talk about some possible blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got a few things I need to get done today. But yeah, check everything. Blood tests are fine, whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, regular. Okay, the bruising is quite extensive… approximately 8 centimeters in diameter. It’s tender to the touch, and there’s some swelling. Color is a mix of purple and blue, indicating it's relatively recent. No obvious signs of injury, no bone tenderness. Now, let’s talk a bit more about your medical history. Have you ever had any other medical conditions diagnosed besides the clot issue?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. And…I think I had a bad bout of the flu last winter, but that’s it. Nothing else really. No surgeries, no allergies… I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no allergies. That's good to know. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. Nothing regular. Oh! And I take fish oil, for my joints. But like, not every day. Maybe three times a week? It’s that Omega-3 stuff. I read it's good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional fish oil. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mum had diabetes, I think. And my grandfather… he had something with his heart. He died pretty young, actually. But other than that, not really. Everyone else just…gets old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart condition in your grandfather. Thank you. And finally, just to cover all bases, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean?
DOCTOR: I mean, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. No, none of that. Never smoked a day in my life. I have a glass of wine maybe once a month, if I'm out with friends. And definitely no drugs. I’m pretty boring, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Now, based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it's concerning that you’re developing unexplained bruising while on Warfarin. It could be a number of things, but we need to rule out any serious causes. I'm going to order some blood tests. These will check your Warfarin level, your blood clotting factors, and a complete blood count to see if there are any other abnormalities. We'll also check your liver function, as that can affect clotting. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn’t take too long to get the results. I've got a dentist appointment next week, and I really don't want to have to reschedule everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab usually gets results back within 24-48 hours. We’ll call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if you develop any new bruises, bleeding, or signs of internal bleeding, such as severe headaches, dizziness, or dark urine. And just to be safe, I'm going to suggest you temporarily stop taking the fish oil, as it can also have a blood-thinning effect. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. No fish oil. I can do that. And I’ll be careful. Seriously careful. Just… please hurry with the results. Is that all? I've got to go.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. I've given the lab technician a heads-up about your urgency. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Here’s a sheet with instructions on what to look out for and our contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Hainley.
PATIENT: Okay, thanks, Doctor. Right, well, bye. .
