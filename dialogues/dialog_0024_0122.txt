DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I am Dr. Mutnick. I see here you are 53 years of age. Please, tell me what brings you in today. Try to be concise; my schedule is… rather full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 53. It is…difficult to explain concisely, but I will try. Recently, I have been…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Things I should remember. It is worrying me, and my blood pressure…it has been high. Is that…understandable?
DOCTOR: “Forgetfulness,” you say. And elevated blood pressure. Hmm. Can you elaborate on these “small things” you are forgetting?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is…appointments, sometimes. Not all of them, but enough to make me double-check my calendar constantly. And…names. Faces, I remember, usually, but the name to go with the face…it escapes me. I also…placed my keys in the refrigerator yesterday. The refrigerator, Doctor. I do not…understand why. It is not like me.
DOCTOR: Placing keys in the refrigerator…right. And this has been happening for how long, precisely?
PATIENT: Perhaps…three months? It started slowly, a forgotten name here or there. But in the last month, it has become…more frequent. I find myself repeating questions to family, because I simply…cannot recall if they answered me already. It is…frightening. Is this…serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Frightening” is a strong word, Ms. Alvara. It could be a number of things. Stress, anxiety, even simply the natural effects of…well, getting older. Though at 53, one would expect a certain level of cognitive function to remain intact. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think. No…no dizziness. No headaches. I sleep…okay, though I wake often. I feel…tired, yes. A constant fatigue, even after a full night. But I attributed that to…general life stresses. And my blood pressure medication, perhaps. I am not certain. Is fatigue…relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fatigue is…vague. Many things cause fatigue. Let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes. Just the one, for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Twenty milligrams, once daily. And…sometimes, ibuprofen for aches. But only when needed. I do not take it regularly. It is…over-the-counter. Does that matter, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter medications can interact with other things, yes. But ibuprofen at infrequent doses is unlikely to be the cause of your…memory lapses. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. I have always been…quite healthy, actually. Until recently. This forgetfulness…it is truly unlike me. It is unsettling. I have always prided myself on my…sharp mind. Is it possible…could this be something…serious, Doctor? Like…dementia? I apologize for asking, but my sister…she had something similar.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, while I understand your concern, jumping to conclusions about “dementia” based on occasional forgetfulness and fatigue is… premature. We need to gather more information. Let's start with a basic physical exam. And then we will review your blood pressure. Please, if you would, stand up.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A physical exam…that sounds…logical. I will stand. I hope you do not mind…my knees are not what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Let’s begin. Your pulse is… slightly elevated. Blood pressure, as you mentioned, is likely the culprit. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please, breathe deeply. Normal heart sounds. Lungs are clear. Any history of…shortness of breath, chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath. No chest pain, ever. I walk…regularly, when the weather permits. I used to enjoy gardening, but it has become…difficult to concentrate enough to properly care for the plants. That is another thing. My concentration is…waning. It worries me. Is this…typical with high blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are…within normal limits. As for your concentration, that could be a symptom of hypertension, but it is also a non-specific complaint. Many things can cause difficulty concentrating. Let me check your neurological function. Follow my finger with your eyes only, Ms. Alvara. Do not move your head. Normal eye movements. Now, squeeze my hands. Grip strength is… adequate. Now, tell me today's date.
PATIENT: Today’s date…? August…the second. August 2nd, 2025. Is that correct, Doctor? It is…difficult to recall sometimes, even though I know it. I apologize. This is…embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Three words…please tell me the words, Doctor. I will do my best.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, I want you to remember those words, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Do you have any family history of memory problems, besides your sister?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother…she had some difficulties in her later years. She would…misplace things, forget appointments. Nothing as pronounced as my sister, but noticeable. And…my grandfather, on my father's side, he was confused often in his old age. They say it runs in families…Is that…true, Doctor? Does that increase my risk?
DOCTOR: Genetics certainly can play a role, Ms. Alvara. However, that does not mean you are destined to follow the same path. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Yes, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps…two times a week. Never more. And I do not smoke. I have never smoked. Is that…relevant, Doctor? I try to lead a healthy lifestyle, despite everything.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption is unlikely to be a significant factor. Now, let’s revisit those three words I asked you to remember. Apple…table…penny. Can you recall them for me?
PATIENT: Apple…yes, I remember apple. And…penny. Yes, definitely penny. But…table…I am afraid table escapes me. I know I heard three words…but I cannot recall the third one. It is…frustrating. I apologize, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your history, physical exam, and…limited recall, I believe the most prudent course of action is to rule out any underlying neurological issues. While I suspect this may be related to stress and poorly controlled hypertension, we cannot dismiss other possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. And, I will refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation, including cognitive testing. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A neurologist…cognitive testing…? Yes, I do. Will these tests be…painful? And…what if they do find something serious? Is it…is it possible I have…what my sister had? I apologize for asking, but I am very worried.
DOCTOR: The tests are not painful, Ms. Alvara. The neurologist will ask you a series of questions and perform some basic exercises. As for your concerns about… “what your sister had”, it is too early to make any definitive conclusions. We are simply being thorough. The tests will help us determine the cause of your memory lapses and fatigue. I will provide you with a referral slip and instructions for scheduling the appointment. In the meantime, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. Try to manage your stress levels and ensure you are getting adequate sleep. Do you have any other questions, or shall we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No…no, I believe that is all. Thank you, Doctor. I…I suppose I will schedule the appointment. Thank you for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a good day, Ms. Alvara. And remember to follow the instructions provided. .
