DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bahta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Lonell Bahta. And please, call me Lonell if you prefer. It is a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Osterholm, is it? I believe my paperwork is complete, but please let me know if anything is missing.
DOCTOR: Osterholm, yes, Deepa Osterholm. And please, just Deepa is fine. The paperwork looks alright, though I rarely remember what's on those things, honestly. Now, what brings you in today, Lonell?
PATIENT: Ah, very well, Deepa. I am here for… a certification, I believe? Regarding home health, or perhaps hospice. My… ex-wife suggested I look into it. She handles most of these things, but she wanted me to have a proper assessment done. I am not entirely sure of the details, to be frank. It is for my recovery, after… a rather serious operation.
DOCTOR: Right, a home health certification… or assessment for hospice eligibility. Let's see… your ex-wife is quite organized, isn't she?
PATIENT: She is… efficient, yes. Very much so. She always has been. I appreciate her looking after these things, truly. Though, I confess, I find the whole process a bit overwhelming. I simply want to ensure I receive the best possible care as I… recuperate. Perhaps you could explain what this assessment involves? What sort of things will you be asking me?
DOCTOR: Well, it’s mostly just a formality, really. We need to document your current functional status – how you’re managing day-to-day activities. Things like dressing, bathing, eating… getting around. And a little bit about your medical history, just to be thorough. You mentioned a serious operation… could you tell me a little about that?
PATIENT: Of course. It was… a tumor, you see. In my abdomen. It required quite a lengthy surgery, several weeks in the hospital. I am recovering now, but… slowly. There are days when I manage quite well, and others… not so much. I tire easily, and some movements are… difficult. I have some assistance at home, but I would like to remain as independent as possible, naturally.
DOCTOR: Abdominal tumor… several weeks in hospital. Alright. And when was this surgery, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was in February. February 14th, to be precise. Valentine’s Day. A rather memorable Valentine’s Day, as you can imagine. It was at Saint-Luc Hospital, here in the city. Doctor Dubois performed the surgery. A very skilled man, though I do not recall all the details of the procedure itself.
DOCTOR: February 14th… Saint-Luc, Dubois. Good. And are you currently seeing anyone for follow-up care regarding the tumor?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I see Doctor Dubois every month. He monitors my progress, adjusts my medication. And I also have a physiotherapist, Madame Lavelle, who helps with my strength and mobility. She visits me twice a week at my apartment. It is… a small apartment, but quite comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Medication... what medications are you currently taking, Lonell?
PATIENT: Ah, that is a good question. Let me see if I can recall… There is… Morphine, for the pain, though I am trying to reduce the dosage. And Omeprazole, for my stomach. And… I believe that is all. I take a small blue pill for blood pressure, but I do not recall the name. My ex-wife manages the refills, so she would have a more accurate list, I suspect. I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll get it sorted. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. Not to any medication, food, or… anything, really. I have always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, take most pills without issue. It is… a small blessing, considering everything else. Though, I do find the taste of Morphine rather unpleasant, naturally. But it is a small price to pay for the relief it provides.
DOCTOR: No allergies... Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Of course. Though, please excuse my slowness. It takes a moment to… gather myself. I am not as nimble as I once was. Is there a chair nearby, in case I need to sit?
DOCTOR: Of course, right there. Just take your time. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It is… a bit unsteady, I admit. My balance is not what it used to be. Perhaps I should hold onto something? I do not wish to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. A little unsteady, yes. And I notice a slight shuffling gait. Can you lift your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? It is… a bit difficult. There is some discomfort in my shoulders. I haven’t much upper body strength at present. It feels… strained. Is this what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes. Alright. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Is this sufficient? I am trying to exert as much force as I can, but my grip is not what it once was. I used to be quite strong, you know. I enjoyed gardening, heavy lifting. It is… frustrating to feel my strength diminishing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. A little reduced, but not alarming. Alright, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Like this? I sometimes feel… a bit breathless, even with minimal exertion. It is a lingering effect of the surgery, I suspect. My lungs were… compromised during the procedure. Is that adequate? I am trying to cooperate as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Breathing is a little shallow, yes. I hear some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. And your heart rate is a little elevated, but not significantly. Alright. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say "Ah".
PATIENT: "Ah…" Everything feels… normal, as far as I can tell. I do not have any throat pain, or… any visible abnormalities. I had my tonsils removed as a child, so there is not much to see, naturally. Is there anything specific you are looking for?
DOCTOR: Ears look clear. Alright, that's all for the physical exam. Let's review everything. You've had a significant abdominal tumor removed in February, you're seeing Doctor Dubois monthly, and you're working with a physiotherapist. You're taking Morphine and Omeprazole, and a pill for blood pressure. You've noted some fatigue, difficulty with balance, and reduced strength. It sounds like you’re still recovering, naturally. We need to consider the impact of the surgery, the medication side effects, and the possibility of some residual deconditioning. I'm going to order some blood work to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any underlying infection.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to assess me so carefully. The fatigue is… the most debilitating symptom, I believe. It makes it difficult to enjoy anything, even simple tasks. And the reduced strength is… concerning, as you can imagine. I would like to regain some of my independence, as quickly as possible. The blood work sounds sensible. Will the results be available soon? And what happens next, after the tests are completed?
DOCTOR: The results should be available in a few days. I'll have my nurse call you with the results. Depending on what we find, we may need to adjust your medication, refer you to a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation, or simply continue with your current physiotherapy program. Now, this assessment is, as you said, for home health or hospice. Based on what I've seen, you do not appear to be an immediate candidate for hospice. You are still actively recovering, and you have a good support system. Home health, however, could be quite beneficial. It could provide additional support with your physiotherapy, help with medication management, and monitor your overall progress. Would you like me to submit a referral for home health services?
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear. I did not wish to consider hospice at this stage. Home health sounds excellent, yes. Anything that can help me regain my strength and independence would be most welcome. Please, submit the referral. And thank you, Deepa. You have been most helpful. I feel… considerably better informed, and less anxious, than when I arrived.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lonell. I'm glad I could help. My nurse will be in touch with the details regarding the home health referral. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Just one more thing. I’m going to print out a summary of today’s visit for your records, and a list of resources for post-operative care. Here you go. Alright, that’s everything for today. Take care, Lonell.
PATIENT: .
