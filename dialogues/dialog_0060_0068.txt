DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Nooruddin, is it? Yes. Well, it’s my leg. It’s… swollen. It started after the treatment. The cancer treatment, you know? It’s… not painful, exactly, just… big. And it feels… funny.
DOCTOR: “After the treatment,” you say. Right. And what kind of treatment are we talking about, dear?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… radiation. Yes, radiation and… pills. Lots of pills. They gave me pills. I… don’t remember the names. It was a long time ago, and I take so many now, it all gets mixed up. They said it was for the… the spot on my bone. In my leg. That’s why it’s swollen, I think. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" is a… relative term, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose it is. But is it something to worry about? Because it’s getting… bigger. Slowly, but it is bigger. And I don’t want it to… fall off or anything. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: "Fall off?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, no. Not fall off fall off. Just… get worse. Like, I don't want to need… more treatment. Or… a hospital. I just want it to stop. I probably sound very foolish.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, worrying isn't going to make anything happen. But we need to figure out what's going on. Now, you said this swelling started after radiation… and pills. Can you tell me roughly when you finished treatment?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. It was… last spring, I think. Yes, last spring. Around… April? Maybe May? It's hard to remember exactly. Everything feels blurry these days. I finished the radiation first, then the pills after that. For… six months, maybe? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Right. And this swelling… has it been increasing steadily since then, or did it get worse suddenly?
PATIENT: Slowly, I think. Very slowly. I didn't really notice it at first. Just… my leg felt a little heavier, you know? And my shoe felt a bit tight. But over the summer, it’s gotten more noticeable. See? It's bigger than the other one. Not a lot, but… it is. And sometimes it feels… warm.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… color? No, not really. It’s the same color, I think. Maybe a little… shiny? But that could just be the lotion I use. It’s… it’s a special lotion for dry skin. I get very dry skin. Sometimes it feels a little… tight. Like my skin is stretched. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Tight," right. Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, I had a little trouble with my heart a long time ago, but that's better now. And my blood pressure goes up sometimes, but I take a pill for that too. Mostly, I'm just… old. And tired. Is that a health problem? I don't think I have anything major. Just the usual things for someone my age.
DOCTOR: “Just old” isn’t a diagnosis, dear. What about family history?
PATIENT: Oh! My mother… she had the arthritis. Very bad arthritis in her hands. And my brother… he had trouble with his stomach. But not cancer. No one in my family had cancer, not that I know of. Well, maybe my aunt… on my father’s side? But that was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. It was… something with her breast, I think. But she lived very far away. I’m not very good at remembering family things.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, so many! Let's see… there's the blood pressure pill, the one for my heart… and these are for my arthritis, even though it's not very bad. And these… I think these are for my sleep. And then there’s the one the cancer doctor gave me, but I don’t remember what it’s for anymore. It’s a mess, I know. I have to take so many, it’s hard to keep track. I just… take them when I remember. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: “Take them when I remember” is… not ideal, dear. We're going to need to get this sorted out. Before we go any further, let's do a quick physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Lie down? Is it necessary? I'm not very good at lying down… my bones ache. But… alright. If you think it's important. Just… be gentle, please? It hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. Just lie on your back, and I'll take a look at your leg. We need to check for any signs of infection, and feel for any… abnormalities. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Alright. It's cold. And hard. Be careful with my leg, please. It's very sensitive. And… is it going to hurt? I don’t like doctors touching my leg.
DOCTOR: Just relax, dear. I'll be as gentle as possible. Now, let me just start by feeling your pulses… Hmm. Pulses are present, but a little… weak. Now, I'm going to check the temperature around your leg… Yes, it is warmer. And slightly… discolored. A bit of redness around the ankle. Now, I’m going to gently feel for any tender spots… Hmm. Tenderness here, along the calf muscle. And… slight swelling. Yes, more pronounced than the other leg. Alright. That’s enough for now. You can sit up when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Oh. Is it bad? You looked… worried when you were touching it. Is it the cancer coming back? Or is it an infection? I don’t want to go to the hospital. I hate hospitals. What’s going to happen?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, it's too early to say definitively what's going on. The swelling and warmth suggest possible infection, but it could also be something else. We need to rule things out. We're going to order some blood work to check for signs of infection. And I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound to look at the blood flow in your leg. That will help us determine if there's a blood clot. And I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics, just in case. It's better to be safe than sorry. Now, do you understand?
PATIENT: Antibiotics? And… blood work? Blood work means needles, doesn’t it? And a… what did you call it? A Doppler ultra-sound? Is that painful? I don’t like needles. And I don’t like machines touching me. It makes me nervous. Will it take long? I have my bingo tonight.
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood work will require a needle, but it will be quick. And the Doppler ultrasound is completely painless. It just uses sound waves to create an image of your blood vessels. It won't hurt a bit. Look, dear, this is important. We need to rule out a serious infection or blood clot. Missing one bingo night is a small price to pay for your health. I'll write you a prescription for the antibiotics. And I'll give you a referral to the lab for the blood work and the radiology center for the ultrasound. They can schedule appointments for you. Now, do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Radiology? That sounds… scary. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I’m on a fixed income, you know. And Medicare… sometimes they don't cover everything. Will I have to pay out of pocket? And what if it is serious? What if it's the cancer again? I don't want to go through that again. It was awful. Just awful.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I understand you're worried, but you're getting ahead of yourself. We haven't even confirmed anything yet. As for the cost, Medicare should cover the ultrasound and blood work, but you can check with the billing department to be sure. I can't guarantee anything, but they should be able to give you an estimate. And frankly, worrying about the cost isn't going to help anything right now. We need to get these tests done so we can figure out what's going on. Now, here's the prescription for the antibiotics. Take them as directed, and make sure you finish the entire course, even if you start to feel better. And make those appointments. The sooner we get these tests done, the sooner we can put your mind at ease. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… antibiotics. And appointments. But… what if it's something really bad? What if I need… surgery? Or… chemotherapy again? I don't think I could do it again. It was… horrible. I lost all my hair. And I was so sick. Just… so sick. I just want it to stop. I just want to be normal again. Please… can you just tell me it's nothing? Can you just tell me it's not serious?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I understand you're scared. But I can't tell you it's nothing. That would be irresponsible. We need to get the test results first. And until we do, speculating is not going to help. I'm not going to lie to you, it could be serious. But it could also be something minor. We just don't know yet. What I can tell you is that we're going to do everything we can to figure out what's going on. And if it is something serious, we'll come up with a plan. But right now, you need to focus on getting these tests done. Here's the referral for the lab and the radiology center. Make those appointments, and let's see what they say. And please, try to stay positive. Worrying is not going to help anything. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: I… I suppose not. But… what if I get scared during the tests? I get very anxious in hospitals. And… I don't like being alone. Could I… could I bring someone with me? Just… just to hold my hand? I don’t want to be alone. Thank you, Doctor. For… for trying. I think… I think I should go now. I have my bingo tonight, you know. .
DOCTOR: Yes, dear. Bring someone with you, if it makes you feel more comfortable. And… good luck with your bingo. .
