DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I don't got all day, so let's just get right to it. It's... well, it's this. <gestures vaguely at own stomach> It's not what it used to be, you understand? Used to be solid, strong. Now... it's soft. Wife always liked it hard. I want it fixed.
DOCTOR: Right. “Soft.” I see. And how long have you been experiencing this… softening, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Experiencing? Boy, I been experiencing life! But seriously... maybe five, six years now. Started after Beatrice... after my wife passed. Didn't eat right, I suppose. Lost some weight, things... drooped. It's just gotten worse since then. And it's embarrassing, you know? Used to be a proud man.
DOCTOR: Five or six years… and you’re only addressing this now?
PATIENT: Well, what was I gonna do? Run to the doctor the minute things weren't perfect? I’m a pile driver operator, not a… a flower. Things break, things bend. You fix ‘em when they really need fixin’. And it’s botherin' me now. Especially when I look in the mirror. Doesn’t look right. You got a way to make it hard again? Like it used to be?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, you're describing a change in your abdominal musculature and, potentially, subcutaneous fat distribution. While I understand your… concern, framing it as simply "making it hard again" isn’t particularly helpful. We need to understand the cause of this change before discussing any potential interventions. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Interventions? What kinda fancy words you throwin' at me now? Look, I ain’t here for a lecture. I want it fixed. Cause? Life, boy! Life caused it. Beatrice passed, I grieved, I stopped liftin' heavy things. It’s not rocket science. Are you gonna help me or not? Because honestly, I got better things to do than sit here and explain my life story. You got somethin' that can tighten things up? Like a… like a bandage for the belly? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, a "bandage for the belly" is not a medical solution. We are discussing your physical health, and I need you to take this seriously. Before we even consider any interventions, I need to perform a physical exam. And I need you to provide me with a complete medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Existing…? Well, I had Beatrice. Best condition a man could ask for. But she’s gone now. <pauses, looking away> Aside from that… I got a bad back sometimes, from all the pilin’. And my knees ache when it rains. I take some pills for the back, when it’s really bad. A doctor in Kingston gave ‘em to me, years ago. Can’t remember the name of ‘em now. Just little white ones. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That's about it. Don't go needin' a whole lotta history, I ain’t got it. Can we just get to the fixin’ now?
DOCTOR: “Little white ones” is not a medication list, Mr. Trendler. And your history is relevant. The pills you’re taking for your back could interact with anything we consider. And frankly, your age also factors into potential solutions. Now, I’m going to ask you some more specific questions, and I need you to answer them directly. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? A little. Probably ten, fifteen pounds. Not on purpose, mind you. Just... appetite went with Beatrice. Food didn’t taste the same after. And I wasn't liftin’ as much, so didn’t need to eat as much, I suppose. And now… it's just easier not to bother with it much. But that ain't the problem! The problem is this… sag. It's disrespectful, you understand? Disrespectful to Beatrice, to myself, to a good man.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? You askin’ about my… business? Look, I ain't here to discuss my… personal life. That's private! I told you, I just want somethin’ done about this belly. I don’t need a doctor askin’ me about… that. Is there a way to just… tighten it up? A machine? Surgery? Anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, your “bowel habits” are a crucial part of your overall health assessment. Changes can indicate a number of underlying issues. And to answer your question directly, there are options, but they require a thorough understanding of the cause of this change. We can discuss surgery or other procedures, but only after ruling out any serious medical conditions. Now, I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Examine…? Look, I’m a grown man! You want me to lie down like a… like a baby? And you still ain’t told me if you can fix it! What if I don't want to lie down? Is that a problem? You gonna poke and prod and then tell me there's nothin’ you can do? Because I swear… I’m not wastin’ my time. If you can’t fix it, just say so.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but a proper examination is essential. I cannot determine the cause of your condition, and therefore cannot recommend any treatment, without assessing your abdomen. It is a standard medical procedure. If you refuse to cooperate, I cannot provide you with any further assistance. It's a simple examination. Please lie down. Or, I can document your refusal and recommend you seek care elsewhere. The choice is yours.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. And hurry up. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please remain still and breathe normally. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any tenderness or pain. There’s some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no palpable masses. Your abdominal muscles are… relaxed, and there’s a moderate amount of subcutaneous fat present. Skin turgor is within normal limits. Okay, Mr. Trendler. You can sit up now.
PATIENT: Relaxed? Relaxed?! That's what you think? I been pilin' for fifty years! They ain't relaxed! But… tenderness? Yeah, maybe a little. After all the grievin’… it takes a toll, you know? So, what now? You got a magic machine or somethin'? Or are you gonna just keep pokin’ and proddin’ and tellin’ me things ain’t right? Just tell me straight. Can you fix it or can't you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, based on my examination, there doesn't appear to be any acute medical emergency. However, your symptoms – the abdominal softness, tenderness, and diminished appetite – are likely multifactorial. Grief, weight loss, and decreased physical activity can certainly contribute. As for "fixing" it, there are options, but they are not magic. We could consider a referral to a nutritionist to address your weight loss and improve your diet. Increasing your physical activity could help tone your abdominal muscles. There are also non-invasive procedures, such as abdominal muscle stimulation, which may provide some improvement, but results are variable. And, as a last resort, there’s always surgical intervention—a panniculectomy—but that comes with risks and a significant recovery period. However, before proceeding with any of these options, I recommend a blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or hormonal imbalances. And I strongly advise a psychological assessment to address your grief and emotional well-being. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Boy, you doctors and your tests! Look, I ain’t enjoyin’ this. All this pokin’ and proddin’ and talkin’ about feelin’s… I just want my belly tight again. But… fine. If you think it’ll help… I guess I can do the blood stuff. But I ain’t talkin’ to no head shrinker! Beatrice was the best shrinker a man could ask for. I don’t need no stranger askin’ me about my wife. Just… do the blood tests. And then tell me if you can tighten it up, or not. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. I’ll order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. I'll also include a lipid panel. I understand your reluctance regarding a psychological assessment, but I strongly believe addressing the underlying emotional factors would be beneficial. However, I will respect your decision for now. The lab results should be available in a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss potential treatment options in more detail. In the meantime, I recommend focusing on a healthy diet and gentle exercise. Are you currently taking any supplements or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Supplements? No. Just the little white pills for the back, when it’s bad. Like I told you before. Can't remember the name of 'em. Old doctor in Kingston gave 'em to me years ago. And a little liniment for the knees sometimes, when it rains. That’s it. Look, is this all the questions you got? I really need to get goin’.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, "little white pills" is not a medication. We need to identify what you're taking. Do you have any of the bottles left?
PATIENT: Here. Found one. Empty now, of course. Been a while since I needed ‘em. But this is what I take.
DOCTOR: “Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen 5/300mg.” Mr. Trendler, this is a potent opioid pain medication, a Schedule II controlled substance. You’ve been taking this… for how long?
PATIENT: Opioid…? Look, the doctor gave it to me for the back! Said it would help. Been takin’ it… off and on, for years. Whenever the back flares up. Not all the time, mind you. Just when I really need it. Never asked too many questions, just took what he gave me. What’s the problem? It helps!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, long-term use of opioid pain medications carries significant risks, including addiction, tolerance, and adverse side effects. It can also interact with other medications and contribute to underlying health problems. Furthermore, it explains your diminished appetite and could be contributing to your abdominal symptoms. The fact that you’ve been taking this medication without regular medical supervision is a serious concern. We need to discuss tapering off this medication immediately. And I’m obligated to report this to the relevant authorities. This is a matter of your safety, and a legal requirement.
PATIENT: Report…? What are you talkin' about?! I ain’t done nothin’ wrong! The doctor gave it to me! I just took it when I needed it! You’re gonna report me to the… to the police?! Over some pills?! This is ridiculous! Look, I came here to get my belly fixed, not to get interrogated! I’m leavin’. I don’t need this. I’ll find another doctor. A doctor who actually helps people, not… accuses ‘em!
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I understand your frustration, but I cannot in good conscience allow you to continue taking this medication without proper medical supervision. It's a matter of your health and safety. I'm not accusing you of anything, but I am obligated to follow established medical protocols and legal requirements. I strongly urge you to reconsider. I can provide you with resources for pain management and addiction treatment. And I'm still willing to address your abdominal concerns, once we have a plan for safely discontinuing the opioid medication. However, if you choose to leave without addressing this issue, I will be forced to document your refusal and take appropriate action to ensure your well-being. Please, think carefully about this decision. I am concerned for your health. .
PATIENT: .
