DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, I suppose. A jumpstart to get my health back on track. I’m not sure exactly where to begin, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. I understand. It's common to feel that way. Many things can contribute to that feeling. Let's try to unpack it a bit. When did you start feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, not exactly. If I had to pinpoint…I’d say the last six months, maybe? It’s been a gradual thing. Less energy, feeling a bit…blah, all the time. Not sick, just…not well. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, it absolutely does. A gradual onset is important information. "Less energy, not well…" Let's try to be a little more specific, if you don't mind. Could you describe what a typical day looks like for you?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, my husband and I, we live just outside of town. I…I work with clay, mostly. Making decorative items, little sculptures, things like that. It’s a fairly physical job, actually, lots of kneading and shaping. I usually start around 8, work until lunchtime, then back at it until 5 or so. Evenings are usually quiet – dinner, a bit of television…not much excitement, to be honest. Lately, even that feels tiring. The work itself…it’s harder to focus, and I find myself needing more and more breaks.
DOCTOR: That sounds…demanding, physically. And mentally, as well, I imagine. It's good you're recognizing the fatigue. Now, besides the tiredness and difficulty focusing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well…thinking about it…my sleep hasn’t been great. I wake up several times during the night, even if I haven’t had a bad dream or anything. And……my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be. I don't feel hungry very often. I'm not losing weight drastically, but…it’s noticeable. It’s just…things don’t seem to bring me pleasure like they once did. Even working with the clay, which I usually love…it feels…flat. Is that…is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Changes in sleep and appetite, and a loss of enjoyment…those are all important pieces of the puzzle. We need to explore this further. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss, even a few pounds?
PATIENT: I believe I mentioned it wasn’t drastic, but yes, maybe…five or ten pounds, over the last few months. It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t weigh myself every day. My husband noticed it first, actually. He said I looked a little…thinner. It's not like I've been trying to diet or anything, so it worried him a bit. He suggested I come see you, to be on the safe side.
DOCTOR: Good of your husband to encourage you to come in. Alright, Ms. Pitzel, let’s move on to some more general questions. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully. No fever, chills, or night sweats. Nothing like that. I haven’t felt acutely ill, just…drained. It’s more of a constant, low-level exhaustion, you understand? Not like the flu or a cold. I suppose I've had the usual minor aches and pains, the sort you get with…well, getting older. But nothing persistent or severe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements and urination?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that's...a bit personal, isn't it? My bowel movements have been…regular, I suppose. Not any major changes there. And urination is normal. No pain, no difficulty, no increased frequency. Just…normal. I apologize for the bluntness. It feels strange discussing these things.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Pitzel. These questions are all part of a thorough assessment, and I appreciate your honesty. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not really, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, things like that. But no serious illnesses, no surgeries, nothing like that. My blood pressure has been a little high at times, the doctor mentioned it during a routine check-up a few years ago, but it was never bad enough to require medication. Otherwise…I’ve been quite healthy, all my life. Relatively, at least. Until now, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a bit complicated. My mother had some heart problems later in life, I believe. And my father…he had diabetes, type 2, I think. And there’s been some……some instances of depression on my mother’s side of the family. Nothing major, but several aunts and cousins have struggled with it at different times. It’s not something we talked about much, to be honest. It felt…private. But that’s about it, I think. Nothing else significant that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Pitzel. That's helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I’ve never used any recreational drugs. Never been tempted, to be honest. I prefer a quiet evening at home with my husband. We enjoy gardening and reading, simple pleasures like that. It’s a pretty peaceful life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. I spend a lot of time in the garden, working with plants, and I haven’t had any allergic reactions to pollen or anything like that, thankfully. Is that…is that all? I feel like I’ve been rattling on for quite some time.
DOCTOR: No, you haven’t been rattling on at all, Ms. Pitzel. That was a very thorough history. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, as you mentioned. Now, I’d like to examine your thyroid. Please extend your neck slightly… Thyroid is normal to palpation, no nodules noted. And finally, I’ll briefly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. But based on your history and these findings, I'd like to order some lab work. We'll check a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, and vitamin D levels. I also want to rule out any vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds…thorough. I appreciate that. If you think those tests are necessary, then please do them. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and feel like myself again. When can I expect the results? And…will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Good. We'll get those tests ordered right away. The lab work usually takes about three to five business days to come back. The lab will contact you directly when they're ready. Once I have the results, I'll review them carefully and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We may also want to discuss a referral to a therapist, based on your family history and current symptoms. It might be beneficial to explore potential emotional factors contributing to your fatigue and loss of enjoyment. But let's wait to see what the lab results show first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…sensible. Waiting for the results seems like a good idea. And a therapist…well, I hadn't thought of that. It’s something to consider, certainly. I appreciate you mentioning it. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any changes to my diet or activity level you’d recommend? Or anything I should be watching out for?
DOCTOR: For now, I wouldn't make any drastic changes to your diet or activity level. Continue with your normal routine as much as possible. However, I would encourage you to prioritize getting adequate rest and hydration. And try to engage in activities that you find enjoyable, even if you don't feel like it. As for things to watch out for, if you experience any sudden or severe symptoms, such as chest pain, difficulty breathing, or significant weight loss, please contact me immediately. But for now, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much better having talked to you. Thank you for listening, and for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll wait for the lab results, and I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
PATIENT: .
