DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My head… back of my head, it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now? Not all the time, comes and goes. Feels like a… tight band, maybe? I don’t know the words, but back there, hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. A headache, primarily at the back of your head, for about three days, coming and going… and you describe it as a tight band. Alright. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: More… how? Is it… sharp? Dull? It's not a bad pain, you understand. More like… annoying. Like someone is holding my head too tight. Sometimes it feels… heavy, like my neck is tired too. I don't know if the neck is the problem, or the head. They feel… close together, the pain.
DOCTOR: So, not a sharp, debilitating pain, more of a dull, annoying pressure… and it's hard to pinpoint whether it's the head or the neck specifically. It feels… connected. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Thinking makes it worse, maybe. Not always, but when I try to… remember things, or… figure something out, it feels tighter. Also… sun. Bright sun. Makes it feel… hotter back there. And… if I look down for a long time, like… reading, or working with my hands… it gets bad. Not right away, but after a while.
DOCTOR: Okay. So thinking, bright sunlight, and prolonged looking down… all seem to aggravate it. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… no fever, no shaking. I haven’t felt sick to my stomach. Eyes are okay, I think. I do sometimes feel a little… dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… light headed. And… I’ve been more tired than usual. But I am old, you know. Old people get tired. It could be that. But maybe it’s with the head.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no nausea, vision seems okay, some dizziness, and increased fatigue. We'll keep all that in mind. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… hmm. Not much, really. Old age is the biggest problem, I think. I used to work with the… the trains. Rail yard, you know? Lots of lifting, lots of noise. My back isn’t so good anymore, but I get by. Never had… serious sickness. No heart trouble, no… sugar sickness. Just old. And… my wife, she passed away five years ago. Sad thing, that. Does that count?
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. And no, that doesn't count as a medical condition, but I appreciate you sharing that. You mentioned working with the trains, heavy lifting... Have you ever had any injuries, particularly to your head, neck, or back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many bumps and bruises. Working with trains is not… gentle work. I fell once, maybe twenty years ago, off a small platform. Hit my head, but not… hard. Just a bump. They checked me out, said I was fine. And my back… always something with the back. Pulled muscles, twisted it… never anything broken, I think. Lots of aches and pains, but nothing that stopped me from working. I worked until I was seventy, you know. Couldn’t sit still.
DOCTOR: A few bumps and bruises from work, a fall with a head bump many years ago, and chronic back issues. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pills. I don't like taking pills. Never been much of a pill person. Sometimes I take something for my… the aches. Like… ibuprofen, maybe. When it’s really bad. But not every day. Just when I need it. Small dose, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for aches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any trouble with that. Eat anything, go anywhere. My wife… she was the one with allergies. Pollen, dust… all sorts of things. But me? No. I eat the spicy food, I walk in the garden, no problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. No allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your neck, your reflexes, and a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my neck, please. It gets sore easy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be. Alright, let's start with your reflexes. Just relax your legs. [Taps patellar tendon] And now the other leg. [Taps other patellar tendon] Good. And now your biceps. [Tests biceps reflexes bilaterally] Everything seems within normal limits there. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. Just gently turn your head to the left, and then to the right. And now, chin to chest, and look up towards the ceiling. A little discomfort with that extension, as you mentioned. And some tenderness here in the upper back and neck muscles. And finally, just stand with your feet together, and close your eyes for a moment. Everything seems stable there. Alright. Let me document these findings. Reflexes 2+ and symmetric. Mild discomfort with neck extension. Mild tenderness to palpation of upper trapezius muscles. Romberg negative.
PATIENT: Okay. That didn’t hurt too bad, Doctor. Just a little… tight. So, what do you think it is? Is it something serious? My wife… she worried about everything. I don’t want to worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it's unlikely to be anything serious. It sounds like you're experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by muscle strain in your neck. The history of heavy lifting, the fall, and the discomfort with movement all point in that direction. The dizziness and fatigue could be related to the headache, or simply to age and general health. However, given your age and the fact that dizziness is present, I would like to be cautious. I recommend we start with some conservative measures: over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you can tolerate them, gentle stretching and heat application to your neck muscles, and ensuring you're getting adequate rest and hydration. I also want to rule out any other potential causes. Would you be willing to get a basic blood test to check your complete blood count, thyroid levels, and vitamin D levels?
PATIENT: Blood test… hmm. I don’t like needles, but… if you think it’s best, Doctor, I will do it. I want to make sure it’s nothing serious. My wife always said it’s better to be safe than sorry. What does it look for, exactly? And will it take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: You are right to be cautious, and your wife was very wise. The blood test will help us rule out other possibilities that could be causing your symptoms, such as anemia, thyroid problems, or vitamin deficiencies. It’s a fairly routine test, and it shouldn’t take long – just a few minutes to draw the blood. It will take a few days for the results to come back, and we can discuss them then. We’ll also want to monitor your symptoms to see if they improve with the conservative measures. If your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please contact the office immediately. I’m going to write an order for the blood test now. Here you go. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. I… appreciate you taking the time. My wife… she always liked a doctor who listened. I will get the blood test done tomorrow. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any stretches I can try right now? Before I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. And I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. Yes, there are a few simple stretches you can try right now, if you'd like. Start with these gentle stretches, and only go as far as is comfortable. Don't force anything. Also, try to maintain good posture throughout the day. Keep your shoulders relaxed and your head aligned with your spine. And remember, gentle heat application to your neck muscles can also provide some relief. A warm compress or a warm shower can do the trick. I’m going to print out a handout with these stretches and some other helpful tips for managing tension headaches. Here you go. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call. Take care, Mr. Brum. And we'll talk again once the blood test results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… better already, just knowing what it might be. Not serious. That’s good. I will do the stretches and get the blood test done tomorrow. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Brum. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. .
