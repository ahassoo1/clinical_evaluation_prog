DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, my foot is… bothering me. A sore, really. It’s been there a while now, and it’s not getting better. It hurts to walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: “A sore,” you say. Right. And how long precisely has this “sore” been… bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must be… maybe three, four months now? It started small, just a little red spot. I didn’t think much of it at first, to be honest. Now it’s… well, it’s bigger. And deeper, I suppose. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes.
DOCTOR: Three to four months. And you’ve just now decided to come in?
PATIENT: Well, I hoped it would heal on its own. I put some ointment on it, you know, the kind you get at the store. But it didn’t help. My daughter, she kept telling me to come see someone, but I don’t like to bother folks. I'm not one for doctors, if I can help it. But it’s getting harder to walk, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what sort of ointment was this?
PATIENT: Just… a regular one. For cuts and scrapes. I think it had… aloe in it? I don’t remember the name. The blue bottle, maybe? It’s the one my wife always used. She’s… passed on now, so I just grabbed what was in the bathroom. I didn't really read the label, I suppose.
DOCTOR: A blue bottle. Right. And have you noticed any discharge?
PATIENT: Discharge? You mean… pus? Oh dear. Let me think… yes, a little. It's not much, but sometimes there’s a bit on my sock. It’s… yellowish, I think. And it smells… not very good. I try to keep it clean with soap and water, but… it's hard when you can't see properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at it. Please, have a seat on the examination table and remove your sock and shoe on that foot. And try not to take too long; I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. It's a bit chilly in here, you know. I hope this won’t take long. It’s hard to balance on one foot these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. There is a significant ulceration present on the plantar surface of your foot, near the metatarsal heads. There is some surrounding erythema and induration, and I can see some purulent drainage, as you mentioned. It appears quite deep. Does this cause you significant pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That… that does hurt. A sharp pain, when you touch it there. It throbs a lot, too, especially when I’ve been walking. Not all the time, but most of the time. It feels… warm, as well. Not feverish, but warmer than the rest of my foot. Is it… bad?
DOCTOR: It is concerning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Given the duration, the depth, the purulent drainage, and your age, there is a possibility of osteomyelitis—an infection of the bone. You also appear to have some peripheral neuropathy, given your diminished sensation to light touch in this foot. This is not something we can simply treat with ointment. I'm going to order some blood work and an X-ray to assess the extent of the infection. We may need to consider a bone biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bone infection? A biopsy? That sounds… serious. I don’t understand all that medical talk, Doctor. Is this going to mean… surgery? I really don’t want surgery. My wife, she… she didn’t do well with surgery. And I’m not a young man anymore. Is there… anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Stoegbauer, I understand your concerns. We need to determine the severity of the infection before we can formulate a plan. Surgery may be necessary, but it is not a foregone conclusion. The blood work will help us assess the systemic inflammation and the X-ray will show if the infection has spread to the bone. Until we have those results, I can’t tell you definitively what the best course of action is. I will also need a complete medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have… the sugar sickness, they call it. Diabetes. My doctor told me a long time ago. I try to watch what I eat, but it’s hard. And my heart… it gives me trouble sometimes. Palpitations, you know? A fluttering feeling. I take a little pill for that. A white one. I can't remember the name, I'm afraid. I see Dr. Nakamura for my heart, but I haven't seen him in a while. Is the sugar sickness… making this foot worse?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Stoegbauer, diabetes significantly impairs your body's ability to heal and increases your risk of infection. And neuropathy—the nerve damage caused by diabetes—can lead to loss of sensation, allowing infections to go unnoticed and untreated until they become severe. We will need to get a detailed list of your medications from your primary care physician. Do you know your most recent HbA1c level?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. HbA1c? No, I don’t think so. Is that something they tell me at the doctor's office? I just know they take blood every six months. They tell me it’s to check the sugar. I haven’t asked what the numbers mean. My daughter, she usually asks for me. I'm not good with… numbers and things. Is it a bad number if it's high? I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: It is alright, Mr. Stoegbauer. We will obtain that information from your records. I'm going to order the blood work and the X-ray now. A nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. I recommend you refrain from putting any weight on this foot until we have the results. And frankly, you should have come in much sooner. I will also send a referral to a podiatrist for further evaluation. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. My wife always took care of all that. I used to get a little rash when I was a boy, from poison ivy, but that was a long time ago. No medications, though. Never had a bad reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I just hope this doesn’t take too long, Doctor. My daughter is taking me to lunch after this, and I don’t want to keep her waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. The orders have been sent. A nurse will be with you shortly. I understand your concern about lunch, but this is a serious issue that requires prompt attention. We’ve covered what needs to be covered for now. I'll review the results as soon as they become available and contact you with the next steps. Is there anything else immediately relevant you can think of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Just… please try to make it not too painful. And thank you for seeing me. I know you’re busy. I just want to be able to walk without hurting. That's all. I'm getting too old for all this trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Try to rest and avoid putting weight on that foot. We’ll do what we can. .
