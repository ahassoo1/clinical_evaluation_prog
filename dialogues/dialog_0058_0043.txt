DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Todoro­v­ich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band squeezin’. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… about a week now, I’d say. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A week, alright. And you said it feels like a tight band?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the best way I can describe it. Not a throbbin’ pain, more like… pressure. It’s not the worst headache I’ve ever had, mind you, but it’s persistent enough to be annoying, ya know? Makes it hard to concentrate when I’m workin’ with folks on their finances.
DOCTOR: Right, persistent is good to know. And you do financial work?
PATIENT: Yep. Personal financial advisor. Been doin’ it a long time now. Helps people plan for retirement, save for their kids’ education, that sort of thing. It’s good work, usually. But when this headache flares up, it makes focusin’ on numbers… tricky. I worry about makin’ a mistake for someone.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s impacting your work, which is important. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… Hmm. Let me think. Not sure if it makes it worse, exactly, but I feel it more when I’m stressed. And lately, there’s been a lot of stress. Market’s been a little shaky, people are worried about things. So, that probably doesn’t help. Also, if I’m lookin’ at a computer screen for too long, it seems to… build up, kinda. Doesn't cause it, but makes it worse if it’s already there.
DOCTOR: Market stress, prolonged screen time… alright. And when it flares up, do you get any other symptoms with it?
PATIENT: Not really. No nausea, no dizziness, no blurry vision. Just the headache. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, but I figure that’s just from sittin’ at my desk all day. I haven't noticed anythin' else unusual. I still got a good appetite, sleepin’ okay... nothin’ like that. It’s mostly just this annoying pressure in the back of my head.
DOCTOR: No nausea, dizziness, vision changes… good. And normal appetite and sleep. Have you tried anything for it so far?
PATIENT: Yeah, I took some over-the-counter pain relievers, you know, the usual stuff – ibuprofen, acetaminophen. Helps a little, takes the edge off, but it doesn't make it go away completely. And it doesn't last very long, maybe an hour or two. I don’t really like takin’ pills if I can avoid it, so I haven’t been takin’ them much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, over-the-counter medications provide some temporary relief, but it’s not a lasting solution. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Old bones ain’t what they used to be, Doctor. But I can stand. Let me know what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Just want to see how you’re moving, Mr. Gibbel. And I'll check your reflexes and strength. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yep, I can do that. Just let me know if you need me to go faster or slower. I'm pretty good at followin' directions. Used to help my grandkids with their homework, ya know? Patience is key.
DOCTOR: Good. And I’m just feeling around your neck here… a little bit of tenderness in the upper trapezius, which isn’t surprising given what you do. Your reflexes are normal, and strength appears good in all extremities. Heart and lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/82, but that’s not uncommon with stress. Overall, the exam doesn't reveal anything glaringly obvious.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, I guess. A little tenderness in my neck doesn't surprise me, spend all day hunched over numbers. The blood pressure, yeah, I figured somethin' was up there. Worryin’ about folks' money will do that to ya. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I'm not lookin’ for a whole lot of worryin' right now, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Gibbel, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by stress and prolonged screen time. The elevated blood pressure isn't helping, and we should keep an eye on that, but it's not necessarily the cause of the headache. It’s rarely anything serious, but it can be quite debilitating. Now, before we write it off as just a tension headache, I'd like to order a basic blood work panel just to rule out any underlying issues, and perhaps a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you checkin' all the boxes, ya know? Better safe than sorry. Blood work and a vitamin level... sure, I can do that. Don’t want any surprises. When can I get that done? And will I need a referral or somethin'? I usually just go to the lab down the street.
DOCTOR: Good. I'll send the order to the lab down the street electronically, so you shouldn’t need a referral. They should be able to get you in relatively quickly. They’ll likely draw some blood for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. It's pretty standard. In the meantime, I recommend trying some stress-reduction techniques – deep breathing exercises, meditation, perhaps even light exercise. And make sure you're taking breaks from the screen throughout the day. We can also discuss some over-the-counter options that might be more effective than ibuprofen, like magnesium supplements. What do you think?
PATIENT: That sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Breaks from the screen, stress reduction… I know I should be doin’ more of that. My daughter keeps tellin’ me to take up yoga. Maybe I should listen to her for once! And magnesium supplements… okay, I can give that a try. I’ll see what the lab says about gettin’ the blood work done. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me, and not brushin’ it off as just an old man complainin’. It really helps to have someone take it seriously.
DOCTOR: You're not just an old man complainin', Mr. Gibbel. And I’m glad I could help. We'll get those results back within a few days, and then we can discuss a more concrete plan. If the headache worsens significantly or you develop any new symptoms – fever, vision changes, weakness – please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Alright?
PATIENT: That's good to know. I will, Doctor. I appreciate you lookin' out for me. I'll get the blood work done this week and call if anything changes. You have a good day now. .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Gibbel. Take care. .
