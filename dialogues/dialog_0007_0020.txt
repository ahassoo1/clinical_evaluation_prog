DOCTOR: Hi Avril, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. I am here for... a check-up, I think? The lady on the phone said something about a telehealth, but I am here in person now. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Avril. It looks like you were originally scheduled for a telehealth visit, but you’re here in person, which is perfectly fine – sometimes it's better to see things face-to-face. We can definitely do a more thorough check-up this way. So, while it was scheduled as a general check-up, is there anything specific you've been concerned about, or anything you want to get addressed today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, my back… it bothers me sometimes. Not all the time, but when I bend over, you know, like to fix a car… it gets a little sore. And my knees, they are not as good as they used to be, of course. I am… how old did you say you are, Doctor? Never mind. They just ache a bit after I have been on my feet all day. Is that something you can look at? I work with cars, you see. It is hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain that's worse with bending, and some knee aches after being on your feet all day. And you work on cars, which is physically demanding. I appreciate you telling me that, it gives me a good idea of what might be going on. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about the back pain?
PATIENT: It is not a sharp pain, Doctor. More of a… dull ache. It comes and goes. Some days I don't even notice it. But if I am under a car for a long time, or lifting something heavy… then it is more noticeable. It does not go down my leg, if that makes sense. Just in my lower back. I try to be careful, but sometimes… well, you know how it is. Things are heavy!
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. A dull ache in the lower back that comes and goes, worse with bending and lifting, and doesn't radiate down your leg. That’s helpful. And you said it doesn’t happen every time you lift something heavy?
PATIENT: No, not every time. Some days it is fine, even with heavy lifting. Other days, even something not too heavy will bother it. It is… unpredictable. I wish I knew what caused it. It makes it hard to plan my work, you see. I have a reputation for good work, and I don't want to let anyone down.
DOCTOR: That’s frustrating, definitely. The unpredictability makes it harder to manage. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Everything feels… normal, I think. Just tired sometimes, after a long day. Like I said, I work with cars. Lots of standing, bending, reaching… It is good exercise, I suppose, but it is hard on the body. I don’t think I have ever had any numbness, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No numbness or tingling. Let’s talk about your knees for a moment. You said they ache after being on your feet all day. Is that a sharp pain, or more of a general soreness?
PATIENT: More soreness, Doctor. Like they are… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It takes a while to get moving. Once I am up and walking around, it is not so bad, but if I sit for too long and then stand up… then it aches again. I try to take breaks, but sometimes I get busy and forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stiffness in the mornings and after sitting for a while, with improvement as you move around. That's common. Do you notice any swelling or clicking in your knees?
PATIENT: Sometimes… a little swelling. Not much. Just at the end of the day, if I have been on them a lot. And yes, clicking. They click sometimes when I bend them. It doesn’t hurt, but it is… noticeable. I think my husband used to have that too, but he is… gone now. He used to say it was just “old age.”
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband. It sounds like he was a practical man. Clicking and occasional swelling… okay. Now, just to get a full picture, have you ever had any injuries to your back or knees?
PATIENT: No, not that I remember. Nothing serious. I have bumped them a few times, of course, working under cars and such, but nothing that needed a doctor. Just… bruises, maybe. I am careful, you see. I have to be. My livelihood depends on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injuries to either your back or knees. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick exam, let me ask about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I take a little pill for my cholesterol, the doctor said it was high, but that is all. And I try to eat healthy. Not too much fried food, you know. Mostly just… normal food. And I drink plenty of water. My husband always said to drink plenty of water. He was a good man. .
DOCTOR: Okay, you take a medication for cholesterol, and otherwise healthy. That’s good to know. And just one last thing before we move on to a physical exam – are you allergic to any medications?
