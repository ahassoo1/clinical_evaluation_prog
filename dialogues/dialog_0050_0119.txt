DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 57 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you to my office?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 57, that is correct. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually discuss these sorts of things, you understand. But… there’s a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, if I may say so. From… well, from him. My… companion. He’s a bit older than me, and hasn't been feeling quite himself lately. It's just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It is often difficult to discuss personal matters. However, it’s important we address these concerns to ensure proper care. Just to clarify, Ms. Wartick, are you saying you are experiencing a discharge, or is it your… companion who is having this issue?
PATIENT: Oh! Goodness, no, Doctor, I am perfectly fine, thank you very much. It is him. I mean, he isn't here with me, you see. He’s… well, he's a bull. A prized fighting bull, actually. And he’s… not performing as well as he used to. This discharge… it appeared a few days ago. And frankly, it's concerning for his… reputation, if nothing else.
DOCTOR: A… bull, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a bull! A very handsome one, I might add. A Spanish fighting bull. I’ve raised him since he was a calf. And now this… problem. It's rather disruptive to the schedule, you understand. The… arrangements have all been made for the festival, and… well, a bull with a discharge is hardly going to be a crowd-pleaser, is it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, with all due respect, I am a physician specializing in human medicine. I practice family medicine. I am not equipped to diagnose or treat livestock. While I appreciate you seeking medical attention, this is… outside the scope of my expertise. I would strongly recommend contacting a veterinarian experienced in bovine health. They would be the appropriate professional to assess your bull's condition. Do you have a veterinarian you typically consult with?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… remarkably unhelpful, Doctor. I assumed, being a doctor, you'd have some knowledge of… anatomy. Surely, the basics are universal? And frankly, it’s rather insulting to suggest I wouldn't have considered a veterinarian. I simply thought I’d… explore all avenues. I mean, I read online about similar issues… and sometimes, human treatments can be… adapted. It's not as if it's a complicated condition, is it? A bit of… drainage.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, while I acknowledge your reading, attempting to apply human medical knowledge to a large animal without proper training is… frankly, irresponsible. Bovine anatomy and physiology are significantly different from ours. A “bit of drainage,” as you put it, could indicate a multitude of issues, ranging from a simple infection to a more serious systemic problem. I understand you are concerned about your bull’s health and the upcoming festival, but I cannot provide a diagnosis or treatment plan in good conscience. I strongly urge you to seek the advice of a qualified veterinarian immediately. Do you have the contact information for one nearby?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the condescension is rather unnecessary. I’ve been caring for animals for decades. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of providing adequate care. But I thought, perhaps, a professional opinion might be… insightful. But clearly, you’re incapable of seeing beyond the… species. Fine. I’ll find a veterinarian. But don’t expect me to be impressed with their expertise after your… dismissal of the situation. I suppose I’ve wasted enough of both our time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I wish you and your… bull, all the best. And I reiterate my recommendation for a veterinary consultation. Should you experience any personal medical concerns, please do not hesitate to schedule another appointment. .
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Honestly, the nerve…
