DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I guess you could call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. And how long, precisely, has this lump been present?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s hard to say exactly… probably a couple of months, maybe three? At first, it was very small, and I didn't think much of it. But it’s definitely grown a bit since then, so I decided it was time to get it looked at.
DOCTOR: “Definitely grown.” Can you describe the growth?
PATIENT: Well, it hasn’t been rapid growth, Doctor. It's not like it doubled in size overnight. It's more… gradual. Perhaps the size of a plum when I first noticed it, and now… maybe a bit larger than an apricot? It’s difficult to judge accurately, I apologize. I haven’t been measuring it, obviously.
DOCTOR: “Obviously.” And has there been any associated pain, discomfort, or other changes you’ve observed?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s been bothering me, actually. There's no pain at all. Sometimes, if I’m being very active – like when I'm choreographing a particularly difficult piece – I feel a bit of… pressure, maybe? But it's not sharp or anything. Just a sort of dull ache, and it goes away quickly. No other changes, no, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And what do you do, Mr. Raghunathan, that requires such strenuous activity?
PATIENT: I'm a choreographer, Doctor. I work with dance companies, mostly contemporary. It involves a lot of physical demonstration, creating new routines, and sometimes even partnering with the dancers. It’s a very active job, I suppose. A lot of time on my feet.
DOCTOR: I see. Contemporary dance. Right. And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… bowel habits? No, not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. Everything seems pretty normal in that regard. Perhaps a little… different, if I haven't been eating well because of rehearsals, but nothing concerning. Is that something I should be paying attention to?
DOCTOR: It is always prudent to be aware of changes in bodily functions. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. Just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I had a bout of appendicitis when I was younger, about twenty years ago, but that was removed successfully. Otherwise, I’m fairly certain I haven’t been diagnosed with anything. I’ve had the standard vaccinations, of course. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, noted. And any surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Just the appendectomy when I was a teenager. I haven't had any other operations or anything of that nature. I’m fairly… low-maintenance medically, if that’s a term. I try to take good care of myself.
DOCTOR: “Low-maintenance.” Very well. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… my mother had high blood pressure later in life, and my father had some issues with his knees. Arthritis, I believe. Nothing too serious. No history of cancer, thankfully, as far as I know. My siblings are both healthy as well. Is there a particular type of illness you’re concerned about?
DOCTOR: “Concerned” is perhaps too strong a word. It's standard procedure, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to any medications in the past. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but nothing else regularly. And no environmental allergies – no pollen, no foods, nothing like that. I consider myself very lucky in that regard. Is that alright, Doctor? I feel like I’m rambling a bit.
DOCTOR: It is acceptable. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I try to get everything I need from my diet. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but nothing consistent. I really try to avoid taking medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. I believe in keeping things as natural as possible. I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, if you'll excuse me, I would like to conduct a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Just let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Please lie supine, Mr. Raghunathan, and relax your abdominal muscles. I’ll start with palpation. Now, tell me if you feel any discomfort as I press. … I am noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Is this where you feel the lump?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's… that’s about right. It's not pain, exactly, but I can feel the tenderness you’re describing. It's most noticeable in that lower left area. It doesn’t hurt unless you press, though. Is that… is that concerning? I apologize for being so inquisitive, I just… worry a bit sometimes.
DOCTOR: The mass is approximately three centimeters in diameter. It’s firm, and not freely mobile. It appears to be slightly fixed to the underlying tissue. Bowel sounds are normal. It could be a number of things, Mr. Raghunathan. A lipoma, a hernia, or… other possibilities. To be certain, we will need to order some imaging. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis will give us a clearer picture.
PATIENT: A CT scan… That sounds… serious. What are you thinking it could be, Doctor? I understand you can't tell me definitively without the scan, but… is it something I should be very worried about? I know you said a lipoma or a hernia, but you also said “other possibilities.”
DOCTOR: “Other possibilities” is simply a matter of being thorough, Mr. Raghunathan. It is premature to speculate. However, given the firmness and slight fixation of the mass, we need to rule out more serious etiologies. A CT scan will allow us to assess the size, location, and characteristics of the mass, and determine whether further investigation is warranted. I will also order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health. I will also refer you to a general surgeon for a consultation. They will be able to provide a more definitive diagnosis and discuss treatment options if necessary.
PATIENT: A surgeon… Okay. I understand. A CT scan, blood work, and a consultation with a surgeon. That sounds like a plan. Can you… can you tell me a little bit more about what these "serious etiologies" could be? Just so I have some idea of what we're looking at. I know you said it’s premature to speculate, but… even a general idea would be helpful. And… how long will it take to get the results of the CT scan? I worry about keeping my rehearsals on schedule.
DOCTOR: Mr. Raghunathan, I understand your anxiety, however, indulging in hypotheticals at this stage is not productive, and frankly, needlessly alarming. Potential causes could range from benign conditions to more concerning ones. To list them all would be irresponsible without concrete evidence. Regarding your rehearsals, I understand the importance of your work. The CT scan typically takes 24-48 hours for results. We will expedite the process as much as possible. I will contact the radiology department immediately. The surgeon’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits, you must seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. No speculating, expedite the scan, and seek immediate attention if anything changes. Thank you. That… that’s very reassuring, even if it’s not much to go on. I appreciate your honesty, and your willingness to expedite things. I will contact the surgeon’s office as soon as they reach out. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any lifestyle changes you recommend? Or… any warning signs I should be particularly aware of besides what you already mentioned?
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the CT scan, Mr. Raghunathan. Listen to your body, and rest if you feel fatigued. Maintain a healthy diet and hydration. Beyond that, there is little more I can advise at this time. I will have my nurse provide you with written instructions and the contact information for the radiology department and the surgeon’s office. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. I believe that is all for today. I will follow up with you once the results are available. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your time and your thoroughness. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly, despite my… nervousness. I will follow your instructions and contact the offices as soon as I can. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get some rest, Mr. Raghunathan. We will be in touch.
