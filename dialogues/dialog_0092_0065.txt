DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I've been… gaining weight. And it’s rather unsettling, as I haven't changed my habits at all. It's been happening for a few months now, and I wanted to see if you could perhaps shed some light on it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight gain without changes in habits can certainly be concerning. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about how long you’ve been noticing this weight gain, and approximately how much weight we’re talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I believe, around November of last year. Perhaps a little before, but definitely noticeable by then. And… well, I’ve gained about 15 pounds, maybe a little more. It's difficult to say precisely, but enough to feel it in my clothes, certainly. It’s just…unexpected.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly eight months of gradual weight gain, about 15 pounds. And you haven't noticed any changes in your diet or exercise routine during that time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I still cook the same meals for my husband and myself – mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes, I’m afraid, though I do try to include vegetables. And I walk our dog every evening, like I always have. About the same distance, the same pace…everything is as it always has been. It’s… frankly, quite worrying. I haven’t a clue what could be causing this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you’ve been consistent with your walking, that's excellent. To rule out any underlying medical causes, let’s go through a more detailed history. I’d like to ask about other symptoms you may be experiencing. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, mood, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, well… my energy levels have been a bit lower, I suppose. I find myself feeling more tired by the end of the day, needing to rest more often. My mood… I wouldn’t say it’s significantly different, but perhaps a little more irritable than usual. And my sleep… yes, I’ve been having some trouble staying asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and struggle to get back to it sometimes. Though I always get to sleep easily enough. It's not a major problem, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Those symptoms can sometimes be related. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No diabetes, no thyroid problems, and my blood pressure has always been normal whenever the doctor has checked it. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was many years ago, and I fully recovered. Other than that, nothing significant. I don’t take any regular medications either.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid needing any surgeries. Just the usual childhood vaccinations, and a wisdom tooth removed when I was quite young. Nothing else. My husband, he’s had a knee replacement, but I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… my mother had some heart trouble later in life, high blood pressure mostly, and my father… he had arthritis, quite badly, towards the end. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… diabetes, I believe. Type 2. But that's about all that comes to mind, really. There wasn’t a lot of talk about medical history in my family when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That's helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. I’ve never been a smoker, and I don’t particularly enjoy drinking. My husband enjoys a beer now and then, but I prefer tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I’ve never had a problem with any medications I’ve taken in the past – a headache tablet now and then, that’s all. Is there anything else you need to know? I'm trying to recall everything...I do want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers the essential questions for now. Thank you for being so thorough, Ms. Selbitschka. It sounds like you've been very consistent with your lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid gland, and take your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll check your height and weight. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. It's good to know we're getting closer to understanding what might be causing this weight gain. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lungs are clear, good airflow. Now, let's check your thyroid. This might feel a little strange. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or nodules. Now, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated but not significantly concerning. And your pulse is 72, regular. Finally, let me measure your height and weight. Your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 83 kilograms. Your BMI is 34.5, which puts you in the obese category. Okay, Ms. Selbitschka. Those are the initial findings. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Given your weight gain, slightly elevated blood pressure, and family history, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol levels. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Blood tests seem like a sensible next step. Anything that can help pinpoint the cause, I’m all for. I understand it's a process, and I appreciate you being thorough. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write the lab order now. Here’s the requisition. You’ll need to take this to the lab downstairs. They’ll draw a small sample of blood. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Fasting is required for this test – so, please do not eat or drink anything except water for eight hours before your appointment. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with your regular walking routine and focusing on incorporating more vegetables into your diet. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Eight hours fasting, I understand. And I will certainly continue the walking and try to add more vegetables. Thank you very much for your time and attention, Doctor. I feel much better having started this process, and I appreciate your thoughtful approach. I’ll go down to the lab right away.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will do that. You as well. .
