DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mannie. It’s nice to meet you too. Uh… what brings me in? Let me see… Something about… sports? My wife, she signed me up for something. I think it’s a tryout… for a team? Old man team, maybe? I forget the details. She’s very good at keeping track of things, but I... don't.
DOCTOR: Right, a tryout. And when did your wife mention this tryout was scheduled for, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… scheduled… Not long ago, I think. Maybe last week? Or the week before? She told me, definitely. We were having… coffee, I believe. Yes, coffee and those little biscuits she makes… but the date… that part is gone from me. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. It's just… things slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mannie. These things happen. It’s very common. And no need to apologize. Now, is this tryout for a sport you've played before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Played plenty of sports. When I was a young man, I loved… baseball, I think. And some… football? Not the fancy kind you see on TV now, though. More… rough and tumble. It was a long time ago, though. I haven't swung a bat or thrown a ball in… well, a very long time. My knees aren't what they used to be, that’s for sure. It’s more for fun now, I guess. If I can even make the team.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort currently, perhaps in your knees, or anywhere else, that might be relevant to this tryout?
PATIENT: Well… My knees do ache sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And my back… a little stiff in the mornings. Nothing terrible, you understand. Just… old age, I suppose. I take some little pills now and then, helps a bit. My wife, she keeps track of those too. I wouldn’t want to go out there and pull a muscle or something. That wouldn’t be good. Is… is that something you check for, Doctor? Pulling muscles?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mannie, we certainly do. It’s important to assess your overall physical condition before undertaking any new activity, especially at your age. Let’s start with a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. A quick look, you say? That’s fine with me. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… be gentle with the knees, if you wouldn’t mind. They've seen a lot of years! Where do you want me to start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table for me, please. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we can take a look at those knees. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not lately. I had a little sniffle, maybe a month ago? But nothing serious. Just a little cough. My wife made me some tea with honey. That always fixes me right up. It's a bit high, isn't it? But I manage. And no, no serious illnesses. I try to stay healthy, you know? For my wife. And… for trying out, I suppose. Although I don't know if I'm up to much running.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And we’ll take things at your pace, Mannie. No pressure at all. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, if you could just take a deep breath for me… Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, but a slight murmur. We may want to investigate that further down the line, but for now, it doesn’t seem to be causing any issues. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Could you bend them for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Oh, that’s… that’s not as easy as it used to be. They feel a little stiff. And they crack a bit, you know? Like… little pebbles rubbing together. I don’t know if that’s good or bad. My wife says it’s just age, but she always says that. Is cracking bad, Doctor? It doesn’t hurt, really, just… feels old.
DOCTOR: I see. There’s a slight crepitus – that’s the cracking sound you’re describing – which is common with age and wear and tear. No significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not drastically so. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me see. I don’t think so. I had a rash once, when I was a boy, but I don’t remember what caused it. My wife usually handles the medicine. She knows all about that sort of thing. She always asks before I take anything. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, but… if she said I was, then I definitely wouldn't take it. She's very careful. Is that good enough, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mannie. It’s good that your wife keeps track of things. And it’s always best to err on the side of caution. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the red one. And sometimes, when my knees are really aching, I take… a white one? My wife, she gives it to me with water. And sometimes, a little something for… my stomach? It's a tiny blue pill. But that’s not every day. Mostly, just the red one. And the white one when my knees bother me. She writes it all down, though. She really does. She’s a lifesaver, that woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a red pill for blood pressure, a white pill for knee pain, and a blue pill for your stomach as needed. We’ll get a complete list from your wife to ensure we have everything correct. Now, to summarize, you’re here because your wife signed you up for a sports tryout, you have a slight murmur, some knee pain, and you’re taking medication for blood pressure, knee pain, and your stomach. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds right. You remembered everything! My wife would be so impressed. She always says I forget things. The murmur… I hadn't even noticed that. And the knee pain… well, that’s just old age, I suppose. Yes, that sounds right. You've got it all. So… what happens next? Do I get to try out now? Or do I need more pills?
DOCTOR: No, no more pills right now, Mannie. We’re not quite ready for the tryout yet. Before you start any strenuous activity, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm more closely. And, while the tests are being done, I’d also like you to see a cardiologist, just to get their opinion on that murmur. It’s likely nothing serious, but it’s always best to be thorough. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… and a heart doctor? Oh dear. Is something wrong, Doctor? I feel alright, mostly. Just a little stiff in the mornings. My wife… she’ll be concerned. She’s very protective. Tests and a heart doctor… that sounds serious. Will it take long? And will it be expensive? I just want to play a little sports… is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mannie. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious when you hear about tests and specialists. But please, don’t worry. These are just precautionary measures. The tests are simple blood work, and the EKG is a painless procedure that records your heart’s electrical activity. The cardiologist will simply review your heart murmur and determine if any further investigation is needed. Most likely, it’s nothing to worry about. We just want to be certain before you start any strenuous activity. As for the cost, we'll submit the tests to your insurance, and we'll discuss any potential out-of-pocket expenses with you beforehand. The goal here is to ensure you’re healthy and safe, Mannie. We want you to enjoy your sports tryout without any worries. And playing sports is absolutely not too much to ask! It’s wonderful for your health and well-being. Does that make you feel a little better?
PATIENT: Insurance… yes, that’s good. My wife handles all that too. And you think it’s probably nothing serious? Just a little… check-up? A little check-up sounds alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't want to miss my coffee with my wife. And… if the heart doctor says it's okay, can I try out then? Just a little bit? I just want to see if I can still swing a bat. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mannie, that's exactly right. Just a little check-up. We'll get the tests scheduled as soon as possible, and I'll refer you to a cardiologist. Once we have their feedback, and if everything looks good, you can absolutely try out. We'll even discuss a safe way to start, perhaps with some light exercise and stretching before jumping into a full practice. I'll give you a written list of the tests and the cardiologist's information. And, if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Now, do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. My wife will be very happy to hear all this. And… thank you. For not laughing at an old man who wants to play sports. And for taking good care of me. I think… I think that’s all. Unless… will the tests make me tired? I don't want to miss coffee. It's very important coffee.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mannie. And no, the tests shouldn’t make you tired at all. It’s just a small blood sample, and the EKG is a quick and painless procedure. You’ll be able to enjoy your coffee with your wife without any problems. Alright then, I’ll have my assistant schedule those tests for you, and we’ll get the referral to the cardiologist sent over. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mannie. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And… good luck with the tryout!
