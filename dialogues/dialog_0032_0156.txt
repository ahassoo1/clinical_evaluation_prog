DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nahrwold. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too, I think. Well, it’s… my stomach. It’s been acting up. Like, a lot of… you know… diarrhea. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's just… persistent. I can't really remember when it started exactly, but definitely a few weeks, maybe more? It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. "Acting up" can mean many things, Ms. Nahrwold. Could you be more specific about the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Um, specific… Okay, well, it’s… watery. And frequent. Like, I have to go a lot. More than usual, definitely. And… it’s not just once or twice a day, it’s… throughout the day. And sometimes at night. It’s… disruptive. Does that make sense? I don't really… keep track, to be honest. It just is. I’m married, by the way, if that’s… relevant. I don’t know what’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Frequent and watery… Disruptive is certainly a descriptive term. Has there been any blood in your stool, Ms. Nahrwold?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I… I don’t think so. Maybe? It’s hard to say. Sometimes things just… look a little different, you know? But like, bright red? No, I don't think so. It’s… hard to tell, honestly. I usually just… go and then move on. Does that sound… bad? I don't really look closely, if you know what I mean. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Ms. Nahrwold. But we will work through this. You mentioned it’s been going on for “a while.” Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. I think… sometimes if I eat something… rich? Like, really fatty foods? Or… dairy? It seems to make it worse. But then again, sometimes it happens even if I haven't eaten anything unusual. It's… inconsistent. I don’t really know what triggers it. I try to avoid… things that upset my stomach, but I don’t always know what those things are. My husband tries to help, but… well. He doesn’t always understand.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Um… sometimes I feel a little tired. But I also work, you know? So I’m always a little tired. And… sometimes my stomach cramps. Not like, really bad pain, but… uncomfortable. And I’ve been… going to the bathroom more often in general, even when it’s not… diarrhea. Just… needing to pee more. Does that count? I also think I’ve lost a little weight, but I haven't really weighed myself recently. Medicare covers me, by the way, if that’s important. I’m just… not sure what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You mentioned weight loss. Could you give me a rough estimate of how much weight you believe you've lost?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That’s… hard to say. I don’t really weigh myself. But… my clothes feel a little looser, I guess? Maybe… five or ten pounds? It’s not a lot, but… enough to notice. My husband said something about it, but he also… tends to exaggerate. He's a bit dramatic. It’s just… I’m smaller, I think. I also feel a little weaker, maybe? I don’t know. It’s all a bit… vague, I’m sorry. I don’t really pay attention to those sorts of things. Is this… normal? I mean, for this to happen?
DOCTOR: “Vague” is not particularly helpful, Ms. Nahrwold. We need to be more precise if we are to determine the cause of your symptoms. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic… medical conditions? Um… Well, the doctor… a few years ago, they said something about… my intestines? Something about inflammation. They said it was… IBD, I think? Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Or maybe… Celiac Disease? Something like that. It was a while ago, and I don’t remember all the details. I was on some medication for it, but I stopped taking it a long time ago. It didn’t seem to be… doing much. Does that… count? I'm married, if you need to know. It feels like that's relevant somehow. I just… don’t remember everything. I'm really sorry.
DOCTOR: IBD… and you stopped taking medication for it?
PATIENT: Yes. A while ago. The doctor said… it was okay to stop, I think? Or maybe I just… stopped taking it because it wasn’t helping. I can’t really remember. It didn’t make me feel any better, and it had… side effects? I think. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the specifics. My husband thought it was a bad idea, but… well, he worries a lot. It was… a few years ago, maybe five or six? I don't really keep track of dates. Does that… matter? Is it bad that I stopped taking it? I’m really not sure what I’m doing here, honestly. Medicare covers most of it, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, discontinuing medication for a chronic condition like IBD without proper medical supervision is… not advisable. Do you recall which medication you were prescribed?
PATIENT: Um… Oh gosh. That’s a good question. It was… a pill? A small, white pill? I think. It had a name, but… I really don’t remember. I think it started with an “A”? Or maybe a “Z”? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention. The doctor… just gave it to me and I took it. My husband tried to help me remember, but he’s not very good with names either. He gets easily distracted. It didn't seem to do anything, honestly. That’s why I stopped taking it. Is it… really that bad? I didn't want to keep taking something that wasn't helping. I'm really sorry. I feel like I'm not being very helpful at all. Perhaps I should just go home? Medicare is good, though...that's something positive, right?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, with all due respect, your lack of attention to your medical history is… concerning. I need to know what medication you were taking. This is crucial. Do you have any records from your previous doctor?
PATIENT: Records? Um… I don’t think so. We moved a few years ago, and I think I lost a lot of things in the move. I’m really sorry. I just… don’t keep track of those sorts of things. I wasn’t very good at organizing things even before the move. My husband handles most of the paperwork, but… he’s not very organized either. I think the doctor’s office might have records? But I don’t remember which doctor’s office. It was… a long time ago. I really wish I could be more helpful. I just… have a terrible memory. It's like… things just slip away. And I get flustered easily. Maybe… maybe I should just try to eat bland foods? And drink more water? Is that a good idea? Medicare should cover any tests you need, right? It's just… a lot to keep track of. I’m married, you know, if that helps somehow.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, I am going to need you to obtain your medical records from your previous physician. Until I have that information, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to properly assess your condition. I will give you a form with instructions on how to do so. In the meantime, I will order a stool sample to rule out any acute infection. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: A form? Oh… okay. Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I’ve never really… had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stomach ache sometimes? But nothing serious. I mean, I have this diarrhea now, but… I don’t think that’s an allergy. It just… is. My husband is allergic to pollen, though. Does that count? He sneezes a lot in the spring. This is… a lot to remember. And I’m already flustered. Medicare covers emergency visits, right? Just in case?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Nahrwold, your husband's allergies are irrelevant. We are discussing your medical history. I need to know if you have any adverse reactions to medication. Have you ever been prescribed an antibiotic that caused a rash?
PATIENT: An… antibiotic? Um… Maybe? I think so. A long time ago. For… something? I really don’t remember. It was probably a small, white pill, like everything else. I don't think it caused a rash… but maybe? It's so hard to remember. I don't recall feeling any different, really. I was probably just feeling sick at the time. I'm really sorry. My memory is just… terrible. It's like trying to grasp smoke. And I get so flustered easily. My husband said I had a fever once, but I don't remember that either. He's very good at remembering things like that. Medicare is pretty good, isn’t it? At least I have that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nahrwold, with all due respect, this is unproductive. I am ordering the stool sample as requested. I strongly advise you to obtain your medical records. Without that information, I am limited in my ability to provide you with appropriate care. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… no. I don’t think so. Just… will the stool sample hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? And… will Medicare cover it? I'm really sorry for being so… unhelpful. And for taking up your time. My husband said I ask too many questions, but… I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: The stool sample collection is non-invasive, Ms. Nahrwold. A kit will be provided with instructions. Results typically take 3-5 business days. And yes, Medicare should cover it, provided it is deemed medically necessary. I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and your medical records, if you are able to obtain them. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: One week… Okay. Will… will I need to fast before the appointment? Or… bring anything with me? And… is there anything I should avoid eating in the meantime? Like… dairy? Or… fatty foods? Just… anything that might… make things worse? I’m really trying to be helpful, I promise. And… I will try to get the records. It might take a while, though. And… thank you. For everything. My husband will be very relieved.
DOCTOR: No fasting is required for the follow-up appointment. Avoid any foods that you know exacerbate your symptoms. Continue to hydrate and focus on obtaining your medical records. I will see you in one week. Please call the office if you have any urgent concerns.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I will try to get the records. And… thank you again. .
