DOCTOR: Right, Bianca Ziccarelli. Sixty-three years old. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, is just... I does be really thirsty all the time. And hungry. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I could eat more. Is happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It just getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Thirsty and hungry, even after eating. And it's been going on for about a month, getting worse. Alright. Now, when you say “thirsty,” how much fluid are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, is not like a little sip here and there, Doctor. I does drink a whole large bottle of water, sometimes two, and still feel dry. And I does like my juice too, you know? A big glass. And I still feel like I need more. More than usual, certainly. I used to drink just a little with my meals, but now... it's all the time. It bothering me, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. A large bottle, sometimes two, and a large glass of juice, and still feeling thirsty. That is quite a bit. Now, are you also going to the bathroom more often than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is true. I does be running to the bathroom more. Especially at night. It wake me up sometimes, you know? I have to get up and go. It not a little sprinkle either, if you know what I mean. Is a good amount each time. It's tiring, honestly. I not sleeping as well as I used to.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst, increased urination, especially at night... Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm... let me see. I does wear glasses, you know? For reading mostly. But no, I don't think so. Not really. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always just figure is the glasses needing cleaning. Or maybe just the light not good enough. I haven't noticed anything different, if that makes sense? I still can see, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you lost any weight recently, without trying?
PATIENT: Weight? Well... now that you mention it... my clothes does feel a little looser. I haven't actually weigh myself, you know? I don't really bother with scales. But my husband, he say I looking a little thinner. Not much, but he notice. He always notice things like that. But I haven't been trying to lose weight, certainly not! I does enjoy my food too much for that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased thirst, increased urination, especially at night, unintentional weight loss, and clothes feeling looser. Now, have you been feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is true too! I does feel so drag all the time. Even after a good night sleep - or what should be a good night sleep, with me getting up to the bathroom so much! - I still feel like I could sleep for another few hours. I used to have plenty energy, you know? I does enjoy gardening and cooking, but lately, is just… hard to get going. I does just want to sit down. Is tiring, everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. This is starting to paint a bit of a picture. Now, I’m going to ask you about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes before?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. Not that I know of. I does go to the doctor for check-ups when I need to, you know? And nobody ever tell me anything about diabetes. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but not diabetes. And my father… he just passed away last year, old age mostly. But no diabetes in my family that I know of. I hope is not that, you know? Is a bad thing, I hear.
DOCTOR: Alright. No history of diabetes in yourself or your immediate family. Now, what about any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I does have a little trouble with my joints sometimes, you know? My knees and hips. The doctor say is just old age, arthritis. I take some tablets for it, helps a little. And I had the flu last year, bad one, but I recovered. Otherwise, I does try to stay healthy, you know? I eat a good diet, mostly, and I walk when I can. Is just this thirst and tiredness bothering me now.
DOCTOR: Arthritis, managed with medication. No other significant medical history. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the ones for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Just the tablets for my joints, Doctor. Is a white one, I think. And a small blue one. I does take them every morning with my breakfast. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many tablets, you know? I try to avoid it if I can. Is better to be natural, if possible. But the arthritis, is bad sometimes, so I take the tablets when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the arthritis medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I does eat everything, you know? I like all sorts of food! And I haven't ever had a bad reaction to any tablets before. I does watch out, though. If I feel anything funny, I stop taking it right away. But I haven't ever had any allergies, not that I know of. I does be careful, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, you know? I does just want to find out what is causing this thirst and tiredness. Is making me worry, to be honest. So, yes, please, do whatever you need to do. I ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table for me. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is 88, regular. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Now, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your skin lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I does put lotion on every day, you know? Keeps it nice and smooth. But no, I haven't noticed any changes. No rashes or anything like that. Sometimes it gets a little dry in the sun, but that's all. I does try to stay out of the sun when I can. Is too hot these days, you know? Nothing else, though. Just normal skin, I think. I hope so, anyway. Is something wrong? You looking worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no, not necessarily worried. Just… gathering information. Now, I'm going to order a blood test and a urine test. The blood test will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolytes. The urine test will check for glucose and other things. It'll help me figure out what’s causing your symptoms. Do you have any problems with giving blood?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no problems at all. I does give blood when they have a drive, you know? Helps people. Never had any trouble with it. I does get a little dizzy sometimes, but that's all. I always sit down for a bit afterwards. But no, I can give blood, no problem. Is just a little prick, right? I can handle that. You think is something bad? Is it diabetes, Doctor? You have to tell me, you know. I want to know.
DOCTOR: Well, Bianca, your symptoms – the increased thirst, frequent urination, unintentional weight loss, and fatigue – are suggestive of diabetes. But we need the test results to confirm that. It could be something else, but diabetes is certainly a possibility. I'll get the lab orders sent over to the nurse and she'll get you set up. It will be a fasting blood sugar test, so you’ll need to avoid eating or drinking anything – except water – for eight hours beforehand. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Eight hours? No food at all? Oh dear. Well, I does get hungry easily, you know? But yes, I understand. No food, only water. Eight hours. Is a long time. When will I get the results, Doctor? And if is diabetes… what does that mean? Will I be sick? Will I have to take injections? Oh dear, oh dear... this is worrying me so much. I hope is not too bad. Is there anything I can do now, to help? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Now, now, let's not jump to conclusions. We don't know anything for sure yet. And even if it is diabetes, it's a manageable condition. Many people live long and healthy lives with diabetes. The nurse will schedule you for the blood test and will let you know when you can expect the results. It usually takes a couple of days. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of water – that's good regardless. And try not to stress too much. Stress can actually make things worse. Until we have the results, there’s not much else you can do, other than to keep an eye on your symptoms and rest when you need to. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are in, and we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Plenty of water... and try not to stress. Easier said than done, you know? But I will try. And you will call me as soon as you get the results? Not a long wait, I hope? And if is diabetes... you will help me, right? You will tell me what to do? I feeling a little better now that I know you will call. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. Is a relief to talk to you, you know? Even though I still feeling worried. But thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Bianca. I will call you as soon as I have the results – I promise. And yes, I will help you every step of the way if it is diabetes. We’ll discuss your options, create a plan, and get you feeling better. That’s what I’m here for. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You answer everything I ask. I just have to wait for the results now, right? And drink plenty of water. And try not to stress. Is a lot to remember. Thank you again, Doctor. You are very kind. I will see you when you call. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca. You take care now. And try not to worry too much. I’ll be in touch soon. Goodbye.
