DOCTOR: Hi Thyra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but please call me Valerie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Valerie, it's good to meet you too. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly fine. Just so I'm clear, are you saying you're only here for paperwork, or is there something specific you wanted to discuss with me today while you're here?
PATIENT: No, just the paperwork. Medicare sent something and I figured I'd come in and get it done while I was able. Don’t want it to pile up, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. Sometimes those forms can be a bit much. Let me pull up your account… Okay, I see a notice from Medicare about an annual wellness visit. Is that what you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, that must be it. I get so many things in the mail sometimes, I don’t always know what’s what. Annual wellness visit… sounds right. Is that something I have to do?
DOCTOR: It’s not usually mandatory, no. But it's a good opportunity for us to check in, make sure everything is running smoothly health-wise, and discuss any preventative care you might need. It’s covered by Medicare, so there’s no cost to you. Would you like to go ahead and get it done today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, if it’s covered and just a check-up... I guess that wouldn’t hurt. I haven’t really been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. So, yeah, okay, let’s do it. What does it involve?
DOCTOR: Great. It’s fairly straightforward. We'll go over your medical history – any past illnesses, surgeries, medications you’re taking – and your family history. Then I’ll do a physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. We’ll also talk about some lifestyle factors, like diet and exercise. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds manageable. I can do all that. I don’t have a whole lot of medical history, thankfully. Just the usual childhood stuff, I guess. And I take a vitamin D supplement, that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Childhood illnesses and the vitamin D are a good starting point. Let's start with that medical history then. Were those childhood illnesses anything significant – like, did you ever have pneumonia, rheumatic fever, anything that required a hospital stay?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the normal stuff kids get. Chickenpox, measles… you know. Nothing serious. I was a pretty healthy kid, actually. Mom always said I had a strong immune system.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Okay, so no major illnesses or hospitalizations. And you mentioned a vitamin D supplement – how much do you take and how often?
PATIENT: Just one of those little gummy vitamins every day with my breakfast. I think it’s 2000 IU, but I'd have to look at the bottle to be sure. My doctor back home suggested it, 'cause I don’t get a lot of sun. We live up north, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, makes sense. Vitamin D deficiency is pretty common in areas with limited sunlight. Okay, so 2000 IU daily. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandma on my mother's side had diabetes, I think. And my uncle… he had some kind of heart trouble when he was older. But other than that, not really. Mostly just people living long lives, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes in your maternal grandmother and heart trouble in an uncle. Do you happen to know what type of diabetes your grandmother had, or what kind of heart trouble your uncle experienced?
PATIENT: You know, I honestly don't. I was pretty young when my grandma got sick, and my uncle… he lived pretty far away, so I didn’t see him much. I just know they had those conditions. I could ask my mom, I guess, if it's important.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Knowing something is better than nothing, and we can always follow up if needed. Okay, let's move on to some basic lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mom wouldn't allow it, even when I was a teenager! And I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t go to the gym or anything fancy. But I try to stay active. I do a lot of walking, mostly. And I help my husband with things around the house, you know, gardening, taking care of the animals. It’s not a structured workout, but I’m not sitting around all day either.
DOCTOR: That sounds good, staying active is important. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, let me just ask about any allergies you might have – to medications, food, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's excellent. No allergies. Alright, so it sounds like you're generally pretty healthy. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… weird, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. If you’d like, you can sit up on the table and we can get started. First, let’s take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. I always get a little nervous with the blood pressure thing, but I know it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay… blood pressure is 132/84. A little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, breathing... breathing... Is that normal? It feels kind of cold.
DOCTOR: Apologies about the temperature, sometimes the metal is a little cold. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds that I hear. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Everything sounds good so far. Now, let's just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide for me, please. Ah…
PATIENT: Ugh, I always hate this part. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears also look clear, no sign of infection. Everything looks good, thankfully. Alright, everything I’ve checked so far looks normal. I'm going to document these findings. Blood pressure 132/84, heart and lungs clear, ears and throat clear. No acute concerns noted.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear. I was worried for a minute there. What about… you know, blood tests? Do I need any of those? My mom always gets a bunch of blood tests done.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, and it depends on a few things. Because this is an annual wellness visit, Medicare does cover some routine screening tests. We could do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We could also check your cholesterol levels. And depending on your age and risk factors, we might consider a lipid panel. Do any of those sound particularly concerning to you, or is there anything specific your mom gets checked that you'd like me to consider?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mom usually gets everything, so... maybe the cholesterol and the sugar one? I don't know if I'm at risk for anything, I guess. I try to eat pretty healthy, but you know, I do like my frybread sometimes. It's probably good to just get it checked, right? Better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, it’s always better to be safe than sorry. And the frybread is perfectly okay in moderation! Okay, so we’ll add a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel to the order. We just need a small blood sample from your arm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Small sample, right? Let’s just get it over with. Where do I need to go?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a small sample. If you go down that hallway to the last door on the left, that’s the phlebotomy lab. The phlebotomist, Sarah, will take care of you. Just tell her Dr. Hernandez ordered a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel for your annual wellness visit. It should only take a few minutes. I’ll meet you back here once you’re done, and we can discuss the results when they come back. Do you have any questions before you head down there?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Thanks, Dr. Hernandez. You’ve been really helpful. I’ll go find Sarah.
DOCTOR: Great. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask Sarah if you have any concerns. I’ll be here when you get back.
