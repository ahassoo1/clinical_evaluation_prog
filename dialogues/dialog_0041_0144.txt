DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Polczynski, but please, call me Derell. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Derell, is it? Yes, right. Well, honestly, I don’t really need anything. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted I come. Said I should “get checked out.” You know how kids are. Always fussing. Just thought I’d see what all the fuss was about, I suppose. It's a very nice office, though. Very… clean.
DOCTOR: Well, it's always good to be proactive, even if it's at the insistence of a concerned daughter! And thank you, we do try to keep things tidy. So, even though you don’t feel like you need anything specific, maybe we can just do a general check-up?
PATIENT: A general check-up… hmm. I suppose that's alright. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I've had… procedures, you know. Lots of them. Back when my husband was still around, he always took care of all that. I don’t really remember what they did, exactly. Just… a lot of beeping and things. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We'll take things very slow and easy. We absolutely won’t do anything you’re not comfortable with. And I understand about not remembering details – that’s perfectly normal. We can definitely go at your pace. It shouldn't be painful, but some parts might be a little uncomfortable, like listening to your heart or lungs. I'll explain everything before we do it, okay?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… good to hear. Explaining things is good. I hate being surprised, you know? Always liked knowing what was going on. Though, honestly, I can barely remember what I had for breakfast this morning, let alone what happened at the hospital. Is this going to take long? I have a mahjong game later with the girls, and Agnes gets very upset if I’m late. She’s a stickler for time, that one.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll try to keep it as brief as possible, Ms. Calvery. I can’t give you an exact time, as it depends on what we find, but I'll be mindful of your mahjong game. We can definitely prioritize getting you out of here in time. Perhaps we can start with a few questions about your general health?
PATIENT: Questions, alright. As long as they’re not too personal. I’m a private person, you know. And please don't expect me to remember everything. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and truthfully, it wasn't great even when it was new. What sort of questions are we talking about? Something about my aches and pains? Because, honestly, everything aches these days. It comes with getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We’ll take it very slow, and I won’t push you to remember anything you’re not comfortable with. And yes, we can certainly talk about any aches and pains you’re experiencing. It’s completely normal to have some discomfort as we get older. Let’s start simple. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Well… “well” is a relative term, isn't it? I haven’t been sick sick, if that's what you mean. No fevers, no coughs. Just… tired. Always tired. And a bit achy, as I said. It’s probably just the weather. This humidity is dreadful. Makes my bones feel like they're filled with lead. And my daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more vegetables. Honestly, the woman is relentless. Is that what you need to know? If I’m feeling “well”? Because, truthfully, I’m mostly just trying to avoid upsetting my daughter.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Calvery. It sounds like you’re experiencing some fatigue and aches, and that your daughter is rightly concerned about your overall well-being. Do you have any trouble with breathing, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, not really. Sometimes I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but who doesn’t? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. And chest pain… hmm. Occasionally. Just a little flutter, really. It comes and goes. I always thought it was just… indigestion. I had a rather large plate of kimchi last week. Perhaps that was it? Honestly, I don’t make a fuss over every little thing. My husband used to say I was too stoic. He was a good man. Is this important? Should I be worried about this flutter?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mention that, Ms. Calvery. Any chest discomfort, even if you think it’s just indigestion, is worth checking out. And it's very common for women to experience chest pain differently than men, so it's always best to be thorough. Just to be sure, can you describe the flutter?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. Well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like… a little bird flapping around in my chest. A very small bird, mind you. And it doesn’t last long. Just a few seconds, maybe. It happens when I’m… exerting myself, I suppose. Like when I’m gardening, or trying to keep up with my granddaughter. She’s a whirlwind, that one. Always running around. Honestly, I think I’m just getting old. Is that it? Is it just old age? I’ve lived a long life, you know. A good life. But things start to wear out, don’t they?
DOCTOR: That's a helpful description, Ms. Calvery. And you’re right, things can certainly wear out with age. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying causes for the fluttering. To get a better understanding, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my heart and lungs… well, alright. I suppose so. Just… be gentle, alright? And don’t be surprised if you hear things. I’ve had a lot of… things done to my chest over the years. All sorts of beeping and whistling. It’s probably just echoes from the past. Do I need to take off my blouse? Or can you listen through it? Honestly, I prefer not to get cold. This office is rather chilly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. We can listen through your blouse – no need to remove anything. And I will be as gentle as possible. I understand your concerns, and we'll go at your pace. Okay. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and a little bit of crackling in your lungs. It's not immediately concerning, but it's something we should investigate further. It could be a number of things, like fluid buildup or a mild infection. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray and… an EKG? Oh dear. More tests. Honestly, it never ends, does it? I’m starting to feel like a science experiment. What exactly will these tests do? Will they hurt? Will I have to lie flat on my back for hours? Because my back isn’t what it used to be, and I have mahjong later. Agnes will be furious if I miss it. And what if they find something bad? I don’t want to know if I’m… you know. I’d rather just continue living my life, enjoying my mahjong and my granddaughter, without worrying about every little ache and pain. Is there any way we can just… skip the tests? Perhaps I just need a good rest and a large plate of kimchi?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Calvery. It’s completely normal to feel anxious about tests, and I want to assure you that we’re not trying to cause you any unnecessary worry. The X-ray is a simple imaging scan that allows us to see your lungs and heart. It doesn’t involve any injections or discomfort. You’ll simply stand or lie down while the machine takes a picture. As for the EKG, it’s a quick and painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. We’ll attach a few small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. It takes just a few minutes. The reason I recommend these tests is to rule out any serious underlying conditions. It’s better to be safe and have a clear picture of what’s going on. And I promise, we won’t discuss any findings until you’re ready. If you prefer, we can wait a few days to schedule them, or if something concerning does show up, we can discuss your options and come up with a plan that you’re comfortable with. I also want to address your concerns about being comfortable. We can definitely work around your mahjong game. The tests don’t take long, and we can schedule them for a time that’s convenient for you. Would you like me to explain the possible reasons we might order these tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Possible reasons… honestly, that just sounds like more worrying. I don’t want to know about all the terrible things that could be wrong with me. I just want to be told if I need to worry or not. And I really don’t want to hear about fluid buildup or infections or… whatever else is lurking in my lungs. But… if you think it’s really necessary, alright. I suppose I can do the tests. But you have to promise me you won’t try to scare me with complicated medical terms. And you have to work around my mahjong game. Agnes will absolutely kill me if I miss it. And… can my daughter come with me? I always feel better when she’s around. She can ask the questions. I always forget what I want to ask. She's good at those things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. I promise to keep things simple and avoid any complicated medical terms. And we will definitely work around your mahjong game. I completely understand your desire to have your daughter with you – that’s perfectly fine. She can come with you to the tests and ask any questions you have. We can schedule the X-ray and EKG for tomorrow afternoon, if that works for you. It will take about an hour in total. Before we proceed, I want to ask one more question. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Sometimes, when I’m climbing the stairs, yes. But that’s just because I’m old, isn’t it? And swelling… now that you mention it, my ankles have been a bit puffy lately. But I just thought it was the heat. It’s been so humid, you know? Everything swells in this weather. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. I have more important things to worry about, like my mahjong game and my granddaughter’s school play. But if you think it’s important, alright. I’ll tell you everything. Just please don’t scare me with complicated medical terms. And make sure my daughter is there. She can write down everything you say. I always forget things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Calvery. That's very helpful. It’s good you’ve mentioned the shortness of breath and swelling – those symptoms can be related, and it’s important to investigate them further. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the exam, I suspect you may have some mild heart failure. That doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we need to monitor closely. The tests will help us determine the extent of the problem and come up with a treatment plan. Please don’t worry. Mild heart failure can often be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. It doesn't mean you can’t continue enjoying your mahjong game and your granddaughter’s school play. Let’s get those tests scheduled, and then we can discuss your options in more detail. Would tomorrow afternoon work for you and your daughter?
PATIENT: Heart… heart failure? Oh dear. That sounds… terrible. I don’t feel sick, you know? I just feel tired and achy. And my ankles are a little puffy. Is this… is this serious? Will I have to go to the hospital? Will I be able to… to continue playing mahjong? Please, Doctor, tell me everything. But please, don't scare me. And please, make sure my daughter is there. She's good at asking questions. And she can write everything down. I always forget things. Tomorrow afternoon… yes, I suppose so. But please, be gentle. And please, don't scare me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your concern. It’s natural to feel anxious when you hear the words “heart failure.” But please, let me assure you, it doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is about to stop working. It simply means that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should be. And no, you won’t have to go to the hospital unless we determine that it’s absolutely necessary. We can manage this with medication and lifestyle changes, and most people with mild heart failure are able to live full and active lives. The tests will help us determine the extent of the problem and come up with a treatment plan that’s right for you. And I promise, we’ll discuss everything in detail, and you won’t have to make any decisions until you’re comfortable. And yes, your daughter can absolutely be there with you. She can ask any questions she has and write down everything I say. We’ll take all the time you need. Let’s schedule those tests for tomorrow afternoon, and then we can discuss everything in more detail. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable and ensure that you continue enjoying your life. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Alright… alright, yes. That sounds… okay. Scheduling the tests… yes. And my daughter can come with me. She's good at asking questions. And she can write everything down. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for not scaring me. And thank you for letting my daughter come with me. She can handle all the complicated medical terms. I always forget things. Tomorrow afternoon… yes. But please, be gentle. And please, don’t scare me. And please, make sure my daughter is there. She can write everything down. And… and please, let me continue playing mahjong. It’s the only thing that keeps me sane.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. You can absolutely continue playing mahjong. That's important. We’ll do everything we can to ensure that you continue enjoying your life and doing the things you love. I’ll schedule the tests for tomorrow afternoon. I’ll have my assistant contact you with the details. And I’ll make sure your daughter is welcome to join you. Please, don’t worry. We’ll take good care of you. And remember, I’m here to answer any questions you have, and we’ll take all the time you need to make sure you’re comfortable. Now, is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. And thank you for letting my daughter come with me. She can handle all the complicated medical terms. I suppose… I suppose I should go home now. And… and prepare for the tests. And maybe… maybe practice my mahjong game. Just in case. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And… and please, don’t scare me. And please, make sure my daughter is there. She can write everything down. I… I think that’s all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Calvery. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry, I promise not to scare you. And I’ll make sure your daughter is there with you. Please, just take it easy today. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take good care of you. And remember, I’m here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery. And try to relax.
PATIENT: .
