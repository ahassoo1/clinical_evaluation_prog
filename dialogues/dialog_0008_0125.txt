DOCTOR: Good morning, Jacquille. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning. Look, it’s a bit embarrassing, but my wife suggested I come in. She worries too much, honestly. I wanted to get tested for… you know… HIV. Just to put her mind at ease, really. Though I doubt it’ll be anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive, and it's very common to get tested, especially with a partner's concerns. No need to be embarrassed at all. To start, have you had any recent exposures that would make you concerned about HIV?
PATIENT: Exposures? What do you mean? Like, needle sticks? No! I work in compliance, not… whatever. Look, I'm married. A long time married. We haven't… well, never mind. The point is, no. I haven’t needed to worry about exposures. I just want the test. Is that so hard to understand? I'm a careful person, always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. When I ask about exposures, I mean unprotected sexual contact with anyone, not just your wife. It’s important to get a complete picture, for accurate testing and counseling. It’s part of standard procedure, and all information is confidential, of course. Have you had any sexual contact with anyone other than your wife?
PATIENT: Are you seriously asking me that? Look, I'm a respectable man. I have a wife, a good job… I find this line of questioning rather insulting, to be honest. It's… frankly, it's none of your business. I came here for a simple test to appease my wife, not a personal interrogation. I’m starting to regret even coming in. What kind of doctor asks these things? It's… unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. That was not my intention. However, as your physician, it is my responsibility to gather a thorough history to ensure the most accurate testing and appropriate care. HIV testing isn’t simply a “yes/no” situation; understanding potential risk factors helps interpret the results correctly. If you’re uncomfortable discussing this further, we can proceed with the test, but I strongly advise you understand that the results may be difficult to interpret without a complete picture. Would you like me to explain the types of tests we offer and what they detect, or would you prefer to simply schedule the test?
PATIENT: Fine. Look, just… explain the tests. Quickly. And don't ask me any more personal questions. I don't need a lecture on… anything. Just tell me what they do and how long it takes. And then I want to get this over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We typically start with an antibody test, which looks for the presence of antibodies your body makes to fight HIV. It's a blood draw. It usually takes about a week to get the results back. However, it can take up to three months after a possible exposure for your body to develop enough antibodies to be detected. So, a negative result now doesn’t necessarily mean you’re negative if you were recently exposed. We can also do an antigen/antibody combination test, which detects both antibodies and parts of the virus itself. That one gives us a quicker result, usually within a few days. Would you prefer the quicker test, or are you okay with waiting a week for the antibody test?
PATIENT: Look, a week is fine. I haven't been exposed. So a week isn't going to make a difference. The quicker test sounds… unnecessary. Just do the one that takes a week, get it over with, and tell me the results. Honestly, the less I have to think about this, the better. I need a requisition form, I suppose. Is that how this works? And can we please just skip the small talk? I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. Here’s the requisition form for the blood test. You can take this to the lab across the street – they’re open until 5 PM today. They’ll draw the blood sample. The results will be sent to my office, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available – usually within a week, as we discussed. While we wait for the results, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing else. Just… thank you. I guess. I’ll go to the lab. And please, just send the results. No phone calls unless it’s absolutely necessary. I’ll handle it from there. I have to go now.
