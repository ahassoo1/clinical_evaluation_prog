DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I am here regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they are asking us to wear, and… well, I have some difficulty with them. I work as a Protective Service Worker, and I need to request an exemption, or explore alternatives, if possible. It’s a bit uncomfortable, and I want to be respectful of everyone’s health, of course, but also ensure I can do my job safely and effectively.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re needing documentation regarding mask use at your workplace, as a Protective Service Worker, and are experiencing some difficulty with them. Let's talk about that. First, can you describe what makes the masks uncomfortable for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Thank you for clarifying. It is… a few things, really. The feeling of them on my face is quite constricting, and it makes it difficult to breathe deeply, especially when I am exerting myself. My work… it requires me to be quite active at times, and I find myself short of breath more quickly with the mask on. Also, it fogs up my glasses constantly, making it hard to see clearly, and that is a safety concern in my line of work. It's not a simple discomfort, it actually impacts my ability to do my job well. I have tried different types, but the issue remains the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constriction, shortness of breath with exertion, and difficulty with vision due to fogging glasses. That's helpful. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness when wearing the masks, or any other symptoms besides the breathing and vision issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully, it hasn’t gone that far. Just the breathing and the vision. No dizziness or lightheadedness, or any other symptoms, really. It's mostly those two things – feeling like I can’t get enough air and not being able to see clearly when my glasses fog up. It makes me… anxious, honestly, to think about needing to respond quickly in a situation when I can’t see or breathe properly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been experiencing these issues with the masks?
PATIENT: It started when the mask requirements were put in place, about… six months ago, I believe. Right at the beginning of March. They initially provided us with surgical masks, and it was difficult right away. We switched to cloth masks for a while, thinking they might be better, but the problems persisted. Now they are asking us to use N95s, and it’s even more challenging. It hasn’t gotten better with time, unfortunately. It’s consistently difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of consistent difficulty with various mask types. Have you had any prior respiratory issues, like asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have always been relatively healthy. I don’t have asthma or COPD, or any other lung problems. I haven't had any trouble breathing before the masks. I do get winded sometimes when I'm exercising, but that’s just because I'm not as young as I used to be! But nothing medical, nothing diagnosed. This is entirely new since the mask requirements started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I don’t have any allergies that I am aware of. No food allergies, no seasonal allergies, nothing like that. I have never had a reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I’ve always been fortunate that way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and just do a general assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please proceed. I am happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand the need to gather information, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I just want to find a solution that works for everyone.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knabenshue, your lungs sound clear – no wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Your heart sounds are regular and strong. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart rate is 78, which is normal. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it doesn't appear there’s an underlying respiratory issue causing these problems. It sounds like you're experiencing discomfort related to mask use, and it’s impacting your ability to perform your job safely. Now, to document this properly for your workplace, I can write a note outlining your difficulties with mask use and the findings from my examination. I will also recommend exploring alternative options, if possible, and I can suggest a consultation with an occupational health specialist, if needed. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Thank you very much. A note outlining my difficulties and the examination findings would be greatly appreciated. And exploring alternative options or a consultation with a specialist would be wonderful. I just want to be able to do my job and keep everyone safe. I’m very grateful for your help with this matter.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll start drafting that note now. I'll include that you report constriction, shortness of breath with exertion, and vision impairment due to fogging glasses when wearing masks. The physical exam revealed clear lungs, regular heart sounds, normal oxygen saturation, and a slightly elevated blood pressure. I'm recommending that your workplace consider providing you with alternative mask options that may be better tolerated, such as masks with adjustable nose pieces and exhalation valves. I will also include a recommendation for a consultation with an occupational health specialist to assess your workplace environment and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything very thoroughly. That sounds excellent, and I appreciate you taking the time to document everything so carefully. I don't have any further questions at this time. Would I receive a copy of this note for my records? And how will it be sent to my workplace?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You’ll receive a copy of the note for your records. I can either print one out for you now, or I can send it electronically to the email address we have on file. Regarding sending it to your workplace, do you have a specific email address or fax number I should use?
PATIENT: Printing a copy for me would be wonderful, Doctor, thank you. As for my workplace, the best email address to use is supervisor.jensen@protective.services. It’s my direct supervisor. Thank you again for your help with this, I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This outlines everything we discussed. I've also included a brief statement regarding the potential impact of mask use on your job performance. I’ll send a copy to supervisor.jensen@protective.services as well. If you don’t see any improvement with alternative mask options, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. We can discuss further testing or referral to an occupational health specialist at that time. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor Alzoubi. This is perfect. I feel much better having this documentation. I truly appreciate your time and understanding. No, there is nothing further you can assist me with today. I will let you know if anything changes. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm glad I could help. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a good day as well. .
