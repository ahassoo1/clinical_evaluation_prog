DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. My goodness, time just… slips away, doesn’t it? Well, to be frank, it’s my stomach. Been having some quite dreadful pains, lower down. It comes and goes, but when it comes… it’s not pleasant at all. I believe the last doctor mentioned something about… well, a condition I have. Something about the body attacking itself? It’s all rather muddled in my mind, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach pains, lower down, coming and going. And you mentioned a previous doctor talked about a condition where your body attacks itself… that sounds like you might have been diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease, possibly Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis. Do you recall anything else about that diagnosis?
PATIENT: Oh dear, those names… they don’t quite ring a bell, I’m afraid. It was some years ago now, and my memory… well, it isn’t what it used to be. I do recall a lot of blood tests, and feeling very tired. And something about my joints aching? It was all quite a difficult time. I believe I was told it was… systemic? That’s the word, isn’t it? Affecting the whole system? Honestly, Doctor, I wish I could be of more help. It feels like a fog sometimes, trying to remember.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Alese. It’s perfectly understandable to not remember everything, especially if it was a while ago. “Systemic” does fit with those conditions – they can affect more than just the stomach and intestines. Okay, so we've got stomach pain, tiredness, and joint pain in the past, potentially related to something like Crohn's or Ulcerative Colitis. Right now, can you tell me more about this stomach pain?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, it’s… a cramping sort of pain, mostly. Like a very tight squeezing. It usually starts low down, on the right side, I think, though sometimes it’s hard to pinpoint. And it comes in waves, really. It’ll be quite bad for a little while, then ease off, then come back again. It doesn’t seem to be connected to what I’m eating, thankfully. I’ve tried to keep track, but I haven’t noticed a pattern. It's been… worse lately, I suppose. More frequent, and lasting longer each time. I haven’t had a fever, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping pain, lower right side, comes in waves, no clear connection to food, and worsening recently. No fever, that’s good. And you said it’s been happening for a while – how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It’s… come and gone over the years, really. I suppose the really bad spells, the ones that are concerning me now, have been happening for… oh, maybe the last six months? But I’ve had milder discomfort on and off for… well, perhaps a couple of years. It’s hard to say precisely. Everything seems to blend together after a while, you know? I’m sorry I can't give you a more definite answer.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Alese. Six months of worsening symptoms is what I need to know. And it sounds like you've been dealing with this on and off for a while longer. Let’s talk a little bit about your other health history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor did mention something about my immune system being a bit… overactive, as he put it. That’s connected to the stomach troubles, I believe. And I have… I think it's called SLE? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus? Yes, that's it. I've been under a specialist for that for some time now. I take medication for it, thankfully. Other than that… I don’t believe so. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Though, truthfully, it’s hard to tell what’s Lupus and what’s… just me!
DOCTOR: Okay, so SLE, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and you're currently being treated for that. That's very important information. It explains a lot. And you're right, Lupus can certainly cause a wide range of symptoms, making it tricky to pinpoint what's going on. What medications are you currently taking for the Lupus?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me see if I can recall… I have a list somewhere, I’m sure. Just a moment… … Ah, here we are! It's a bit crumpled, I apologize. Let’s see… I take… hydroxychloroquine, 200mg daily. And… prednisone, 5mg, though the dosage varies depending on how I’m feeling. Sometimes it’s 10mg, sometimes less. And… oh, yes, methotrexate, 15mg once a week. I believe those are the main ones. I also take some vitamins, but nothing specific for the Lupus, I don’t think. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Alese. Hydroxychloroquine, Prednisone , and Methotrexate. Okay. And you mentioned taking vitamins. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've never had any allergic reactions to anything, as far as I know. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t noticed any sensitivities to plants or anything like that. I suppose I’m quite lucky in that regard. It’s one less thing to worry about, isn’t it? I’m generally quite robust, despite everything!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Alese. No known allergies is certainly helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members with autoimmune diseases, digestive problems, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a bit of a tricky question. My family… well, we weren’t very forthcoming with medical information, if I’m honest. My mother… she had some sort of arthritis, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? But she didn’t talk about it much. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Nothing major, as far as I know. No one ever really discussed illnesses, really. It wasn’t really the done thing. So, I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer you, Doctor. I apologize. It’s frustrating, I know, but that’s just how it was.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Alese. It’s understandable that family medical history isn’t always readily available. Okay, and finally, just a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life, and I don't drink alcohol. Never appealed to me, really. And recreational drugs… goodness no! I’m a very simple sort of person, Doctor. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, thank you very much. I live alone, quite peacefully. I keep myself busy with gardening and… well, just taking things easy these days. I used to be a ship engineer, you know. A very demanding job, but I enjoyed it. But now… I’m quite content with a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Non-smoker, no alcohol, no recreational drugs, and enjoying a quiet life. Alright, Alese, thank you for all of that information. That gives me a really good picture of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I'll feel your abdomen to see if we can pinpoint where the pain is coming from. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I’m quite used to examinations, having been under a doctor’s care for so long. Just… try to be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. My stomach is rather tender at the moment. But please, don't hesitate to let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Alese. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. … Is that alright, Doctor? I sometimes feel a little breathless, but it's probably just my age.
DOCTOR: Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, let's check your abdomen. I'm going to gently press on different areas. Please let me know immediately if you feel any pain, and where exactly it is. We'll start on the right side… … Does that bother you at all?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, that's… quite tender, actually. Right there, yes. A bit of a sharp pain, really. Not excruciating, but definitely noticeable. It feels… almost like a cramping sensation, even with the gentle pressure. It’s a bit higher up than I expected, though. Almost… under my ribs? Is that possible, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right lower quadrant, a bit higher up, almost under the ribs. It does sound like there’s some discomfort in that area. And you're right, it's possible for referred pain to be felt higher up. …Any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. The left side feels… fine, actually. A little bit of general discomfort, perhaps, but nothing like the pain on the right. And the upper abdomen… no, that doesn’t bother me at all. It’s definitely concentrated on the right side, Doctor. It’s been like that for a while now. It feels… almost like something is pressing, rather than cramping. Is that possible? A feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much?
DOCTOR: Okay, right lower quadrant tenderness is the most significant finding. The feeling of fullness even without eating much is important information, Alese. I'm not detecting any significant guarding or rebound tenderness at this time, which is good. Alright, Alese. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. Given your history of SLE and the pain in your right lower quadrant, we need to consider a few things. It could be related to your Lupus, such as serositis causing inflammation in the abdominal lining. It could also be something separate, like diverticulitis or even a gallbladder issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests and a CT scan… it all sounds rather serious, doesn’t it? But yes, Doctor, please do whatever you think is necessary. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s better to know what we’re dealing with, even if it’s not good news. Just… try to be quick about it, if you can. I don’t handle medical procedures very well, if I’m honest. And please, let me know what you find. I like to be kept informed, even if it’s just a little bit.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alese. I understand your anxiety, and I will definitely keep you informed every step of the way. The blood tests will help us assess your inflammation levels and rule out any infection. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your abdomen and help us identify any abnormalities. I'll arrange for the tests to be done as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and we'll schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. It’s just a temporary measure while we wait for the results. And please, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, Doctor. A pain reliever would be most welcome, thank you. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. No, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment… except, perhaps… will the CT scan involve any radiation? I’ve heard stories… And will it be a painful procedure? I’m not very good with confined spaces, either. It’s silly, I know, but…
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all, Alese. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about radiation and confined spaces. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. We use the lowest possible dose to get the necessary images. As for the confined space, you will be lying on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It's relatively open, and you can communicate with the technician at all times. They can also give you a sedative if you're feeling anxious. It typically takes about 20-30 minutes. The technician will explain the procedure in detail before you go in. I'll also write a note for the radiology department letting them know about your anxiety so they can take extra care to make you comfortable. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Oh, that is very reassuring, Doctor, thank you. Knowing that they’ll be aware of my anxiety makes a huge difference. And the fact that it’s not a completely enclosed space… that’s good to know as well. Twenty to thirty minutes… I think I can manage that. I used to be a ship engineer, you know. I’ve spent weeks in cramped engine rooms! So, yes, I think I’m feeling a bit better about it now. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. It’s not easy, being an older patient, I suppose. Everything feels… a bit more daunting these days. But you’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. And you're right, it can be daunting. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures, especially as we get older. And your experience as a ship engineer definitely proves you're capable of handling a confined space! Alright. Let me quickly write up the prescription for the pain reliever and then the nurse will be in to draw your blood shortly. We'll schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning, and the radiology department will be aware of your anxiety. In the meantime, if anything changes, or if your pain gets worse, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been wonderfully thorough and kind. I truly appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and patiently. I’m very grateful for your care. Just… please, let me know what you find as soon as you can. The not knowing is always the hardest part. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. I understand your anxiety about the unknown, and I promise to let you know the results as soon as they are available. The nurse will be in shortly to get started. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this.
