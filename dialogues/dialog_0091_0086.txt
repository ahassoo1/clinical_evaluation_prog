DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Right. Hi, Doctor. Just here for the results, like we talked about. I don't really do waiting rooms, so I appreciate you getting right to it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand your preference, and we will respect your time. I have your lab results here from July 28th. Before we discuss them in detail, could you briefly remind me what we were investigating, and what symptoms prompted the testing?
PATIENT: Um… honestly? It was mostly just feeling really tired all the time. And a little dizzy. My friend kept saying it was probably just stress, but I figured I should get it checked. The blood tests were to rule stuff out, right? I remember something about iron and… vitamins? I don’t really pay attention to the specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. We ran a comprehensive panel including a complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. The intention was to identify any underlying causes for your fatigue and dizziness. Let’s start with the complete blood count. Your white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet levels are all within the normal range. However, your hemoglobin is slightly low at 11.8 grams per deciliter. The normal range for women is generally between 12 and 15.8. Do you have any history of anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? No, not that I know of. My mom had… something with her blood once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember what. I eat pretty well, I think. Lots of fish and fruit. Is that… bad? What does low hemoglobin even mean? I’m sorry, I just… I’m not good with this stuff.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Kovtun. It's perfectly alright to be unfamiliar with medical terminology. It’s my job to explain things clearly. Low hemoglobin means there isn't enough of the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. This can lead to fatigue, dizziness, and generally feeling weak, which aligns with what you’ve been experiencing. There are many potential causes. It could be related to iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, chronic illness, or even blood loss. Your iron studies show your serum iron is low, and your ferritin level, which is a measure of your stored iron, is also quite low. This suggests you may have iron deficiency anemia. Your vitamin D level is also on the lower end of the normal range, but not critically low. Before we definitively diagnose iron deficiency anemia, I would like to ask a few more questions about your diet and menstrual cycle, if you don’t mind me asking. And have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Okay, iron deficiency… that sounds… not great. My period is pretty regular, not super heavy, but it’s there. I eat a lot of spinach, does that count? As for… the other thing… no, no blood in my stool. Definitely not. I haven’t noticed anything like that. I eat a lot of salads, though. Maybe I need more… red meat? I honestly don’t eat a ton of meat. Mostly fish. Is this serious?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Ms. Kovtun. Spinach is a good source of iron, but it’s not as easily absorbed by the body as iron from animal sources. The fact that your period is regular and not particularly heavy is reassuring, but it can still contribute to iron loss. Regarding your concern about whether this is serious, it’s important to address iron deficiency, but in most cases, it is manageable. Untreated, it can lead to more significant fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. In more severe cases, it can affect heart function. However, we caught it early, and it appears to be mild to moderate. To confirm the diagnosis, I would like to order a reticulocyte count. This test measures how quickly your bone marrow is making new red blood cells. I’d also like to check a C-reactive protein to rule out any underlying inflammation that might be contributing. In the meantime, I recommend starting an iron supplement, ferrous sulfate 325mg once daily. It can cause some constipation, so I suggest drinking plenty of water and increasing your fiber intake. Would you be comfortable starting that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot. Constipation, though? Ugh. Is there anything else I can take with it to, like, prevent that? I really hate being constipated. And what about the spinach? Should I keep eating that? Also, can you spell that iron thing? The… ferrous sulfate? Just so I can look it up and see what’s in it. I like to know things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable to ask, Ms. Kovtun. It’s important to be informed and to address any concerns you have. Yes, constipation is a common side effect of ferrous sulfate. To help prevent it, you can increase your fluid intake, eat a diet rich in fiber – fruits, vegetables, whole grains – and consider a stool softener like docusate sodium if needed. We can discuss options if you experience issues. Yes, absolutely continue eating spinach! It’s a very healthy food, and while the iron isn’t as readily absorbed, it still provides valuable nutrients. And certainly. Ferrous sulfate is spelled F-E-R-R-O-U-S S-U-L-F-A-T-E. It’s a common form of iron supplement. I’m going to order the reticulocyte count and C-reactive protein now. We’ll need a blood sample. While we are at it, let's check a thyroid stimulating hormone level just to make sure that isn't contributing to your fatigue. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Okay, good. F-E-R-R-O-U-S… got it. And yeah, okay, more blood. I'm getting good at this. Allergies… hmm. Not really. I get a little itchy sometimes with certain soaps, but that’s it. No medication allergies that I know of. Definitely not to anything strong, like penicillin or anything. I'm pretty sure. Is there a specific list you want? I really don’t think I’ve had any reactions. I just… avoid taking pills whenever possible. Which is why I was hoping this wouldn't involve pills. .
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Kovtun. It sounds like you don’t have any significant medication allergies. I understand your reluctance to take pills, and we can explore alternative options if the iron supplement proves difficult to tolerate. However, ferrous sulfate is the most effective way to replenish your iron stores quickly. We will start with the 325mg once daily and see how you respond. It’s important to take it on an empty stomach with a glass of orange juice, as vitamin C enhances absorption. I will provide you with a written prescription and instructions. Once we receive the results of the additional blood tests, we will have a clearer picture of the cause of your fatigue and dizziness. I anticipate the results will be available within 48 hours. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, or we can connect via telephone if you prefer. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
