DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Erxleben, so what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, Doctor… Burlingham, is it? I’ve just been… awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, even after I’ve eaten. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to become a bit disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes. Well, “awfully thirsty” and hungry… that could be a number of things. A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, roughly. Maybe a month, now that I think about it. It’s hard to keep track, really. I just keep finding myself reaching for a glass of water, or… well, another biscuit, and then another. It’s not like me, this constant need. I’m usually not one for snacking. I’d rather get this sorted quickly, if you don't mind, Doctor. I’ve got a delivery schedule to manage.
DOCTOR: A delivery schedule. Right. Well, we’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Erxleben. Now, besides the thirst and hunger, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not… particularly. No. I feel alright, generally. A bit tired, maybe? But that’s just the job, I suppose. Long hours, early starts. No dizziness, no… funny turns. Just the thirst and the hunger. Is it alright if I ask what you're thinking it could be? I don’t mean to be pushy.
DOCTOR: Pushy?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. It’s just… I’d rather not spend all day here, if I’m honest. I’ve a schedule to keep, as I mentioned. And frankly, I’m not a fan of doctors, if you don't mind my saying so. It's not that I distrust you, it’s just… not my favourite pastime, this whole being examined business. I just want to know if it's something serious and what can be done about it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Erxleben, I understand you’re busy, but rushing through this won’t help anyone. Thirst and hunger can be symptoms of several things, and I need to rule out the more serious possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your… bathroom habits, for example?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Oh… um. Not… drastically. No. Everything's… regular, I suppose. A bit more frequent, maybe? Now that you mention it. But I put that down to the water, honestly. Drinking more means… well, you understand. Is that serious, Doctor? Because if it’s something like needing to… visit the facilities more, I can’t exactly arrange my deliveries around that.
DOCTOR: “More frequent” is a start, Mr. Erxleben. And frankly, saying it's “just” something doesn’t help me diagnose you. Are we talking a little more, or several times more?
PATIENT: Several times, I’d say. A noticeable difference, definitely. It’s… embarrassing to talk about, to be honest. But you asked. And yes, it’s been alongside the thirst and hunger. I’m also a bit… warmer than usual, now that I think about it. Not feverish, just… flushed. Is that relevant? Please, Doctor, is this something I need to worry about? I've got a delivery to Inverness tomorrow morning.
DOCTOR: Inverness, right. Well, the increased thirst, hunger, frequent urination, and flushing… those together are certainly concerning, Mr. Erxleben. Given your weight and… these symptoms, we need to check your blood sugar. It's possible we're dealing with diabetes. I'm going to take a quick blood sample now. Then we’ll see what the results say. Don't panic. It’s manageable, even if that is the case. A nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, dear. My father… he had that. Never looked after himself, though. Always snacking, never exercised. I eat reasonably well, I always have. Still… that’s not what I wanted to hear. A blood sample, right. Fine. Just… quickly, if you could, Doctor. Inverness is a long drive. And I’d rather know either way. What happens if… if it is diabetes? Is it… serious? Will I need… injections? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Erxleben, one thing at a time. Let's get the blood sugar reading first. Yes, if it is diabetes, it needs to be managed. And management options depend on the type of diabetes, and how well you respond to lifestyle changes. Yes, sometimes medication is necessary. Injections aren’t always required. We'll discuss all of that after we have results. Now, if you’ll just roll up your sleeve... The nurse will be here momentarily. Let’s not jump to conclusions, alright?
