DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguió. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. I’m here for a vaccination, I think. Medicare sent me a notice, said it was time for one… or maybe a couple? I wasn’t entirely sure what they were recommending, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A vaccination, alright. Medicare does like to send out a lot of confusing mail, doesn't it?
PATIENT: You have no idea! It’s a bit of a mess sometimes. I just figured I’d best get it sorted. Do you have a record of what they suggested? Or can you tell me what I might need?
DOCTOR: Let's see… Mr. Paguió, according to your record – and honestly, it's a very basic record, rural clinic and all – you're due for your annual flu shot, and it looks like you’re behind on your pneumococcal vaccine. Given your age and… well, your weight – no offense intended, but it does factor into these things – a pneumococcal vaccination is especially important. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No offense taken at all, Doctor. I understand. And no, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Not to medicine, food, or anything, really. I've had all my usual childhood shots, as far as my mother could keep track. Is the pneumococcal one a bad one? Does it make you feel sick afterwards? I've heard stories…
DOCTOR: “Stories.” People and their stories. It’s not a “bad” one, Mr. Paguió. Like all vaccinations, there’s a small chance of soreness at the injection site, maybe a low-grade fever for a day. Nothing a little rest and fluids won't handle. But frankly, the risk of not getting it – pneumonia can be very serious, especially given… certain health factors – is far greater. We’re talking potential hospitalization, even death. Now, let’s not get dramatic, but it’s a sensible precaution. Are you generally a healthy individual otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, I’d say so. I work a pretty steady job, production planning, mostly sitting at a desk, but I try to walk when I can. No major illnesses or anything like that. I do get a bit tired easily, sometimes. But I figured that’s just getting older. Just… generally healthy. Is the flu shot the same sort of thing? Sore arm, maybe a bit tired?
DOCTOR: Yes, the flu shot is generally very well-tolerated. Similar side effects—soreness, maybe mild fatigue. It's just your body building up immunity. Now, this isn't a guarantee you won't get the flu, of course, but it drastically reduces your chances of getting severely ill. It also reduces the risk of complications, which is what we really want to avoid. Before we administer anything, I should probably take your vital signs. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… routine stuff. Have you had a recent physical exam anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not recently. It’s been… a while, to be honest. Work keeps me pretty busy. Everything's been okay, as far as I know. Should I roll up my sleeve now? Or would you like me to sit somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just get this over with. I suppose a basic exam won't hurt. Have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Roll up your sleeve when you're ready. Honestly, people really should keep up with these things… it makes my job so much easier.
PATIENT: Alright, here we go. Just let me know if it's going to be cold or anything. I'm not a big fan of needles, but I understand it has to be done. It’s a nice little clinic, by the way. Quiet.
DOCTOR: Quiet is good. Means less drama. And yes, it will be a slight pinch. Don’t faint on me, Mr. Paguió. Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. We'll keep an eye on it. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular. A bit of a murmur, but nothing to worry about right now. Now, let’s get these vaccinations administered. Which arm do you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh. A murmur? Is that… bad? I didn't know I had a murmur. I've never had any chest pain or anything like that. And… either arm is fine, really. Whatever is easiest for you. Maybe the left one? I don’t know, is there a reason to prefer one over the other? I’m probably being silly, asking so many questions…
DOCTOR: A murmur doesn’t automatically mean anything is wrong, Mr. Paguió. A lot of people have innocent murmurs. It just means there's a slight extra sound when your heart beats. We’ll monitor it. Don't catastrophize. Now, left arm it is. This may sting for a moment. Try not to tense up. There. Done. Now, sit here for fifteen minutes. We want to make sure you don’t have any immediate reaction. And please, try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay. That wasn't… terrible. But definitely felt that. Fifteen minutes, right? It is a nice, quiet little clinic, like you said. Do you live nearby, Doctor? I haven't been to many doctor's appointments since I moved here. Everything feels a bit new still.
DOCTOR: I live close enough. It’s… adequate. Now, please just remain seated quietly for the allotted time. We're not here to socialize, Mr. Paguió. It gives me time to finish documentation.
PATIENT: Right. Documentation. Of course. Fifteen minutes… It’s a little chilly in here, I think. But… okay. Just fifteen minutes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fifteen minutes are up. Any dizziness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No dizziness. Just a bit of soreness in the arm, like you said. Nothing too bad. I feel… okay. Probably just a little tired. Is there anything I need to do? Avoid any strenuous activity? Take anything for the pain?
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter pain reliever if needed. Avoid heavy lifting for the rest of the day. And please, try to maintain a reasonable diet and get some exercise. Common sense, really. Here's a record of your vaccinations. And a pamphlet on flu prevention. If you experience any severe reaction, like difficulty breathing or a high fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, schedule a follow-up appointment in a year for your annual checkup. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. And thank you for… explaining everything, even if I asked too many questions. I’ll try to take it easy and eat a bit better, like you said. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mmhmm. Good day. .
