DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I am Dr. Eaddy. It is a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... well, to be honest, I mostly just remember someone telling me I needed to come in for a... a check. Something about making sure I'm okay to… operate things? It’s all a bit fuzzy. Is this about my job?
DOCTOR: Operate things…?
PATIENT: Yeah, you know… the big machines? Like… the ones that lay down the road, or… flatten it out? I drive 'em. Been doing it a long time. My husband… well, used to work with me, too. But this test… is it about that? To make sure I can still do my job safely? Because I feel fine, mostly. Just a little forgetful these days, I guess.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness is… not uncommon with age, Ms. Hughston. However, it is essential we determine the cause. Your husband’s employment status is… irrelevant. I’m attempting to ascertain why your primary care physician referred you to me. Do you recall anything specific they said regarding the reason for this visit?
PATIENT: Oh dear… they did say something, didn't they? Ugh, my memory… it's just terrible. Something about… a screening? And… making sure nothing was… affecting my ability to, well, think clearly. That sounds right, doesn't it? It wasn't about being sick, exactly. More like… being careful? I mostly just fill out the papers they give me. I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor, I just… things don’t stick in my head like they used to. Is this a drug test then? They mentioned something about that, I think… something about making sure I’m safe on the job.
DOCTOR: A “screening,” as you say, could encompass several possibilities. It is… unfortunate your recollection is so fragmented. To clarify, let's begin with a formal review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my husband always took care of all that paperwork. I… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… arthritis, I suppose. In my knees, mostly. It flares up with the weather. Other than that… I really don’t know. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. It’s just a bit embarrassing, I’m afraid. He handled everything. And now… well, now it's just me. Do you need specifics? I don’t even remember the names of the medicines I took after the surgery.
DOCTOR: A cholecystectomy—gallbladder removal—and arthritis. Very well. And do you currently take any medications at all, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. I take something for the pain in my knees, when it’s really bad. It’s… a little white pill. I think it’s Ibuprofen? Or Naproxen? Something like that. And… sometimes I take a little something to help me sleep. Just when I can’t get to bed, you know? A small, blue pill. That's about it, I think. I don’t really keep track. It all just goes into a little dish, and I take one when I need it. Is that… bad? Should I be writing these things down?
DOCTOR: It is… sub-optimal, Ms. Hughston. Taking medication without a clear understanding of the dosage and potential interactions is not advisable. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything… that I remember, anyway. My husband always said I had a strong stomach. He'd always test new foods before I did, just to be safe. I think... I might be a little sensitive to shellfish? But it was a long time ago. I didn’t eat much of it even then. Mostly just shrimp, I think. It gave me a bit of a stomach ache once, but I don’t know if it was the shrimp or something else I ate. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I’ve avoided it ever since. Is that important?
DOCTOR: A potential shellfish sensitivity… noted. Now, Ms. Hughston, let us discuss your family medical history. Are you aware of any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tough one. My family… well, they weren't big on talking about illnesses. It was always just… “you don't want to dwell on those things”. My mother… she died young, I think. Something with her heart, maybe? But I don't really remember the details. My father… he lived a long life, but he always had… aches and pains. Arthritis, I think, like me. And my brother… he had something… with his lungs, maybe? He smoked a lot. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all so foggy. I wish I could be more help, but my memory just isn’t what it used to be. Is it okay if we just… skip this part? It’s making my head hurt trying to remember.
DOCTOR: While a complete family history is desirable, it appears… challenging in your case. Very well, we will proceed. Now, Ms. Hughston, tell me about your social habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. No, no smoking. My husband always hated it. He said it was a terrible habit. And I… well, I don’t really care for alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And… recreational drugs? Oh, no, never. I’ve never touched anything like that. Never had any interest in it, to be honest. I mostly just like to relax at home and watch television. Or… or tend to my garden, when the weather is nice. I’m a pretty simple woman, Doctor. No… no bad habits, I assure you. Are we getting closer to figuring out why I’m here? This is a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Hughston, before we proceed with a physical examination, can you describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I usually wake up around six, sometimes earlier if the sun is shining. I make a cup of coffee, and then I have a little something for breakfast… usually toast, and maybe an egg if I'm feeling up to it. Then I get ready for work. I drive the big machines, you know? Smoothing out roads, laying down asphalt. It’s… a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I like being outdoors. I usually get home around five, and then I make dinner. Sometimes I watch television, sometimes I read. And then I go to bed around ten. It’s a pretty simple life, Doctor. Not much excitement. I mostly just try to keep busy and stay out of trouble. Is that helpful? I'm sorry if I'm rambling… it's just… this is all a bit strange.
DOCTOR: It is… adequate. Now, Ms. Hughston, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. My knees aren’t what they used to be, and I don’t bend very well. And if I start rambling again, feel free to stop me. I just… things don’t always come to me easily these days. Is there anything I need to do to prepare? Do I need to change clothes? Or… lie down? Just let me know what you’d like me to do, and I’ll do my best. I just want to get this over with and find out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: No need to change clothes, Ms. Hughston. Simply sit comfortably in the chair. I will begin by checking your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart rate is regular, and your lung sounds are clear. However, I do detect a slight… diminished range of motion in your knees, as you indicated. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, and your coordination appears slightly impaired. Now, I will ask you a few simple questions to assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… today’s date? Um… let me think… It’s… August, isn’t it? Yes, August… and the… the day… oh goodness… is it the second? August 2nd? I think so. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I'm terribly sorry, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m always forgetting things these days. It’s embarrassing, honestly. Is that… bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It is… not ideal, Ms. Hughston. Now, can you repeat after me: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog?
PATIENT: "The… quick brown fox… jumps… over… the lazy dog?" Is that right? I think so. My tongue feels a bit clumsy, Doctor. It's… hard to say sometimes. My husband always said I mumbled. Is that… a problem? I'm terribly sorry if I'm making this difficult. I just… things aren’t as easy as they used to be. Are you… are you finding something wrong? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Your speech is slightly… slurred, Ms. Hughston. Now, I would like to order some laboratory tests and a brain scan to investigate the cause of your cognitive decline and speech impairment. These tests will help us determine if there is an underlying medical condition that requires treatment. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… a brain scan? Laboratory tests? That sounds… serious. Is something terribly wrong, Doctor? I’m… I’m a bit frightened now. I don’t like the sound of that at all. What kind of things are you looking for? Is it… Alzheimer’s? My mother… she had something like that, I think. She… she forgot everything in the end. Oh dear… I don’t want that to happen to me. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Could it just be… stress? Or… old age? Please, Doctor… tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, it is too early to make any definitive diagnosis. However, your symptoms—cognitive decline, slurred speech, diminished reflexes—are concerning, and warrant further investigation. The laboratory tests will assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or infections. The brain scan will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any structural abnormalities. I understand your concerns about Alzheimer’s disease, but it is only one possibility. Other conditions can cause similar symptoms, and we need to rule them out first. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They are specialists in brain disorders and can provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you agree to these referrals?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… a neurologist… that sounds very serious indeed. But… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and… and get this sorted out. I don't want to… to end up like my mother. Forgetting everything… it sounds terrible. So… laboratory tests and a brain scan… and see a specialist. Will this take long? And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see. And… will I be able to drive to these appointments? My husband… well, he always took care of all these things. I’m terribly lost without him. Is there someone who can help me with the paperwork? Oh dear… this is all so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hughston. I will arrange for a referral to a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. We will schedule the laboratory tests and brain scan as soon as possible. Our billing department will assist you with any financial concerns, and we can explore options for financial assistance if needed. Regarding driving, that will depend on the results of the neurological evaluation. We will advise you accordingly. I will also have our medical assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results of the tests and the neurologist’s recommendations. They will also assist you with the necessary paperwork and any logistical arrangements. Here is the contact information for the medical assistant. Please do not hesitate to contact them if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can assist you with at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That's… that's very kind of you. I appreciate your help. I… I don’t think so, not at the moment. Just… please hurry. I just want to know what’s going on. And… and maybe I can have a little bit of hope. That's all I ask. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I think I’ll just go home now and try to… try to relax. I just hope I can remember all of this.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hughston. Please do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. We will be in touch soon to schedule your appointments. Have a safe journey home. .
