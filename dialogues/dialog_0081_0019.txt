DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… my wife… she want… baby. We… old. She think maybe… need help? I make little things, you know? Metal, plastic… not babies.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your wife is hoping to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Conceive… that the word, right? She very much want. But… we try… some time. And she… she worry. I worry too, a little. But mostly her.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Carlotta, while I commend your wife's… enthusiasm, at your ages, achieving a pregnancy naturally is… unlikely. And frankly, pursuing it carries significant risks for both of you. Perhaps we should discuss realistic expectations and potential alternatives before proceeding further. First, let’s get a little more information. How old is your wife, exactly?
PATIENT: Ah… that is good to know. Risks… yes, we don’t want risks. She… she is… hmm… I think… sixty-two? Sixty-three? It’s hard to remember dates these days. We been married a long time.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two or sixty-three. Very well. And what about you, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Seventy. I am seventy years old. It is… a lot of years. We have good life, though.
DOCTOR: Indeed. A long life, and a considerable time since either of you would have been in a position to conceive a child. Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, attempting a pregnancy at these ages presents a very high risk of complications for your wife, potentially life-threatening ones. Have you both discussed the ethical considerations as well?
PATIENT: Ethical… considerations? I… I don’t understand. You mean… it’s not… good? To want a baby? My wife… she very happy when she think about baby. We always wanted… but life… life happened.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, let me put this plainly. The risks of pregnancy at your wife’s age – and frankly, your age as well, should she somehow become pregnant – are astronomical. We’re talking about a significantly increased chance of miscarriage, stillbirth, chromosomal abnormalities in the child, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and even death for your wife. Furthermore, the child would be born with a significantly shortened lifespan and a high probability of genetic defects. It is… irresponsible, to say the least, to even consider this without a full understanding of these risks and the potential consequences. Now, before we go any further, let's review your wife’s medical history. Has she had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That… that is very scary. Death… we don't want that. No… no previous pregnancies. She… she always work. Very busy woman. Good job. Never time… until now.
DOCTOR: No previous pregnancies. Very well. Has she been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. She has… her blood pressure, sometimes. Doctor give her pills. And… her knees. Bad knees. Old job… lots of standing. I think that is all. She is strong woman, though. Doesn’t complain much.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, and knee problems. Is she currently taking any medications for her blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, yes she is. Little white pills. She take them every morning with her tea. I think… amlodipine? Or something like that. She keeps the bottles… I don’t pay attention to the names.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine. Alright. Now, Mr. Carlotta, I need to be frank. Given your wife’s age, her lack of previous pregnancies, and her existing medical conditions, pursuing a pregnancy is… not advisable. In fact, I strongly recommend against it. We can, however, discuss other options, such as adoption or simply focusing on enjoying the life you already have. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Adoption… that is… nice idea. But… it’s not the same, is it? My wife… she wants to feel… the baby grow. To know… it’s part of her. I understand what you say. Risks… very scary. But… she is very sad already. Is there… anything else? Any little thing… we could try? Even if it’s… very small chance?
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, chasing a minuscule chance when the risks are so substantial is… illogical. However, I suppose we can discuss the possibility of in vitro fertilization with donor eggs. It's a long shot, expensive, and carries its own risks, but it would circumvent the issue of your wife's egg quality. But I must reiterate, the chances of success are extremely low, and it's unlikely to result in a healthy pregnancy. Before we proceed further, I need to perform a thorough physical examination on your wife to assess her overall health. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: In… vitro… what? And donor… eggs? That sounds… complicated. And expensive? We don’t have much money. I don’t know… it all sounds very scary. Physical… examination? She is very private woman. But… if it helps… maybe. If it’s… not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, you are asking me to consider a highly improbable and potentially dangerous course of action. IVF with donor eggs is a complex and expensive procedure, and it's unlikely to yield a positive result given your wife's age and medical history. However, if you insist, I suppose we can proceed with a physical examination to assess her baseline health. But I must warn you, I will not pursue this any further if the results indicate significant health concerns. Now, let's begin with her blood pressure. Do you know what her typical readings are?
PATIENT: I… I don't know. She doesn’t tell me. She says it’s… woman’s business. But… she takes the pills every day. So… it must not be too bad? Maybe we should just… enjoy life? Like you say. It’s getting late, you know? We have had good life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Carlotta, with all due respect, your wife’s refusal to share her medical information is… concerning. And frankly, relying on her subjective assessment of her health is not sufficient. I strongly advise her to undergo a comprehensive medical evaluation to determine her suitability for any potential treatment. However, I will not proceed with any further discussion of IVF or any other fertility treatments until she agrees to a thorough examination. Perhaps you can discuss this with her and schedule an appointment for a full check-up. Until then, I believe the best course of action is to focus on maintaining her current health and enjoying the life you have together. It was… enlightening meeting you, Mr. Carlotta.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Thank you, Doctor. Maybe… maybe you are right. She just… wants a little bit of happiness.
