DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it's…family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble. And cancer, too. It’s just…it’s always something with them. I’m probably worrying over nothing, but better safe than sorry, you know? I’m a teacher, and I need to, well, be here. Can’t be dropping dead on a classroom full of students.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. Family history is very important, and it's certainly wise to be proactive about your health, especially with your profession. It's good you're thinking ahead. To get a better understanding, let's start with your mother’s side of the family. Could you tell me a bit more about the specific heart troubles and cancers that have affected them?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, my grandmother…she had some kind of…failure, I think? They kept saying “congestive” something. Lots of swelling. And she had a really bad time with her chest, always short of breath. Then my aunt – my mother’s sister – she had…I think it was colon cancer. Very aggressive. She was only…fifty-something. And then, on my mother’s side of the family, there's been a lot of…high blood pressure, I guess. A lot of people on medications for it. It's just…a general feeling of doom, if I'm honest. It feels like a ticking time bomb. I don't even know what questions to ask. It all sounds the same to me, honestly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like a significant health history, and it's completely understandable why you'd be feeling anxious. "Congestive" refers to congestive heart failure, which can cause swelling and shortness of breath as you mentioned. And colon cancer, especially when it's aggressive, is a serious concern. High blood pressure is also common, and it’s good that family members were on medication, but it’s also something we want to be vigilant about. To clarify, do you know at what age your grandmother was diagnosed with heart failure, and roughly when your aunt was diagnosed with colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My grandmother… she was probably in her late seventies, I’d say. Maybe seventy-two, seventy-three? It was a while ago, I was just a child. And my aunt… she was diagnosed, oh… maybe ten years ago? No, more than that. Fifteen, maybe? Around fifty-five, fifty-six, I think. It happened pretty quickly, unfortunately. They caught it late, I think. She didn’t really… go to the doctor much. And honestly, I wasn't really involved in her care at the time. I was… focused on my own things. I feel bad saying that now, but…life gets in the way.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Theriot. It’s perfectly normal to be focused on your own life, especially when you’re younger. It sounds like your grandmother was diagnosed in her seventies, and your aunt around age fifty-five. That gives us a helpful timeframe. Now, let's turn to you. Have you experienced any health issues yourself?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing major, anyway. I get the occasional headache, but who doesn’t? And I’ve been feeling a bit… tired lately, but that’s probably just the stress of teaching. The kids are… challenging, to say the least. I had a physical a couple of years ago, standard stuff, and the doctor said I was fine. Blood pressure was a little high, he said, but not anything to worry about yet. He suggested I watch my salt intake and exercise more, the usual. I’ve… been meaning to get around to that. Honestly, I’m probably in better shape than most of my colleagues. They mostly just live on coffee and pizza. I don't feel sick. It's just… this nagging feeling that something is lurking, you know? Like a shadow.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you’ve been generally healthy, with a slightly elevated blood pressure at your last physical, but nothing that was immediately alarming. It’s good you’re aware of that. And it’s also good that you're relatively active compared to your colleagues. It’s very common to have a nagging feeling of concern when you have a strong family history of health problems. To get a clearer picture, let's briefly review your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I find it disgusting, frankly. And I drink… occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a beer on the weekends. Nothing excessive. I'm not a partier, if that's what you're asking. I prefer a quiet night in with a book, honestly. I try to eat relatively healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein. I avoid processed foods as much as possible. But, like I said, I've been under a lot of stress lately, and that makes it harder to maintain a healthy diet. I've been resorting to takeout more often than I'd like. It's just… convenient. Is that a bad thing? I just want to get this over with and go back to work. My students are probably causing chaos right now.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful to know, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you have a very healthy lifestyle overall, and the occasional glass of wine or takeout isn't a cause for concern. It's completely understandable to feel stressed and rely on convenient options when you're busy. Now, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. None that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I get the occasional sniffle during pollen season, but that’s just… normal, right? Everyone gets a little stuffy in the spring. My ex-wife was the one with all the allergies. Peanuts, shellfish, dust mites…the whole list. I always had to be careful when we went out to eat. It was exhausting, frankly. But me? Nothing. Clean bill of health, allergy-wise. I’m starting to feel a bit silly being here, to be honest. Maybe I'm just overreacting. It’s just…the anxiety. It's really getting to me. Can we just…run some tests? Just to be sure?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Theriot, and it's certainly not silly to want to be proactive about your health, especially given your family history. And wanting to “just run some tests” is a very reasonable request. It's good you are taking this seriously. Let’s proceed with a physical exam and some basic blood work. I'll also order a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, given the family history of heart problems, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We can also discuss an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Whatever you think is best. An EKG sounds…smart. Just get it over with. I want to know, one way or another. The not knowing is the worst part. And if everything is fine… well, then I can finally stop worrying and get back to my students. They probably think I abandoned them. Honestly, they’re a handful, but…they need me. And I need to be able to, you know, be there for them. So, yes. Let's do all the tests. Whatever it takes. Just… hurry, please. I have a classroom full of chaos waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. I understand. Let’s get started. I’ll have the nurse come in to take your vital signs first, then we’ll proceed with the physical exam. We’ll get the blood work ordered, and I’ll schedule the EKG for you as well. If you don’t mind, please have a seat and we’ll begin. I’ll try to be as quick and efficient as possible. Before we start, just to document, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
