DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 32 years of age. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Thirty-two. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry. It feels… constant, if that makes any sense. I eat, and I’m hungry again shortly after. And I just seem to be drinking water all day. It’s a bit bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: “Awfully thirsty and hungry,” you say. Constant, despite eating. I see. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… probably… about a month now? Maybe six weeks. It started gradually, I suppose. Didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I was more active. But it hasn’t gone away, and if anything, it’s getting a little worse. I haven’t changed anything in my diet, mind you.
DOCTOR: Six weeks of increasing thirst and hunger. No dietary changes. Very well. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Other changes… Not that I’ve specifically noticed, no. I suppose I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, but I work long hours, so that’s not entirely unexpected. And maybe going to the bathroom a little more often, but… honestly, I wouldn’t say it’s anything significant. I haven’t been keeping close track, if that makes sense. Just the thirst and the hunger are the main things bothering me.
DOCTOR: “A bit more tired” and “going to the bathroom more often.” I understand. While those symptoms may seem minor to you, they can be pertinent. Now, let's delve a little deeper. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, blurred vision, or any difficulty healing from cuts or bruises?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that you mention it, perhaps a little. My trousers felt a bit looser recently, but I hadn't really paid it much mind. I assumed it was the heat. Blurred vision, no, not at all. And I usually heal alright, I think. I cut myself a couple of weeks ago while unpacking boxes at work, and it seemed to close up normally enough. Nothing remarkable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m just hoping it’s nothing serious. I really don’t have time for a prolonged illness.
DOCTOR: “A little” weight loss, despite increased intake. Very well. And no noticeable changes in vision or healing. Now, Mr. Erxleben, do you have any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother's side… my grandmother, I think she had something like that. But it was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about it much. It was just… “Grandma wasn’t well.” I honestly don't know if it was diabetes specifically, or something else entirely. My father’s side, no, not that I'm aware of. I'm afraid I’m not very knowledgeable about family medical history. We weren’t a family that kept records, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: "Grandma wasn’t well," a vague history, unfortunately. We'll proceed with caution, then. Now, let's discuss your current medications, if any, and any allergies you may have. And while we're at it, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational substances?
PATIENT: No medications, thankfully. No allergies that I'm aware of. And no, Doctor. No smoking, no drinking, and certainly no recreational substances. I keep a pretty clean lifestyle, all things considered. Work keeps me busy enough. I assure you, those aren’t factors in this.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I appreciate your… assurances, Mr. Erxleben, it’s important to gather a complete picture. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’d like to perform a simple urine test, and I'll order a blood glucose test. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Whatever you deem necessary. Blood pressure, pulse, urine test, blood glucose… yes. Just… please be quick about it? I have a rather full schedule this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just step over here. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142 over 90. Pulse is normal at 78. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs detected. Now, if you could provide a urine sample for analysis. The restroom is just down the hall. I'll meet you back here once you're finished.
PATIENT: Right. Very good. I’ll be as quick as I can, Doctor.
