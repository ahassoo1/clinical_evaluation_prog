DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need a form signed so I can finally get this… procedure done. My daughter insisted on this whole clearance thing. Said it was “necessary”. Honestly, a waste of time, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand you're here for a procedure clearance form. Just to be thorough – and for my records – can you tell me what procedure is scheduled?
PATIENT: It’s a… face lift. Honestly, it’s not something I particularly want to discuss. It’s just… things are starting to sag. My daughter says it’ll make me look “more presentable”. I just want it done quickly and efficiently. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: A facelift. I understand. And your daughter is requesting this clearance, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She's very… involved. Always has been. Wants everything perfect. Look, I'm perfectly healthy, I’ve been healthy my whole life. Worked hard, ate good food… well, mostly good food. I don’t understand why I need all these questions. Is this form going to be signed or not? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Orwin. It’s not that I don’t believe you’re healthy, it’s just standard procedure before any surgery, even cosmetic ones, to make sure everything is optimal. It's for your safety. To start, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Good heavens. I had the flu once, back in ‘68, but I was working through it. And I broke my wrist when I was a boy, falling out of a tree. Nothing serious. Terrazzo work is hard on your body, you know. Mostly just aches and pains. That’s hardly “significant”. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to list every little bump and bruise I’ve ever had?
DOCTOR: Okay, flu in ‘68, broken wrist as a child, and aches and pains from your work. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, arthritis…?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. High blood pressure? I eat fish three times a week. Arthritis? I work with stone. Keeps me moving! Look, I'm a practical man. I don't sit around waiting for things to go wrong, I do things. I’ve never been to a doctor unless absolutely necessary, and frankly, this whole thing feels unnecessary. Are you going to ask about my childhood pets next?
DOCTOR: No pets, Mr. Orwin. Just trying to be thorough. Have you ever had any surgeries before, aside from the broken wrist being set?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Or maybe it's just good genes. My father lived to be 95, never had a day’s illness in his life. Except for that one time with the… never mind. Look, are we nearly done? My daughter said this would be quick. She’s very good at getting things organized. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never taken anything stronger than aspirin. And that was just for a headache. I’m a strong Norwegian man, I don’t need medications. Honestly, all these questions are starting to give me a headache. Are we getting anywhere with this form, or am I wasting my time? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. And to clarify, you’ve never experienced any reactions to penicillin, any pain relievers, or any other medications at all?
PATIENT: No! Look, I'm telling you, I’ve never had a problem with anything. I eat a sensible diet, I get plenty of exercise, and I don’t go around popping pills like some people. I'm perfectly healthy. Now, can we please get this form signed? My daughter is waiting to hear back, and she gets very… impatient when things aren’t done promptly. It’s a waste of both our times, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam, just to be sure. It won't take long. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want to poke at me? Fine. But make it quick. I haven't got all day, you know. And don't expect me to start telling you about every ache and pain. It's all just part of getting old, and frankly, I don't need a doctor telling me that. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Overall, you appear to be in good general health. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that can be common with age and stress. Now, I just have a few quick questions about your social history... Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was a waste of good money. And my lungs are perfectly good, as you just heard. Are we nearly done with this interrogation yet? This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of aquavit with dinner sometimes. It's Norwegian tradition, you know. Helps with digestion. Don't make such a face. It's not like I'm a… a drunkard. Just a civilized beverage. Honestly, all these questions. Are we getting anywhere with this form? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned and my daughter is expecting an update.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you live alone, or do you have support at home?
PATIENT: Widowed, you know. My wife passed five years ago. And yes, my daughter lives nearby. She's very… attentive. Perhaps a little too attentive. But she helps out. She makes sure I'm eating properly, and that I’m taking care of myself. Look, are we finished now? This has been a complete waste of an afternoon. Just sign the form and let me be on my way. I have a golf game.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I’ve completed the form. Here you are. It indicates you're cleared for the procedure. However, I would like to discuss your slightly elevated blood pressure. It might be worth monitoring it at home, and we can discuss lifestyle modifications if it remains high. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Fine. Good. That’s all I needed. No, I have no questions. And frankly, I don’t need a lecture on my blood pressure. I’ve lived a long and healthy life, and I think I know what I’m doing. Thank you for your time… though I can’t say it was particularly enjoyable. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a golf game to get to.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. Have a good day.
