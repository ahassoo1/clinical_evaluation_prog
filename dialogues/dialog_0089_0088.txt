DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's… this ringing in my ears. It's been going on for a bit now and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s something we can definitely look into. When you say “a bit now,” roughly how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe three, four weeks now? It comes and goes, but it's definitely more frequent lately. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks, alright. And is it constant when it is happening, or is it more like bursts of ringing?
PATIENT: It’s bursts, yeah. Not a constant thing, thankfully. It’ll come on, then go away for a bit, then come back. Sometimes it's a high-pitched ring, other times it’s more of a… buzzing sound? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense. High-pitched or buzzing—helpful to know. Is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I feel it a little in the left, but it's not nearly as bad. It’s definitely worse on this side.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in the right ear. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I think loud noises sometimes. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking or music is playing. And… honestly, when I’m stressed. Work is pretty hectic, so that’s probably a big part of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, loud noises and stress seem to be factors. Any recent exposure to really loud noises – concerts, construction, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not recently, no. Nothing I can think of. It's mostly just the usual noise at work – the restaurant gets pretty busy. And sometimes my ex… well, that was loud too, but that’s a different kind of noise. Sorry, didn’t mean to get into that.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jaylyne. We're just trying to get a complete picture. Let’s stick with the physical side of things for now. Do you have any trouble with your hearing, other than the ringing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I can hear fine, as far as I know. Everything sounds normal, just… with this ringing over it sometimes. It hasn’t gotten to the point where I can’t hear people, or anything. Sometimes after the ringing stops, everything sounds a little… muffled for a minute, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so normal hearing overall, with possible temporary muffling after the ringing. Have you experienced any dizziness, nausea, or pain in your ears?
PATIENT: No dizziness or nausea, thankfully. And no pain at all, just the ringing. It’s more annoying than anything. Really just gets on my nerves, you know? It makes it hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dizziness, nausea, or pain. Just the annoying ringing and occasional muffling. Have you had any ear infections in the past, or any problems with your sinuses?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think I had one ear infection as a kid, but nothing since. And no sinus problems that I know of. I get the occasional cold, like everyone else, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent or recurring ear infections or sinus problems. Now, just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, no. And allergies… just a little hay fever sometimes, but nothing serious. Nothing I take anything for regularly. Just try to stay away from pollen when it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or significant allergies. Let's do a quick exam of your ears, just to get a visual check and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Get it over and done with, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, everything looks normal on the outside. Your ear canals are clear, and your eardrums look healthy and are responding normally to the air puff. I’m also going to quickly check your hearing with a simple tuning fork test. Alright, hearing seems symmetrical. That doesn’t rule anything out, but it's good. It sounds like you don't have any significant hearing loss. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it’s likely this is tinnitus. It’s very common.
PATIENT: Tinnitus… okay. Is that… serious? Will it go away? It's just… it’s pretty disruptive.
DOCTOR: It’s not usually serious, thankfully, Jaylyne. It’s more of a symptom than a disease itself. It means your brain is detecting sound when there isn’t any external sound present. In many cases, it does go away on its own, especially if it’s related to something temporary like stress or noise exposure. However, it can sometimes be persistent. Given your history, stress seems like a major factor. I recommend strategies for managing stress, like mindfulness exercises, deep breathing, or even talking to someone about what's going on at work. We can discuss some resources for that if you'd like. I also recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. I'm going to recommend a hearing test, just to get a baseline and rule out any subtle underlying hearing loss we didn't catch during the quick screening. And I’ll write you a referral to an audiologist.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Stress management, yeah. I probably should do that. A hearing test too, just to be sure. That’s a lot, but better to know, I guess. What about… anything I can take? Pills or something? To make it stop?
DOCTOR: There aren't any medications specifically to cure tinnitus, unfortunately. Some people find relief with certain medications that address underlying anxiety or depression, but that's more about managing the overall stress and emotional impact. There are some over-the-counter options marketed for tinnitus, but the evidence for their effectiveness is limited, and some can even worsen the problem. We can discuss if an anti-anxiety medication would be appropriate for you, but I’d generally recommend starting with non-pharmacological approaches first. Things like white noise machines or relaxation techniques can be very helpful. There are also tinnitus retraining therapy programs that can teach your brain to filter out the noise. I’m going to give you a handout with information on managing tinnitus and resources for stress management. I'll also send the referral to the audiologist. They'll schedule you for a full hearing evaluation. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Non-pharmacological… right. Less pills, that’s good. A handout would be great. And the referral. Okay. I think… I think that’s everything? Is there anything else I need to do? I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Here’s the handout. It includes information on tinnitus, stress management techniques, and links to helpful websites. I’ve also sent the referral to an audiologist named Dr. Anya Sharma. Her office will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ve documented everything we discussed today in your chart, including the history, exam findings, and plan. To reiterate, we’ve ruled out any major underlying problems. This is likely stress-related tinnitus. The plan is to manage stress, avoid loud noises, and get a full hearing evaluation to rule out anything subtle. Honestly, sometimes just knowing what’s going on and having a plan can be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thanks, Doctor. You’ve explained everything really clearly. I appreciate it. I guess… I’ll just try to relax more. And avoid loud noises. And see the audiologist. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. That’s the right approach – stress management, noise avoidance, and follow-up with the audiologist. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns down the line. Here’s my card with the clinic’s number. Take care of yourself, and I hope you find some relief soon. Have a good day. .
