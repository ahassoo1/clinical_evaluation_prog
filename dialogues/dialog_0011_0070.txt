DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning. Neppl, you say? Is that… German? Anyway. I just… moved here. New place, new doctor, all that. Medicare said I needed to come. Social thing, I think. Honestly, I don’t really remember what they said. Just… checking up, I guess? Old age, you know. Things… slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Neppl is of German origin, you are correct. It’s quite common. And you’re perfectly right to prioritize coming in for a check-up, especially with a change in location and a recommendation from Medicare. It’s excellent preventative care. “Things slipping your mind” is perfectly normal, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll certainly take that into consideration as we go through your visit. To start, could you tell me a bit about what, if anything, specifically prompted this visit, even if it’s just a general feeling of wanting to get a check-up?
PATIENT: Prompted? Hmph. Like I said, I don’t remember. They sent a paper. A lot of papers, actually. My ex-wife always did the paperwork. Still does, probably. She’s very… organized. I work with faces, you see. Makeup. Theater. I make people look good. That's what I do. And sometimes… sometimes my hands, they get a little shaky. Not all the time, but… enough to notice. Is that what you want to know? My hands?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very helpful to know. The shaking in your hands is certainly something we should explore. That's a very pertinent detail. And the fact that you work with precise hand movements is also important. To clarify, has this shaking been a recent development, or has it been something you've noticed for a while?
PATIENT: A while. Hmm… how long is “a while”? Years, probably. Not bad shaky, you understand. Just… not as steady as they used to be. When I was younger, I could paint a line so thin you wouldn't believe it. Now… well, now it’s more… expressive. That's what I tell people, anyway. “Artistic license.” They don't need to know I'm getting old. They just want to look pretty. It’s been getting… more noticeable lately, I guess. Yes. More noticeable. Especially when I’m nervous. Which is… often. People are… demanding.
DOCTOR: “Expressive” is a very diplomatic way to put it, Mr. Szmyd. And it's completely understandable to want to maintain a professional appearance. It sounds like the shaking is intermittent and perhaps exacerbated by nervousness, which is a common pattern. To get a better understanding of what might be contributing to this, could you describe any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? Like… a fever? I don't have a fever. I feel… tired. Always tired, actually. But that's just… life, isn't it? And… sometimes my muscles ache. A little. Nothing you'd notice. Old age, again. And I… I forget things. Like I said. Names. Where I put my glasses. That sort of thing. Is that a symptom? Everything aches when you get old, so it’s hard to tell what’s important and what's just… being old. My ex-wife tells me I snore. Loudly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Those are all important details, Mr. Szmyd, thank you for sharing them. Fatigue, muscle aches, memory concerns, and even snoring can be pieces of a larger puzzle. It’s good that you’re observant of these changes. To clarify the memory concerns, are you experiencing difficulty with recalling recent events, or is it more about names and misplaced items, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Names, definitely. Faces, too, sometimes. I make a living with faces, can you imagine? It’s embarrassing. And… recent events… hmm. I went to the grocery store yesterday. Or was it the day before? I bought… milk, I think. And bread. Maybe. I remember arguing with the cashier. About the price of tomatoes. Or was that last week? It all… blurs together. It’s like… a fog. A very annoying fog. My ex-wife says I repeat myself. Constantly. She says it drives her crazy. Though, frankly, she drives me crazy, so it’s probably equal.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulties with both short-term recall and recognition, which is understandably concerning, particularly given your profession. The repetition your ex-wife mentions is also a pertinent detail. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any past medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Past conditions… hmph. Let me think. I had… the flu. Many times. That's about it. Oh, and a bad back. Years ago. I lifted a very heavy prop. Very foolish of me. They gave me… pills. Blue ones. And white ones. I don't remember what they were for. My ex-wife handled all that. She's very good at doctors. I… I think I had high blood pressure, once. But they gave me more pills. And I stopped taking them. Too many pills. My ex-wife was very upset. She said… well, she said a lot of things. Honestly, I don't pay much attention when she gets going. It’s just… easier that way. She's a very… forceful personality. Is that what you want to know? If I've been sick? Not really. Just old. And forgetful. And… pill-averse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you’ve had some issues with back pain and potential high blood pressure in the past. The fact that you discontinued the medication for your blood pressure is important information to note. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Like I said, no pills. I don’t trust them. Too many side effects. And my ex-wife… she always said they were just… a way for the doctors to make money. A conspiracy, she called it. Honestly, I don't know what to believe anymore. Maybe she’s right. Maybe they are. No. No pills. Just… coffee. Lots and lots of coffee. To stay awake. And… sometimes a little brandy. To calm my nerves. Does that count? Is brandy a medication? It makes me feel better, anyway. Briefly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying that, Mr. Szmyd. It’s helpful to know about the coffee and occasional brandy. While they aren't traditional medications, they can certainly have an impact on your overall health and potentially contribute to some of the symptoms you're experiencing. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. That's… complicated. My mother… she was… difficult. Always complaining. She lived to be… old, I think. Very old. But she wasn’t happy. Ever. She… I think she had… something with her heart. But I don’t remember the details. My father… he was a soldier. Very stoic. Never talked about his feelings. He died… young. Suddenly. Heart attack, I think. My brother… he… he moved to America. A long time ago. I haven’t seen him in… decades. He’s probably forgotten about me. Honestly, I’ve mostly forgotten about him. No one in my family was ever… healthy. They all had… problems. Lots of problems. Is that helpful? They weren't a cheerful bunch, let me tell you. Lots of… sadness. And complaining. And heart problems, I think.
DOCTOR: That provides some useful information, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like there’s a family history of heart problems, and perhaps some overall health challenges. Knowing this is helpful as we consider potential causes for your symptoms. Finally, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Hmph. What does that even mean? I work. A lot. With makeup. Theater. Late nights. Early mornings. It’s… demanding. I live alone. In a small apartment. It's… tidy. My ex-wife makes sure of that. She visits occasionally. To… inspect. She criticizes my furniture. And my curtains. And my choice of television programs. I don’t exercise. Never have. Too much effort. I eat… whatever’s available. Usually takeout. Not very healthy, I suppose. I drink coffee. Lots of it. And… occasionally brandy. To relax. I watch television. Old movies. And I… I try to avoid my ex-wife. Is that a lifestyle? It’s… quiet. Lonely. And stressful. Mostly stressful. She keeps me on my toes, that woman. Always has. Always will. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Szmyd. That paints a very clear picture. A demanding work schedule, a mostly solitary life, and some ongoing stress are all factors we need to consider. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, based on what you've told me, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Hmph. What kind of examination? I don’t like doctors poking and prodding. It makes me nervous. And my ex-wife always said they don’t tell you the truth anyway. But… I suppose. If you have to. But be gentle, alright? And don’t take too long. I have… things to do. And… and don’t tell my ex-wife anything. She’ll just… criticize. Just… be quick, alright? And tell me what you're doing. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I understand your concerns, and I will absolutely respect your wishes. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything I'm doing before I do it. It will be a standard examination—checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, looking at your ears, and a brief neurological assessment. I will be as gentle as possible and will keep you informed every step of the way. And I can assure you, any findings will be kept confidential. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably on the examination table?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… alright. Just… don’t squeeze too tight, alright? And tell me what you're doing. Everything. No surprises. And… is this going to hurt? I don’t like pain. My ex-wife says I have a low pain tolerance. Which is… insulting. But… well, she's usually right. Just… be careful. And tell me what those numbers mean when you're done. Don't just… mumble something about high or low. I want details.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I will explain everything. I’m now inflating the cuff around your arm. It will feel a little tight for a moment, but it shouldn't be painful. I am measuring the pressure of the blood against your artery walls as your heart beats. Alright. Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. The top number, 145, is your systolic pressure—that's the pressure when your heart beats. The bottom number, 90, is your diastolic pressure—that’s the pressure when your heart is resting between beats. A normal blood pressure is generally considered to be below 120 over 80. Your reading is slightly elevated, which we’ll need to discuss further. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we want to monitor. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something wrong? My ex-wife always said I had a weak heart. She said I worried too much. Which… well, she’s probably right. Is it bad? What are you listening for? Don’t just… listen. Tell me. I need to know. Is it my heart? Is it… failing? My ex-wife said it was inevitable. That I would end up… well, never mind. Just… tell me what you hear. And be honest. I can handle it. Probably. As long as it’s not… too bad.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I’m hearing a slightly irregular rhythm and a faint murmur. A murmur is an extra sound when the heart valves open and close, and an irregular rhythm means your heartbeat isn’t perfectly consistent. It’s important to note this doesn’t automatically mean anything is seriously wrong. Murmurs are actually quite common, and many people live long and healthy lives with them. The irregularity is mild. However, to determine the cause and ensure everything is functioning properly, I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or ECG, which records the electrical activity of your heart. I also recommend an echocardiogram, or echo, which uses ultrasound to create an image of your heart’s structure and function. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Irregular? Ultrasound? ECG? What does all that mean? Is it… serious? Is it… failing? My ex-wife always said… well, never mind. Is it going to hurt? Do I need to be hospitalized? Will I need surgery? Hospitalized? No. Absolutely not. I don’t do hospitals. And surgery… well, I’m too old for surgery. Just… tell me what’s wrong. And be honest. Even if it’s bad. But… no hospitals. And no surgery. Promise me. No hospitals.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, let me assure you, we are not at the point of hospitalization or surgery. These tests—the ECG and the echo—are simply to gather more information. They are non-invasive, meaning they don't involve needles or incisions. The ECG involves placing small stickers on your chest to record your heart's electrical activity, and the echo uses a handheld device to create an image of your heart through your chest wall. They are painless and relatively quick. These tests will help me determine the cause of the irregular rhythm and the murmur. It could be something benign, or it could indicate a more serious issue that needs to be addressed. Knowing what we’re dealing with is the first step toward providing the best possible care. I completely understand your apprehension about hospitals and surgery, and I assure you, we’ll explore all non-invasive options first. Would you be willing to schedule these tests?
PATIENT: Stickers… alright. No hospitals. And no surgery. You promise? If it's just stickers… and no hospitals… then… alright. Schedule them. But… make them quick. I have… things to do. And I don't want to be stuck in a doctor's office all day. And… tell the technician to be gentle. I bruise easily. My ex-wife always said I have… delicate skin. But… no hospitals. Promise me. No hospitals. Or surgery. Deal?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. I promise – no hospitals or surgery at this stage. We'll keep everything as quick and comfortable as possible. I will personally note your preferences in your chart and instruct the technician to be as gentle as possible. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for an ECG and an echo as soon as possible. We will call you to confirm the appointments. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan that’s right for you. Before we finish, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that's it. Just… the hands. My shaky hands. Will the tests… show something about that? Will I be able to… keep working? It's… important. It's all I have. My ex-wife said I was… useless without it. She's always… critical. And… thank you. For… not sending me to the hospital. And for… listening. Most doctors don't listen. They just… poke and prod. You… you seem… alright. As far as doctors go. Just… make sure the technician is gentle. Please. And no hospitals. Still. Just… no hospitals.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. The tests may give us some insight into the cause of your hand tremors. Certain conditions can cause tremors, and identifying the underlying cause is important. We’ll also explore other potential causes, such as stress or medication side effects. I understand your concerns about your work and will certainly take that into consideration. We will work together to develop a plan that allows you to continue doing what you love. I will make a note to remind the technician to be especially gentle. I'll have my nurse come in to review these plans with you. If any concerns come up before your appointments, do not hesitate to contact the office. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. Take care of yourself, Mr. Szmyd. And rest assured, we will get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: Alright… thank you. I… I appreciate it. And… tell the nurse to be gentle. Please. . .
