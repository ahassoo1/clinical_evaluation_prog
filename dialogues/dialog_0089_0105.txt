DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. She’s been worried. I don’t really… remember all the details, honestly. Something about getting checked out before the surgery, right?
DOCTOR: Right, that’s perfectly fine. We always want to make sure someone is healthy enough for a procedure, and figure out what’s best for you. So, let’s start with the weight itself. How long have you been concerned about it, and has it been a gradual change or more sudden?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a good question. It feels like… a long time. Honestly, it’s hard to say. Maybe the last… five or ten years? It wasn’t like a big thing all at once, more like… slowly getting bigger. I used to be… lighter, I guess. Not a lot lighter, but… noticeable. I don't really track things like that though. My wife does all that, usually. She'll probably have better dates if you ask her.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And has this weight gain been accompanied by any changes in your eating habits or activity level?
PATIENT: Eating… hmm. I eat… normal, I think? Maybe a little more takeout lately, just because it’s easier. Work keeps me pretty busy. And… I don’t really do much exercise. Never really have, to be honest. I used to walk a bit more with my wife, but… things get in the way. It’s not that I don’t want to, it just… doesn’t happen, you know? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Life gets busy. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Symptoms… uh… sometimes I get a little… breathless, if I walk up stairs. Not terrible, but I notice it. And… my knees ache a bit, especially at the end of the day. I figured it was just getting older, though. Maybe… I get warm easier than I used to? Does that count? I’m really not good at remembering… or noticing these things, to be honest. My wife usually points stuff out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information – the breathlessness, knee pain, and feeling warmer are all things we should look into. Just to get a full picture, have you had any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… … sometimes I wake up feeling tired, even if I’ve been in bed for a while. I don’t… snore, do I? My wife would definitely tell me if I did. I think I just… toss and turn a bit. Not a big deal, I guess. I don’t fall asleep easily sometimes, just thinking about things… work mostly. But, I don't think it's a problem problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully not. Palpitations… hmm. Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little fast, but I just figured it was from stress at work. Swelling… … I don’t think so. Maybe a little bit at the end of the day, but nothing major. Honestly, I don’t really pay much attention. Everything feels kind of… normal, even with the weight and everything. Does that make sense? My wife worries a lot more than I do, I think.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve been to the doctor for check-ups, you know, regular stuff, but they never told me anything bad. I think… I had a bad flu a few years ago, but that was it. I don't really keep track of those things. And... I think my wife mentioned something about my cholesterol being a little high at the last checkup? But I honestly don't remember. She handles all the paperwork and doctor stuff usually. I just… show up.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… maybe a wisdom tooth pulled? That’s about it, I think. No hospital stays, not unless you count when I was born, of course! Seriously though, nothing serious. Nothing like… a big surgery. Just the little stuff. I really don’t have a good memory for things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… that’s a tough one. My… my parents, they both… passed away a while ago. I think my father had… something with his heart, maybe? But I don’t really know the details. We weren’t very close. And… I don't have any siblings. So… there’s not much family history to go on, I'm afraid. My wife's family is big, but I don’t know them well enough to know about their medical stuff. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll work with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I don't really take anything. Maybe a pain reliever if I have a headache, but that's it. And... rarely. I try to avoid pills if I can. My wife is the one who takes vitamins, a whole bunch of them. I just... don’t bother. I think I'm pretty healthy otherwise, you know? Except for the weight, of course. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always asks if I’m allergic to anything before trying new foods, but I always say no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I think I'm pretty lucky in that regard. My wife, on the other hand, is allergic to dust, I think. But me? No allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, that’s very helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, definitely not. I don’t smoke. Never have. And… I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And… definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I'm a pretty straight-laced guy. Work keeps me busy enough, I don’t need anything else. My wife doesn’t drink either, really. We both prefer a quiet night at home.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, yeah. I work in retail. Sales. Mostly electronics. It’s… okay. Long hours, on my feet a lot. That’s probably why my knees ache, to be honest. Lots of dealing with people, some of them are… difficult. It keeps me busy, though. Pays the bills. Not very stressful, really, except during the holidays. Honestly, I don't think about it much. It's just… a job, you know? My wife works from home, she's an accountant. Much quieter than my job, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long, I have to get back to work eventually. But, yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need. Just… tell me if it’s going to hurt, okay? I'm a little nervous about this whole thing, to be honest. But I'm trying to stay positive. For my wife, mostly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I’ll explain everything as I go. First, let's take your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. That’s something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs. That could be due to a number of things, but we’ll investigate further if needed. And now your knees. There’s some tenderness on the inside of both knees, and a slight range of motion limitation. Do you feel pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It's worse when I bend them all the way. It's the same ache I feel at the end of the day. I just figured it was old age, to be honest. I don't really do much to help them, though. No stretching or anything. Just… ignore it. Which probably isn’t the right thing to do, is it? This doesn't sound good, does it? My wife is going to worry.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re acknowledging the pain, Mr. Kochubey. Ignoring it won’t make it go away, and it’s good we’re looking into it now. Your weight is certainly contributing to the stress on your knees. Now, I’m going to quickly check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fullness. And finally, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, that completes the exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I think it would be helpful to order some blood tests to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We should also get an X-ray of your knees to see what’s going on there. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. That’s good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and X-rays… okay. My wife will probably want to know all the details, but I’m sure she’ll be happy we’re getting things checked out. Will the blood tests require fasting? I ate breakfast before I came… a pretty big breakfast, actually. Is that going to mess things up?
DOCTOR: Yes, some of the tests will require fasting, specifically the cholesterol test. Since you had a big breakfast, we’ll need to reschedule those tests for tomorrow morning. You’ll need to avoid eating or drinking anything after midnight tonight. The other tests don’t require fasting, so we can go ahead and do those now, if you're willing. Would you like me to call the lab to set up appointments for both?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. Reschedule the cholesterol test for tomorrow morning, and set up the other tests for now. I really appreciate you handling everything. It's a lot to keep track of, and I get easily confused. My wife will be so relieved. She’s always the organized one. Do you think… do you think I'm a good candidate for the surgery? I haven’t even asked that yet, have I? I’m just… a little scared, to be honest. For all the work and everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Kochubey. It’s too early to say definitively whether you’re a good candidate for surgery. We need the results of the blood tests and X-rays first to get a clearer picture of your overall health and the condition of your knees. However, based on our conversation and the exam, I have some initial thoughts. Your weight is a significant factor, and losing weight will certainly improve your surgical candidacy and reduce your risk of complications. We'll also need to address your blood pressure and any other underlying health issues. I also want to discuss non-surgical options with you, such as physical therapy and weight management programs. Sometimes, these can be effective alternatives to surgery. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and explore all your options. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Reasonable. Tests first, then talk about everything. I like that. Physical therapy… I’m not sure about that, but I’m willing to try. My wife keeps saying I need to exercise more. I guess she’s right. So, the lab… you'll call me with the appointment times? And I shouldn’t eat after midnight tonight, right? This is… a lot, but I’m glad we’re doing it. Thank you, Doctor. Really. I think I’m ready to go home now, if that’s okay. Just… need to process everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad you're feeling more comfortable with the plan. Yes, I’ll have the lab call you with the appointment times. And you are correct, no food or drink after midnight tonight for the cholesterol test. Let me just quickly document everything we discussed today and then I’ll have the lab reach out. It was good meeting you and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I’m good. You explained everything so clearly. I just need to… remember it all, I guess. My wife will help with that. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. I really appreciate your time and patience. I think I’m ready to go home now. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. You take care, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before your appointments. It was a pleasure meeting you as well.
