DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A letter confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my travel insurance company needs it. They’re being very strict this year.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sayar. A fit-to-fly letter. I can certainly help with that. To properly complete this, I’ll need to gather some information from you. It's important to ensure your health allows for safe air travel. First, could you tell me a little bit about why your insurance company is requesting this letter?
PATIENT: Well, my husband… passed away last year. We had a trip planned to visit family in Mongolia, and I’m finally trying to go… but the insurance is being difficult because of the timing, I think. They want to make sure nothing… happened to me before the trip, that I’m healthy enough to travel after everything. It's frustrating, honestly. They didn't ask for this before.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sayar. That sounds incredibly difficult, and it's understandable why you're frustrated. Losing your husband and then navigating these insurance hurdles… it's a lot. I apologize for the added stress. To complete the letter accurately, I'll need to ask some questions about your health. We’ll cover your medical history, any current symptoms you might be experiencing, and perhaps a brief physical exam, if you're agreeable. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I just… want to get this sorted, so I can finally go. Ask whatever you need to. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful. I don’t really… keep track of everything myself, to be honest. My husband always handled that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sayar. Medicare is helpful, and we can access some information through their system, but your input is still the most important part. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was little, but it healed fine. My doctor always said I was very healthy. I… I did have some problems with anemia a few years ago, but the iron pills fixed it. It hasn't been an issue since. I haven't been to a doctor regularly since my husband passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And the anemia was resolved with iron supplementation?
PATIENT: Yes, completely. I took the pills for about six months, and then the doctor said my levels were good. He did bloodwork to confirm, of course. It was… around 2023, I think? Early 2023. I remember because it was right before we started planning the trip with my husband. It’s funny, the little things you remember.
DOCTOR: It is the little things, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes. And I haven't had any problems since then. No fatigue, no dizziness… nothing. I really have been feeling okay, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Ms. Sayar. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not even vitamins. My husband always said I had a good diet, so I never needed them. And, like I said, I haven't really been to a doctor to be told otherwise. Just… trying to get by.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully. My husband was allergic to shellfish, so we didn't eat it often, but that was for him, not me. Again, just trying to remember things for him sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's quickly cover your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years ago. And we never drank much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Definitely no drugs. I promise.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Sayar. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask a few questions about your recent health. Have you had any recent illnesses, injuries, or surgeries in the past year?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s been… quiet, thankfully. Just a few colds, like everyone gets. Nothing serious enough to see a doctor. I had the flu shot last year, though. I always get it. My husband made sure of it. He was very good at keeping me healthy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And finally, are you currently experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, or any other concerning symptoms?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Really. I feel… normal. A little sad, of course, but physically, I’m okay. That’s why I’m so frustrated with the insurance company. They’re making me jump through hoops for no reason. But I understand you need to ask.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar. It's good to hear that you're not experiencing any current symptoms. To complete the fit-to-fly letter, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, just to be thorough. This will include checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick visual examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Let’s just get this over with, so I can finally go visit my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat is clear, no signs of infection. Your ears are normal. Overall, you appear to be in good health. Everything sounds and looks good, Ms. Sayar. Based on your history and this brief examination, I do not see any medical contraindications to air travel.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… that’s wonderful! Really? That means I can finally go? Can you write the letter now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sayar, that is correct. Based on my assessment, I will gladly write you a letter confirming you are fit to fly. It will state that you have no known medical conditions that would prevent you from safely traveling by air. Here you go. Please review it to make sure all the information is accurate. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything we discussed today?
PATIENT: Yes, this is perfect! Everything looks correct. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you so much. I think that’s everything. I really appreciate your help. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sayar. I'm glad I could help. I understand how important this trip is to you. If you experience any changes in your health before your trip, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. And have a wonderful time visiting your family. Safe travels.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
