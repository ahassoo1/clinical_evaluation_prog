DOCTOR: Right. Zoie Stoffregen, 87. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's… well, it’s my waterworks. Been a bit tricky lately, you see. Not as strong as they used to be. Takes a bit of… pushing, sometimes. I don't know why, just… old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. And how long has this been…tricky, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. A while now, I think. Maybe a few months? Or was it longer? Time… it all blends together, doesn’t it? It's not sudden, that's for sure. It just… got worse little by little. I'm sorry, I'm not very good with dates. My husband usually keeps track of things.
DOCTOR: A few months, gradually worsening. Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort with this difficulty?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, no. More like… a little ache afterwards, sometimes. But it's not sharp, you understand? Just a bit… tired feeling. And it doesn't happen every time. Mostly when I really have to go. It’s a strange thing.
DOCTOR: “Tired feeling.” Right. And any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Color? I don't usually look, dear. I just… go. Is it supposed to be a certain color? I'm sorry, I don't pay much attention to those things. It looks like pee, usually! I’m afraid I can't be much help with that. My eyesight isn't what it used to be either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any…leakage?
PATIENT: Leakage? Oh… well, yes. A little. When I cough, sometimes. Or if I laugh real hard. It's embarrassing, but… what can you do? It's just… old age, again, I suppose. A bit of a dribble, that’s all. Nothing major, thankfully. I always keep a pad, just in case.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Yes, I take a little pill for my blood pressure. And another one for my…arthritis, I think it is. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something my husband gets me. I can’t remember the names of them, sorry. There aren't many, though. He handles most of that, you see. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Do you know the dosages of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Dosages? No, I don't think so. I just take what he gives me. He knows what he’s doing. He’s very careful. I think one is a little white pill and the other is…blue? I really don't pay attention to those numbers. I’m sorry. I trust my husband completely. He’s a retired pharmacist, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a more detailed medication list from your husband. It's important for safety. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. Can you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam is fine. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet, you know. Old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: 141 pounds. And your height is documented as 182 centimeters. Now, if you don't mind, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. 182… that sounds tall. I always thought I was a bit on the bigger side. Is this alright? I’m a bit creaky, you see. Try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender to palpation. No masses appreciated. Bowel sounds are present, albeit slightly diminished. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, neurological? Is something wrong? I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, maybe that's it. Reflexes… is that like when they hit your knee with that little hammer? I don’t like those. I always flinch.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mrs. Stoffregen. Just to rule things out. It’s not necessarily indicative of a problem. I’m going to test your reflexes in your legs. It involves a small tap, yes, like you mentioned. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Relax… Just… be gentle, alright? I bruise easily these days. My skin is so thin. This whole thing is making me a bit anxious, to be honest. It's probably nothing, like you say… but still. It’s worrying, an old woman getting poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Patellar reflexes are present bilaterally, but diminished. Ankle reflexes are also diminished. Alright. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing urinary incontinence and some diminished reflexes, likely age-related. It’s not immediately concerning, but further investigation is warranted.
PATIENT: Oh… incontinence? That sounds… fancy. So it’s just old age then? Not anything serious? What kind of "investigation"? More poking and prodding? I really don’t want to have to do more tests. Could we just… get a little pill for it? My husband always says a little pill fixes everything.
DOCTOR: A "little pill" might help, but we need to understand why this is happening. I’m going to order a urinalysis to rule out infection. And I recommend a referral to a urologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can assess your bladder function and determine the best course of treatment. I'll also need a complete medication list from your husband, including dosages. That is essential.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A urologist? Is that someone who… looks inside? I don't like the sound of that at all. And more tests? I'm getting a bit overwhelmed, honestly. Can’t we just try the pill first? Please? I trust my husband, and he knows what's best for me. I really don't want to see another doctor. This is all very frightening.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Stoffregen, I understand your concerns, but I cannot prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. A urinalysis is a simple test, and a consultation with a urologist is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. It is in your best interest to follow these recommendations. I will have my nurse provide you with the necessary paperwork for the urinalysis and the urologist referral. .
