DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. GonzalezPerez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Nothing major, thankfully. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to get things updated with the clinic.
DOCTOR: Medicare, yes. While paperwork is certainly necessary, our appointments are for addressing health concerns, Ms. Fabing. Simply updating forms doesn’t typically require a physician’s time. Are you experiencing any health issues at all?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Well, no, not really. I’m feeling alright, all things considered. Just figured I’d get it done while I was able. It’s been a busy summer with work, you know? I don’t want to forget and have to come back another time. I install and repair valves – it keeps me moving, that’s for sure!
DOCTOR: Moving, yes. And physically demanding work, I presume?
PATIENT: It is, Doctor. Lots of bending, lifting…sometimes crawling in tight spaces. It keeps me pretty active, but my back gets a little sore sometimes, if I'm honest. Nothing I can't usually work through, though. Just a little stiff in the mornings, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Stiffness, mornings.” Right. And how long has this been occurring, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s hard to say exactly…probably on and off for a few years now. It comes and goes with the workload, really. When I'm slower, it's not so bad. This summer has been particularly busy, so it's been a bit more noticeable lately. I just thought it was part of getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Part of getting older,” you say. I find that patients often attribute discomfort to age when there may be other factors at play. Do you experience any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain down my legs, thankfully. Just in my lower back, mostly right across it. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. It eases up after I get moving, usually. It’s just… annoying, I guess. And I don’t want it to become something worse, you know?
DOCTOR: A dull ache that eases with movement. And has anything specific brought on this increased discomfort this summer, beyond simply a higher workload?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. We took on a big job a couple of months ago, installing some new valves for the water treatment plant. Lots of overhead work, reaching and bending in awkward positions. I think that might have aggravated it a bit. It wasn't a single incident, just… a lot of strain over a few weeks. Also, I think I lifted something a little too heavy one day, but I don't remember exactly what. It happens sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Overhead work, possible heavy lifting.” Right. And have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. No numbness or tingling. Everything feels normal there. It's really just the lower back, like I said. Sometimes a little stiff in the mornings, a little achy after a long day, but that’s about it. I'm probably just being an old worrywart, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Worrywart,” perhaps. However, it is prudent to ascertain the full extent of any discomfort. Let’s perform a brief physical examination, Ms. Fabing, to assess your range of motion and identify any areas of particular sensitivity. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. If you think it’s best. I’d rather check it out now than let it get worse, you’re right. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll begin. Please let me know if anything causes you pain during the examination. First, I'm going to have you lie flat on your back.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. I don't always feel comfortable on these things!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Tell me if you feel any tenderness or sharp pain. …Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little there… Not a sharp pain, but it’s a little tender when you press on it. And maybe a little bit there too… It’s hard to say, honestly. It’s just a general achiness. Oh, ooh, that’s a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about when you bend forward?
PATIENT: Okay. It feels a little stiff, and a little achy. It’s not bad, but it’s definitely noticeable. I don't feel any shooting pain, thankfully. It just… doesn’t want to bend very far.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, let’s try bending backwards, if you’re able. Again, please let me know if you experience any pain.
PATIENT: That’s… a little uncomfortable. Not a sharp pain, but it feels like something is pulling. I don’t usually bend backwards like this, to be honest. It feels better just standing straight, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie on your side now, please. We’ll check your hip range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay. This side is good, I think. Let me know if you need me to adjust.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any pain here?
PATIENT: No, not really. That doesn’t hurt at all. Feels pretty normal, actually. It’s really just my back that’s bothering me. Unless… sometimes I feel a little bit of a click in my hip when I get up from sitting, but it doesn’t hurt. It just… feels like something pops. It doesn’t happen every time, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Fabing. That will be all for the physical examination at this time. Based on my findings, it appears you have some muscle strain in your lower back, potentially exacerbated by your work. The intermittent clicking in your hip isn’t particularly concerning at this time, but we should monitor it. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking any?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And no medications either. Just… a lot of ibuprofen sometimes, when my back really flares up. I try to avoid it when I can, though. Oh, and I take a multivitamin, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the examination and your history, I suspect a musculoskeletal strain. We can start with conservative management. I recommend over-the-counter pain relief, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. Heat or ice packs can also provide relief. It's crucial to practice proper lifting techniques, and avoid any activities that aggravate your symptoms. I'd like to see you back in two weeks to re-evaluate your progress. If your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you experience numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs, please contact the office immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Heat or ice, proper lifting… I can definitely do that. And I’ll watch for any numbness or tingling. Two weeks sounds fine. Thank you for taking the time to look at it. I appreciate it. Do I need to fill out any more forms?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that concludes our consultation for today, Ms. Fabing. I'll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion, including the recommendations for conservative management. If you have any questions after reviewing it, please don't hesitate to call the office. I'll also schedule your follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. Do you happen to have a preference for a morning or afternoon appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, an afternoon appointment would be great, if that's possible. That way I can get most of my work done before coming in. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think I can manage this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have you scheduled for an afternoon appointment on August 16th. The nurse will confirm the time via telephone. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor GonzalezPerez. I really appreciate it. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Fabing. .
