DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Oh, my… what brings me in. Yes. Well, it’s this… discomfort. Lower down, you see. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s rather… substantial. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… well, it’s a complicated condition, isn't it? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, I think they called it. It’s been… some time since I’ve seen anyone regularly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. I apologize if I ramble.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly alright if you ramble—we have plenty of time, and I want to get a complete picture of what’s going on. Lupus is indeed a complicated condition, and it's good you brought that up. So, you’re experiencing discomfort in your lower region, and it’s intermittent?
PATIENT: Intermittent… yes, I believe that’s the correct word. It doesn’t happen every day, thankfully. Some days I feel… well, perfectly fine. Others…others it’s a sharp pain, almost cramping. It feels…deep inside. And it’s not always the same. Sometimes it's a dull ache, sometimes… quite intense. Does that make sense? I’m trying to recall specifics, but the dates and the exact nature of it all… they’re rather fuzzy. I do remember being quite uncomfortable a few weeks ago, though. Perhaps a month? It kept me up at night.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Glymph. It's very helpful to know it varies in intensity and character. So, a sharp, cramping pain, sometimes a dull ache, primarily in your lower abdomen, and it was particularly bothersome about a month ago. To help me understand more fully, could you describe where exactly in your lower abdomen you feel the discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… difficult to pinpoint precisely. It seems to be… down here, mostly. But it sometimes radiates… spreads outwards, you see? It isn't just one single spot. More of a… a general feeling of unease throughout the lower region. It’s not my side, exactly, more… centered. I hope that’s not too vague. I truly wish I could be more precise. It feels like… well, imagine a large, uncomfortable fullness. That’s probably the best way to describe it, when it's mild. When it's severe… it’s a different matter entirely.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Glymph, thank you. Lower abdomen, slightly to the left of the midline, with some radiation throughout the lower region. It sounds like it’s quite variable. You mentioned it feels like fullness when mild. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Trigger… now that is a difficult one. I haven’t noticed a clear connection, not that I recall. I eat… reasonably, I suppose. Nothing particularly rich or spicy. I try to avoid things that upset my stomach, naturally. Stress, perhaps? I’ve had… a rather eventful life, if I may say so, and lately there's been… adjustments. Changes. My son moved away, you see. A lovely boy, but… it's quiet now. Could that be it? I honestly don’t know. Sometimes it seems to come on randomly, other times… after a long walk, perhaps. Or after sitting for too long. It's really quite unpredictable. I apologize for my lack of clarity. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it’s perfectly understandable that it’s frustrating. Stress, recent life changes, walking, and prolonged sitting – those are all things that could potentially contribute. Let’s move on to some other questions, then. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… oh dear. Well… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. They’ve been… irregular, shall we say? Sometimes…difficult. Not consistently, but frequently enough to be…noticeable. And… There's been…a bit of spotting. Not heavy, you understand. Just…a few flecks of blood. It’s come and gone, and I initially dismissed it as… well, just a minor inconvenience. But now that you ask… it has been occurring more frequently. It’s rather embarrassing to discuss, I must confess. I’ve been meaning to mention it to someone, but… I've been putting it off. Is that concerning?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Glymph. It’s important information, and you did the right thing by bringing it up. Irregular bowel movements and spotting are both things we need to investigate further. It's not embarrassing at all—I'm here to help. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can recall. No fever, no chills. No nausea or vomiting. No significant weight loss… although, I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. My appetite has been…normal, I suppose. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps. But that could be due to the changes, you see. And… a general feeling of malaise. A sort of…unsettledness. It’s difficult to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a vague discomfort. I haven’t noticed any swelling, either. I've been trying to pay attention to my body, but it's difficult when everything feels… off. Oh! And my skin… it's been rather dry lately. And I've been bruising easily. Is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Glymph. Fatigue, general malaise, dry skin, and easy bruising are all things that could potentially be connected. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have a list of your current medications with you?
PATIENT: Oh, my… yes, I do. Somewhere… ah, here we are. It’s a bit of a mess, I’m afraid. I take Plaquenil, of course, for the Lupus. And……a low dose of Lisinopril for my blood pressure. And occasionally, ibuprofen for aches and pains. I try to avoid it when possible, but… sometimes it’s necessary. And that's all, I believe. Oh, wait! There's a vitamin D supplement, too. The doctor said my levels were low. It's all rather… complicated, isn't it? I apologize for the disorganization. I really must get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. This is very helpful. Plaquenil for Lupus, Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional ibuprofen, and vitamin D. That gives me a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, not to medications, anyway. I have a bit of a sensitivity to… dust, perhaps? It makes me sneeze, but it's not a serious allergy. And I get a bit of a rash sometimes, if I wear certain fabrics. But nothing life-threatening, thankfully. No allergies to foods, either. I've always been able to eat pretty much anything, although I prefer a simple diet. And no allergies to… anything else, as far as I'm aware. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. It's the Lupus that causes most of my trouble, really. It seems to react to everything!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. No known medication or food allergies, just a sensitivity to dust and certain fabrics. That’s good to know. Now, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was a young woman. A very long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy as well, many years later. That’s about it, I believe. Nothing else major. A few minor procedures, of course, but nothing that required a hospital stay. It’s been a while since I’ve had any significant medical issues, aside from the Lupus, that is. It's hard to keep track, really. So many years… and so many doctors. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. Appendectomy and hysterectomy. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… a complicated matter, really. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had heart problems. I don’t recall the specifics. And my brother… he suffered from depression, sadly. On my husband’s side… his mother had diabetes, and his father had… well, I can’t recall exactly. It was something to do with his kidneys, I think. It’s been a long time, and nobody was very forthcoming about medical details. It wasn't something we discussed openly. And my son… he seems perfectly healthy, thankfully. But truthfully, I don't know much about his medical history, either. We weren't particularly close. It’s rather… fragmented, I’m afraid. Does that help at all? I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Fragmented is common. Arthritis, heart problems, depression, and diabetes – that gives me some useful information. Now, lastly, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I'm retired now. I used to be a ship engineer, believe it or not. A rather unconventional career path for a woman, perhaps, but I enjoyed it immensely. I'm single, have been for quite some time. No children, as I mentioned. I live alone, in a small house near the coast. I enjoy reading, gardening… quiet pursuits, really. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner. I used to be very active, travelled extensively, but… well, my energy levels haven’t been what they used to be. I don't have many close friends these days. My son lives quite far away, and we don't see each other often. It’s a simple life, but… it’s my life. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That gives me a very good picture, Ms. Glymph. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I think it’s time to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven't had a proper physical exam in… a very long time, to be honest. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I do hope it won't be too uncomfortable. I tend to be a bit… fragile, these days. But I understand it’s important. Please, proceed at your own pace.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. We’ll take things slowly and at your own pace. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And quite sensible, I suppose. Please, proceed. I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just… be gentle, if you would. And if I feel uncomfortable at any point, I shall let you know. I do get a bit anxious during medical exams, I must confess. It's the needles, mostly. But I'm trying to be brave. Please, don't hesitate to explain what you’re doing, as you go along. It helps to calm my nerves.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph. I will explain everything as I go along, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I’m just wrapping the cuff around your arm now. This will measure your blood pressure – it tells us how hard your heart is working. Inflating the cuff… deflating the cuff… Okay, your blood pressure is 135/85. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Placing the stethoscope on Ms. Glymph's chest… Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Listening… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, with no signs of congestion. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. I’m just gently pressing on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Palpating Ms. Glymph’s abdomen, starting in the upper quadrants… Do you feel any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. That’s… tender. Not excruciating, but definitely uncomfortable. It’s a dull ache, really. It’s been like that on and off for weeks, as I mentioned. And… It feels… a bit hard there, if I’m honest. Not rock-hard, but definitely firmer than the rest of my abdomen. Is that… concerning? It’s difficult to tell, really. I’m not a medical professional, as you know. But it doesn't feel right, if that makes sense. Please, be careful. I'm a bit sensitive in that area. And… the murmur. You said it was likely benign? But… is there a chance it could be something more serious? I always worry, you see. I have a rather active imagination.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Glymph. It’s good you told me about the tenderness and the firmness. It's important we investigate that further. The tenderness in your left lower quadrant, coupled with the firmness, could indicate a few different things. It could be inflammation, a muscle strain, or potentially something more concerning. We need to rule out any serious causes. Regarding the murmur, it is likely benign, but it's always best to be cautious. It's a soft murmur, and you have no other symptoms like shortness of breath or chest pain, which is reassuring. But we can order an echocardiogram to get a clearer picture of your heart. I’m also going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Listening to Ms. Glymph’s abdomen with the stethoscope… Your bowel sounds are a bit quiet, which could be related to the tenderness. Do you feel any nausea or bloating?
PATIENT: Quiet bowel sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? No, I haven’t been nauseous, thankfully. But I have been feeling a bit…bloated, yes. Especially in the evenings. It’s uncomfortable, but not debilitating. It comes and goes. It’s just a general feeling of fullness, really. And… sometimes gas. More than usual, I suppose. But nothing dramatic. It's difficult to say what's normal, these days. Everything feels… off. And the firmness… you think it could be something serious? I always worry about appendicitis, you see. My grandmother had it, and it was quite… traumatic. And… are there any other tests you think are necessary? I want to make sure we’re not missing anything. I know you’re busy, but I’d appreciate your thoroughness. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be thorough, Ms. Glymph, and I appreciate you voicing your concerns. The quiet bowel sounds and bloating, coupled with the tenderness and firmness, suggest we need to investigate further. Given your history and symptoms, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be appendicitis, although your symptoms aren't classic for it at this time. It could also be diverticulitis, a bowel inflammation, or even a mass. To rule out these possibilities, I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, a C-reactive protein test to look for inflammation, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your organs and help us identify the source of the tenderness and firmness. We'll also do a urine analysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? And all those other tests… it seems like a lot. But… I suppose it’s necessary, if you think it’s best. Yes, alright. Please proceed with all the tests. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just hope it’s nothing too… alarming. And… contrast? Is that safe? I've heard it can be hard on the kidneys. I do have a bit of a history of…sensitive kidneys, you see. Perhaps we could discuss alternatives? I just want to make sure we’re being as careful as possible. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hate waiting. It just makes me worry even more. But… if it’s necessary, I’ll try to be patient. Please, just let me know what to expect. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. I really do. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and get back to feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Ms. Glymph, and I’m glad you’re speaking up. A CT scan is a powerful tool, but we always weigh the risks and benefits. You're right to be concerned about the contrast dye, especially given your history of sensitive kidneys. We’ll take precautions. Before the scan, we’ll give you intravenous fluids to help your kidneys flush out the dye. We’ll also check your kidney function before and after the scan to make sure everything is okay. If your kidney function is significantly impaired, we can consider a CT scan without contrast or an MRI instead. As for the results, it usually takes 24-48 hours to get them back. I understand the waiting is difficult, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. The fluids and the monitoring… that’s reassuring. And the promise of a quick call… I appreciate that, Doctor. Knowing you’ll be looking out for me… it helps to calm my nerves. And the emergency room instructions… yes, I’ll remember those. Severe pain, fever, nausea… I’ll be vigilant. I always try to be. Thank you, Doctor Reisig. You’ve been very patient and thorough. I feel much better knowing we’re taking all the necessary precautions. And… what about the murmur? You said it was likely benign, but… will the echocardiogram tell us more? I just want to be certain. I know I’m asking a lot, but I always worry about my heart. It just feels… fragile, these days. But thank you, again. I truly appreciate your kindness. I think… I think that’s all for now. Please, let me know if you need anything else. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It’s my pleasure. And you’re not asking too much at all—it’s important to address all your concerns. The echocardiogram will give us a detailed look at your heart structure and function. It will tell us if the murmur is significant and if there’s any underlying heart disease. We’ll be able to see the chambers, valves, and walls of your heart, and it will give us a clear picture of your heart health. I’ve already put in the orders for all the tests, and the receptionist will schedule them for you. She’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for each test. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I’m here to help. Now, if you’re all set, I’ll leave you to get dressed. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, Ms. Glymph.
