DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. Well, it’s my back. Lower back, mostly. Been hurting for… oh, a good while now. Feels like old man pain, you know? Not a sharp pain, more like a… ache. It's been getting worse lately, makes it hard to get around.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino. “Old man pain”... I understand. And it’s been worsening recently, affecting your ability to get around. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about this ache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's worst when I bend over, like to pick something up. Or if I stand for too long. Sitting isn't so bad, but after a while, even that gets to me. Feels like… like my bones are tired, if that makes sense. Not a muscle ache, not really. More deep down. And it’s pretty constant, just different levels of hurt. I haven't fallen or anything, just… slow build-up over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s aggravated by bending and prolonged standing, and constant, varying in intensity. Not related to any injury… just a gradual onset. And you say it feels deep down, not muscular. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not down my legs. It stays right in my lower back. Mostly right in the middle, but sometimes it feels like it spreads a little to the sides. Not shooting pain, just… more ache. I did have a bad fall when I was younger, a long time ago, but it didn't hurt my back then. I'm not sure if that's important. It was… oh, goodness, maybe fifty years ago now? I don't really remember. But this feels different.
DOCTOR: Fifty years ago… okay, we'll keep that in mind. And you're right, that feels quite distant. This is a different type of pain. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No tingling. Legs feel alright. Sometimes a little weak, but that’s just 'cause I don’t get out as much as I used to. I used to walk a lot, but it's harder now, with the back. It's just… the pain makes me move slower, and then everything feels weak, you know? It's all connected, I think. But no numbness or tingling, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness or tingling. I understand that the pain contributes to a feeling of weakness. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis or any other conditions affecting your bones or joints?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. My first wife… she had something with her joints, something bad. But not me. Never been told I had anything like that. I think they checked my bones once, a long time ago, when I broke my arm as a kid. But nothing ever came of it. Just a simple break. No, Doctor, no arthritis or anything like that. Just… old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior diagnoses of arthritis or bone conditions. And you haven’t had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never been under the knife. I always figured I was too healthy to need one, ha! Until now, maybe. But no, never had anything taken out or put in. Just a few stitches here and there when I was a boy, scrapes and bumps, you know. Nothing serious. I always preferred a good bandage and some rest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I take a little something for my blood pressure, just a tiny pill once a day. But that’s it. And that’s just 'cause the doctor told me to, years ago. Nothing for the pain, I just try to tough it out. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, makes me feel… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a small medication for blood pressure. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back, if you don’t mind. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and look for any areas of tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Range of motion… means you want me to bend around, doesn't it? Should be interesting! I'll try my best. Just be gentle, okay? It does hurt a little, as you know. Examination table… right this way?
DOCTOR: Yes, bending and moving around, and I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie on your stomach on the table. Okay, I'm going to gently palpate your lower back to assess for tenderness. Tell me if you feel any pain at any specific point. And I'll also check your range of motion… I’d like you to try and bend forward, as far as you comfortably can. Okay… and now, try to bend backwards, again, just as far as you can comfortably go. I am noting some tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine, primarily at L4-L5. Limited range of motion with both flexion and extension, but no signs of acute muscle spasm. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally in the lower extremities. No neurological deficits noted.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s tender right there… Yes, right around there, on the left side mostly. And bending back… that’s a bit harder. Feels like something’s stuck. Not as good as it used to be, that’s for sure. And left side feels tighter than the right. Like it’s… rusty, maybe. But no shooting pain, just… a dull ache when I move. I'm doing my best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, I appreciate you letting me know. Okay, back on your back now, please. Now, I’m going to check your legs again, just a quick neurological exam. I'm going to test your reflexes and strength. Just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing. Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Sensation is intact. Based on the examination and your history, it sounds like you have lumbar strain, likely chronic in nature. The tenderness, limited range of motion, and lack of neurological deficits are consistent with this. It’s not uncommon to develop these types of issues with age, especially with activities that strain the back. Now, we could order some imaging, like an X-ray or MRI, to rule out any structural problems, but given your history and the exam findings, I don’t think it’s immediately necessary. We can start with conservative management. What do you think?
PATIENT: Conservative management… that sounds good to me, Doctor. I don't want any big tests or anything. Just want to feel better, you know? So… what does that mean? No surgery, right? And what can I do? Is there anything I can take, or exercises? I've heard about stretching, but I'm afraid of making it worse. Just want to get back to walking, mostly.
DOCTOR: No surgery, absolutely not. Conservative management means things like physical therapy, pain relief medication if needed, and lifestyle modifications. Stretching is good, gentle stretching, but it’s best to be guided by a physical therapist to ensure you’re doing it correctly. I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild NSAID – naproxen – to help with the inflammation and pain. Start with one 220mg tablet twice daily with food. And I'm going to give you a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in lower back pain. They can teach you proper stretching and strengthening exercises tailored to your specific needs. They'll also assess your posture and gait. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that aggravate your pain, such as prolonged standing or heavy lifting. Use proper lifting techniques if you must lift something – bend your knees and keep your back straight. And try to maintain a healthy weight, as that can also put extra strain on your back. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Naproxen… okay, I think I’ve heard of that. Twice a day with food… alright, I can do that. And a physical therapist… good. That sounds like a good idea. Someone to show me what to do, instead of just guessing. No heavy lifting… that’s easy enough. I don’t do much of that anymore. And I'll try to sit up straighter, I guess. So… I go get the prescription, and then call the number for the physical therapist? And how long does it take, usually, to start feeling better?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You can pick up the prescription at your usual pharmacy. And here’s the referral form for the physical therapist. They're located on Elm Street, and their number is listed here. It's best to call and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. As for how long it takes to feel better… that varies from person to person. With consistent physical therapy and following the recommended guidelines, you should start to see some improvement within a few weeks. It’s important to be patient and consistent. It’s not a quick fix, but most people experience significant pain relief and improved function with conservative management. I want you to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, weakness, or loss of bowel or bladder control, contact me immediately. Otherwise, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in about 4-6 weeks to assess your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, four to six weeks. I can do that. And if anything gets worse, I call you right away. Numbness, tingling… got it. That's good to know. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You made me feel a lot better, just talking about it. Thank you. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any vitamins, or special exercises I can start now, before I see the physical therapist? Just want to get a head start, if possible.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Albino. I'm glad I could help. As for getting a head start... Avoid prolonged sitting, if possible. If you must sit, make sure your chair provides good lumbar support and that your feet are flat on the floor. Gentle walking is good, but don't overdo it. Listen to your body. Vitamin D is important for bone health, so ensuring you get enough through sunlight or supplements is a good idea, but don't start taking any high doses without consulting with your primary care physician. As for specific exercises, I'd advise against starting any new ones before seeing the physical therapist. They will assess your condition and recommend exercises tailored to your needs. You want to avoid doing anything that could potentially worsen your pain. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I feel a lot more hopeful now. I'll pick up the prescription, and call the physical therapist tomorrow. And I'll try to listen to my body, and not overdo it. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and patience. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Albino. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And I wish you all the best with your recovery. Have a good day, and take care.
