DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, it's about this… tiredness. Just dragging all the time. And it's not just regular tired, you know? It's… well, I’ve started eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. It’s embarrassing to even say. And frankly, I don’t have time for this nonsense. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. Thank you for telling me. It is good you brought this to my attention, even if it’s embarrassing. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. When did you first start noticing this tiredness and… the dirt eating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The tiredness has been creeping up for maybe… six months now? Just gradually getting worse. But the dirt… that's been happening for maybe a month. A month and a half? It started with just a little taste, and now… well, now I find myself looking for it. It's stupid, really. I used to be a very sensible woman. Do you really think it's something serious? Because I have patients to help, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of increasing tiredness and a month or so of… craving dirt. We'll get to the bottom of this, Candis. It is unusual, but we need to figure out what's causing it. This craving for dirt – do you have a specific type of dirt you're drawn to?
PATIENT: Specific type? Oh, honestly, what a question! It’s… mostly the red clay from my garden. It just… smells right, I suppose. And feels… good in my mouth. Don’t look at me like that. I know it’s awful! It's not like I'm going out of my way to find fancy dirt, it's just… there. And easier than going to the store for something else. Really, I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay, red clay from the garden. Thank you for clarifying. It's helpful information. This could indicate a few different things, and we'll need to explore some possibilities. Have you noticed any other changes in your body along with the tiredness and the dirt eating?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmmm. Well, my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. Everything tastes… bland. And I’ve been feeling a bit short of breath, even just walking up the stairs. But I’m 79! Short of breath comes with the territory, doesn't it? I just figured it was my age. Are we getting somewhere with this, Doctor? I really do have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting somewhere. Loss of appetite and shortness of breath are important things to mention, even if you think they’re just part of getting older. I want to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and looking at your throat. Then we can talk about some possible tests. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. Get it over with. But don’t take too long. Honestly, I don’t understand why everything takes so much time these days. It used to be a doctor would just know what was wrong. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I hear some mild crackling in your lungs. Nothing immediately alarming, but we'll need to investigate further. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little high, but not critically so. Now, let's take a quick look at your throat. Throat looks okay, a little pale, but no obvious signs of infection. Now, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your iron levels, complete blood count, and some basic electrolytes. This will help us rule out some possibilities and get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, fine. As long as it doesn't take forever. What are you looking for, exactly? Iron? What does that have to do with eating dirt? Honestly, the whole thing is ridiculous. I just want to feel better. Can I go back to work after this? I have appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're looking at iron levels because a craving for dirt, what we call pica, can sometimes be a sign of iron deficiency anemia. The body tries to get the nutrients it's lacking, and sometimes that manifests as unusual cravings. It's not always the case, but it's a good place to start. The blood tests will also tell us if you have any other deficiencies or infections that could be contributing to your tiredness and appetite loss. As for going back to work… let’s see what the blood tests show first. Depending on the results, you may be able to go back today, but we might need to do some further investigation. I don't want you to push yourself too hard if something is seriously wrong. I'll have the lab draw the blood right away. It should only take a few minutes. They'll let me know when the results are back.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. And please tell them to be quick about it. I really don't have time for this. Where is the lab, anyway? Honestly, this whole place is so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall to your left. The technician, Sarah, is already expecting you. She'll take good care of you. I'll be right here reviewing your chart, and I’ll let you know as soon as the results are available. It shouldn't be long. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… get me the results quickly. Honestly, the nerve… dirt, indeed. .
