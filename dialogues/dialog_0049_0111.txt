DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why my wife insisted I come. Something about… my complexion? It’s just a bit darker than usual, I suppose. And I tire easily, naturally, at my age. Let’s get this over with quickly, shall we? I have important matters to attend to.
DOCTOR: Right. A change in complexion and fatigue. I see. While it's good you're here, dismissing things simply because of age isn’t… prudent. We'll need to explore this a bit. When you say 'darker', can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Goodness. It's… darker. Like… well, like tanned leather, perhaps? I work with iron, you see. Rebar. It's a strenuous profession. Perhaps it’s the sun. Or the dust. I haven't kept track of such trivial details, Doctor. My wife handles those sorts of things. Really, I’m quite busy. Is there a simple explanation for all of this? Some tonic, perhaps?
DOCTOR: “Tanned leather,” you say. And you work with iron, exposed to the sun. It could be related to your occupation, certainly. However, a change in skin pigmentation can be indicative of several things, and it’s vital we rule out anything… serious. Before we consider a 'tonic,' I need to ask some more questions. Do you notice the discoloration is all over, or is it localized to certain areas?
PATIENT: Localized? I... honestly haven't been examining myself in a mirror, Doctor. I have far more pressing concerns. It's mostly on my arms and face, I believe. Anywhere exposed to the elements, naturally. And perhaps a bit on my legs. My wife pointed it out, and frankly, she’s far too concerned with appearances. It’s likely just the sun. I assure you. This is all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Right. Arms and face, areas exposed to the sun. I understand your… perspective, Mr. Drahota, but we must be thorough. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well… I tire more easily, as I mentioned. My appetite hasn’t been what it once was, but that could be the heat. And my… joints ache a bit. But again, Doctor, I am eighty-five years old! Aches and pains are to be expected. Is this a comprehensive list, or are we to dissect every minor discomfort I experience? Frankly, I'm beginning to feel quite unwell simply discussing all of this.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, decreased appetite, and joint pain. Yes, those are all pertinent details. Let me review your EHR… Ah, I see some notes from Dr. Lee, your previous physician. Some mild hypertension noted a few years back, and some cholesterol monitoring. No mention of any significant changes in skin pigmentation. Have you had any recent infections?
PATIENT: Infections? No, nothing significant. A minor cold, perhaps, last winter. My wife insisted I see a doctor for that as well. Honestly, I’ve always been rather… robust. I haven’t needed to bother with doctors often. I’m not one to complain over every little ailment. This is all very… tedious. I really must be going soon. Do you have anything concrete to tell me, or shall I simply continue to endure this interrogation?
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, this isn't an interrogation. It’s a medical assessment. A history of fatigue, decreased appetite, joint pain and a change in skin pigmentation warrants investigation. Given your age and medical history, we need to consider several possibilities. Before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you'll allow me. It will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and examining your skin more closely. It’s a standard procedure.
PATIENT: A physical exam? Really, Doctor? Must we? I assure you, I'm perfectly fine. It’s just… the sun. And old age. But if you insist. Just… please be quick about it. I have important matters to attend to, and this is taking up far too much of my valuable time. Though I must warn you, I am not particularly fond of being poked and prodded. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated – 145/90. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly distant. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a bit shallow. Now, let's take a look at your skin. The discoloration is quite pronounced, and the skin feels slightly rough. No obvious lesions or growths. I'll need to check your lymph nodes as well. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly tender. This is… concerning.
PATIENT: "Concerning?" Concerning how? You're starting to worry me, Doctor. I told you, it's just the sun! And old age! What could possibly be "concerning" about that? I don't appreciate you making me feel like… like something is seriously wrong. This is entirely unnecessary. Perhaps I should have stayed home. My wife is going to be furious if I come back with bad news, and all for nothing. Is there anything definitive you can tell me, or are we simply speculating? I want answers, Doctor, not vague pronouncements of "concern."
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration. However, dismissing these findings solely as "sun and old age" would be irresponsible. The slightly enlarged lymph nodes, coupled with the changes in your skin and your reported fatigue and decreased appetite, are reasons for further investigation. It could be benign, but it also could indicate something more serious, such as an underlying infection or… a hematological malignancy. I'm not saying you have cancer, but we need to rule it out. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a referral to a hematologist for further evaluation. We also need to discuss a possible skin biopsy to determine the exact cause of the pigmentation. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Cancer? You're suggesting I have… cancer? Goodness gracious. This is outrageous! I refuse to believe it. I feel perfectly fine, aside from a bit of fatigue, which, as I’ve repeatedly stated, is to be expected at my age! A biopsy? You want to cut into my skin? This is preposterous! My wife… my wife will be beside herself! I… I need to think about this. I need to consult with my family. This is too much. Too much! I… I think I’ll just go home now. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I must say, you've caused me a great deal of unnecessary distress. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand you're upset. I'm not trying to alarm you, but I have a professional obligation to investigate these findings thoroughly. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Early detection is crucial in many cases. Here is a referral to a hematologist, and some information on the recommended blood tests. Please contact their office to schedule an appointment at your convenience. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or persistent fatigue – please seek immediate medical attention. I wish you all the best, Mr. Drahota. .
