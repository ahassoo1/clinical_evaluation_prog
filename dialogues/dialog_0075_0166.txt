DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Panjoj. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. I've been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it's been… persistent enough that I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little odd in my right as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, persistent numbness… that's good you came in to get it checked. Let's try to pinpoint this a bit more. When did you first notice the numbness, Tarin?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. It began, I believe, sometime in late May. I was working on a particularly involved animation project – a lot of time sitting, hunched over a computer – and I initially dismissed it as just… discomfort from the position. But it hasn't gone away with changes in posture, unfortunately. It’s been quite consistent since then, just varying in intensity.
DOCTOR: Alright, late May, associated with prolonged sitting… good detail. And you said it’s in your left leg mostly, but sometimes you feel it in your right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. The left leg is where it’s most noticeable, usually starting in the thigh and sometimes extending down to the foot. The right leg is… more of a fleeting sensation, like a pins-and-needles feeling that comes and goes. It's not as strong or consistent as the left. Is there a specific reason you ask about both legs? I want to be sure I’m giving you all the information you need.
DOCTOR: That's excellent of you to be so thorough, Tarin. Asking about both legs helps me understand if this is something localized, or potentially affecting a broader area. Now, can you describe the numbness in your left leg more precisely?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t a complete loss of sensation, if that makes sense. It’s more like… a dulling. A reduced ability to feel things, particularly temperature. I can still feel pressure, but it's… muted. And sometimes, as I mentioned, there’s a tingling sensation alongside it. It's not painful, precisely, but it's definitely uncomfortable. I've noticed it’s worse after I've been sitting for extended periods, as you might expect.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dulling sensation, reduced temperature sensitivity, tingling, worse with sitting. That paints a clearer picture. Do you notice anything that improves the numbness?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Movement helps, definitely. Walking around, stretching… anything that gets the blood flowing seems to lessen it temporarily. Standing also provides some relief, although prolonged standing isn't ideal either. Lying down doesn’t seem to make it significantly worse or better. It’s just… a temporary reprieve, really. It always returns once I resume sitting.
DOCTOR: Alright, movement and standing temporarily improve it. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, then I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you had any recent injuries to your back, hip, or leg?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. No recent injuries, no. I haven’t had any falls or accidents that I can recall. I'm fairly careful, and I don't participate in any high-impact activities. I did help a friend move some furniture a couple of months ago – it was fairly heavy lifting, but nothing overly strenuous, and I didn't feel any immediate pain or discomfort at the time. But thinking about it now… maybe that’s when it initially started, a very mild version of this feeling? It’s hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible connection to lifting a couple of months ago. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – diabetes, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I’ve been generally healthy my entire life, thankfully. No diagnosed medical conditions. I do have a family history of… high blood pressure on my mother’s side, but I’ve always maintained a healthy lifestyle and have regular check-ups. My doctor always says my vitals are excellent. I do take a daily multivitamin, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No medical conditions, family history of high blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I haven't had any adverse reactions to any medications in the past. I'm not particularly sensitive to anything, as far as I know. I’ve eaten all sorts of things without issue and have never had a skin reaction to anything. I should mention, though, I am not currently taking any prescription medications. Just the multivitamin, as I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications besides a multivitamin. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I occasionally – very occasionally – drink a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month. And I do not use any recreational drugs. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good film or working on my animation projects. I find those quite… stimulating enough, thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, Tarin, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Dr. Panjoj. Please proceed. I'll do my best to remain still and follow your instructions. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I should be aware of. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your back on the table, please. We'll start with your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It shouldn’t hurt, but let me know if it's uncomfortable. Now, let’s start with your right leg. Okay, good response. Now, let's move to your left leg. Hmm… slightly diminished response on the left compared to the right. Now, I'm going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m ready. Is that sufficient? I can try to squeeze harder if necessary. I do spend a lot of time using a stylus, so my hand strength is fairly good.
DOCTOR: That's good strength in both hands. Now, I'm going to check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Just tell me when you feel it. Please say "yes" when you feel the touch, and "no" if you don't. We'll start with your right leg. Okay… and now your left leg. Okay, I'm noting some reduced sensation in your left leg compared to your right, particularly in your thigh and lower calf. This correlates with what you’ve been describing. I will also palpate your spine to check for tenderness. No tenderness noted. Now, please sit up. I'm going to check your range of motion in your hips and knees. Range of motion is good in both hips and knees.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm noting all of that. The reduced sensation on the left leg does seem to match my experience. I don't feel any sharp pain during those movements, just… the usual mild discomfort from being sedentary for long periods. I do find myself stiffening up after a long day of work, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, thank you for that. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some nerve compression, likely related to prolonged sitting and possibly aggravated by the lifting you did a couple of months ago. It’s difficult to say for certain without further testing, but the reduced sensation and diminished reflex on your left leg are suggestive of this. The lack of sharp pain is reassuring, and the normal range of motion is also a positive sign. I'd like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of the nerves and discs in your lower back. It will help us rule out any serious underlying issues, such as a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds reasonable, Dr. Panjoj. Yes, that would be alright with me. I would certainly prefer to have a clearer understanding of what’s going on, and rule out anything more serious. What is the process for scheduling that? And are there any specific things I should do to prepare for it? I don't believe I have any metal implants, but I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll go ahead and write the order for the MRI now. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. They'll likely ask about any metal implants, pacemakers, or other medical devices you may have. It's important to be truthful, as these can be contraindications for the MRI. You should also inform them if you're pregnant. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting, prolonged sitting, and activities that aggravate your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. I’m also going to prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help relieve some of the muscle tension in your back. And I’d like you to start gentle stretching exercises, focusing on your hamstrings and lower back. I'll print out a handout with some recommended exercises. We’ll review the MRI results together once they’re available, and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Dr. Panjoj. Avoiding lifting and prolonged sitting is manageable, and I appreciate the recommendations for pain relief and stretching. I will be sure to follow those guidelines carefully. And I’ll be diligent about informing the radiology department of my medical history. Thank you for taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. It’s reassuring to have a plan in place. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any questions you have for me before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. One last thing – if you experience any new symptoms, such as weakness in your legs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. As for questions, no, I think we've covered everything for now. Just focus on following the guidelines I've given you, and we’ll see what the MRI reveals. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once the results are back. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Panjoj, I believe that covers everything. You've been very thorough and helpful, and I appreciate your clear explanations. I feel much more at ease knowing we have a plan in place. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I’ll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I receive the results.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day.
