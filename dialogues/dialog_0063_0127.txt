DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mr. Schaust, you’re 25 years of age, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, I prefer Gedalya, if you don't mind. It's… a bit formal just Mr. Schaust.
DOCTOR: Very well, Gedalya. Though, I find a degree of formality is… preferable in a medical setting. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…difficult to explain exactly. I’ve just been getting weaker, you see. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping. It started a few months ago, maybe? I didn’t think much of it at first, just assumed I was tired, but it’s getting worse. It’s… worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Weakness and… drooping eyelids. “A few months ago,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Perhaps around… April? It was after a particularly stressful period at work. We had a really big project, lots of long hours. I thought it was just exhaustion then. But even after things calmed down, it didn’t go away. It's… gradual, you understand? Not sudden. Just… slowly getting worse each week, I think. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it began.
DOCTOR: April. Stressful period at work. Alright. And this weakness… where are you experiencing it, precisely?
PATIENT: It started in my arms, I think. Just feeling… tired, like I couldn't lift things as easily. Now it's… everywhere, really. My legs feel it too, especially at the end of the day. And my face… it’s not just the eyelids, it’s harder to smile, harder to… well, make expressions, I suppose. It feels… heavy, all over. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: "All over," you say. Is there any pain associated with this weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. More… fatigue. Like my muscles are just… used up, even when I haven't done much. It’s a strange feeling. It’s not a burning pain or anything like that. Just… heavy and tired. And… sometimes a little shaky, especially my hands. But no actual pain, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any difficulty with your vision?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I hadn't really thought about it, to be honest. Now that you mention it… perhaps a little blurry sometimes? But I wear glasses, so I assumed it was just my prescription needing adjusting. It’s nothing dramatic, though. Just… a bit fuzzier than usual, maybe? I haven't been to the optician recently, so it could be that.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, potentially related to your glasses. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, no, not really. Everything seems… normal there, if you don't mind me saying so. I haven't noticed anything different. I apologize, that's a bit of a personal question, isn't it? I'm not quite sure what that has to do with… the weakness.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Mr. Schaust – Gedalya. We must consider all possibilities. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I haven’t needed to take anything regularly, thankfully. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, for headaches. But nothing prescribed by a doctor. I generally try to avoid medication if I can. I'm not allergic to anything that I'm aware of, either.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother has… arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had high blood pressure, later in life. Nothing… major, as far as I know. No neurological conditions, no muscle diseases… at least, not that anyone spoke about. I'm not very close to my extended family, so I don't have much information, to be honest. I could ask my mother, perhaps? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is… always prudent to be thorough. Now, let’s move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke at all. I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I don’t drink heavily. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I lead a… fairly quiet life, really. I prefer a good book to… well, anything like that. I apologize if that sounds… boring. I just try to stay healthy. Which is why all of this is so concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: Very well. I believe we have covered the essential… preliminaries. Now, if you will excuse me, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, yes, of course. Whatever you need. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I’m not usually good with… examinations.
DOCTOR: It will be a standard neurological assessment. Nothing… overly invasive. Just a few simple tests. Please lie flat. We’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if I need to do anything specific. I’m… a bit nervous, if you don’t mind me saying so. I've never really been to a doctor for something like this before.
DOCTOR: Close your eyes. Now, relax your arms completely. I will tap on your tendons. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but should not be painful.
PATIENT: Ouch! That was… a bit startling, actually. Is that… normal? I didn’t expect it to be so… sharp.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished. And the other side?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that was… also quite startling. It feels a bit weaker on this side, I think? I don’t know if that’s just me imagining things, but it didn’t feel as… strong of a reaction. Is something wrong? This is… worrying me quite a bit now.
DOCTOR: Biceps reflex, please. Relax your arm. Hmm. And now the triceps. Extend your arm.
PATIENT: Yes… that feels… odd. It doesn’t feel like anything is hurting, exactly, but it’s… faint. Very faint. It’s almost like nothing is happening when you tap. Is that… good? Bad? I’m really not sure what to expect. I’m feeling a bit lightheaded now, if I’m honest. Perhaps it’s just the nerves.
DOCTOR: Pulse is… normal. Now, let’s assess your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Is that… enough? I’m trying, but it doesn’t feel very strong. It feels like… my hands just don’t have the power they used to. It's… frustrating. I used to be quite strong, I thought. And now… this.
DOCTOR: Now, push your heel down into the table. Resist my force. And now the other leg. Hmm. Well, Mr. Schaust… Gedalya, the preliminary examination suggests some degree of generalized weakness and diminished reflexes. I suspect further investigation is required. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an electromyography study.
PATIENT: Electromyography? What… what is that? And what does all of this mean? Is it… serious? I’m getting quite frightened now. I just want to know what’s wrong, and what we can do about it. Is it… something I did? Something I can fix?
DOCTOR: Electromyography, or EMG, is a test to assess the electrical activity of your muscles. It will help determine the cause of your weakness. As for what it means... it's too early to say definitively. It could be a number of things, Mr. Schaust – Gedalya. Various possibilities. As for "something you did," it's often not attributable to any specific action. I will schedule you for the tests immediately. The lab will contact you directly to arrange an appointment. Until then, try to rest. And avoid any strenuous activity. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Rest? But… what if it’s something serious? What if it gets worse while I’m resting? And… what kind of possibilities are we talking about? You said various… are we talking about something… debilitating? I’m really starting to feel quite unwell now, just thinking about it. Is there anything at all you can tell me, even a little bit, to put my mind at ease? Or is that… not possible?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schaust – Gedalya, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot provide a diagnosis without the results of the tests. Speculating would be irresponsible and unhelpful. It could be a vitamin deficiency, it could be a neurological issue, it could be a number of things. I have ordered the appropriate investigations. Until we have those results, there is nothing more I can say. Worrying will not change the outcome. I suggest you focus on getting some rest and try to remain calm. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. The lab will contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule your appointments. .
PATIENT: …Alright. I… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… try to remain calm. .
