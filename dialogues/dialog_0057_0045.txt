DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s my face. It gets… red. Like, flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, but when it does, it’s… warm. And people look. It makes me a little shy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your face gets red and flushed, and it happens intermittently. And it makes you feel self-conscious. Can you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Not after exercise, I don't think. Not when I’m… upset. Sometimes when I eat something spicy? But not always spicy. Yesterday it happened… I was talking to the cashier at the store. Just normal talking. Nothing special. Before that… maybe a week ago when I was remembering something sad? It’s… random. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be consistently linked to exertion, strong emotions, or spicy food. It happened yesterday while talking to a cashier, and about a week ago when you were recalling a sad memory. Do you notice anything else happening when your face flushes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… sometimes my heart beats a little faster? Not like… racing, just… aware of it. And maybe… a little bit sweaty? Just on my face, not all over. And sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Just for a second. Not falling down dizzy, just… whooshy. It doesn’t happen every time, though. Only sometimes. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the redness, warmth, and flushing, you sometimes experience a faster heartbeat, facial sweating, and a brief sensation of dizziness. It sounds like these symptoms don’t happen with every episode. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like high blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I know of. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. My wife… she always took care of that. She passed away two years ago. I haven't really… bothered with it since. Sorry. I should, I know. Just… hard to keep track of things. I don’t take any medicine, either. Just vitamins. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. That’s perfectly alright. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s understandable that other things may have taken a backseat. We’ll take things slowly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Just… the usual childhood things. Chickenpox. Measles. But nothing serious. No operations. No hospital stays. I eat okay. I try to. Not much sugar, you know? My wife… she was always telling me to eat more vegetables.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Withycombe. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar issues with flushing or any conditions like high blood pressure, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My family… they’re all back in India. We don’t talk very much anymore. I haven’t seen them in… many years. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. But not heart problems. And I don’t know about thyroid. Nobody ever talked about it. My father… he was healthy. Very strong. But… he died young. From a fever, I think. It was a long time ago. I don’t really know much about their health, sorry. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's alright that you don't have a lot of information about your family's medical history. We'll proceed with what we do know. Just a few more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a cigarette in my life. My wife… she didn’t like smoking. I drink… sometimes a small glass of wine with dinner. Just red wine. Maybe two or three times a week. And no, no drugs. Never touched them. I don’t even like coffee, can you believe it? Just tea. Green tea. For my health. That's all.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Withycombe. So, just occasional red wine, green tea, and no smoking or recreational drug use. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insect stings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing that I know of. I can eat anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I've been stung by a bee once, when I was a boy, but I just put some mud on it. Worked fine! No, no allergies. I’m very lucky, I think. Maybe too lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good to know, Mr. Withycombe. No known allergies. Alright, well, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I trust you. I haven’t been checked in… a long time. It’s probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. I do notice some slight redness on your cheeks, but that’s likely related to what you’ve been describing. Everything sounds and looks alright so far. Given your symptoms and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to be on the safe side. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. We’ll check your thyroid levels, blood sugar, and a complete blood count. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes, please. Blood tests are good. My wife… she always said blood tests tell you everything. I trust your judgment. What do I need to do? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It’s a very good point that blood tests can tell us a lot. It won't hurt much, Mr. Withycombe. A nurse will take a small sample of blood from your arm, a quick pinch, and then apply a bandage. You might feel a little discomfort, but it shouldn't last long. I’ll write the order for the lab now. The nurse will call you when your results are back, which usually takes a few days. In the meantime, I’d like you to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. If you are able to do that, write down the readings and bring them to your follow-up appointment. Also, I’d recommend limiting your alcohol intake to one drink per day and continuing with a healthy diet. We’ll discuss the results of the blood tests at your follow-up appointment and determine the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very good. I can buy a machine for my blood pressure. And I will try to drink less wine. And eat more vegetables. Like my wife always said. When is the follow-up appointment? And… is it serious? The flushing, I mean. Is it something bad?
DOCTOR: Let's schedule the follow-up appointment for two weeks from today, August 16th at 10:00 AM. That will give the lab enough time to process the results. As for your question about the flushing, it's difficult to say definitively without the blood test results. There are many possible causes, most of which are not serious. It could be related to something as simple as a sensitivity to certain foods or beverages, or it could be a symptom of an underlying medical condition, such as rosacea or a thyroid problem. It's also possible it could be related to your blood pressure. We're doing the blood tests to rule out any serious causes and get a clearer understanding of what’s going on. I don’t want you to worry unnecessarily. We’re taking all the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you not… making me feel silly about it. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? My face gets red. It’s not very dignified. Thank you. Very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It’s completely understandable to feel self-conscious about it, but please don’t feel embarrassed. You’re doing the right thing by seeking medical attention, and we’ll figure this out together. It was a pleasure meeting you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, Mr. Withycombe.
