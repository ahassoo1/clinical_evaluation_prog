DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly, I haven't the time for this, but my assistant insisted. It’s… my vision, and my hearing. They’ve both been quite… troublesome lately. It came on so suddenly, you wouldn't believe it. Frankly, it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sudden changes are concerning. We'll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. To start, can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed these changes in your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't recall the precise date. It was… sometime last week, I suppose. It’s all a blur. Everything just seemed… dimmer, and sounds became muffled. I haven't been sleeping well, if that’s relevant. A very busy schedule, you understand. Important work. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began, really. It just was.
DOCTOR: Okay, sometime last week. And you’ve noticed both vision and hearing being affected simultaneously?
PATIENT: Well, yes, of course! That’s what I said, isn’t it? Both. Dimmer vision, muffled sounds. It’s not terribly complicated. Really, I wish this could be quicker. I have a very important surgery scheduled this afternoon. A young boy… very delicate case.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Julie. We will be as efficient as possible. Let’s try to quantify these changes. With your vision, would you say it’s affecting your ability to perform your usual activities?
PATIENT: Quantify? My dear, I am a surgeon. I perform delicate procedures! Naturally, it’s affecting my work. I can barely make out the instruments clearly. It’s… disconcerting, to say the least. I haven't needed glasses in years, and now… well, it's just a nuisance. A great inconvenience, really. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Yes, we are. And I appreciate you clarifying. It sounds like this is a recent and noticeable change impacting your professional life. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, I haven’t been paying much attention to… trivial things. I’ve been rather preoccupied. Perhaps a slight headache, but I get those frequently. Stress, you know. Long hours. And, now that you mention it, perhaps a bit of dizziness. But I assumed it was low blood sugar. I skip meals sometimes, terribly busy as I am. Is that helpful? Really, I hope we can move this along.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. The dizziness – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Not terribly often. Mostly when I stand up too quickly, I suppose. A bit… off-balance. Nothing significant. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable. It’s just… annoying. This whole situation is quite annoying, frankly. Are we closer to finding a solution? I really must get back to the hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic neurological assessment – checking your balance, reflexes, and a few other things. It shouldn’t take long. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? At my age? Honestly. Very well. But please be quick about it. I haven’t the patience for prolonged examinations. And I trust you’ve thoroughly sterilized everything? I’ve heard… stories. Let’s just get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. Everything is thoroughly sterilized. We'll be as efficient as possible. Please follow my gaze as I check your pupils. Could you tell me if you are noticing any changes in your peripheral vision?
PATIENT: Peripheral vision? Honestly, I hadn’t even considered it. No, I suppose not. Everything seems… blurry overall. It’s difficult to distinguish details, much less peripheral details. I simply can’t waste time focusing on such minutiae. Hurry up, please. I have a very important patient waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you could follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. Do you see my finger clearly the entire time?
PATIENT: Yes, I see it. It’s… blurry, as I’ve already explained repeatedly. It’s difficult to focus, you understand. Long hours, demanding work... It strains the eyes. Honestly, this is rather tedious. Are we finished yet? This is a complete waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just one more quick step. Could you smile for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Really, I fail to see the purpose of all this… probing. It’s quite undignified. Can we please discuss potential solutions? Perhaps a new pair of glasses? A stronger prescription? I haven't the time for exhaustive testing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you wouldn't mind standing with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes for about 30 seconds. Just try to maintain your balance.
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. This is… ridiculous. I haven't done anything like this since… well, I don't recall. It’s terribly undignified, honestly. This is a waste of time. I feel… slightly unsteady. Is this necessary? I have a surgery scheduled in less than two hours. Hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Please sit down, Ms. Julie. You’ve demonstrated some instability with that test, and I’m concerned about a potential balance issue. Given the sudden onset of your symptoms, and this finding, I’m going to recommend further evaluation. We need to rule out some more serious possibilities.
PATIENT: Serious possibilities? What… what are you implying? I am a perfectly healthy woman! I’ve simply been… overworked. Perhaps a bit of stress. A good night's sleep, and I'll be fine. You're not suggesting… something is wrong with me, are you? This is preposterous. I demand a second opinion. And I absolutely refuse any unnecessary testing. I have a reputation to maintain. Hurry up, please. Tell me what kind of glasses I need.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your concerns, and I respect your wishes. However, given the sudden onset of both vision and hearing changes, coupled with the instability we just observed, proceeding without further investigation would be irresponsible. I am not suggesting you have anything serious, but we need to rule out neurological causes, such as a stroke or transient ischemic attack, which can present with these symptoms. I strongly recommend a stat CT scan of your head, and a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. I can also arrange for an audiometry test to assess your hearing. We can discuss the possibility of glasses after we have a clearer understanding of the underlying cause. Would you be willing to consider these tests?
PATIENT: A… a scan? A neurologist? Are you suggesting I’m… incapacitated? This is outrageous! I am a highly respected surgeon, capable of performing intricate procedures. I do not need to be subjected to… invasive testing. Absolutely not. A simple pair of glasses is all I require. And I expect you to write the prescription immediately. I refuse any further examination or… unnecessary procedures. I will consult with my own physician, thank you very much. And I expect a full apology for this… insult. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a patient waiting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. However, I must document my concerns regarding the potential for a serious neurological condition, given the sudden onset of your symptoms and the instability observed during the examination. I will provide you with a referral to your own physician, as requested. I will also provide you with a detailed summary of our consultation, outlining my findings and recommendations. Please, be careful on your way out, and if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as new weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for your time.
