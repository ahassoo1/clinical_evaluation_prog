DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Limtiaco, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ronnald Limtiaco. Though, honestly, sometimes I… well, it all gets a bit fuzzy these days. I’m here about some papers, I think? My wife said something about needing them for… leave? For work, maybe? I manage things at the church, you see. Religious stuff and teaching. It’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: Papers?
PATIENT: Yes, papers. Something about time off? Or maybe help with… well, I’m not entirely sure. My wife, bless her heart, handles most of the details. I think it has to do with needing some time away from the church work. It's been a bit much lately, and I'm feeling… run down. I just need whatever forms are necessary, if that makes sense. I’m not good with all the official stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're feeling… fatigued. And your wife scheduled this appointment to obtain paperwork for leave from your church duties. Is that a correct summary, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. “Fatigued” is a good word for it. Yes, very tired. And the paperwork… yes, that’s it. Something for time off, or maybe… if I can’t work for a while. I don’t know the difference, to be honest. Is it FMLA? My wife mentioned something like that. It all blurs together, you see.
DOCTOR: FMLA. Yes, well, that’s a complicated process. Before we get into that, let’s establish why you're feeling this fatigue. It’s not simply… a matter of being busy. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Well, I’ve been a little… forgetful lately, even more than usual, if that’s possible. And sometimes I feel a bit… dizzy. Not often, but it happens. Mostly just tired, though. And the forgetfulness. My wife keeps reminding me of things, which is good. She’s very patient. Is dizziness a symptom? I don't know what counts as a symptom!
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and dizziness. Right. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. I’d say… a few months, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint. It came on gradually, you see. Not suddenly. The forgetfulness is definitely worse lately, though. And the dizziness… probably around the same time. A few months. Yes, that sounds right. My wife will probably have a more accurate timeline, to be honest. She remembers everything!
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam to rule out any obvious causes. Your heart rate is… regular, though slightly elevated. Breathing is… normal. Pupils are responsive. Any recent changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I wear glasses, you see, so things are always a little… blurry. But no change in the blurriness, if that makes sense. Everything looks the same as it always has. A little fuzzy, but… normal fuzzy. I haven't needed a new prescription recently, so I assumed it was fine. Is that helpful? I'm not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really. A little ache in my back sometimes, from working in the garden at the church. But that's just old age, I think. Nothing serious. No sharp pains, no headaches… just a general feeling of being… worn out. And a bit forgetful. Is the forgetfulness a symptom, too? I keep asking, I know, but it’s the most bothersome thing, really.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness can be a symptom of many things, Mr. Limtiaco. It's rarely the sole indicator of anything significant, of course. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Pre-existing conditions… Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control with medication. And I had my appendix out when I was young. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. My wife would know better, she keeps all the records. She’s very organized. I take the blood pressure medication regularly, though. That’s the only thing I can think of.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication. What is the name of the medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I just take the little pills every morning. They’re… white, I think? Small, round pills. I get them refilled regularly from the pharmacy, but I don’t pay much attention to the name. My wife handles all of that. I really wish she were here. She'd know all the details. I'm terribly sorry, I'm not very helpful with these things. Is there a number on the bottle? I can try to remember… maybe.
DOCTOR: Mr. Limtiaco, with all due respect, it is critical to know what medications you are taking. It is simply irresponsible to not know this information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you’re right, you’re absolutely right. I should know. No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always checks, of course, before I start anything new. She's very careful. I’ve never had a reaction to anything… as far as I remember. But the medication name… I’m just drawing a blank. Truly. I'm so sorry for the trouble. Perhaps we can call the pharmacy? Would that be alright? My wife usually handles all of that, you see. It's just… a lot to keep track of.
DOCTOR: We will need to obtain your medical records from your primary care physician. This will take time. Until then, I suggest you refrain from any strenuous activity and, frankly, avoid making any important decisions. Your cognitive state is… concerning, and I'd prefer not to compound the issue. Do you have any family history of dementia or Alzheimer's disease?
PATIENT: Dementia or Alzheimer's… Oh dear. That's… a frightening question. Let me think. My mother… she did get quite forgetful towards the end. Very forgetful. She didn’t know who people were sometimes. But I don’t know if it was… that. My wife would know. She always kept track of those things. I… I don’t want to think about that. Is that a concern? I just want to feel better, you see. And get back to work at the church. But if it runs in the family… Oh dear. This is… worrying.
DOCTOR: Right. I am going to order a comprehensive blood panel and a referral to a neurologist for a cognitive assessment. This is necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out any serious underlying conditions. Do not drive yourself home, Mr. Limtiaco. I recommend you have someone accompany you. I will have the nurse prepare the paperwork for the blood tests and the neurology referral. .
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. A neurologist? Is it… is it serious? I just thought I was a little tired. And forgetful. Okay. A neurologist. And I shouldn't drive? Yes, yes, I understand. My wife… I'll call my wife. She'll know what to do. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you. I'll… I'll wait for the nurse. And I'll call my wife. .
