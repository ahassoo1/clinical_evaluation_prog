DOCTOR: Good morning, Raymonde. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness… well, I’ve been feeling… not quite right. Mostly, it’s my stomach. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don’t eat much. And I feel full so quickly, even after just a few bites. It’s been going on for a bit now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long… time just slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Time does seem to fly. So, it’s primarily nausea and feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food. And you said this has been going on for “a bit.” Could you try to give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… let me think. It feels like… maybe since the spring? Or was it earlier? My husband, bless his soul, he passed last year… things have been a bit blurry since then. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more precise. It just... feels like a while now. A couple of months, maybe? Longer? I really don't know for sure. It comes and goes, you see. Some days it’s worse than others.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. Losing your husband is a huge loss, and it’s completely understandable that things feel a bit unclear right now. We can work with “a couple of months.” And when you say it comes and goes, can you tell me what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, now… that’s a good question. I don’t know if anything makes it better, exactly. Sometimes it just… eases up on its own. But… I think maybe when I’m busy with the animals, it’s not so bad. Distraction, I suppose. When I’m just sitting around… that’s when it seems to bother me the most. And… oh, certain foods. Anything greasy… definitely doesn’t help. But even things that should be okay sometimes make me feel sick. It's very unpredictable. I used to have such a good appetite! It’s just… not the same anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so activity seems to help a bit, and greasy foods definitely make it worse, but even other foods can sometimes trigger it. The unpredictability is good to know. Now, besides the nausea and feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been… a little tired, I suppose. But at my age, who isn't? And… sometimes my stomach just… hurts. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. And… oh, goodness, now I'm trying to remember… I seem to be losing weight, but I haven't really been trying to. It just… seems like my clothes are a bit looser. That’s all I can think of right now, Doctor. My mind isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. You’re doing wonderfully. Fatigue, a dull stomach ache, and unintentional weight loss… those are all important things to know. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe… forty years? And I had pneumonia once, a bad bout of it. But other than that… I haven't been to the doctor much. I always tried to stay healthy. I always figured a good strong constitution would take care of me! I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting older, of course, but nothing… major, I don’t think. My husband took care of most of the doctor’s visits when we were together. He liked to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about forty years ago and a bout of pneumonia. That’s helpful to know. And were you hospitalized for either of those?
PATIENT: Oh yes, for the pneumonia. I was very sick, couldn't breathe at all. I was in the hospital for… oh, goodness, I don't remember exactly how long. A week, maybe? It was a long time ago. The gallbladder… no, I don't think I was hospitalized for that. I think it was outpatient. It didn’t feel that serious at the time. Though I remember being quite sore afterwards! It's all so fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: Okay, hospitalized for the pneumonia, outpatient for the gallbladder removal. Now, have you had any surgeries other than those, or any serious illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, falling out of a tree. It healed up fine, though. And… I think that's it. Nothing else that I can remember, Doctor. I was always very careful, you see. Spent most of my time outdoors, working with animals. Not much call for surgery out there! I’ve been lucky, I think. Mostly just the usual bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken wrist as a child. Now, regarding your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had something with his heart, but I don't remember exactly what. He passed away when I was young, you see. And I didn't pay much attention to medical things, to be honest. My husband's family… I don't really know. We didn’t see them very often. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. My family history isn’t something I’ve ever kept track of. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Raymonde. It’s common for family medical history to be unclear. High blood pressure in your mother is helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor took me off it a few years ago. Said it wasn’t helping much, and it upset my stomach. Now… I take a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, when my joints are particularly sore, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothing regular, really. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen when needed. I don't like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin daily and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy either, thankfully. I've always been pretty lucky, I think. I’ve never had to worry about allergies. I wish more people could say the same! No, no allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde. Thank you for that information. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm not very good at remembering things these days, you see. But I'll try my best!
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll explain everything as I go. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 72, and your temperature is 98.6 – all within a normal range for your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Hmm… I'm noticing some tenderness in your upper abdomen, and it feels slightly distended. Is that a new symptom?
PATIENT: Oh… tenderness? Distended? Well… yes, I think so. It has been feeling a bit uncomfortable lately, like something’s… full. Not a sharp pain, just… pressure. And yes, it feels… bigger, I suppose. I hadn't really paid much attention to it, to be honest. I just thought it was… old age. But now that you mention it, it has been getting worse over the last few weeks, I reckon. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’ve noticed it, Raymonde. Tenderness and distension can indicate a number of things, and it's important to investigate further. Your bowel sounds are a bit diminished, which can sometimes be associated with a blockage or reduced intestinal activity. Now, I'm going to check for any fluid accumulation in your abdomen. There appears to be a small amount of fluid present. Based on what I’m finding during the exam, I’m concerned about a possible gastrointestinal issue. We need to do some further testing to determine the exact cause. I'd like to order some blood work and an abdominal CT scan. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and a CT scan? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it something really bad? I've never had a CT scan before. Are they painful? And what will the blood work tell you? I suppose if you think it’s necessary… yes, alright. But I must admit, I’m a little frightened. It just feels like one thing after another lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Raymonde. It's natural to feel frightened when facing uncertainty. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check for signs of infection, and look at your organ function. The CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your abdominal organs, allowing us to identify the cause of your tenderness and distension. The CT scan is painless, although you will need to lie still for a short period of time. You may be given some contrast dye, which some people experience as a warm sensation. It's important to rule out anything serious, and these tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. I’m not going to jump to conclusions yet, Raymonde. There are several possibilities, and we need the test results to determine what's going on. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll order the tests right away, and we can schedule them for as soon as possible. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be very helpful. I get so confused easily, you see. Just… tell me everything slowly, and don’t worry about using big words. I just want to know what to expect. And… what if it is something bad? What are the possible treatments? I know you said not to worry, but it's hard not to, you see. My husband always told me to be prepared, but… preparing for bad news is a difficult thing. Thank you for being so patient with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Raymonde. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious, and I’m here to answer all your questions. Let’s start with the tests. For the blood work, a nurse will take a small sample of blood from your arm. It usually takes just a few minutes, and there's very little discomfort involved. We’ll be checking your complete blood count, electrolyte levels, liver function, and other important markers. For the CT scan, you’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. A technician will be in the room the entire time, and you’ll be able to communicate with them through an intercom. You’ll need to lie very still for about 20-30 minutes while the machine takes images of your abdomen. You may be given some contrast dye, either orally or intravenously, to help enhance the images. Some people experience a warm sensation when the dye is injected, but it’s usually mild and temporary. As for potential treatments, it’s too early to say anything definitively without the test results. However, depending on what we find, treatment options could range from medication to manage symptoms, to minimally invasive procedures, or even surgery. I want to assure you that we’ll explore all possible options and develop a treatment plan that’s tailored to your specific needs. Here's some information about CT scans that you can review. And please, don't hesitate to ask me any questions you have, no matter how small. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be with you every step of the way. For now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Do you have any preferences for when you’d like to have them done?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a little bit better, knowing what to expect. As for when to have them… I suppose as soon as possible would be best. The sooner we know, the sooner we can start dealing with it, you see. I don’t like living with this uncertainty. But… I have a volunteer shift at the animal shelter on Thursday. Would it be possible to schedule them before then? I promised I'd help with the kittens… they need their vaccinations. I don’t want to let them down. It's silly, I know, worrying about kittens when I'm worried about myself… but they depend on me.
DOCTOR: That’s not silly at all, Raymonde. Your kindness and dedication are admirable. We can absolutely work around your volunteer shift. Let me see… We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, and the CT scan for Wednesday afternoon. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Tomorrow morning for the blood work, and Wednesday afternoon for the scan. Thank you so much for being so accommodating. It really does make a difference, knowing that you’re listening and that you’re willing to work with me. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the tests? Anything I should eat or avoid? And… will I need someone to drive me to the scan? I don't drive anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It’s my pleasure. For the blood work, it’s best to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand, so you can have breakfast after the test. Just drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. For the CT scan, you can eat and drink normally, unless I advise you otherwise. However, if you have any kidney problems, please let me know. Regarding transportation, yes, you will need someone to drive you to the scan, as you’ll be given a contrast dye that might make you feel a little drowsy. It’s best to have someone stay with you for a few hours afterwards as well. I’ll have the nurse call you tonight to confirm the appointment times and answer any other questions you might have. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if anything comes up before then. We’ll get through this together, Raymonde. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been so kind and patient with me, and I really appreciate it. Knowing what to expect makes me feel so much better. Thank you again, for everything. I suppose I should get going, then. I need to make arrangements for someone to drive me to the scan, and I don’t want to keep them waiting. Thank you again, Doctor Bombara. I truly appreciate your help. Goodbye, and thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. It was my pleasure to meet you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you tomorrow morning.
