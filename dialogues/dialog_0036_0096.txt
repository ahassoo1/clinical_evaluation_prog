DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's... it's a bit strange, honestly. I've been really bothered by the sun lately. It feels like I'm extra sensitive to it. It started a few months ago, and it's just getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Extra sensitive to the sun… that’s good information to start with. When you say “bothered,” can you describe what happens when you’re exposed to the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s not a sunburn, exactly. More like… my eyes really hurt, and I get a headache almost right away. And my skin feels… itchy, and really warm, even if I haven’t been out for very long. It’s mostly on my face and neck. It's just uncomfortable, and it makes me want to stay inside all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so eye pain, headache fairly quickly upon exposure, and itchy, warm skin on your face and neck. And this has been happening for a few months, progressively worsening. Do you notice any changes to your skin itself – like a rash, blistering, or any unusual bumps?
PATIENT: No, no rash or blisters. It doesn’t look different, just… feels really uncomfortable. It's hard to explain. It’s not like a normal sunburn feel. More… prickly? And yeah, it definitely gets worse the longer I'm out. Even on cloudy days, sometimes. That’s what’s worrying me, honestly. It feels… different than it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, “prickly” is a good descriptor. And it happens even on cloudy days… that’s definitely something to note. Let’s talk a little bit more about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any skin conditions before, like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always had pretty good skin, honestly. I mean, a few blemishes when I was a teenager, but nothing serious. I haven’t really had to go to the doctor much at all, to be honest. Just regular check-ups, you know? And… well, after my wife passed, things got a little… complicated. But nothing like this. I've never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It takes a lot of strength to navigate those kinds of challenges. And thank you for sharing that with me. It's good to get a full picture. Okay, so no prior skin conditions, and generally good health otherwise. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. And thankfully, no hospital stays either. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing major. I try to eat pretty well and stay active when I can, but... it’s been hard lately, with everything. Focusing on things like that feels… difficult sometimes. But yeah, generally healthy. I really haven’t had much trouble with my health before this sun thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And it’s perfectly understandable that focusing on health can be challenging during difficult times. Let’s move on to family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any skin conditions, or have they experienced unusual sensitivity to the sun?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mom… she did have some freckles, lots of them. And she always wore a hat when she was outside. I don’t remember her specifically saying she was sensitive to the sun, but she was always careful. My dad… he didn't have any skin problems that I know of. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away a long time ago. So, probably just my mom being careful with the sun. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. History of sun protection is relevant. And it's okay that you don't have a lot of information about your grandparents' health. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I take a multivitamin, just a basic one. And sometimes, if I get a really bad headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I don’t really like the idea of putting a lot of things into my body if I don’t need to. And I haven't changed anything recently, so it's just the same as always. Just the multivitamin and the ibuprofen when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And no recent changes to your medications. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any trouble with any medications. I've been pretty lucky that way, I guess. So, no allergies to report. Just… this sun thing. It’s the only thing that’s bothering me right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No allergies, just this increasing sun sensitivity. Okay, Arbin, I’m looking at your record here, and it confirms what you’ve told me – no significant past medical history, no surgeries, no allergies. It looks like you haven’t been seen in our clinic for a few years, other than a routine check-up in 2022. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll just take a look at your skin, particularly on your face and neck, and check your eyes. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Absolutely. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on and hopefully get some relief. My skin is probably fine, but I trust your judgment. Let's take a look.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m looking at your skin now. The skin appears… normal in color and texture. No visible rash, blistering, or unusual bumps, as you mentioned. I'm not seeing any signs of immediate inflammation. There's no tenderness to the touch, and no noticeable swelling. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. The conjunctiva appears clear, and I don’t see any signs of inflammation or lesions. However, your eyes do seem slightly sensitive to the bright light of the instrument. The sclera is clear. Alright, Arbin. Everything appears physically normal at the moment. The sensitivity to light is a little concerning, given your symptoms, but there are no immediately obvious physical findings to explain what's going on. Given your description – the increasing sensitivity to the sun, the headache and itchy skin, even on cloudy days – and the fact that your physical exam is normal, I’m considering a few possibilities. One is photosensitivity, which can be caused by certain medications, though you're not taking anything that's typically associated with that. Another possibility is a condition called polymorphic light eruption, which is a common skin reaction to sunlight. It can cause itchy skin, redness, and headache, and it often improves with sun protection. There’s also the possibility of something neurological. To help me narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel will give me a general overview of your health, and we can also check your vitamin D levels. We can also consider allergy testing, and I might recommend a consultation with a dermatologist for a more thorough evaluation of your skin. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. That’s good. I just want to figure out what’s happening, so whatever you think is best. Blood work and seeing a dermatologist… I'm happy to do that. I don’t mind the tests, and getting another opinion sounds smart. I just... I haven't felt like myself lately, and it's worrying me. So, yes, let's do the blood work and see a dermatologist. What do I need to do to get those scheduled?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good that we’re taking a proactive approach. Alright. I’m ordering the CBC and CMP now, and I’ll also add a Vitamin D level check. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, so no food or drinks other than water. I’ll give you a lab requisition form to take with you to the lab, and they’ll schedule the appointment. It's located just down the hall. As for the dermatologist, I’m going to put in a referral for Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s excellent, and she specializes in photosensitivity reactions. Her office will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a week or two to get in, depending on their availability. Here’s the form. The lab is right down the hall, and the receptionist will schedule you. I’ll also send the referral to Dr. Reed's office electronically. In the meantime, it's very important to protect yourself from the sun. Wear a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and protective clothing when you’re outdoors, and apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to all exposed skin. Try to avoid the sun during peak hours – between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Do you have any questions about the tests, the referral, or the sun protection measures?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. Fasting for the blood work, referral to Dr. Reed, and sun protection… I can definitely do that. Sunscreen and a hat, no problem. I just... I'm glad we're getting this checked out. Is there anything else I should be looking out for while I wait for the results? Any symptoms that would mean I should call sooner?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad you feel that way. It’s always best to be proactive. While you’re waiting for the results, please keep an eye out for any new or worsening symptoms. If you experience a high fever, severe headache, blistering skin rash, difficulty breathing, or any changes in your vision, please contact us immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Also, if your symptoms suddenly become much worse, don't hesitate to call. Otherwise, just focus on protecting yourself from the sun, and we’ll get the results back as soon as possible. It usually takes a few days for the lab work to come back. We’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Bacy. You've been very helpful and put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so thoroughly. I'll be sure to follow your instructions and contact you if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arbin. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day. .
