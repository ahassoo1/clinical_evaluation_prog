DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I’ve had this cough... it just won’t go away. It’s been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it feels like it’s getting worse. It’s especially bad when I lie down, makes it hard to breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. A cough that’s been lingering for a few weeks and worsens when lying down certainly warrants investigation. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to start? It’s not a dry cough, you see. It brings up... well, a little bit of phlegm. Sometimes it’s clear, sometimes it’s a little bit... yellow. Not much, though. And it doesn’t hurt, exactly, just feels… tight in my chest. I mostly cough at night, like I said, and when I try to do anything… even just walk to the kitchen. My heart… it’s been a bit weak, you know. The doctor told me years ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful information, Ms. Sadhu, and the history of a weak heart is certainly important. The color of the phlegm and the fact that it's associated with shortness of breath and exertion are things we need to consider. You mentioned it's been a few weeks – roughly, how many weeks would you say?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. It started right after my grandson, Mateo, visited. He came all the way from the city. That was… oh, around the 15th of July, I believe. So, almost three weeks, maybe a little more. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little tickle in my throat. But it’s gotten… well, more persistent, like I said. It just feels… heavier now. And I do get winded easier. I used to walk to the market every day, but now… I have to stop and rest.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And to clarify, is this shortness of breath a new symptom, or has it been ongoing with your heart condition?
PATIENT: Oh, the shortness of breath… well, it’s not new exactly. I’ve always gotten a little breathless when I overdo it. But this feels… different. It’s happening with less and less activity. Before, it was just after climbing the stairs, maybe. Now, it’s just walking across the room. And it feels like it’s… tighter in my chest when I breathe, if that makes sense. It’s a bit scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Sadhu, and it's good you’re sharing these concerns with me. A change in your usual shortness of breath is something we need to investigate. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. Not a chill, not a sweat. I haven’t felt sick, like with the flu or anything. Just tired, mostly. And a little… anxious, because of the coughing. I’ve been sleeping in my recliner, it’s easier to breathe sitting up. But no, no fever, no chills, nothing like that. Just this cough and feeling tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for your heart condition, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I take a few. Let me see… I have my little pill organizer here. There's Furosemide, that’s for the swelling in my feet, the doctor said it helps my heart. Then there’s Lisinopril, for the blood pressure. And a little white one, Hydrochlorothiazide, also for the pressure. I take those every morning. And sometimes, if my arthritis bothers me, I take Ibuprofen, but not every day. I try not to, it’s bad for my stomach. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Sadhu. Thank you for being so thorough. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach! I eat everything… well, almost everything. I do try to avoid shellfish, but that’s just a preference, not an allergy. Never had a problem with any pills or anything like that. No allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, where to start? Well, like I said, I have a weak heart. The doctor diagnosed it… oh, must be 20 years ago now. I had some trouble breathing then, and he said my heart wasn’t pumping as strong as it should. I’ve been seeing a cardiologist off and on ever since. I also had my gallbladder removed when I was younger, and my arthritis has been acting up lately. And I broke my wrist a few years ago, but it healed okay. Is there anything specific you want to know? I get a bit confused remembering everything… it's been a long life!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Sadhu. You’ve given me a good overview. Do you know when your last cardiology appointment was?
PATIENT: Let me think… That’s a good question. It was… oh dear, it must have been last fall, I believe. October, maybe November. Dr. Alvarez, in the city. He did an EKG and an echocardiogram, said my heart was… stable, but getting weaker, naturally. He adjusted my medication a little, told me to watch my salt intake. I try to, but it’s hard! My husband loved his salt, and I got used to it. That was… a long time ago now. He’s been gone five years, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Sadhu. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just to complete the picture, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... well, my mother lived to be 95, strong as an ox! But she had high blood pressure, towards the end. My father… he didn’t live as long, passed away when I was young, heart trouble, they said. And my brother, he had diabetes, and he had a stroke a few years ago. Nothing else much, really. Mostly just… old age. We weren't a family that talked much about our health, if you know what I mean. It was just… something you dealt with.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Not a puff. My husband smoked a little when he was younger, but he quit when we got married. Said he didn’t want to risk my health. I always told him that smoke was just bad news. No, never smoked, never will. I always liked fresh air. I spend a lot of time on my porch, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Sadhu. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not every day, though. Maybe once or twice a week. My husband and I used to enjoy a little glass with our meals. It helps me relax. But I don’t drink much, really. Not enough to worry about, I don't think. Just a little red wine, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your social situation. Do you live alone, or do you have someone who helps you out?
PATIENT: I live alone, yes. My husband passed away five years ago, like I mentioned. It’s quiet sometimes, but I manage. My grandson, Mateo, he comes to visit when he can, helps me with the groceries and things. And Mrs. Rodriguez next door, she’s a dear. She checks on me every day, makes sure I’m okay. But mostly, I manage on my own. I’m pretty independent, you know. I always have been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Sadhu. It sounds like you have a good support system. Alright, before we move on to a physical exam, are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Sometimes my ankles swell up a little, at the end of the day. It’s been happening for a while, but it seems worse lately. And I get a little… dizzy sometimes when I stand up too quickly. It doesn’t last long, just a moment or two. But it’s there. And… oh, yes! I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual. Just… worn out, all the time. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… a general feeling of being unwell. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Sadhu. The swelling in your ankles, the dizziness, and the fatigue are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and examining your ankles and legs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. It’s probably just my old heart acting up, but it’s good to be sure. Just… be gentle, please. I’m a bit fragile, you know. But go ahead, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sadhu. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart. Take a nice, deep breath for me. Okay. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and there's a faint murmur. That's not entirely unexpected given your history, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take deep breaths in and out… Your lungs are clear, but I can hear some mild wheezing on exhale. Next, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 160/90. Now, let’s take a look at your ankles. I see some moderate pitting edema in both ankles. Pressing here, I can feel a clear indentation that remains for a few seconds. And finally, I'll quickly check your temperature and pulse. Your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your pulse is irregular, around 80 beats per minute. Okay, Ms. Sadhu. That concludes the physical exam. I’ve documented my findings.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. The irregular rhythm and the swelling… is that bad? I thought my medication was supposed to keep all that under control. What does it mean, Doctor? Is my heart getting worse?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re concerned, Ms. Sadhu. The changes we’ve observed do warrant further investigation, but it doesn’t necessarily mean your heart is rapidly deteriorating. The irregular rhythm and swelling, along with your symptoms, suggest your current medication regimen may need adjustment. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to assess your overall health and rule out any infection. Second, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Third, an EKG to get a more detailed reading of your heart’s electrical activity. And finally, a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs and heart size. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, please do the tests. I just want to feel better, and know what’s happening. Where will I get these tests done? And how long will it take? I don’t drive anymore, you see, so I’ll need someone to take me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sadhu. The tests can be done at the clinic’s laboratory, which is located right here in the building. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. They should only take about an hour or so, including the chest X-ray. I will write the orders for the tests now. Once the results are back—usually within 24-48 hours—we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have someone who can accompany you tomorrow morning?
PATIENT: Yes, my grandson Mateo can take me. He’s a good boy, always willing to help. He works, but he can take a half-day off. He lives close by, thank goodness. So yes, he can bring me. And… will I need to fast for these tests? I had a small breakfast this morning.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Ms. Sadhu. It’s good that you have Mateo’s support. Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or drinks, except for water. Since you had breakfast this morning, we'll need to reschedule the blood tests for tomorrow afternoon, to allow for the fasting period. Does that work for you and Mateo?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Tomorrow afternoon is perfectly alright. Mateo can adjust his schedule. It’s not a problem. Eight hours, you say? I’ll make sure I don’t eat anything after… hmm, after 8 o’clock tonight, then. Is there anything else I need to do to prepare for the tests? Or anything I should bring?
DOCTOR: No, nothing else specific, Ms. Sadhu. Just the fasting. You don’t need to bring anything. Please wear comfortable clothing for the chest X-ray. I will have the lab schedule the tests for tomorrow afternoon and will give you a slip with the appointment time. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and explaining everything so clearly. I’ll make sure Mateo brings me in tomorrow afternoon, and I’ll remember to fast. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I’ll see you tomorrow afternoon. In the meantime, try to rest and take it easy. And don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Ms. Sadhu.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
