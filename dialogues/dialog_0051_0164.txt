DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I keep getting really sick after I eat fava beans. It started a few months ago, and… well, I get very yellow, and just feel awful. Like really tired and weak. I thought it was just a stomach bug at first, but it keeps happening whenever I have them.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing…and feeling tired and weak after eating fava beans. That's certainly something we should look into. Just to clarify, when you say yellow, are you referring to your skin or the whites of your eyes, or both?
PATIENT: Both, actually. My skin gets a bit yellowish, and definitely the whites of my eyes. It's… noticeable. My friends even commented on it last time. It doesn't happen every time I eat them, but most of the time. And it lasts for a few days, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, both skin and eyes. And it doesn't happen every time, but most of the time. A few days duration, you said. Thank you. Hmm… Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the yellowing and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I get a bit of a stomach ache, but that could just be from the beans themselves, you know? And maybe a little dark pee, but I’m not entirely sure if that’s connected. I drink a lot of water, so I’m always going to the bathroom anyway. It's hard to say. It’s mostly just the yellowing and feeling completely drained. Like I haven’t slept in days.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach ache – possibly related, possibly not. And dark urine. That's good to know. I want to get a full picture here. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat pretty normally, I think. Maybe when I'm feeling sick, I don’t feel like eating much of anything, but that’s just when I’m unwell. Otherwise, my appetite is the same. I enjoy cooking, so I usually eat pretty well. I like to make Romanian dishes, lots of soups and stews. It's hard to enjoy cooking when you feel so tired though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, that you still have a good appetite generally. Romanian dishes sound lovely. Now, let's move onto some other things. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve tried a few different medications over the years for colds and things, but nothing has ever bothered me. And I’m pretty careful with what I eat, especially after this started happening with the fava beans. I check labels and everything.
DOCTOR: <stage>I make a note of that. No known allergies. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. I take one every morning. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Otherwise, no. Just the multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Good. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. That was… unpleasant, but it was successful. And I sometimes have a bit of trouble with anemia, the doctor told me a few years back, but nothing serious enough to require regular treatment. Just… a little low iron sometimes. That's all I can really think of. Oh, and high blood pressure, but it's well controlled with medication. I take a small pill for that every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, history of anemia, and currently taking medication for high blood pressure. Thank you. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: It's Lisinopril, I think. A small white pill. I’ve been on it for about five years now. It keeps everything under control, thankfully. I get my blood pressure checked regularly by my family doctor, so I know it's working.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. That's helpful. Now, regarding family history… Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother had diabetes, and my father had heart problems. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she also had some sort of anemia, I think. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember all the details. But yes, diabetes and heart problems, and some anemia on my mother’s side. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, thank you. And finally, just a couple of questions about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke, and I try to stay away from it whenever possible. I don't like the smell of it, and it's just not good for you. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years ago.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just occasionally. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Nothing heavy. I wouldn't say I drink regularly. I enjoy a nice glass of wine, but I don't need it. I mostly drink water, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Haggar, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Then I’ll take a look at your skin and eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are. I hope you can figure out what’s going on. It's just… tiring to keep worrying about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart and lungs sound good. I’m just feeling your abdomen now… Do you feel any tenderness here, on the right side?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A little bit. It's not awful, but it's… sensitive. Sometimes it feels a bit achy, even when I’m not being touched. I thought it might be just from eating too much, but… I'm not sure. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Your sclera – the whites of your eyes – are showing some yellowing, and your skin has a slightly jaundiced appearance. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, the symptoms are pointing towards a possible issue with your liver or gallbladder. It could be something relatively minor, but we need to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function and bilirubin levels. I also recommend an ultrasound of your gallbladder and liver to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's causing this. Blood tests and an ultrasound sound good. When can we do those? I’m happy to schedule them whenever it’s convenient.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I've scheduled you for blood work this afternoon, and the ultrasound is scheduled for Thursday morning. The lab results usually take a couple of days to come back, and we can discuss them once I have them. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid eating fava beans and any other foods that seem to trigger your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. Thank you. Avoiding the fava beans makes sense. It’s a bit sad, I do like them, but it’s worth it if it helps figure things out. I'm just… relieved we’re doing something. Thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I understand it can be frustrating when something isn’t clear, and I'm glad we're taking steps to investigate. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment on Thursday, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a printed summary of our discussion and your test orders. And here’s the contact information for the clinic, should you need it. Thank you for coming in today. I’ll see you on Thursday to discuss the results. In the meantime, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
