DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… unsteadiness. I’ve been feeling quite off-balance lately. It’s difficult to explain, really. It just… happens. I don’t recall a specific event that caused it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It's helpful to know it wasn't related to a particular injury or event. When you say “off-balance,” could you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not a dizziness, not exactly. More like… the ground feels unsteady under me. Like I might tip over, even when I’m standing still. Sometimes it’s worse when I walk, and I have to concentrate very hard to keep my steps even. I don’t… I don’t think I’ve fallen, thankfully. But I worry I might. It’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s more of a feeling of instability rather than spinning or lightheadedness. And it seems to be impacting your walking as well. Has this been happening gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It… it feels like it’s been gradual. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I think it started a few months ago, perhaps? It was very mild at first, barely noticeable. Then it slowly got worse. I wish I could be more specific. Everything feels… a bit hazy, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. It’s common for these things to develop gradually. A few months, slowly worsening… that’s helpful information. And you mentioned your memory feels a bit hazy. Have you noticed any other changes in your memory or concentration alongside this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I do seem to forget things more easily than I used to. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, appointments… things like that. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words. It’s quite frustrating, honestly. I didn't think it was connected to the unsteadiness, but… perhaps it is. I truly don’t recall if this all started at the same time. It's all a bit… muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information, Lilyanna. Memory issues and difficulty finding words along with the unsteadiness is certainly something we need to investigate further. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My past medical history… that’s a difficult question. My husband… he always handled those things. I… I remember having the usual childhood illnesses, measles, things like that. And I had a rather difficult childbirth, many years ago. But beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t have much to tell you. My husband passed away a few years ago, and I haven’t been to a doctor regularly since then. I do have private insurance, if that’s helpful. But specific illnesses or conditions… I truly don’t recall. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It’s understandable that things might be a bit unclear, especially after a loss. Knowing about the difficult childbirth is helpful, and it's good to know you have private insurance. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I believe I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps ten or twelve years old. It was a very simple procedure, as I recall. And… I had a C-section with my son, of course, due to the difficult labor. Beyond that… I don’t believe so. I really do wish I could be more precise. My memory… it’s a constant source of frustration. I hope this isn’t making things too difficult for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilyanna. You're providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. Knowing about the appendectomy and C-section is helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one as well. My parents… they both passed away many years ago. And I didn’t know them very well, to be honest. They were… not very forthcoming about their health. I know my mother had… some sort of arthritis, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, but I don’t recall the specifics. I don’t have any siblings, so there’s no one to ask. I apologize for being so vague. It's just… I don't have much information to share. It feels like a lot of things are… lost to time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilyanna. You've told me what you know, and that's what matters. Knowing about your parents' arthritis and heart problems is helpful, even if the details are limited. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, as I mentioned, my husband passed away a few years ago. We didn’t have any children besides my son, who… he lives quite far away now. I live alone. I used to be very active in the community, volunteering at the local school, but I’ve… withdrawn a bit since my husband’s passing. I don’t drink alcohol, and I’ve never smoked. I try to eat a healthy diet, but… it’s difficult to motivate myself sometimes. I work as a rotary drill operator in the oil and gas industry, which is… physically demanding work. But I need to keep busy, you see. I find it helps to… distract me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Lilyanna. That gives me a much better understanding of your life. Physically demanding work and a history of volunteering… that’s good to know. And I understand the desire to stay busy. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any reactions to medications or food, as far as I know. I’ve never had any issues with bee stings or anything like that either. I have a… rather strong constitution, I believe. But I suppose it’s always best to be cautious. I apologize, I simply cannot recall ever having an allergic reaction. I truly wish my memory were better.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Lilyanna. No known allergies is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I haven’t taken any prescription medications in years. I occasionally take ibuprofen for aches and pains, especially after work, but that’s it. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a while ago. I simply… lost the habit. I apologize for being so vague. My life has been… rather chaotic since my husband’s passing, and I haven’t been very diligent about my health. I really do wish I could be more organized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lilyanna. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's understandable that things haven’t been easy. So, just occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment, including checking your balance and coordination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If that will help determine what’s going on, then please, proceed. I apologize if I seem… hesitant. It’s just… I’m not very fond of medical examinations, to be honest. But I understand it’s necessary. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Lilyanna, I’m just checking your balance now. A little unsteady, as we discussed. And just checking your coordination… a little tremor there. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the exam reveals some mild unsteadiness, a slightly wide-based gait, and a slight tremor. These findings suggest a possible issue with balance and coordination. Now, to help narrow down the possibilities, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I’d like to check your vitamin B12 levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. If that will help determine the cause of this… unsteadiness, then please, proceed with the blood tests. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I truly wish I could provide more information. But my memory… it's simply not what it used to be. I hope these tests provide some answers. Where do I go to have those done?
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Lilyanna. You're providing me with all the information you have, and that's perfectly alright. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician will draw a small sample of blood. It shouldn't take too long. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I would like you to keep a log of any episodes of unsteadiness, noting the time, duration, and any associated symptoms. Also, please be careful to avoid falls. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Room 203, down the hall. I can remember that. A log of the episodes… yes, I can do that. Hmm… I suppose my question is… what could this be, Doctor? Is it something serious? I apologize for asking, but my mind is… racing a bit. Is it… is it something that can be fixed? And… could my memory be related to this, or is that a separate issue? I apologize for all the questions. I simply… want to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Lilyanna, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious when you're unsure about what's going on. There are several possibilities that could be causing your symptoms. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, such as B12, as we’ll be checking. Thyroid issues can also cause balance problems. Less common possibilities include inner ear problems or neurological conditions. It's too early to say definitively what's causing it without the blood test results. But we'll investigate thoroughly. As for your memory, it could be related to the unsteadiness, especially if it’s affecting your brain function. However, memory problems can also have other causes, such as stress, medications, or age-related changes. We’ll discuss that further once we have more information. I want to assure you that we'll work together to figure this out and develop a plan to address it. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you want me to write a note for your son to let him know you’re being evaluated?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very reassuring to hear. Taking it one step at a time… yes, that sounds sensible. A note to my son… that’s a kind offer. Perhaps just a brief note to let him know I’m being evaluated for some unsteadiness, nothing too alarming. He worries, you see. He lives so far away, and I don’t want to cause him unnecessary concern. But it would be nice for him to know I’m taking care of this. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilyanna. I'm happy to help. Here you go. It simply states that you're being evaluated for some unsteadiness and that you’re under my care. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I’ve also sent the lab orders electronically. They should be expecting you shortly. Once you have the results, you can either schedule another appointment with me, or you can have the lab forward the results directly to my office. In the meantime, please be careful and avoid activities that might increase your risk of falling. And remember to keep that log of your episodes. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. No, I believe that’s all for now. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I will be careful and keep the log. And I will schedule a follow-up appointment once I have the results. Thank you, Doctor Chagaris. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day as well. .
