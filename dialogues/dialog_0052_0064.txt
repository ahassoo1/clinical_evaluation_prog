DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. My chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Chelberg. Chest pain is certainly something we want to investigate thoroughly. To get a better understanding, could you describe the pain in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Hmm… it’s mostly in the middle of my chest. And like I said, tight. Sometimes it feels like it goes into my arm… my left arm, I think. It doesn’t go all the way down, just… a little bit. It comes and goes, you know? Not steady. It usually happens when I’m walking, or… doing something around the house. But not always. Sometimes it just… happens.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Chelberg. It’s helpful to know it’s located in the middle of your chest and radiates to your left arm, and that it’s brought on by activity, but can also occur at rest. To help me build a complete picture, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale? Hmm… that’s a good question. When it’s really bad… maybe a six? Not the worst ever, but enough to make me stop what I’m doing. Most of the time, it’s more like a two or three. Just… uncomfortable. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a… heavy feeling. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. A heavy feeling, rated a six at its worst, and generally around a two or three – that’s very helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit more about when this started. When did you first begin experiencing this chest pain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe… a month ago? I think it was after I helped my daughter move some furniture. Heavy lifting, you know? I thought it was just a pulled muscle at first, but it hasn't gone away. It's been getting a little worse lately, that's why I came in.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. So it began about a month ago following heavy lifting, and has been gradually worsening. Has anything specific relieved the pain at all?
PATIENT: Well, sitting down usually helps. And… when I take a little rest. Not medicine, just… stopping and relaxing. And sometimes, a warm cup of chamomile tea. It doesn’t make it go away, but it feels… better.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Chelberg. Rest and a warm beverage seem to provide some comfort. Now, to get a fuller understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I have a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. That was… maybe twenty years ago? Other than that… not much. I try to eat healthy, and I walk when I can. My husband, he worries about me, you know? He says I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. High blood pressure managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. And it's good you are mindful of your health and stay active when you can. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you happen to know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… my daughter helps me with the pills, she keeps track. I think it's… lisinopril? Is that right? Yes, I believe it’s lisinopril. A little white pill. I take one every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Excellent, lisinopril. And do you experience any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My husband always says I’m lucky that way. He’s always been the one with the sniffles and sneezes!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Chelberg. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, or grandparents – have had any heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure too, when she got older. And my father… he had a stroke, a long time ago. I don't know if it was related to his heart, but… yes. And my older brother, he has diabetes. He doesn’t take care of himself very well, always eating sweets.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Chelberg. A family history of high blood pressure, stroke, and diabetes is helpful to know. Now, to get a complete picture, could you briefly describe your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, well… I live with my husband, Ricardo. We have three grown children, all married with families of their own. I used to work as a transportation inspector, but I retired a few years ago. Now I mostly spend my time cooking, gardening, and visiting my grandchildren. We go to church every Sunday. I try to stay busy, but I get tired easily these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. That provides a good understanding of your background. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your overall condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a regular rhythm, but I do notice a slight murmur. It's not particularly loud, but it's present. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackling sounds. Your blood pressure is currently 142/88, which is a little elevated. And your pulse is 78, also slightly elevated. I'm going to palpate your chest and abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: Oh, the murmur… is that bad? My blood pressure being high doesn't surprise me, I get nervous at the doctor's office, you know? As for tenderness… hmm. A little bit here, on my chest, right in the middle. That’s where the pain is. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable when you push on it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Chelberg. The murmur warrants further investigation, but we’ll discuss that shortly. It's understandable that your blood pressure is elevated in the office setting – that's a common occurrence. And the tenderness in the middle of your chest corresponds with the location of your pain, which is also helpful information. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings from the physical exam, I would like to order a few tests to get a clearer understanding of what's going on. These include an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity, and some blood work, including a complete blood count and a cardiac enzyme panel, to rule out any heart damage. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, tests… well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. I trust your judgment. An EKG and blood work… is that going to be painful? I don't like needles very much.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be nervous, Ms. Chelberg. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small adhesive patches on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. As for the blood work, there will be a brief pinch when the needle is inserted, but it’s usually very quick and not overly painful. The phlebotomist will be very gentle. We'll send the blood work to the lab and I’ll review the results as soon as they come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity, and if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you explained everything very well, Doctor. Avoiding activity and going to the emergency room if it gets worse… I can do that. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It’s my pleasure. I want to assure you that we are taking your concerns seriously and will work together to determine the cause of your chest pain and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and perform the EKG. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and will contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you again for coming in today.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you so much. You have a good day now.
