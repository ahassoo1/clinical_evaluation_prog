DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello. Well, uh... it's about the... the team. The baseball team. I need a check-up, yes? To play. I think. Something like that. My... ex-wife, she said I needed one. Before I could try out. A formality, she called it. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. A team physical. Okay. And how long have you been playing baseball, Mr. Bartok?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. A very long time. Since... since I was a boy, of course. Many, many years. Not… not lately, though. Not seriously lately. Mostly just with... with the fellas. Down at the park. It’s… good exercise, yes? Keeps a man young. Though, my knees… they aren’t what they used to be. I remember a slide once... a bad slide. But that was years ago. Years.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you're looking to get cleared for tryouts now. And you mentioned some knee issues in the past. Any current pain or trouble with them?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… constantly. No. But they… they stiffen up, you know? Especially in the mornings. Or after… sitting for a long time. It’s a small thing. An old man thing, really. I can still… I can still get around. Walk. Climb stairs. Though, quickly? No. Not quickly. And bending down… that's a little difficult. It's not bad bad. It just… reminds me I’m not twenty anymore. A little creaky, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s get a better idea of what’s going on. We'll do a quick physical exam. Just want to check your range of motion, reflexes, listen to your heart and lungs, the usual. Have you had any other injuries besides the knees?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm... let me think. There was… my shoulder, once. Playing softball. A bad throw. Felt it pop. Needed some… something. A wrap, maybe? And… and I think I pulled a muscle in my back a long time ago. Lifting… boxes. Yes, boxes. For a friend. It wasn’t serious. I just… I just rested it. I don't remember much detail. Old injuries are all a blur, you understand. A man gets older, things… fade.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any major medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor… a different doctor… mentioned something about it once. Said I should watch my salt. I try to. Salt is good, though. Adds flavor. Diabetes? No, I don't think so. I like sweet things, yes, but… I’m not sickly sweet. Heart problems? No. I feel my heartbeat. That means it’s working, doesn’t it? Look, I’m not a delicate flower. I’m a… a sturdy man. It's all a bit of fuss, if you ask me. But my ex-wife… she’s very particular.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. I understand you feel healthy overall, but it’s important we go through this thoroughly. We’re not trying to cause fuss, we’re trying to make sure you're safe to participate in tryouts. Let’s start with a quick review of your medications and allergies, if you have any. And then we can move on to the physical exam.
PATIENT: Medications... hmm. Let me think. I take… something for my knees, sometimes. When they really bother me. A little white pill. I get it from the drugstore. Not every day. Just when… necessary. Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life. Everything. I’m not a fussy eater. A sturdy man, remember? I don’t get hives, or… or anything. Perhaps a little indigestion sometimes, after a big meal. But that's just… a little bit of gas. Not an allergy. This is all a bit… detailed, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, an over-the-counter pain reliever for your knees when needed. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Name? Hmm… no. I just… ask for something for the knees. The man at the counter, he knows. He always gives me the same thing. It’s a white pill. Small. I take two. When the knees… protest. I don't pay attention to names. Too many names in the world. A sturdy man doesn't need to know the names of pills. He just needs them to work, yes? A sturdy man just needs relief. It's all a blur, really. I just want to play baseball. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, it is important for me to know what you’re taking. Even over-the-counter medications can have side effects or interact with other conditions. It’s not about being fussy, it’s about providing you with the best and safest care. Do you have any insurance information I can access to check your medication history?
PATIENT: Insurance… Yes, I have Medicare. The blue card. My ex-wife handles most of that. She’s… very organized. Let me see… <rummages in wallet> Here. Yes, this one. Blue. With my picture. You can… look it up. She said everything is in the system. A sturdy man doesn’t worry about systems. But she… she likes systems. I trust her with these things. Look up the pills. Whatever you need. Just… hurry it up, if you don’t mind. I have a game to think about. Or a tryout. Something like that. A blur, you understand. A blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me just pull up your records here... Okay. It appears you’ve had a few prescriptions filled in the past, but nothing currently listed for knee pain. It shows a previous diagnosis of… mild hypertension, confirmed about five years ago. And a single visit for… indigestion, about three years ago. Nothing else relevant. I still recommend that you try to recall the specific name of the over-the-counter pain reliever you take. But we can proceed with a physical exam for now. If you'll please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure and heart rate.
PATIENT: Hypertension... yes, that's what the other doctor said. Salt, he said. I try. But… salt is good. And indigestion? Well, I like to eat. A sturdy man likes to eat! Okay, fine. Blood pressure. Heart rate. Lie down. Yes. <awkwardly lies down on the examination table> Is this going to take long? I’m not very flexible anymore, you know. A sturdy man, but not that sturdy. Hurry it up, if you don’t mind. This is all… a bit undignified.
DOCTOR: Just a few moments, Mr. Bartok. I understand your discomfort. It's just standard procedure. I’m inflating the cuff now... Just relax your arm. Deep breaths. Okay. 148 over 92. Not ideal. And your pulse is a little elevated at 88. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breath in... and out… again… and one more time. Everything sounds clear, but your breathing is a bit shallow. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. <Tests reflexes in both knees and ankles> A little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Finally, let’s check the range of motion in your knees. Can you bend your knees as far as you can?
PATIENT: Bend my knees… Yes. <grimaces slightly as he attempts to bend his knees> Ouch. Not as far as I used to. A bit of creaking. A bit of pain. This is… not comfortable. I’m a sturdy man, but even sturdy men have their limits. Yes. That's as far as they go. It’s… stiffer on this one. <points to his left knee> Years of baseball. Years of… living. Do you need to… push them? I don’t like to be pushed. This is… undignified. A sturdy man shouldn’t have to endure this. What does it mean? Am I… still able to play?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I've noted some swelling and tenderness in your left knee, as you mentioned. Your range of motion is limited in both knees, especially on the left. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common with age, but nothing overly concerning. However, your blood pressure is elevated. Based on my initial examination, you have mild osteoarthritis in both knees, and your hypertension is not well controlled. Now, regarding playing baseball, I cannot clear you for tryouts at this time. Participating in strenuous activity with uncontrolled hypertension and existing osteoarthritis could lead to serious complications, including increased risk of heart attack, stroke, or further joint damage. We need to get your blood pressure under control and address the pain in your knees. I recommend a referral to a cardiologist to evaluate your blood pressure and determine the appropriate treatment plan. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the knee pain. We can discuss physical therapy options as well to improve your range of motion and strength. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s… unacceptable. I need to play. I want to play. Baseball is… it's everything. My only… recreation. A sturdy man needs recreation. You’re saying I can’t play? Because of… old age? Because of a little bit of creaking? And… high blood pressure? That’s just a number. My ex-wife… she worries too much. A cardiologist? Physical therapy? That sounds… expensive. And… time-consuming. I don’t have time for… coddling. I just need something for the knees. A stronger pill. Something to make the pain go away. I’ll be careful. I promise. I won’t… strain myself. You’re telling me an old man can’t enjoy a simple game of baseball? That’s… that’s a disgrace. I need a second opinion. A doctor who understands… sturdy men. A doctor who understands the need for recreation. This is… ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. I’m leaving. <attempts to stand up, wincing in pain> I’ll… I’ll think about it. A long time. And I’ll find another doctor. A doctor who understands. <grumbles under his breath as he slowly walks towards the door> A disgrace…
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration. However, my responsibility is to your health and safety, not simply to accommodate your desires. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for activity when your medical condition presents a significant risk. I will document your refusal of referral and treatment. You are free to seek another opinion, as you wish. However, I strongly urge you to reconsider and prioritize your health. Before you go, please allow me to provide you with a written summary of my findings and recommendations. And here is a prescription for a short course of ibuprofen to help manage the knee pain. Please remember, this is a temporary solution and does not address the underlying issues. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or worsening knee pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Take care, Mr. Bartok. .
