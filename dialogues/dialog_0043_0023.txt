DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 38 years of age. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor Kalinski. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… it hurts sometimes. It's like… a pain in my breast.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pain in your chest can be concerning, certainly. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not a sharp pain. More like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels heavy. And… it’s not always in the same spot. Sometimes it’s more on this side… and sometimes over here… . It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Bulaong. It’s helpful that you’re trying to pinpoint it for me. The fact that it's not consistently in one place is noted. Does anything seem to bring on the pain – exertion, stress, eating, or perhaps a particular position?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. It just… happens. I work on roofs, so… it's hard to tell if moving around makes it worse. It hurts when I’m tired, maybe? But I'm always tired from the work. I don't think stress...no. I don't get too stressed. My wife keeps me calm.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Bulaong. A supportive partner is invaluable. Since your work is physically demanding, it’s difficult to isolate the cause. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms associated with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. No fever. No… lumps. Nothing coming out of it. Just… the pain. Sometimes… I feel a little… worried about it, but my wife says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and it's reassuring you haven’t noticed any other physical changes. Worrying is understandable with chest pain. Let's delve a bit deeper. Have you ever had this type of pain before, or is this a new experience?
PATIENT: I… I don’t think so. Maybe a little soreness after a long day on the roof. But not this. This feels… different. It's not just muscle pain. It's… inside. It's hard to explain. I've never felt this before, no. Definitely new.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new onset of pain is important to note. And it sounds like it's distinct from the typical muscle soreness you experience with work. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I’ve never been to the doctor before… really. Just… for work injuries, little things. My wife usually takes care of all that. She says I’m strong and don't need doctors. I’m healthy… or I thought I was.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bulaong. It’s perfectly alright if you haven’t had regular check-ups. Many people don’t until something brings them in. And it's good you have a supportive wife who looks after you. Since you haven't been diagnosed with any prior conditions, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any heart problems, lung issues, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandmother… on my mother's side… she died when she was old. I don't know what she died from. No one talks about it much. And… no cancer, as far as I know. My family doesn't really talk about sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, even though details are limited. That's helpful. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me if you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. My wife sometimes gives me something for a headache, but that’s it. Just… regular pain reliever. Nothing else. I try to stay away from medicine as much as I can.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, regarding lifestyle… Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My wife would kill me if I did. She says it's very bad for you. I don't drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every night. I eat… okay. My wife cooks good food, healthy food. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Bulaong. A healthy lifestyle is very important. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, such as food or insects?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Never had any problems with allergies. Sometimes I get bitten by mosquitoes on the roof, but that’s just itchy. Nothing serious. I don't think I’m allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong, thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and I will also palpate your chest to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have to get back to work later.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong, I'll do my best to be as efficient as possible. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. Take a deep breath in... and out... again... good. Your heart rate is currently 78 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. I'm not hearing any abnormal sounds in your lungs. Now, I'm going to gently press on your chest. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild tenderness upon palpation on the left side of your chest, specifically around the mid-clavicular line. It's not severe, but it is present. No palpable masses are detected.
PATIENT: That’s where it hurts, Doctor. When you press there… that’s the spot. It's not always painful, but… yeah, that’s it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Bulaong. That helps me narrow down the possible causes. Given your description of the pain, the mild tenderness upon palpation, and your physically demanding occupation, my initial concern is musculoskeletal pain, potentially a strain of the intercostal muscles or inflammation of the cartilage in the rib cage – what we call costochondritis. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart and ensure there are no underlying issues. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Um… is it safe? I don't want to get sick from the… the rays.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Bulaong. It’s good you’re asking questions. The amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is very low, and the benefits of ruling out serious conditions far outweigh the risks. It's a standard diagnostic tool, and the dose is comparable to the natural background radiation you’re exposed to over a few days. It won't make you sick. We take all necessary precautions to minimize exposure. It will help us determine if there’s anything else going on, such as pneumonia, a collapsed lung, or other issues that could be causing your pain. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… if you say it’s safe. I trust you, Doctor. And… if it gets me back to work faster… then yes. Let’s do the X-ray. But… can we do it quickly? I really need to get back today.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. I completely understand your concern about getting back to work. The X-ray procedure itself is very quick – it will only take a few minutes. Our technician will position you appropriately, take a few images, and then you’ll be all set. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss the findings and a plan of action. I will also provide you with a referral to the radiology department, and they will schedule the X-ray for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and taking over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, to manage your discomfort. Do you have any allergies to these medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can take those. My wife gives them to me sometimes for headaches. She said I can take them with food.
DOCTOR: Good. Then that’s a good starting point for symptom management while we await the X-ray results. I'll write a referral for the X-ray now, and I’ll also include instructions for you regarding what to expect during the procedure. Here is the referral. Please take this to the radiology department. They are located on the third floor, room 312. They’ll schedule an appointment for you as soon as possible. Once the X-ray is complete, the results will be sent directly to me. I will review them and contact you to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this part of the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you for listening to me. I hope it's nothing serious. Just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I understand your concern, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this quickly. Remember, if your pain worsens significantly or you experience any new symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fever, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the X-ray results. In the meantime, take it easy, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Have a good day, Mr. Bulaong.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. You too.
