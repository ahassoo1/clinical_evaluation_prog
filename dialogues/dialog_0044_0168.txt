DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s…Esthela Pandolfi, if you please. And frankly, it’s about this…gentleman I’ve recently begun seeing. I simply want to ensure everything is…as it should be, before things progress any further. One must be prudent, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, prudence is always a good idea, Esthela. It’s wise to get things checked out. I see here you're 44 years old. And you’re here today with concerns related to a new partner?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Forty-four, and quite particular about my health, I assure you. It's not every man who meets my standards, you see. And yes, it is about a new…acquaintance. I wouldn’t call him a partner just yet. One must observe, Doctor. Observe carefully. It’s just…well, I want to be certain he isn’t bringing any…unpleasantness into my life. Do you follow?
DOCTOR: I do, Esthela. It sounds like you're being very thoughtful and proactive about your well-being. To help me understand what you’re concerned about specifically, could you tell me a little more about what’s prompting these concerns?
PATIENT: Well, it’s difficult to articulate precisely. He seems…perfectly normal, outwardly. But one can be deceiving, can’t one? He’s…older, shall we say. Not terribly so, but old enough that…certain things become more relevant. I suppose I worry about…well, the usual things. Things one doesn’t discuss openly. I simply want to be sure. And I’d prefer not to list everything; it feels rather vulgar, frankly. Are there standard tests one should have, given the…circumstances?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. It’s perfectly reasonable to want peace of mind, and I respect your desire to keep things private. Yes, there are standard screenings we can do, especially with a new partner, and even more so considering a difference in age. We typically recommend testing for sexually transmitted infections – STIs – that’s a good starting point. And depending on your level of comfort, we can also discuss testing for other infections. Would you be comfortable starting with STI testing?
PATIENT: STI testing…yes, that seems…sensible. A prudent measure, as I said. And I suppose one can’t be too careful, can one? Though I must confess, the thought of discussing such things is rather unpleasant. But if it’s necessary…very well. Do you need a…detailed history? Because I assure you, my lifestyle is…quite discreet. I wouldn’t want to bore you with unnecessary details.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Esthela, and I assure you, I’m here to provide care without judgment. We don’t need a detailed history, but a little information helps me determine the best course of action. Perhaps we can start with a few general questions. Have you had a recent physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one last October with Dr. Miller. A very thorough examination, I assure you. He detected a slight irregularity in my blood pressure, but nothing alarming. He prescribed a low-sodium diet and told me to…monitor things. I’ve been quite diligent about it. And, naturally, I follow all medical advice to the letter. Do you need his contact information? He’s a very reputable doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Esthela, and thank you for mentioning Dr. Miller. Knowing you had a recent exam with him is helpful. And it’s excellent that you’ve been proactive about your blood pressure. Given your concerns about a new partner, and to be thorough, I'd also like to ask about your overall medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I've mentioned. And thankfully, I’ve been blessed with good genes. My mother lived to be ninety-two, and she was quite vigorous until the very end. No chronic conditions whatsoever. Though I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu two winters ago, but that was promptly treated. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very healthy woman. I simply want to be…certain, as we’ve discussed. It's about peace of mind, truly. This gentleman…well, he’s a bit of a mystery, and one must be cautious.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. It sounds like you've taken excellent care of yourself, and that's wonderful. Now, just to complete a basic overview, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, as Dr. Miller recommended for my heart health. And occasionally, a multivitamin. Nothing else. I prefer a natural approach whenever possible. I don’t believe in loading oneself with unnecessary chemicals, you understand. It disrupts the body’s natural balance. And honestly, Doctor, I’m rather particular about what I put into my system. Do you require the brand names? I assure you, I only use the finest quality products.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Esthela. Low-dose aspirin and a multivitamin - noted. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I have no allergies whatsoever. It's another blessing, I suppose. Though I do find certain perfumes…overpowering, if that counts. But a true allergy? No. I can eat anything, take anything, without issue. It’s rather convenient, truthfully. Are we nearing the end of this…inquisition? I do have a luncheon appointment at one o’clock, and I wouldn’t want to be late. It's with the Ladies Auxiliary, and they are quite punctual.
DOCTOR: We're almost finished, Esthela, and I apologize for the thorough questioning. It's simply my job to gather all the necessary information to provide the best care. Just a few more questions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been remarkably fortunate in that regard. No surgeries, no serious illnesses, no hospitalizations. I attribute it to good genetics and a healthy lifestyle, of course. And a bit of prudence, as we’ve discussed. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very…low-risk patient, I assure you. Are we quite finished now? I truly must be going. The Ladies Auxiliary is expecting me, and Mrs. Henderson is notoriously strict about tardiness.
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, we’ve covered everything. You’ve given me a very clear picture of your health history, and I appreciate your thoroughness. It sounds like you are indeed a very healthy woman. Now, given your concerns about a new partner, and to be cautious, I recommend we proceed with STI testing. We can do a blood test and a urine sample today. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…perfectly reasonable. As long as it doesn't take too long; I have commitments, you understand. Blood test and urine sample…very well. Just please assure me the results will be kept strictly confidential. One wouldn’t want this…information circulating. And, honestly, Doctor, I trust you are discreet. It’s paramount. Can we schedule that now? I’d like to get this over with as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Confidentiality is of utmost importance, and I can assure you that all your information will be kept strictly private. Let’s get you scheduled for the lab work. It will take about 15-20 minutes for the blood draw and urine sample. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and collect the sample after I leave. She will explain the process. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all. You have been most…efficient, Doctor. And discreet, I trust? I simply want to reiterate the importance of confidentiality. It is…paramount. I suppose I will see you again in a few days, once the results are in. Thank you for your time. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must be going. Mrs. Henderson does not tolerate tardiness, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Your confidentiality is my top priority. I appreciate you coming in today. Have a wonderful day with the Ladies Auxiliary, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before our follow-up appointment. .
