DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. New here, you know. Just... the normal check-up, I think? Doctor said I should find someone when I moved. Old doctor... was good. But far away now. Everything is so… complicated these days.
DOCTOR: Right, a general check-up. Well, it's good you’re being proactive. Though, frankly, most people don’t need yearly check-ups. Still. Let’s get this over with. Do you have any specific concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? No… not really. I feel… fine. A little tired, maybe? But who isn’t? I work long hours, you know. Making up actresses… very demanding work. They want this, they want that… always something. Is that a concern? Being tired? It’s just… life.
DOCTOR: Making up actresses… right. Well, “tired” is exceptionally vague. Is this new?
PATIENT: New? …I don’t know. Maybe. Everything feels… blurred lately. Time, mostly. I used to remember all the faces, all the little details… now, not so much. It’s annoying. Very annoying. Not like before.
DOCTOR: Blurred… Right. So, memory issues and fatigue. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my back aches. Always has, though. From bending over… the actresses, you know? And… I think I’m eating more. More potatoes. And… is it normal to forget where you put your glasses? I just had them! See! Now I really lost them. This is… typical.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain, increased appetite, and memory problems. And you've misplaced your glasses, which… happens. Let's try to be a bit more systematic. Do you have any difficulty with balance?
PATIENT: Balance? No… I don’t think so. I walk to work, you know. Every day. Long walk, but I walk. Though… sometimes I feel a little… wobbly. Like the floor is not… flat. But that’s just old shoes, maybe? Bad shoes. Not balance. I need new shoes. Good shoes.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And what about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: My… what now? You ask very… personal questions, Doctor. Is this necessary? I came for a check-up, not… an interrogation. I eat potatoes, yes. Good potatoes. Is that what you want to know? Is that a problem? Potatoes?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Szmyd, it’s standard procedure. We need a complete picture. I’m trying to rule things out. A change in bowel habits can indicate… well, a lot of things. Just tell me if you've noticed anything different. More frequent?
PATIENT: Different… Everything is different these days! The potatoes taste different, the actresses are different, you are different… It’s all different! Fine! Maybe… maybe I go more often now. A little. But that's because of the potatoes! Good, strong potatoes. What else do you want to know? Am I going to have to tell you my life story? This is ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Any family history of… neurological issues?
PATIENT: Neu… what? My family? My mother… she liked to knit. A lot of knitting. And my father… he liked potatoes too! Very strong potatoes. No one… sick, I don't think. They all… old. Old people get old, yes? Is that what you mean? They didn't go to doctors much, back then. Not like now, with all the questions. And the… potatoes. It always comes back to the potatoes!
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, I’m trying to get a clear understanding of your health. A family history of neurological problems – dementia, Parkinson’s, stroke – is important. Did anyone in your family have trouble with their memory, movement, or speech?
PATIENT: ! I don't like this! You ask too many questions, and you don't listen to the answers! My mother knitted, my father ate potatoes! They were old! What more do you want?! I came for a simple check-up, not… a test! I think I'll find another doctor. One who understands… normal people. And doesn’t talk about… neurologicals! I need air. And leave the potatoes alone! .
DOCTOR: Some people… Honestly. .
