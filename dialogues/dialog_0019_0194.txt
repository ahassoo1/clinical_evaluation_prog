DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… well, it's my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. It’s hard to explain, really. Things just… go quiet sometimes, and I get really dizzy. It doesn't last long, but it's unsettling. My daughter, Lani, she booked this appointment for me, said I should get it checked out. I don’t remember all the details, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Terasa. It's very common for things to be a bit fuzzy, especially when you're not feeling well. And it's wonderful that Lani is looking out for you. So, the quietness and dizziness… when did this start happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. It feels like it’s been happening on and off for a while now. Maybe a few months? It's hard to pinpoint. It doesn't happen every day, thankfully. More when I’m… stressed, I think? Or tired? I really can't say for sure. My husband, he… well, he always took care of remembering things like that. It's been a bit harder since he passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you're unsure of the exact timing, Terasa. Losing track of things is completely normal, especially with everything you’ve been through. And stress and fatigue can definitely play a role in these kinds of symptoms. So, when this quietness happens, is it in one ear or both?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I think… usually just the one. My right ear, I think. Yes, definitely my right ear most of the time. Sometimes it feels muffled in both, but it starts in the right. And the dizziness… it’s like the room is spinning, but not always. Sometimes it just feels like I’m going to fall over.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily your right ear, with occasional muffled hearing in both. And the dizziness—spinning sensation or just feeling unsteady. Do you notice anything with the quietness and dizziness?
PATIENT: With it…? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… a ringing. A really high-pitched ringing in my ear. It’s not constant, just when the quietness starts. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I’m going to be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. Just… queasy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ringing in the right ear with the quietness, and sometimes nausea. That’s helpful. Have you ever had any problems with your balance before this, or any ear infections?
PATIENT: Ear infections… oh, when I was a little girl, yes. A couple of times. Nothing serious, just a bit painful. But since then, no. My balance… well, I wouldn’t say I’ve ever had trouble with it, not until these spells started. I used to be a pretty good dancer, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And a history of dancing suggests good balance generally. Alright, Terasa, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears and do a few simple tests to check your balance and hearing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if you know what I mean. It’s unsettling, not knowing what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. Let’s get started then. First, I’m going to take a look inside your ears. This won’t take long and shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I'll just gently insert this instrument to get a better view. Okay… your ear canals look clear. The eardrums appear intact, but I do notice a little bit of fluid behind your right eardrum. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test, just to see if we can pinpoint any hearing loss. Then we'll check your balance.
PATIENT: Fluid, you say? Oh dear. Is that bad? I don't like the sound of fluid. I hope it's not serious. A hearing test sounds… alright. I’ll do whatever you need me to do, Doctor. Just… please don’t make it too complicated. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Terasa. Fluid behind the eardrum can happen for a lot of reasons, often with a cold or allergies. We just need to see how much there is and if it's affecting your hearing. And don’t worry, the hearing test is very simple. I'll give you headphones to wear, and you just need to indicate when you hear a tone. No complicated questions, I promise. Let’s start with your right ear. Just press this button whenever you hear a sound, even if it's very faint. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, ready. I think. It's just… a little nerve-wracking, you know? I haven’t had my hearing tested in… oh, goodness, decades, I suppose. Just… go slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take our time. Okay… I’m going to start now. Just let me know when you hear something. …Did you hear that one?
PATIENT: No… nothing. Not a sound. Wait… maybe a very faint beep? It was so quiet, I’m not sure. It could have been the air conditioning.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll mark that down. That's helpful to know. Let's try another one. …And this one?
PATIENT: No… no, still nothing. I really can't hear much in this ear, Doctor. It feels… muffled, like there’s cotton wool inside. It's not painful, just… quiet. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We're almost finished with this ear. Alright, Terasa, that's all for the hearing test. And I’ve also done a quick balance test, and you seem a bit unsteady, but nothing overly concerning. Based on everything so far, it seems like you have some moderate hearing loss in your right ear, and a bit of fluid behind the eardrum. The dizziness is likely related to the fluid buildup and the hearing loss. It doesn’t seem to be anything serious, but we’ll want to investigate a little further to rule out any other possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn't sound too bad, does it? Hearing loss… fluid… is it… curable? Will I be able to hear properly again? I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren when they visit.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Terasa. It's good you're thinking about your grandchildren. Let's talk about what we can do. The good news is, often this type of hearing loss is treatable. The fluid buildup could be from a simple ear infection or allergies, which we can address with medication. If it doesn’t clear up on its own, we can consider a referral to an audiologist. They can do more comprehensive testing and discuss options like hearing aids if needed. I’m going to prescribe a short course of antibiotics as a precaution, in case there's an underlying infection. I also recommend an over-the-counter decongestant for a week to help clear any congestion in your ear. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you're doing. If your hearing doesn’t improve, we can discuss a referral to the audiologist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds good, Doctor. Medicine and a follow-up… yes. I can do that. An audiologist… is that someone who… helps with hearing? I’ve never been to one before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. An audiologist specializes in hearing and balance problems. They can do very detailed tests to figure out the exact cause of your hearing loss and recommend the best course of action. They can fit you with hearing aids if needed, and teach you how to use them. Don’t worry, it's a very common thing, and they’re very good at what they do. Here’s your prescription for the antibiotics, and this is a referral to a local audiologist. I recommend scheduling an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience with me. My memory… it’s not always reliable. I just hope this medicine works. I really don't want to need hearing aids. But I’m glad I came to see you. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. And don’t worry about your memory – we can always review things again if needed. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in two weeks. .
