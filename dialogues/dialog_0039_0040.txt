DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's this pain in my side, mostly. Keeps coming back. And…the water infections, too. They've been a bother for a while now. I believe my previous doctor mentioned something about my kidneys, but honestly, I don't recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and recurring water infections… I understand. It is good you’re getting it checked out. It’s tricky to remember everything, don’t worry about that. Let's start with the side pain. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a dull ache, lower down on my side, on both sides, actually. It comes and goes, but it's been happening quite often lately – maybe a couple of times a month. Sometimes it’s just a little discomfort, other times it really bothers me when I’m trying to sleep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense – a dull ache, lower down on both sides, coming and going… a couple of times a month. And it's worse when you try to sleep. Now, when you say "recurring water infections," how often would you say you're experiencing those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…it’s probably every two or three months, at least. Sometimes it feels like it’s just starting, a little burning when I go to the toilet, but I take some medicine and it usually clears up quickly. But then it comes back again. It's… a bit of a cycle, really. I do worry about it, always having to take something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly every two to three months you’re experiencing symptoms – burning with urination – and you’re managing it with medication. And it is understandable to worry about something recurring like that. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me what kind of medication you’ve been taking for these infections?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve had different ones over the years, Doctor. My regular doctor – Dr. Patel, before he retired – would usually prescribe…oh, what was it called? It was a little white pill… I’m terrible with names. It starts with a ‘C’, I think. I get them filled at the pharmacy down the road, and they just give me what the doctor ordered. I don't really pay attention to the name, just take them as directed. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Espinueva, don’t worry about it at all. It’s common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in your records, if you're comfortable with that. While I’m doing that, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, well, Dr. Patel did mention something about my kidneys a while back. He said I had…polycystic kidneys, I think? He said it meant I had a lot of little fluid-filled sacs on them. He said it didn't need any treatment at the time, but I've always wondered about it. Apart from that, I’m generally alright. I get a little tired sometimes, but I put that down to my age. I don't smoke, and I only drink a little bit of wine with my dinner now and then.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidneys…yes, I see that in your records as well. Diagnosed about five years ago. And you're right, it was noted that no specific treatment was needed at that time. It’s good to know you don't smoke and only drink in moderation. Okay, just to be thorough, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, a very long time ago, but that was all. Nothing since then. I've been quite lucky, really. A few aches and pains, as you'd expect at my age, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries besides your tonsils as a child. That's good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Well, my wife passed away a few years ago, and I don't have any children. I have a sister who lives in Australia, but we don't see each other very often. She's quite healthy, as far as I know. My father had high blood pressure, I think, and my mother… she had arthritis, mostly. Nothing too serious, really. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. High blood pressure in your father, arthritis in your mother. I understand it's difficult to recall everything. One last few questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I can take most medications without any trouble. I’m quite a simple man, really. Nothing fancy. I just like a good cup of tea and a quiet life. Are we nearly finished? I do hope this isn’t too much bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Mr. Espinueva. And no allergies, that’s good to know. Alright, so let's do a quick exam. I just want to listen to your abdomen, feel your lower sides, and check your blood pressure. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Hmm… sounds are a little diminished in the lower quadrants, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to gently press on your lower sides. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, and on this side… any pain here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit on that side… on the left. It's not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like the pain I was describing earlier. It's not too bad, but I can definitely feel it when you press there. The right side feels alright, though. Just a little tender, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull ache on the left side, with some tenderness on the right. I'm also going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That’s a little elevated. Alright, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. Your history of recurring water infections, the pain in your side, and the polycystic kidneys all point to a few possibilities. The elevated blood pressure is also something we need to address.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? What sort of possibilities are we talking about, Doctor? And what will happen now? I must admit, I’m getting a little worried. I just want to feel better, and I'd like to understand what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Espinueva, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Given your symptoms, the polycystic kidneys, and the recurring infections, we need to rule out a few things. It could be something related to the kidneys themselves – a blockage, perhaps, or a more active infection. It’s also possible that the pain is referred pain from another source. We also need to address the elevated blood pressure, as that can contribute to kidney problems and other health issues. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for infection and other abnormalities. Then, a blood test to assess your kidney function and look for any signs of inflammation. Finally, I think an ultrasound of your kidneys would be very helpful to visualize them and see if there are any blockages or changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that's what you recommend, then I'm happy to go ahead with those tests. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment completely. When can I have these tests done? And will they be painful? I really don't like needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll write the orders for the urine analysis, blood test, and kidney ultrasound now. The urine analysis is straightforward – you just need to provide a sample. The blood test will involve a small needle prick in your arm. It’s usually quick, and most people don’t find it too painful. The ultrasound is completely painless – it uses sound waves to create an image of your kidneys, and there’s no radiation involved. I can arrange for you to have these tests done at the clinic's lab tomorrow morning. They usually have appointments available quite early. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, tomorrow morning would be fine, Doctor. As early as possible would be best, if that’s alright. I’d like to get this sorted out quickly. Will I need to fast for any of these tests? And will I get the results straight away, or will I have to wait? I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a little, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll schedule you for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. Yes, you will need to fast for the blood test. That means no food or drink after midnight tonight, except for water. The urine analysis can be done any time, but it’s best to give the first sample of the morning for the most accurate results. You won’t get the results straight away, unfortunately. The lab usually takes a couple of days to process them, and then I’ll need to review them carefully. I’ll call you as soon as I have them and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, severe pain, or difficulty urinating – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with an old man like me. Fasting until tomorrow, and get the tests done at 8:00 AM. I’ll remember that. Thank you again for everything. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this looked into. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It’s my pleasure. Don't worry about your age at all! I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. If anything comes up before tomorrow, please don't hesitate to call. Otherwise, I'll see you then. Have a good evening, and try to get some rest. .
