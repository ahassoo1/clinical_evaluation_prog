DOCTOR: Hi Soila, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It's my tummy. It feels… big. And I don't want much to eat these days, you see? Not like before. It just doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “big” and not feeling right, and less appetite. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh dear... when did it start? That's… a hard one. It feels like a long time now. Maybe a few weeks? Or maybe longer? Everything is a bit… fuzzy these days. I just noticed it getting bigger, slowly. And the food… well, it just doesn't taste as good anymore. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks or longer, gradually getting bigger and a decreased appetite. Is it painful at all, Soila?
PATIENT: Painful? Not really… no. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like something is full, even when I haven’t eaten much. A heavy feeling, you know? Not sharp pain, thankfully. Mostly just… there. A bit of a worry, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable, feeling full easily, no sharp pain, just a general worry. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – are you more constipated than usual, or perhaps having diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh my… bowel movements? Let me see… Everything feels slow, if that makes sense. Not… regular, like it used to be. More… difficult. I don’t think… diarrhea, no. Just… harder to go. Everything is a bit of a struggle these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, slower and more difficult bowel movements. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting at all, Soila?
PATIENT: Nausea… vomiting? No, no, not at all. I haven’t been sick to my stomach, thank goodness. Just… not hungry. And the tummy feeling big and uncomfortable. That's about it, I think. I really don't know what could be wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, no nausea or vomiting, just the decreased appetite and abdominal discomfort. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss, Soila?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Oh, that's a good question. I haven't been trying to lose weight, that's for sure! I used to weigh more, I think… but now? Everything is a bit blurry, dear. I don’t really keep track of those things anymore. I just feel… lighter, maybe? But I don’t know if that’s from not eating as much… or something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsure about weight loss, possibly feeling lighter. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or heart issues?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Medical problems… Hmm. Doctor, I've lived a long life, you know? I've had a few aches and pains here and there, like everyone else. But nothing serious, not that I recall. No diabetes, no heart problems… The doctors always said I was quite strong, actually. But it was a long time ago. I don’t remember everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known serious medical conditions. Are you currently taking any medications, Soila?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, dear. Let me see… just a little something for my bones, the doctor gave it to me a while back. A small white pill, I think. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take something for that, but not every night. It's all a bit of a blur, you see? I have trouble remembering what I took when, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for bones and something for sleep, intermittently. Now, before we do an exam, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh my. That's a long story. My mother… she lived a long life too, very strong woman. I think she had some trouble with her tummy when she got older, but I don’t remember the details. My father… he was a fisherman, very healthy. And my sister… she passed away a long time ago, I don’t recall what she died from, I'm so sorry. It was a long time ago, you see? Everything is a bit… faded. I don’t mean to be unhelpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Soila. It’s common to not remember details from a long time ago. Okay. With your permission, I’d like to listen to your tummy and feel your abdomen. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Listen to my tummy… feel my abdomen… Yes, of course. Do whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just be gentle, please? Everything feels a bit tender these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, Soila. I am feeling some fullness in your lower abdomen. It’s not particularly painful when I press, but it does feel a little bit firm. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, although they are a little bit quiet. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s… a little bit strange. A little bit of pressure, yes. Not painful, exactly. Just… a feeling. Like something is… there. It’s hard to describe, dear. It doesn’t hurt, but it’s… noticeable. Especially when you press. Oh, and yes, a bit of a gurgle… I felt that too just now.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fullness and firmness, no pain but noticeable pressure, and a gurgling sensation. Now, I'm also going to check your reflexes. Just to get a complete picture. Can you extend your legs for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. There you go. Old bones, you know? Not as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age, Soila. It just means your nerves aren't firing as strongly as they once did. Nothing to worry about. Okay, Soila, based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some abdominal fullness and decreased appetite. The diminished reflexes and slower bowel movements are also consistent with age-related changes. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work and a urine test. And I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be very helpful to get a clearer picture of what’s going on inside. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh my. Blood work… urine test… CT scan? That sounds… serious. Allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had any trouble with anything before. Kidneys? I don't remember anything about my kidneys. The doctors never said anything about them. This all sounds a bit… overwhelming, dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or kidney problems. I understand it sounds overwhelming, Soila, but it’s better to be thorough, and rule things out. The CT scan will help us see what's going on inside and determine the cause of your symptoms. We can discuss the results when they're available, and I’ll explain everything in detail. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a high-fiber diet and plenty of fluids to help with your bowel movements. I also want you to keep a food diary, noting what you eat and how it makes you feel. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, I suppose. High fiber… fluids… food diary… Yes, I can try that. Will… will it hurt, Doctor? The CT scan, I mean? And… how long will I have to wait for the results? Everything takes so long these days.
DOCTOR: The CT scan itself shouldn’t hurt, Soila. You’ll lie on a table, and the scanner will take pictures. It’s a bit noisy, but it’s not painful. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for the radiologist to read them and send the report. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss everything. Now, since you’re not currently insured, the cost of the scan may be a concern. I’ll have my staff reach out to you with information on financial assistance options and payment plans. We can work with you to make sure you get the care you need. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Financial assistance… yes, that would be very helpful. Everything is so expensive these days. A follow-up appointment… yes, that sounds good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I get a bit… forgetful, you know? It’s hard to keep track of things. But… yes, I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. It’s my pleasure. My staff will schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with all the necessary information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we’re here to help you every step of the way. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, dear. You’ve been very helpful. Just… please remember to call me when the results are ready. I worry, you know? It’s hard to wait. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will personally call you with the results. Please take your time getting up, and don't hesitate to let my staff know if you need any assistance. It was lovely meeting you, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
