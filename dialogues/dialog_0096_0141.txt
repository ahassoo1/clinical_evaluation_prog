DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Burlingham, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for… oh, let me think. About three weeks now, I’d say. Started on my arms, and now it’s pretty much all over. It doesn’t really hurt, just… incredibly annoying.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, you say. And it's spread… everywhere. Hmm. Alright. "Everywhere" is a bit vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: You’re right, it is. Sorry. It’s on my torso, my back, legs… even my scalp feels a bit itchy. Not my face, thankfully. And, you know, in the creases of my elbows and knees. It’s just… constant. Like a little electric feeling under the skin.
DOCTOR: Creases of the elbows and knees… Electric feeling, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Not painful electric, more like… a constant tingling. It’s hard to explain. And it’s worse at night, if that makes any difference. I've tried some lotion, you know, just regular stuff from the drugstore, but it doesn’t really help for very long. It's been driving me a bit mad, honestly. I haven’t slept properly in days.
DOCTOR: Lotion, of course. People always try something themselves first. Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I don’t think so, not really. I mean, it doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I eat or any new soaps I’ve used. I haven’t been in any new places, either. I mostly stay around the apartment. Maybe… a little worse when I get warm? Like, if I'm doing something active, it flares up a bit. But that could just be because I’m noticing it more, you know?
DOCTOR: “Mostly stay around the apartment…” Right. And what do you do around the apartment, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual. I read a lot. History, mostly. And I do crossword puzzles. Keep the mind sharp. I watch a bit of television, news and documentaries. Nothing too strenuous, doctor. I used to be a dispatcher, for the city, but I retired a few years back.
DOCTOR: A dispatcher. And for how long were you a dispatcher, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Twenty-seven years, actually. Started right after I came over from Russia. It was… stressful, always talking on the radio, sending people here and there. But it kept me busy. I retired about five years ago, give or take. I still miss it sometimes, to be honest. But it was time.
DOCTOR: Stressful, you say. And have you experienced anything… unusual, since your retirement?
PATIENT: Unusual? Hmm… that's a broad question, doctor. Well, my wife… she passed away about two years ago. That was… a big change. Everything's a bit quiet now. Other than that… not really. I mean, the usual aches and pains of getting older, but nothing I'd call unusual. I try to keep my mind occupied, you know? Stay positive.
DOCTOR: “Stay positive.” Right. Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Let's have a look at this itching, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I’m happy to show you. It’s hard to describe, you know? It's not… a rash, exactly. Just… irritated skin.
DOCTOR: Hold on, hold on. No need to undress just yet. Let me examine your arms first. Just extend them, please. Let's see… Hmm. No visible rash, as you said. Skin is slightly dry. Any lesions, bumps, anything at all that you've noticed?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s just… red, sometimes. Especially after I scratch it, I suppose. And it’s flaky, a little. See? It's not raised or anything. And it doesn't really look that bad, honestly. That’s why I hesitated to come in, I suppose. It's just… incredibly annoying.
DOCTOR: Dryness and mild erythema. Hmm. And what about your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, my legs are the same. A little red, mostly on the backs of them, a little flaky. It’s not terribly noticeable, to be honest. It’s worse if I’m warm, like after a shower or something. Then it really gets itchy. I’ve been trying to keep them cool, but it doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Mild xerosis and erythema, bilateral lower extremities. And you’ve tried moisturizing regularly?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Like I said, I tried some lotion, just regular stuff from the drugstore. Aveeno, I think it was. It helps a little, for a little while, but then it wears off. It doesn’t really fix anything, you know? I put it on after every shower, and sometimes again before bed, but it just doesn’t seem to make much of a difference. I'm starting to wonder if it's something else entirely.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Aveeno. Right. Well, Mr. Ferneding, it could be simple dry skin, exacerbated by heat. But given your history… the stress, the retirement, the loss of your wife… it could be a manifestation of something else. I’d like to rule out a few things. Let’s start with some bloodwork. A complete blood count, and a metabolic panel. And I'd like to check your thyroid levels, just to be safe.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Okay, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Bloodwork is okay. I just… I’d like to know what’s causing this, you know? It’s just driving me mad. Where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 302. They'll need your insurance card, of course. And you’ll need to fast for eight hours beforehand – no food or drink except water. The results should be back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, try to avoid scratching as much as possible. And use a fragrance-free moisturizer, several times a day. We'll see what the bloodwork says. Do you have any questions for me, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Fragrance-free, right. Okay, I’ll remember that. And yes, I have Medicare, so that shouldn’t be a problem. Fasting… eight hours. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor Burlingham. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s just been so annoying, and I was starting to worry it was something serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll see. It's often nothing serious, Mr. Ferneding. But it's best to rule things out. You'll get a call from the lab when your results are ready. If anything urgent comes up, of course, go to the nearest emergency room. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go to the lab right away. Have a good day. .
