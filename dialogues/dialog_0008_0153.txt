DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well… something about a check-up? For… work. I keep forgetting the details, you see. Something about being cleared for a performance, I think. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Just trying to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. A work clearance check-up. And you’re experiencing some… difficulty with recall, it sounds like. Let's try to get to the bottom of this efficiently. To start, can you tell me a little more about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, efficient is good. I… well, I’ve been an usher, mostly. And sometimes I take tickets. Lobby stuff, you know? Around town. Different places. It’s… it’s not very demanding, physically. Mostly standing. And smiling. That’s the hard part, remembering to smile all the time. I haven’t done much lately, though. That might be why my memory’s fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, ushering, ticket taking… mostly standing and smiling. And you haven’t been doing it much recently. Has this memory issue come on suddenly, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. Things just… slipped away a little at a time. It’s not like I can’t remember anything, just… names and dates. Details. Important details. My ex-wife used to get so frustrated. She said I never remembered anniversaries. Which… well, she was probably right. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I really need to get back to… well, whatever it is I do now.
DOCTOR: Right. Gradual onset, mainly affecting names, dates, and details. And it’s causing some concern. Let’s go through a quick review of your overall health to get a better picture. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Not really. I mean, I get tired easily, but that’s just old age, I suppose. And my knees ache sometimes, but again… old age. I haven’t been sick. No dizziness or headaches. Just… foggy. Is there a test for this… fog? I’m not good with hospitals, you know. Always reminds me of… never mind. Just trying to be quick here.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illnesses, dizziness, or headaches, just fatigue and some knee pain. You mentioned the fatigue – has that been increasing recently?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It has. It’s… harder to get through the day, even when I’m not doing much. Used to be able to just… keep going. Now I need to sit down a lot. It’s embarrassing. And… My appetite’s been a little off too. Not that I need a big appetite, you understand. I’m… thin. Always have been. But even less now. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Okay, increasing fatigue and decreased appetite, in addition to the memory issues. Let's take a look at your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions previously?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I recall. I’ve… seen doctors before, for check-ups. Had a bad flu once, years ago. And I broke my arm when I was a boy. But… no serious conditions. No diabetes, heart problems… nothing like that. I didn’t really go to the doctor much, if I could help it. Waste of time, usually. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have… something I need to be getting to. Honestly, I can barely remember what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history. And no surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Definitely not. I… I’d remember that, wouldn’t I? I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Just… getting old. That’s all it is. Old age and a bad memory. It’s a terrible combination, I tell you. Is there anything I can do to… speed things up? I really do appreciate your time, Doctor, but… this is making me anxious. And when I get anxious, I forget things even faster.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries, and you feel this is likely related to age. Let’s briefly go over your family history. Are you aware of any significant medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… difficult. My parents, they passed away a long time ago. In China. I didn’t see them much after I came here. And I… I wasn't close to my siblings. I don't really know their medical histories. I think my mother had… something with her heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about those things. Mostly just focused on… surviving, you know? Is this important, Doctor? Because I honestly don’t have much to tell you. It’s all very… vague.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited information regarding family history. Let's move onto medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I don’t take anything. Never have. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Bad for the stomach, you know? And… I don’t trust them. No medications, Doctor. And no allergies. I can eat anything. Well, almost anything. I don’t really have much of an appetite these days, so it’s not like I’m eating a lot of anything. But… no allergies. Definitely not. Are we getting closer to being done? I really do need to be going. I’m starting to forget why I’m here. It’s very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications or allergies. Let’s do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Oh dear. A… physical exam? Well, if you have to. But please be quick, Doctor. I… I don’t do well with doctors poking and prodding. It makes me anxious. And when I get anxious… you know. Just… please be gentle. And try not to take too long. I really need to get back to… whatever it is I was doing. This is all very… stressful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. …148 over 85. A little elevated. Now I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Reflexes are a little slow, and there’s some mild unsteadiness with balance. Okay. That's all for the basic exam.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… over. Everything okay? Am I… dying? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I’m too old for games. And please, don’t use any big words. I’ll just forget what you say anyway. Is it serious? Do I need… hospitalization? I really don't want to go to the hospital. I have… things to do. Even if I can’t remember what they are. Just… tell me what's going on. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, let's go through this calmly. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your reflexes are slightly slow, and there is some mild unsteadiness. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual memory loss, the fatigue, the decreased appetite, and what I observed in the exam – it could be a number of things. It could be related to normal aging, but given the memory loss, we need to investigate further. I don't think hospitalization is necessary at this time, but I do want to order some blood work to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes. We should also consider getting a brain scan, like an MRI, to rule out any structural issues. It’s also important to evaluate your cognitive function a little more thoroughly. Would you be open to seeing a neurologist for a full assessment?
PATIENT: A neurologist? A brain scan? Oh dear… This is worse than I thought. I… I don’t like this, Doctor. I really don’t. I just came in for a work clearance, you know? I need to be cleared to… to do whatever it is I do. Not… poked and prodded and scanned. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Maybe some pills? Something simple? I really don’t want to go through all of that. I’m an old man, Doctor. I’m tired. And I forget things. It’s just… part of getting old, isn’t it? I… I need to think about this. Can I just… go home? I promise I’ll try to remember what you said. But… I’m starting to forget already.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your concerns, and I wouldn't push you into anything you're not comfortable with. However, ignoring these symptoms isn’t the best course of action. While it could be simply age-related changes, it's important to rule out anything more serious. Let’s start with the blood work. That’s relatively non-invasive, and it can give us a lot of information. I’ll write you a script for that. I also strongly recommend a cognitive assessment, but we can schedule that for a later date if you prefer. You can take some time to consider it. For now, let's focus on the blood work. Does that sound acceptable?
