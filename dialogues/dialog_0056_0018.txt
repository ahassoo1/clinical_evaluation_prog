DOCTOR: Hi Westly, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, it’s…rather difficult to put into words precisely. I seem to be going to the restroom quite a bit. More than usual, certainly. It's been…ongoing for a little while now, I believe. Though, dates escape me, you understand. It feels…frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent urination. And you said it's been going on for a "little while" – can you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific…yes. Hmm. Perhaps…since the spring? Or was it early summer? It’s all a bit hazy, I’m afraid. Before the truly warm weather, certainly. Before…the berries were ripe. Does that help at all? It feels like…several weeks, at least. Perhaps a couple of months. It’s not causing pain, thankfully, just…inconvenient. And a bit worrisome, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of months, starting sometime in the spring. And no pain, just frequency and…inconvenience. Alright. Are you noticing any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…let me consider. I do feel…rather thirsty, perhaps more so than usual. Though, with the heat, it's difficult to say. And I’ve been…sleepier, perhaps? Not unwell, mind you, just…a bit more inclined to rest. I wouldn't say anything drastic. Is there anything specific I should be looking for? I often miss things, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased thirst and some fatigue. Those could be related. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you go to the restroom, are you urinating a large amount each time, or is it just small amounts frequently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I believe…a normal amount, each time. Not dribbling, or anything like that. Just…often. It's not a weak stream, if that matters. It feels like a full emptying, each time, but…more frequently than I remember being necessary. I hope that clarifies things, Doctor. It's difficult to describe these things precisely, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does help. So, normal volume, just increased frequency. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… Now that you mention it…perhaps it’s a bit paler than usual? Though, I drink a good deal of water, so that might explain it. It doesn’t appear cloudy, and…no, no blood or anything alarming. Just…lighter in color. It’s difficult to say for certain. My eyesight isn’t what it once was, you see. Is there something I should be looking for specifically?
DOCTOR: Okay, paler urine. That could be from the increased fluid intake. No blood or cloudiness is good. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…hmm. Well, Doctor, I’ve always been rather…sturdy, you might say. I’ve not had much trouble with illness, thankfully. I believe my doctor, years ago, mentioned my cholesterol being a bit high, but I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. I do take a vitamin D supplement, if that’s relevant. And…Medicare covers my routine checkups, I believe. I don't actively manage any conditions, if that answers your question. Is there something specific you are concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, just a vitamin D supplement. Good. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Years ago, when I was a young man, I had my tonsils removed. And… I believe I was hospitalized briefly for a bout of pneumonia, many years ago as well. But beyond that… nothing significant comes to mind. Nothing recent, certainly. It was…decades ago. Perhaps a minor operation on my knee, but that was a very long time ago and I don't recall the specifics. Is there something specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a previous pneumonia hospitalization. Nothing recent. Now, thinking about your family – is there a history of diabetes, kidney problems, or any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history…that is a difficult question, Doctor. My parents…they both lived long lives, but I don't recall specifics about their health. My mother…she had some trouble with her joints in her later years. Arthritis, I believe. My father…he was a strong man, a farmer. I believe he had a weak heart towards the end, but I don’t recall any details about diabetes or kidney problems. We weren't a family given to discussing such matters, you see. It’s all rather…hazy, I’m afraid. I do have a cousin, somewhere in Bohemia, but I haven't spoken to him in many years. I wouldn't know anything about his health.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, possible heart trouble in your father, nothing specific about diabetes or kidney disease. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, not at all. I've never been one for smoking. It's quite a harmful habit, you know. And alcohol…perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but very rarely. I prefer a good cup of tea. And no, no other substances. A quiet life, you see. I spend my time tending my garden and reading. A very simple existence. I do enjoy a good walk when the weather permits, but the heat has been rather oppressive lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol, no other substances. Very healthy lifestyle. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…hmm. Not that I am aware of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to any medication that I recall. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to certain pollens in the spring, but nothing severe. Just a bit of sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing that requires treatment. I believe I've always been rather robust, as I mentioned. I don’t actively avoid any substances due to allergies. Is there a particular medication you are concerned about?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Westly, thank you for that information. It sounds like you're generally very healthy, which is great. Based on what you've told me, the frequent urination, thirst, and fatigue could be a few different things. One possibility is simply drinking too much fluid, especially with the warmer weather. However, it’s also important to rule out other conditions like diabetes or a urinary tract infection. I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order a urine test to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A urine test and an examination… certainly. I trust your judgment implicitly. Anything you deem necessary to ascertain the cause of these…inconveniences, I am quite willing to undergo. It is reassuring to know we are taking a systematic approach. Please, proceed as you see fit. I confess, I am eager to find a solution. It's just… unsettling, this constant need to visit the restroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start with a quick check of your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, pulse is 76 and regular. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Finally, I'll just gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything seems normal so far. Now, I’ll need a urine sample. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Please try to collect a midstream sample for the most accurate results. There's a restroom just down the hall. Do you need any assistance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thank you. I believe I can manage. A midstream sample… yes, I recall the instructions from previous visits. Just down the hall, you say? Very good. I shall endeavor to follow your directions precisely. I trust a brief respite will suffice for this…collection process. Thank you for your guidance. I shall return presently.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. I’ll be right here when you get back.
