DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Fazzina. Welcome. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Ah… my wife and I… we are thinking… maybe a baby? She is… how you say… wanting. But we are… old. I am seventy, you know. Maybe need to check… everything is okay? It's been… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta. That's perfectly reasonable to want to check things out. It's good you're thinking proactively. So, your wife is pregnant or you are attempting to get pregnant?
PATIENT: No, no pregnant yet. We… trying. But… slow trying. That’s why we come. To see if… possible. I don’t know… is it… safe, at my age? And… her age too, she is… almost seventy as well. We are… healthy, mostly. But… old bones, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It’s good you’re both relatively healthy. It is less common at your ages, certainly, and there are some increased risks we’d want to discuss. Before we get into that, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Doctor… I forget so much these days! I have… a little trouble with my knees, like I said. And sometimes my back. But… serious? No, no serious. I take… a little pill for the blood… pressure, maybe? I think so. The doctor… the other doctor… gave it to me a long time ago. My wife… she remembers more. She goes to the doctor more often. But I feel… okay. Mostly okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you've been managed for high blood pressure at some point. Do you remember the name of the medication, or perhaps what it looks like?
PATIENT: No, no name. Small… white… maybe? Round, I think. I take it every… morning, with the water. I really don’t remember. My wife… she will know. She keeps all the pills. I just… swallow them. It's been so long. I am sorry. Old age… it does things to the memory, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's very common. We can certainly look through your wife’s medications when she's here. To get a better picture, let’s talk about your past medical history a bit more broadly. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… not that I remember. Maybe… when I was a little boy? A fever, perhaps? But… nothing serious. Nothing… recent. I broke my arm once, a long time ago. Playing football. But… that was in Somalia. A different life, you know? I haven’t been sick… properly sick… in… many years. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Carlotta, just to get a complete picture. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my… wisdom teeth out, many years ago. That’s all I can remember. A small surgery, nothing big. And… maybe a little thing on my… eye? A small spot. But very, very long ago. That was… before I came to this country. Before my wife. Mostly, I have been lucky. No big problems. I hope.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… I had many brothers and sisters, in Somalia. But… most are gone now. Old age, mostly. And… accidents. It’s a sad story. My wife… she has a sister, still living. She is in… Florida, I think. We don’t see her often. But… nobody in my family… big problems with… health? Not that I remember. Everybody just… got old. It’s a long time ago. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. Bad for the health, you know? My wife… she doesn't smoke either. We both… take care of ourselves. Mostly. We eat… healthy food. Not too much sugar. And… we walk. Not every day, but… when the weather is good. Old people need to move! Keep the bones strong.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. Now, before we proceed, are you allergic to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Nothing big. Sometimes… a little itchy… from the grass? But nothing serious. My wife… she is allergic to… cats! But I… no. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. At least… not that I remember. This memory… it’s a problem, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure pill we discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just the… white pill. And… sometimes a little something for my knees. When they hurt very bad. But it’s… over the counter. You can buy it at the store. For the pain. My wife buys it for me. I don’t remember the name. It's… yellow, maybe? A small tablet. Nothing special. Old bones, you know? They need help sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Thank you for that information. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. I just… hope it’s not too much trouble. Old bones, you know… they don’t bend so easy anymore. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slowly and gently. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit here for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Take your time. No rush. Old bones, you know… need a moment to settle.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and potential history of hypertension. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? My lungs… they feel okay. Sometimes a little… tight, when it’s cold. But mostly okay. I used to be a strong runner, you know. Long, long ago.
DOCTOR: Your heart rhythm is slightly irregular, which is common at your age. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds, but no wheezing or crackles at the moment. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear. Throat is a little dry, but no signs of infection. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? My knees… they sometimes ache. Old age, you know. It's not easy. Do what you need to do, though. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is normal for your age. Now, let’s quickly check your feet. Some mild swelling in your ankles and feet. Sensation appears intact, but a little reduced in your toes. Now, I’m going to quickly palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses detected. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Carlotta.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was… not so bad. Old age… it makes everything a little difficult, you know. But I trust you. What did you find? Is it… bad? Is it possible… to have a baby, at our age?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Let's go over everything. Overall, you're in reasonably good health for your age. We found some expected changes – slightly elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, a little swelling in your ankles. Your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, which is common. The exam didn’t reveal any major concerns. Regarding your question about having a baby… it's certainly possible, but it’s a high-risk situation. At your age, the risks of complications during pregnancy – for both your wife and the potential baby – are significantly elevated. We'd need to do some further testing to assess your overall health and ensure you’re both fit enough to proceed. We'd also need to consult with a specialist in high-risk obstetrics. Before we proceed with any testing, I want to discuss the potential risks in detail so you and your wife can make an informed decision. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Risks… you said risks. What kind of risks? For my wife… and for the baby? We… we have waited a long time. A very long time. We just want… a little happiness. But not… if it causes too much trouble. What are the chances… of everything going okay?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It's completely natural to want happiness, and I commend you and your wife for considering this carefully. The risks are multifaceted. For your wife, the risks include a higher likelihood of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia , and complications during delivery. There's also an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. For the baby, there's a higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities, premature birth, and low birth weight. The baby might also require more intensive medical care after birth. As for the chances of everything going okay... it's difficult to give a precise number. It depends on your wife’s overall health and the results of the testing we would need to do. It’s important to be realistic about the challenges. We'd need to carefully weigh the potential benefits against the risks. Would you like me to outline the testing we could do to assess your wife’s suitability for pregnancy?
PATIENT: Testing… more testing. It sounds… complicated. And… worrying. But… if it helps, we should do it. My wife… she will want to know. She is the strong one. She will make the decision. But… can you explain the testing? What does it involve? And… how long will it take? Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me outline the testing. It involves a few different steps. First, we'd need a comprehensive blood workup for your wife to assess her overall health, including her blood sugar levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. We’d also check for any underlying infections. Second, we'd need an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy, determine the gestational age, and assess the baby's development. Third, we’d recommend genetic counseling and testing to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities. This might involve a chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, which are procedures to collect samples of the placenta or amniotic fluid. These procedures do carry a small risk of miscarriage, which is something we would discuss in detail. Finally, we'd need regular monitoring throughout the pregnancy to assess your wife’s health and the baby's development. This would involve frequent checkups, ultrasounds, and other tests as needed. The testing process can take several weeks to complete. As for pain, the blood workup and ultrasounds are painless. The CVS and amniocentesis do involve some discomfort, but we would take steps to minimize it. We'd also have a specialist present during these procedures. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: CVS… amniocentesis… these sound… serious. And… a risk of miscarriage. That’s… worrying. My wife… she wouldn’t want to risk the baby. But… she wants a baby so much. It’s a difficult decision. Perhaps… we should talk to her first. Let her decide if she wants to go through with it. Can you… write down all this information? So she can read it carefully? And… can you recommend a specialist in high-risk obstetrics? Someone she can talk to? Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I completely understand. It is a lot to take in, and it’s wise to discuss it thoroughly with your wife. Here’s the information about the testing process and the names and contact details of a few specialists in high-risk obstetrics. I recommend scheduling a consultation with one of them to discuss your options and address any concerns you both may have. I’m glad I could be of assistance. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the specialist’s recommendations and make a decision together. For now, take your time and focus on having a meaningful conversation with your wife. This is a decision you both need to make together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. We will talk… and decide. It’s a big decision. A very big decision. We appreciate your help. Thank you again, Doctor.
