DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Carla. Well, it’s this itchiness, you see? It’s been bothering me for a little while now, all over. It’s not… terrible, but it’s just constant. Really annoying, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Constant itchiness, you say. And you mentioned it’s all over… could you be a bit more specific about where exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It's mostly on my arms and legs, I think. And my back… it’s hard to reach, so I have to get my daughter to help sometimes. Not my face, thankfully. And it doesn’t really seem to be… worse anywhere in particular, just… everywhere. It’s just a general itch, you know? Not like a bug bite or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been going on, Carla?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It’s been… a few weeks, I’d say? Maybe a month? It started slowly, just a little tickle here and there, and then it got… more noticeable. I didn't think much of it at first, just figured it was the dry air, but it hasn't gone away. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: A month of persistent itchiness… Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: You know, that’s funny you ask. When I'm busy, I don’t even notice it sometimes! Like when I'm gardening, or talking with friends. But when I’m trying to relax, or before bed… that’s when it really gets to me. Hot showers seem to help for a little while, but then it comes back. I haven't really tried anything else, to be honest. I just thought it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: It seems to be exacerbated by periods of relaxation, and temporarily relieved by hot showers. And you haven’t noticed any rash, bumps, or changes in your skin at all?
PATIENT: No, no rash or bumps. Just… itchy skin. My skin feels a little dry, maybe, but it doesn’t look that bad. My daughter keeps telling me I need to moisturize more, but I’ve always had dry skin, and I've never had this problem before. It's just… different this time. It’s more of an internal itch, if that makes sense? Not just on the surface.
DOCTOR: An internal itch… that’s a useful description. Now, Carla, have you started any new medications recently?
PATIENT: No, no new medications. I haven’t changed anything about my routine, really. Same pills for my blood pressure, that’s it. I've been taking those for years. And nothing over the counter, not even vitamins. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t really like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of, besides your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of a scare with my gallbladder years ago, but they took it out, and I’ve been fine ever since. And my arthritis is acting up a little lately, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. Nothing else… I don’t think so. I used to have really bad allergies when I was younger, but those seem to have faded with time. Oh! And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered fully. Does that count?
DOCTOR: History of gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a previous bout of pneumonia. And you said your allergies have subsided. Have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. I've always been pretty careful, tried to avoid anything major if I could. I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I prefer to stay out of them if at all possible. It always feels like a waste of time, waiting around and worrying. But, you know, sometimes you just have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history, Carla?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains when she got older, arthritis mostly. And my father had high blood pressure, like me. I think my grandmother had some kind of skin condition, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago, and nobody really talked about those things much back then. Mostly just aches and pains, if I remember correctly. Nothing really serious.
DOCTOR: Family history of arthritis and hypertension. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven't had a drink in… well, not since my divorce, and that was a long time ago. And definitely no drugs. I'm a church lady, Doctor! I spend my time gardening, volunteering, and spending time with my grandchildren. That's about it. A pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Very good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter always worries about that, though. She's very careful about what I eat when I visit her, just in case. But, no, I don’t have any known allergies. I’m pretty lucky that way, I suppose. Is that everything, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Carla, that seems to be everything. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a closer look at your skin. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I have a bit of a sensitive back, you see. But, yes, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and we’ll begin. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I'm observing your skin now, Carla. I don't note any visible rash, hives, or lesions. Your skin appears slightly dry, as you mentioned, but there’s no evidence of acute inflammation. Skin turgor is slightly diminished, consistent with mild dehydration. No palpable nodules or masses. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Your skin is dry, but there are no acute findings to explain the itchiness.
PATIENT: Hmm. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? So, you don’t see anything wrong? It’s just… dry skin? I feel like it’s more than that, Doctor. It’s just a nagging itch. What do you think it could be, then? Do we need to do any tests? I don’t want to bother you if it’s nothing, but it’s really been bothering me.
DOCTOR: It's true that the physical exam is not revealing an obvious cause, Carla. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s “nothing.” Given the persistence of the itchiness and the lack of visible skin changes, several possibilities exist. It could be a mild allergic reaction to something you're not aware of, a form of eczema, or even a systemic issue like mild kidney disease or thyroid dysfunction. It could even be a side effect of your blood pressure medication, although that's less common. To investigate further, I recommend a few basic blood tests. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. These will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. We may also consider a skin biopsy if the itchiness persists after the blood tests. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… complicated. Blood tests, a skin biopsy… I was hoping it would be something simple. But, if that's what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, I suppose so. I just want to feel better. Can you explain a little more about what each test does? And… will they be painful? I’m not very good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carla. I understand your apprehension. Let me explain. The complete blood count, or CBC, will assess your overall blood health, checking for any signs of infection or inflammation. The comprehensive metabolic panel, or CMP, evaluates your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolyte balance. These are routine tests, and generally very well-tolerated. The thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH, measures the level of thyroid hormone in your blood; an imbalance can sometimes cause itching. As for the blood draw itself, it will involve a small needle prick to extract a small sample of blood. It's generally quick, and most people experience only a mild, brief discomfort. The phlebotomist, the person drawing the blood, is very skilled, and will minimize any discomfort. As for the skin biopsy, that involves taking a small sample of your skin to examine under a microscope. It will require a small local anesthetic to numb the area, so you shouldn’t feel any pain during the procedure. It may leave a small, superficial wound that will require a bandage, but it should heal within a week or two. Does that explanation alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Well, that does sound a little less scary when you explain it like that. A small prick… I can probably handle a small prick. And a little bit of numbness for the skin biopsy… alright. Yes, I think I can do that. When can we get these tests done? And… will I need to fast beforehand? I always forget those things, and then I have to reschedule. It’s just a lot to remember when you get older.
DOCTOR: I understand entirely, Carla. We can get the blood tests done right here in the clinic laboratory this morning. You will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except for water. That’s important for accurate results. As for the skin biopsy, we can schedule that for later this week, perhaps on Thursday?
PATIENT: Okay, Thursday sounds good. Eight hours of fasting… I suppose I can manage that. I’ll have to skip breakfast, and maybe lunch too. But that’s alright. As long as we’re getting closer to figuring out what’s going on. And… will I get the results right away? Or will it take a while? I don’t like waiting, Doctor. It makes me worry even more.
DOCTOR: The blood tests usually take 24 to 48 hours to process, Carla. The skin biopsy will take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so, as it needs to be sent to the pathology lab for analysis. I understand your anxiety about waiting, and I assure you, we’ll expedite the process as much as possible. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day to help soothe your skin. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to wear loose-fitting clothing. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. A fragrance-free moisturizer… loose-fitting clothes… I can do that. I just hope we figure out what’s going on soon. I really do. It’s just… nice to finally be doing something about it. Now, let's get those blood tests done. Is there anything else I need to do before we head to the lab?
DOCTOR: No, nothing at all, Carla. Just head to the lab, and the phlebotomist will take care of everything. The nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork. I’ll see you on Thursday for your follow-up appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Let’s get you started.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Carla. Have a good day.
