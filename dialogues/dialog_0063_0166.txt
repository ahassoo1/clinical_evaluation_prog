DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kinjerski. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s this numbness in my leg, actually. It’s been… persistent, and I wanted to get it checked out, just to be sure everything is alright. It started a few weeks ago, I believe around July 15th, and hasn’t really gone away completely.
DOCTOR: July 15th… right. And where exactly is this numbness located?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my left leg, Doctor. It begins, I’d say, right at the top of my shin, and extends down to my foot, primarily on the outside edge. Sometimes it feels like… pins and needles, other times just a sort of dull ache and lack of feeling. It's not constant, but it’s frequent enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Frequent, you say. And does anything specific seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… I've noticed it tends to be worse after I've been on my feet for a long time. I do a lot of work with motion capture, so I'm standing and moving quite a bit for hours at a time. Also, if I cross my legs for too long, it seems to aggravate it. I don't recall any specific injury that might have caused it, though. I was working on a project for a new video game on July 10th and was in a somewhat awkward position for a while, but I didn't feel anything at the time.
DOCTOR: Motion capture… awkward positions… yes, yes. And have you experienced any weakness in that leg, any difficulty walking, or problems with balance?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no weakness or trouble with balance. Walking is… normal, I suppose. It doesn’t feel different. It’s purely a sensation thing, this numbness. And it hasn’t been spreading, if that makes sense. It’s stayed consistently in that left leg, from shin to foot. It doesn't affect my right leg at all.
DOCTOR: "Purely a sensation thing," you say. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No pain elsewhere, no tingling in my hands, no issues with my back. My appetite is normal, sleep is normal… Honestly, it’s just this leg. It hasn’t interfered with my work too badly, but it’s definitely distracting, and I’d prefer to get it sorted out. I did notice my left foot felt a bit colder than usual a couple of times, but that could just be the air conditioning in the studio, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes appear normal. Sensory function…slightly diminished on the lateral aspect of the left foot, as you've described. No obvious signs of muscle wasting. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes, and I don't have any family history of it that I'm aware of. I generally eat a pretty healthy diet, and I try to stay active when I’m not working. Is something concerning you?
DOCTOR: It's…unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule a few things out. Given the nature of your work and the location of the symptoms, it could be a nerve impingement. It's often caused by prolonged pressure or awkward positioning. We can order a basic blood panel to check your glucose levels and rule out other possibilities. And I think an MRI of the left leg would be prudent.
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. An MRI and blood work seem like good steps to take. I’d certainly prefer to know what’s going on, and ruling things out makes sense. Is the MRI something I can schedule here at the clinic? And will the blood work require fasting beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can schedule the MRI here. The radiology department is booked, so the soonest available appointment is August 9th. As for the blood work, yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. We will give you a form to take to the lab. Here. Take this to the lab on the morning of August 9th, before your MRI. Once the results are in, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. August 9th works fine. I’ll make sure to fast. No, I don’t believe I have any other questions at the moment. You’ve explained everything clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and figure out a plan.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get the tests done, and we’ll see what they reveal. If the numbness worsens significantly before then, or if you develop any weakness, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you on August 9th. You may get dressed now. Try to avoid prolonged pressure on that leg. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. I’ll be sure to avoid putting pressure on it. I appreciate your advice. Goodbye. .
