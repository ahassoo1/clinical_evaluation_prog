DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sachar, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’m here about getting certified for home health care, if I qualify. I was told this is where I need to start. It’s for my mother, you see. She’s… not doing very well lately.
DOCTOR: Home health, right. Okay. And… how old is your mother?
PATIENT: She turned 82 just last month, on the 17th of July. She’s always been a strong woman, but… lately she’s needing a lot more help than I can give her on my own. It’s become… quite a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, 82. And what specifically is she needing help with?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things, Doctor. Mostly with bathing and getting dressed. She gets very unsteady on her feet, so I worry about her falling. And she’s… well, she’s confused sometimes. Not all the time, but enough that I can’t leave her alone for long. Cooking is getting difficult for her too, she forgets things on the stove. It’s just… a lot. I work full-time, so it’s hard to be everywhere at once.
DOCTOR: “Confused,” you say. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. She’ll ask the same questions over and over, even if I just told her. Or she’ll think I’m someone else, sometimes. Like she’ll call me her sister, who passed away years ago. And she gets… agitated easily, especially in the evenings. It’s not constant, but it’s worrying. She knows me most of the time, but there are moments... moments where she doesn’t. I just want to make sure she's safe and comfortable, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anyone formally diagnosed her with anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not yet. We haven’t… we haven’t gone to a specialist yet. Honestly, it’s been hard getting her to agree to go. She’s very proud, you see. She doesn’t like people thinking she’s… failing. I was hoping, if she did qualify for home health, maybe someone could assess her properly at home. I wasn’t sure if that was possible, or if we had to go through a formal diagnosis first. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sachar, I'm a family doctor, not a miracle worker. I can do a basic assessment, but without any history or testing, it's hard to say anything definitively. We'll need to rule out some things. Has she had any falls recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no serious falls. She’s stumbled a few times, but I’ve been right there to catch her each time. It’s why I’m so worried, you know? It feels like it's just a matter of time before she really goes down. She gets dizzy sometimes too, just standing up. And her memory… it’s gotten worse over the past six months, definitely. I’m just scared to leave her alone, even for a little while. Would a home health aide be able to help with… with just keeping an eye on her, even if we don't know exactly what’s going on yet?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just do a quick exam. I need to check her vitals, listen to her heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological check. It won’t be extensive, but it’s a start. And frankly, it’ll help me decide if this is even something I can assist with. Do you have a list of her medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Just a moment… Here you go. It’s a bit messy, I apologize. She takes a few different things for her blood pressure and… and something for her arthritis. And she takes a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended that last year. Is this enough, or do you need more information? I’m used to just bringing her to appointments, I haven’t had to manage everything myself before.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with her vitals. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… Now, can you tell me about any past medical issues?
PATIENT: Certainly. She had her gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, and she was diagnosed with high blood pressure maybe ten years ago, but it’s mostly been under control with medication. She also had a hysterectomy when she was in her early forties. And… oh, she broke her wrist a few years back, when she tripped in the garden. Other than that, she’s always been pretty healthy, honestly. She used to be so active, always gardening and going to church… It’s just been downhill lately, so quickly. I just… I’m worried about her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to her heart and lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… within normal limits. Now, I'm going to do a very basic memory test. Can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Yes, I can. Please, go ahead. I hope I can remember them! It’s been a bit… difficult, lately, for me to recall things myself, so don’t be surprised if I struggle. I do my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… penny. I think that’s right. Oh! And I think I remembered them in the right order. Did I do okay?
DOCTOR: Okay. And now I'm going to ask you the date. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… It’s… August… the 2nd? Yes, I think it’s the 2nd of August. 2025, right? I’m so sorry, Doctor. I feel like I’m failing this test! I usually know these things.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sachar, this isn’t a formal assessment. It’s just a quick check to get a baseline. Based on this brief exam and your description, your mother is showing signs of cognitive decline. This could be a number of things. I can refer you to a neurologist for a full evaluation, but frankly, home health alone isn't going to solve this. She needs proper diagnosis and management. I'll write you a referral. And you really should encourage her to see a specialist as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I was hoping… I was hoping home health could at least help keep her safe while we figured things out. But you’re right, it's not fair to expect that. A neurologist… okay. Do you have any recommendations? And… is it going to be a long process? I just worry about her getting scared, you know? She doesn't like doctors much as it is.
DOCTOR: Look, I can give you a list of neurologists in the area. The wait times can be… lengthy. As for her anxiety, that’s something you’ll have to manage. Honestly, Ms. Sachar, I’m a family doctor. I can’t hold her hand through this. I’ll print the referral and a list of specialists. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you… for your time. I’ll make an appointment for her, then. Hopefully, they can see her soon. I appreciate you being honest with me, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. Have a good day, Doctor Pehrson.
