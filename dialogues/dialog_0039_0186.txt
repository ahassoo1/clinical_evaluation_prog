DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. I’m here for… a physical. For a team tryout. I need to make sure I'm okay to, you know, go all out. It’s for… well, it doesn’t really matter what it’s for, does it? Just need to pass the check-up.
DOCTOR: Not at all, no need to share if you're not comfortable. A physical is a good idea before starting any new activity. Okay, so you’re here for a pre-participation physical. That’s great. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. I guess I'm okay. I mean, I haven't been to a doctor in… a while. I mostly just try to stay active, you know? Do a lot of walking. And… lifting. Things like that. No big problems, really. I don't get sick often. I think. It’s hard to remember, honestly. Do you need me to list everything? I don’t even know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry about listing everything right away. It is hard to remember details sometimes. Let’s start with the basics. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… not that I remember. Surgeries… hmm. When I was a kid, I had my tonsils out. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a… well, never mind. It was a long time ago. Nothing since then, I think. I really don’t remember anything else. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, thank you. Tonsils out and a broken arm – good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well. My parents are… gone now. Both of them. I have a sister, but we don’t talk much. She lives… far away. Health-wise? They both… lived long lives, I guess. My father had some problems with his heart, towards the end. My mother… she just got old, you know? Nothing really specific I can tell you. They weren’t big on doctors, either. Does that help? I’m not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little bit of background. Heart problems in your father - that's good to be aware of. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I haven't had any reactions to anything, ever. I don’t even get bug bites very often. Seriously. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve tried all sorts of things, just to be sure. I know it sounds weird, but… I really don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! No allergies is always a plus. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Never have been, really. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Just… try to tough it out, you know? I’ll take something for a headache if it’s really bad, but that’s about it. Just… whatever you get at the store. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No regular medications. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, is there anything you are particularly concerned about?
PATIENT: Hm. Concerned about…? Not really. I mean, I wouldn't be here if I was really concerned, right? I just… want to make sure I’m good to go. I get a little… winded sometimes, when I push myself too hard. But that’s probably just getting old. It’s not a big deal. I’ve always been able to push through it. I just... don’t want to, you know, collapse or something during the tryout. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Getting winded with exertion is good to know, and we’ll definitely check that out. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Just get it over with, please. I’ve got things to do. Just… hurry, if you could? I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick as possible, Mr. Kingan. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little bit distant. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. That's a little elevated. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your arm for me. Reflexes are… a little diminished. And finally, let's take a quick look at your throat… say "Ahhh."
PATIENT: Ahhh… Diminished reflexes? What does that mean? Is that bad? And elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t sound good. I don’t usually go to the doctor, so I don’t know what’s normal and what’s not. Is this going to stop me from trying out? Just tell me straight, Doc. I don't have time for a lot of explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kingan. Diminished reflexes can happen as we get older, or it can sometimes indicate a nerve issue. It’s not necessarily a cause for alarm right now, but it’s something we should monitor. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could be due to stress, or it could be something we need to address with lifestyle changes, or potentially medication. It doesn’t automatically mean you can’t try out, but I do want to run a few tests – just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Would you be okay with a simple blood test and an EKG to check your heart rhythm?
PATIENT: Tests… ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But… how long will that take? And will it cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance, remember? I told the receptionist. This tryout is important to me, but I can’t afford a fortune just to find out I’m too old to do it. Just tell me the truth, Doc. Is this a waste of time?
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Mr. Kingan. I’ll be as efficient as possible. The blood test and EKG shouldn’t take more than an hour or so, including waiting time. As for the cost… let me see what the lab and EKG fees are. The blood test will be around $85, and the EKG is $120. I can also check with the clinic's financial assistance program to see if we can offer you any discounts, given your lack of insurance. It’s not a waste of time. We need to rule out any potential issues before you exert yourself during the tryout. Knowing what’s going on will help you make an informed decision, and it will help me advise you safely. And honestly, you seem reasonably fit, despite some minor findings. Let’s just get a baseline so we’re both comfortable. Does that sound fair?
PATIENT: $205… okay. Fine. Just… let’s get it done. The sooner I know, the sooner I can either start training, or… forget about it. Just… where do I go for the blood test and EKG? And how long will it take to get the results? I really don’t have a lot of free time. Just… tell me exactly what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Here's the requisition form for the blood test and the order for the EKG. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They're expecting you. You don't need an appointment. The EKG technician is in room 205. The results should be back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my assistant call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s everything. Just… call me when you have the results. My number is… Okay. Thanks, Doc. I guess I’ll go do these tests now.
