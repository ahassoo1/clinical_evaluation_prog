DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac. I am here because I am hoping to move into a senior living facility. They requested I get a check-up first, to make sure I am… suitable, I suppose you could say. They want to be certain I don’t have any needs they can’t handle.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of both you and the facility. A pre-admission check-up is a good idea. So, just to confirm, you're here for a general health assessment to facilitate admission to a senior living facility. Is there anything specific you're concerned about, or any particular problems you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. I feel quite well for my age, truthfully. I do bake a good deal – I own a small bakery, you see – and that keeps me moving. But my hands… well, they aren’t as steady as they once were. It doesn’t stop me, mind you, but it requires a bit more concentration these days. And sometimes, I forget where I put my glasses. But that happens to everyone, I suspect. Is that the sort of thing you need to know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely is, Mr. Tkac. Any changes in your physical abilities or memory are important to note. Baking is wonderful! Keeps you active, as you say. Let’s talk a bit more about these hand tremors. When did you first notice them?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. It was… let me think. Probably about three years ago now. At first, it was very slight. I just chalked it up to getting older, honestly. I used to be able to decorate cakes with such precision, you wouldn't believe it. Now, sometimes the frosting… well, it doesn’t go exactly where I intend it to. It doesn’t happen with every batch, but often enough that I’ve had to simplify some of the designs. It’s a nuisance, mostly. It hasn't gotten dramatically worse, thankfully. Still able to bake a good loaf of bread, at least.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that it hasn’t dramatically worsened. And it's helpful to know it’s been gradual. Are the tremors present when you're not baking?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me consider… Yes, they are. Though much less noticeable, naturally. When I’m simply reading or holding a cup of coffee, they're there, but very slight. It’s when I’m doing something precise with my hands, like piping frosting or kneading dough, that they become more pronounced. Sometimes, if I’m nervous or tired, they seem a little worse even then. Do you need to know about… medication? I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, thank you. And yes, please tell me about your blood pressure medication. What's the name of it and how much do you take?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s called Lisinopril, I believe. And I take 20 milligrams every morning, with my breakfast. I’ve been on it for… oh, about five years now, I suppose. My regular doctor, Dr. Hayes, prescribed it. He monitors it regularly, and says it’s keeping things stable. I haven't had any problems with it, no side effects or anything. Though, I do sometimes forget if I’ve already taken it, so I keep a little chart by the coffee maker to remind me.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s good that you’re monitoring that and haven’t had any issues. And a chart is a very practical solution. You mentioned some forgetfulness, aside from the medication. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not… serious, mind you. It’s mostly just little things. I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went in there, or I'll have trouble remembering the name of an actor in a movie I just saw. Things like that. And sometimes, as I mentioned, I misplace my glasses. I usually find them eventually, but it can be frustrating for a moment. It hasn’t been getting worse lately, thankfully. My daughter worries about it, of course, but she worries about everything. She’s a good girl, but… protective. I wouldn’t say it interferes with my daily life, not really. I still manage the bakery just fine, and I can still follow a recipe without trouble.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like relatively normal age-related changes, especially given your age, but it’s good to document these things. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing of that sort. I’ve been very fortunate, truthfully. Dr. Hayes always tells me I have the heart of a young man – though I suspect that’s just his way of being polite. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but it healed perfectly. And I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties, but that was a long time ago. Otherwise, I've been quite healthy, all things considered. I've always tried to eat a good diet – lots of fruits and vegetables – and I get plenty of exercise, what with running the bakery.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. A history of good health is a very good sign. And no surgeries other than the appendectomy?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Only the appendix. I avoided doctors as much as possible when I was younger, I’ll admit. Didn't like needles. My wife, God rest her soul, was the one who always insisted on regular check-ups. She was a practical woman. I suppose I should be more diligent now, though. Especially with considering this move.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable, Mr. Tkac. It's good you're taking the step now. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Let me see. My mother lived to be 88, and she was quite healthy for most of her life. She did develop some arthritis in her later years, but nothing major. My father passed away when he was in his seventies, from a heart attack, I believe. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, like me, and she took medication for it. Otherwise, I don't recall any serious illnesses in the family. No history of dementia or Alzheimer's, thankfully. My Lakota side, we tended to be a hardy people, living close to the land. It’s difficult to say, truthfully. We didn't talk much about medical history back then. It wasn’t something we focused on.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tkak. That’s perfectly alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. My wife didn’t care for it much, and I always respected her wishes. Besides, I need a clear head for baking! Can’t be measuring ingredients if you've had too much to drink. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee, as I mentioned, but that’s my only vice. And I’m quite active socially, thankfully. I have a few close friends I see regularly, and my daughter and grandchildren visit often. Keeping busy helps keep me young, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. Staying active and having social connections is very important. Alright, one last quick question. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about everything. My wife used to tease me for having a cast-iron stomach. She said I could eat nails and not be bothered. I haven't had any trouble with bee stings or poison ivy, either. Truly, I'm a remarkably un-allergic person, it seems. Though, I do get a bit of a rash if I spend too much time in the sun. But that's just common sense, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful, Mr. Tkac. Thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. It shouldn’t take long. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Go right ahead. I'm used to check-ups, even if I didn’t always enjoy them. My wife would insist on them, you see. And truthfully, it’s reassuring to know everything is in order, especially with this move in mind. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Blood pressure is 138/76. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, non-distended, normal bowel sounds. I do notice a mild tremor in your hands, as you described, more prominent with outstretched arms. It’s not severe, but it is present. Overall, your exam is within normal limits for your age. The tremor is the only significant finding, and we’ll discuss that further.
PATIENT: I appreciate the thoroughness, Doctor. It’s good to hear everything else seems to be in order. That tremor… it’s a bit of a nuisance, truthfully, but it hasn't stopped me from baking yet. Do you think it will worsen over time? Is there anything that can be done about it? Perhaps something to help steady my hands?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Mr. Tkak. The tremor could be essential tremor, which is a common condition, particularly in older adults, and often worsens slowly over time. It isn't usually life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. It’s also possible it could be related to a medication side effect, though you’re only taking Lisinopril, which isn’t strongly associated with tremor. Given your age and overall health, I don’t believe it's necessary to start medication at this time, but we can certainly monitor it. To help manage it, I recommend occupational therapy. They can teach you strategies to adapt your baking techniques and tools to minimize the effects of the tremor. Also, ensuring you’re getting enough rest and managing any stress can be helpful. We could also consider a neurological consultation to rule out other potential causes and get a more definitive diagnosis. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Occupational therapy… adapting my techniques… that’s a good idea. I'm not keen on taking any more medication if I can avoid it, so that appeals to me. And a neurological consultation… well, if it will put my mind at ease, then yes, I suppose I'm willing. It’s just that… I’ve always been so independent. The idea of needing specialist help… it’s a bit unsettling. But if it will help me continue baking, and ensure I'm safe in this senior living facility, then I suppose I should do what's best. What would be involved with this neurological consultation? Would it be a lengthy process? And do you have a recommendation for a good neurologist?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Tkak. It's perfectly natural to want to maintain your independence. A neurological consultation typically involves a review of your medical history, a physical and neurological exam, and potentially some imaging studies, like an MRI, to rule out other causes of the tremor. It’s usually a single appointment, unless further testing is needed. I recommend Dr. Evelyn Reed. She's an excellent neurologist here in town, very thorough and compassionate. I’ll give you her contact information and a referral note. In the meantime, I’m happy to write a note for the senior living facility outlining your overall health status and mentioning the tremor. It doesn't sound like it will interfere with your ability to live independently. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. The information about Dr. Reed and the note for the facility… that’s very helpful, I appreciate it. You've been most thorough, and I feel much more at ease now. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and address them so thoughtfully. It’s good to know there are people like you still practicing medicine. I suppose I should schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed then. And I thank you again for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkak. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. My staff can assist you with scheduling an appointment with Dr. Reed if you’d like. I wish you all the best with your move to the senior living facility. I have a good feeling you'll be very happy there. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Tkac.
PATIENT: That is kind of you, Doctor. I appreciate that very much. I will let your staff know about the appointment with Dr. Reed. And you have a wonderful day as well, Doctor. Perhaps I will see you again sometime.
