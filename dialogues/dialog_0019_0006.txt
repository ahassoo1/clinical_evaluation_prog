DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Renzi. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I... I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me very much. It was not a lot of blood, but… enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood, that is concerning, and good on you for coming in to get it checked out. Hmm. Now, when you say coughing up blood... how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: It started… maybe three days ago? It has only happened three times. Each time it was with a cough… a normal cough, I think. Not a bad cough, but… there was blood. A little bit each time.
DOCTOR: Alright, three times in the last three days. And you said a “little bit” each time – can you describe how much?
PATIENT: It is… difficult to say. Not enough to fill a teaspoon, Doctor. Maybe… a few drops each time? It is mixed with the… with the stuff I cough up, you see? Not bright red, but… darker. Like old pennies, perhaps. I am sorry if that is… unpleasant to hear.
DOCTOR: No, no, that's perfectly alright, Jeannemarie. Details are important, so thank you for being so specific. Darker blood… okay. And besides the blood, have you been feeling unwell at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. I feel… tired, perhaps. But I am always a little tired. It is hard to say if it is different. No fever, no chills. No pain in my chest… just the coughing, and the blood. I have been eating normally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or chest pain, and you’re eating normally… just some tiredness alongside the coughing and blood. Let’s talk a bit more about the cough itself. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up when you cough – besides the blood, of course?
PATIENT: It is not a dry cough, no. I bring up… phlegm. White, mostly. Sometimes it is clear. But usually white. Not much, though. Just a little bit with each cough. I do not feel… congested, if that makes sense. Not stuffed up. Just… a little phlegm.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little white phlegm with the cough. And you mentioned it started three days ago… Have you been around anyone who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I mostly stay at home. My husband… he passed away last year. I do not have much family nearby. I go to the market, and to the temple sometimes, but I haven't noticed anyone looking unwell. I am careful.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Jeannemarie. That must be difficult. Okay, so no recent illness around you that you’re aware of. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. When I was a little girl, I had a few colds, of course, like any child. But I have never been told I had asthma, or bronchitis, or any problems with my lungs. I did smoke for a time when I was younger, but I stopped many years ago. Perhaps… twenty years? Or more.
DOCTOR: Okay, you used to smoke, but quit over twenty years ago. That’s good to know. And no history of lung problems. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate, and just take a look at your overall health. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and again… alright. Your breathing sounds a little bit wheezy, especially on the left side. I'm also going to listen to your heart. Heart sounds normal. No murmurs. And I’ll just take your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 135/85. I’m also going to take a look at your throat… open wide and say “ah”. Throat looks clear. No obvious signs of infection. I'll also palpate your lymph nodes. No swelling there either. So, everything seems relatively normal, but the wheezing is something we need to investigate. Given your history of smoking and the coughing up of blood, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum test to check for infection or any other abnormalities. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and a… sputum test? Yes, Doctor, that sounds wise. If that is what you think is best, then I trust you. Is it… painful? The X-ray, I mean. And the sputum test… how does that work? I just want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: No, the X-ray isn’t painful at all. You'll just stand or sit in front of a machine and it takes a picture of your lungs. It's very quick. The sputum test… well, that involves coughing up a sample of phlegm into a cup. You've already been doing that! We just want a sample to send to the lab to look for anything unusual. The nurse will give you specific instructions on how to do it properly. It might take a few tries to get enough of a sample, but it shouldn't be unpleasant. We'll get those tests ordered right away, and we'll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid smoking and stay well-hydrated. If the coughing gets worse, or if you develop a fever, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very alright, Doctor. No smoking… I haven’t smoked in many years, but I will be sure to avoid it. And I will drink plenty of water. A few days… I can wait for the results. And I will come back if anything changes, or if I feel worse. Thank you, Doctor Renzi. You have put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I’m glad I could help, even if just a little. We'll get those tests done, and hopefully, it’s nothing serious. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you scheduled for the X-ray and give you instructions for the sputum test. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been very kind and thorough. I appreciate your patience and care. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns or questions. Take care of yourself, Jeannemarie.
