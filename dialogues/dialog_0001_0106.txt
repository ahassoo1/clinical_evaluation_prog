DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's this foot. Honestly, it's been a bother for weeks now. A sore, really. Not just any sore, mind you. It’s… well, it’s open. And it doesn’t seem to be getting better with those bandages the nurse at the senior center keeps putting on. I suppose that's why I’m here. It’s quite inconvenient, you know.
DOCTOR: Open, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, open. Like a…a hole, practically. Not a neat little scrape, Doctor. It’s… unsightly. And it smells. Honestly, I have to keep it covered, even at home, and I’m a very tidy woman. It's probably the sugar, I expect. My husband… well, he always said I had a sweet tooth. Though he’s gone now, of course. But that doesn’t change the fact that it’s open and not healing. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Right, right. An open sore… and you suspect it’s related to… sugar?
PATIENT: Well, everyone knows sugar is bad for you. My mother always said too much sweet would rot your teeth and make your wounds fester. I’ve had this… condition… for years, the one where I have to watch what I eat. The nurse called it something… diabetes, I think? But the point is, everything’s connected, isn't it? The sugar, the sore, the not healing. It’s just common sense. Honestly, these young people don't seem to understand basic health anymore.
DOCTOR: Diabetes… alright. And how long have you been, uh, officially diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years. Decades, probably. It was back when my Harold was still alive, and we were living on Majuro. The doctor there, a young man, fresh out of school, I think, told me I needed to watch my intake. Something about the sugar in the fruit, specifically. It all sounds very complicated. I remember him giving me a little chart, but I seem to have misplaced it somewhere over the years. It was a long time ago, and I’ve moved a few times since then. But it’s been a long time, that’s certain. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this sore… how long has this particular sore been open?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started as a little blister, I believe. About three weeks ago, maybe four? I was walking barefoot in the garden – a silly thing, I know, but the soil was so warm. Then it got red, and swollen, and then…well, it broke open. I thought it would heal with a bandage, but it just hasn’t. It’s been stubbornly refusing to get better. And it’s getting… well, it's not a pleasant sight, Doctor. Honestly, I’m starting to worry about it getting infected. That's why I finally came in. Do you have any of those powders that help things heal?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take a look at it. If you don't mind. Just need to get a better idea of what we're dealing with. Could you please hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, at my age, “hopping” is a bit of an exaggeration. But I suppose I can manage. Just be gentle, Doctor. These old bones aren’t as resilient as they used to be, you know. And try not to stare, if you please. It’s really quite unsightly, and I’ve always been a modest woman. There. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. It is…open. And there's some redness around the edges. Any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, there is. A bit of a sharp sting, actually. Not unbearable, but definitely noticeable. Honestly, you don’t need to poke at it so much, Doctor. It’s quite sensitive, you know. It feels…raw. Like someone scraped away a layer of skin. Is that good? Is that bad? I never understand what all this poking and prodding means. It just feels…unpleasant. And frankly, a little undignified, at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. And is there any discharge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A little bit. It’s…well, it’s not clear, if you know what I mean. A little yellowish, and it sometimes smells… unpleasant. I’ve been keeping it covered with bandages, of course, but the smell still seems to seep through sometimes. Honestly, I've tried everything. Different bandages, cleaning it with warm water, even some of that antiseptic spray my granddaughter recommended. Nothing seems to help. It's just… stubbornly refusing to get better. Is that a sign of infection, Doctor? I'm starting to get worried. It doesn’t feel like a normal sore, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well, the discharge isn’t ideal. And you’re right, it doesn’t look like a simple scrape. Alright, Ms. Cannington, it appears we’re dealing with a potentially infected ulcer, likely related to your diabetes. It’s not uncommon, unfortunately. We’ll need to run some tests to confirm the infection and determine the best course of treatment. I’m going to order a culture to identify what’s growing in the wound, and we’ll also check your blood sugar levels.
PATIENT: Oh, tests? More poking and prodding, I suppose? Honestly, I hate tests. And blood sugar? That means another needle, doesn’t it? I always get so faint. My Harold used to say I had a weak constitution. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I have to go to the hospital? Honestly, I’ve always dreaded hospitals. They’re so… sterile. And full of germs, ironically enough. Can’t we just put some ointment on it? A nice, strong ointment? Something that will make it go away quickly? I really don’t have the energy for all these tests.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Cannington, I understand your concerns. But we need to know what we're dealing with before we can just slap some ointment on it. This could get serious if left untreated. The culture will tell us what bacteria are present, and the blood sugar check will give us an idea of how well your diabetes is controlled. It’s a standard procedure, it won’t take long, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. No, it likely won't require a hospital stay at this point, but we have to be thorough. We’ll start with these tests, and then we can discuss treatment options. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think…Well, I always had a bit of a reaction to shellfish. A rash, mostly. And I seem to get a little itchy when I use that lavender soap my granddaughter sends. It’s probably just the scent, though. Honestly, I'm not terribly allergic to anything. More sensitive, perhaps. And I don’t tolerate needles very well, as I mentioned. I always get a little lightheaded. But shellfish and lavender, I suppose. And needles, of course. Is that all you need to know? Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit overwhelmed with all this talk of tests and bacteria and cultures.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shellfish, lavender, needle aversion. Noted. We’ll be careful. The nurse will draw the blood, and she’s very good at making people comfortable. Now, about your medications... are you currently taking anything, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medications. Let me see… Well, I take something for my blood pressure, a little white pill. The doctor prescribed it years ago, when Harold passed. It helps with the dizziness, mostly. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis, when my joints are particularly sore. But it doesn't really seem to help much anymore. And…oh, yes! I take a vitamin D supplement. My granddaughter said I wasn't getting enough sunlight. But that's about it, really. Nothing fancy. Just the blood pressure pill, the arthritis stuff, and the vitamin D. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand. They always make me feel so sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, vitamin D. Do you know the names of these medications, or the dosages?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not at all. I just have a little bag with all my pills in it, and I take them as the nurse tells me. I never bothered to memorize the names. Too much trouble, honestly. They all look the same to me – little colored pills. I can bring the bag to you, if you'd like. It's in my purse. But I don't know anything about dosages or names. My Harold always took care of all that. He was very organized. Now, where did I put that bag…
DOCTOR: Alright. Never mind. The nurse can sort that out later. Let’s just get the culture and blood work done, then we’ll talk about a basic wound care routine. I'll have the nurse come in to draw the blood, and she’ll explain everything. It's important that we keep this wound clean and dry. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: Oh… well… yes, actually. What if it doesn’t get better? What if it gets… worse? I’ve heard stories, you know. About people losing limbs. Is that going to happen to me? Honestly, that’s my biggest fear. And… will it be painful? The cleaning, the tests, everything? I’m just… a very sensitive woman.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Cannington, it’s unlikely to come to that. We’re catching this early. With proper care and monitoring, we can manage the infection and prevent complications. I understand your fear, but worrying won’t help. As for pain, the cleaning may be a little uncomfortable, but we can use a topical anesthetic to minimize any discomfort. I'll be sure to tell the nurse to be gentle. The important thing is, we’re addressing this now. Now, I really must get to my next patient. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. Just try to relax.
