DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my foot, you see. It’s been… bothering me. A sore, it is. A bad one. It won’t get better.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that isn’t healing. I see. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started small, maybe a little cut, I think. Now… it’s bigger. And it hurts when I walk. Especially when I put my weight on it. It’s red around the edges, too. I’ve been trying to keep it clean.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… maybe a month now? Could be a little longer. Time goes by so fast these days. I tried some cream, but it didn't help much. Just kept it covered.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so. And what kind of cream did you try, if you recall?
PATIENT: Just… the regular kind. You know, for cuts and scrapes. The one my wife used to get. A white jar, I think. I don't really remember the name. It didn’t do much, so I stopped using it. I mostly just try to stay off of it when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any other medical problems, like diabetes or anything that affects your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me… a long time ago… I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. I take pills for it, every day. And… sometimes my legs feel cold, you know? Not all the time, but sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know about the diabetes and the coldness in your legs. That's important information. Let’s take a look at your foot. Could you please remove your shoe and sock so I can examine it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's a little difficult, my hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. There we go. Be careful, now.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see the sore here, on the bottom of your foot near your toes. It appears to be about a centimeter in diameter, with some redness around the edges, and there's a little bit of drainage. It doesn’t look deeply infected right now, but with the diabetes, we need to be cautious. The skin around it feels warm to the touch. Do you have any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, you know? It feels… tender. Is it bad? Is it very bad? I worry about losing my foot, you see. My wife… she had trouble with her feet, too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Stoegbauer, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. It’s good we’re checking it out. Given your history of diabetes, we need to take this seriously. I'm not going to say it’s nothing, but it doesn’t appear to be a deep infection right now. However, people with diabetes can sometimes have trouble healing, and infections can spread quickly. I want to get a better idea of what's going on. I'm going to order a simple test to check for infection. We'll also check your blood sugar to make sure it's well-controlled. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… wise. Whatever you think is best. Checking the sugar sounds good. And if you think it’s necessary, go ahead. I just want it fixed, you know? So I can walk without pain. Is it a needle? I don’t like needles. But… if you say it’s important, I’ll be brave.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a small prick with a needle to draw a little bit of blood. We'll only need a tiny amount. I understand you don't like needles, and we'll try to be as quick and gentle as possible. While we’re waiting for the lab results, I want to make sure you’re taking good care of your foot. It's important to keep it clean and dry. Avoid putting a lot of pressure on it, and wear comfortable shoes. Do you currently use any special creams or bandages on it?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… I wash it with soap and water, like I said. And I try not to walk on it too much. My daughter gave me some socks, special ones, she said they help. They’re thick, and soft. I wear those. I haven’t used any special creams since the white jar didn't help. She told me not to put anything on it, really. Just keep it clean. Is that… right? Should I be doing something else?
DOCTOR: Your daughter is giving you good advice, keeping it clean and dry is a good start. Since we’re still waiting on the results, that’s fine for now. We’ll have a better idea once we see the lab results. To be on the safe side, and because of the diabetes, I'm going to refer you to a podiatrist - a foot specialist. They can take a closer look and help us manage this properly. They may want to do some X-rays or other tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A foot doctor? Is it… very bad? I just hoped it was something simple. My wife… she saw so many doctors. But if you think I should, Doctor, then I will. I trust your judgment. Yes, alright. A foot doctor. When would I see them?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily very bad, Mr. Stoegbauer, but it’s best to get an expert opinion, especially with diabetes. It's more about being cautious and making sure we’re doing everything we can to prevent complications. I can get a referral sent over today. They should be able to get you in within a week or so. Their office will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also give you a handout with information about foot care for people with diabetes. In the meantime, please continue keeping your foot clean and dry, and avoid putting too much pressure on it. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. A foot doctor, and keep it clean. Yes. Thank you. It’s good to know someone is looking after it. I worry about these things, you see. I just want to be able to walk again without pain. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Stoegbauer. And we'll do our best to get you there. I’ll have the nurse print out that foot care handout for you, and we'll get the referral sent over right away. If you experience any worsening pain, redness, swelling, or drainage from the sore, please contact the office immediately. Don’t hesitate to call, even if it seems minor. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you for your time, and for listening to my worries. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a good day, and take care of your foot. .
