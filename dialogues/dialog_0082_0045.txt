DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… well, my face gets red. Like, flushing. It happens sometimes, and I wanted to see if you know why. It’s a little… embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Flushing can be… unsettling. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, when did you first start noticing this flushing, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Around February, I think. Yes, February. After my wife… passed. It wasn't right away, but then it started. It’s not every day, but enough to worry me. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes… just because.
DOCTOR: February… and around the time of your wife’s passing. I see. That’s… significant, Mr. Withycombe. It can absolutely be a factor. Now, can you describe what the flushing feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… warm. My face gets hot, you know? And red. Very red. Not just my cheeks, but my neck too. And sometimes… my ears feel warm. Not painful, just… hot. It lasts… maybe five minutes, sometimes longer. It’s not a bad feeling, exactly. Just… noticeable. And I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Warm, red flushing of the face and neck, sometimes involving the ears. Lasting five minutes or longer. Alright. And does anything seem to trigger it, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I'm not sure. Like I said, sometimes after eating. Spicy food, maybe? But not always. And sometimes… when I’m thinking about things. Thinking about my wife, mostly. Or when I'm alone. That's about all I can think of. It doesn't happen when I’m with my friends, not that I see them much these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially triggered by spicy food and possibly emotional states – particularly when recalling memories or when alone. Let’s talk about other things, just to get a fuller picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms that happen at the same time as the flushing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart feels like it's beating faster. Not like a race, but… just a little quicker. And maybe… I feel a little shaky. Like my hands are trembling a little. It's not bad shaking, just… noticeable. I don’t know if it’s with every flush, but sometimes. Oh! And sometimes I sweat a little. Just on my face, when I'm hot. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very important, Mr. Withycombe. Rapid heartbeat, slight tremors, and facial sweating… these things can be clues. Now, let's go back a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure once, years ago. But the doctor said it was okay after I changed my diet. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Not since my wife… passed. I mostly just try to take care of myself, you know? Eat healthy, get some sleep. But this flushing… it worries me. It feels… different.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of high blood pressure that’s currently managed through diet. And you haven't seen a doctor regularly since your wife's passing. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. I used to take something for my stomach, years ago. But I stopped. Just try to eat carefully now. And… I drink a little tea sometimes. Chamomile, for sleeping. That's all. Nothing regular. Really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications or regular supplements, just occasional chamomile tea. And no allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife… she was the one with allergies. Dust and things. I was always okay. I used to tease her about it. But… no allergies for me. Not that I've ever noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, Mr. Withycombe, I'd like to do a quick physical examination. Just to check your heart rate, blood pressure, and listen to your lungs. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust you. It’s just… I’ve never had much trouble with… anything before. This flushing is new. So, if you think you need to check, go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. I appreciate that. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I’ll take a reading. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not alarmingly so, but something to monitor. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. I’m also going to check your pulse. Your pulse is a little fast, 95 beats per minute, but again, not dramatically so. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal. Okay, Mr. Withycombe, everything seems to be within normal limits physically, although your blood pressure and pulse are a bit elevated. Given your description of the flushing and the timing of its onset after your wife’s passing, combined with the occasional rapid heartbeat and the elevated readings, it's possible this is related to anxiety or a stress response. However, we need to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Anxiety? Stress? I… I haven't thought of it that way. I mean, I miss my wife. A lot. But I try to… keep busy. Is that what you mean? Is being sad… making me flush? I just thought it was something wrong with my body. What other causes could it be? Should I get some tests? I don’t mind, if you think it’s important. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel that way, Mr. Withycombe. Grief can manifest in many different physical ways, and flushing, rapid heartbeat, and increased blood pressure are all possibilities. However, it's important to rule out other conditions, just to be certain. There are a few possibilities we should consider. One is something called rosacea, a skin condition that can cause redness and flushing. Another is a condition called carcinoid syndrome, but that's less likely given your symptoms. And, less commonly, it could be related to a hormonal imbalance. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. A complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation, a thyroid panel to assess your thyroid function, and a hormone level check. We can also do a skin scraping to rule out rosacea. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, skin scraping… I don't mind. I just want to know what’s happening. And if it is grief… what can I do about that? I mean, I miss her terribly. And I don't want that to… make me sick. Is there anything I can take? Or… anything I can do? Even if it's just… thinking differently?
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking those questions, Mr. Withycombe. It’s important to address both the physical and emotional aspects of this. The blood tests will give us a clearer understanding of any underlying medical causes. Here's the order for the blood tests. You can go to [Local Lab Name] - they’re conveniently located at [Address]. They don’t require an appointment. Regarding grief… it’s a complex process, and there's no easy fix. However, there are resources that can help. I'm going to give you a referral to a grief counselor, Dr. Anya Sharma. She specializes in helping people cope with loss. Talking to someone can be incredibly beneficial. Here's the referral. She’s very good, and I think you'd find her helpful. Beyond that, remember to practice self-care. Eat healthy, get enough sleep, and try to stay connected with friends and family, even if it’s difficult. It's also okay to allow yourself to grieve, and to feel sad. We’ll get the results of the blood tests back in a few days, and then we can discuss them further and decide on a plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – particularly if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness – please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything. The tests, the counselor… thank you, Doctor. That… that gives me something to do. And something to hope for. I appreciate you listening. And not… making me feel like I’m crazy. I was worried it was just… me being weak, or something. But you said it could be grief. That… that makes sense. I’ll go get the tests done, and I’ll call Dr. Sharma. Thank you again, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. You are not weak, and it’s perfectly normal to experience physical symptoms after a loss. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Have a good day, and please keep me updated on how you're doing.
