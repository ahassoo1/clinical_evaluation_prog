DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning, Doctor. Right, well... it's my ear. Feels all... blocked, you know? Like something's stuffed in there. It's been... a while now, I suppose. Not painful, exactly, just… full.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A blocked feeling in your ear. And you said it's been going on for a while. Can you tell me roughly how long "a while" is?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a good question. Weeks, I think? Maybe months? It's hard to say, honestly. Things… blur a bit these days. It wasn’t sudden, that’s for sure. Just… gradually got worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over weeks to months. And has anything specific made it worse – like, getting water in your ear, flying, or a cold recently?
PATIENT: A cold… maybe? I’ve had a bit of a sniffle now and then, but nothing major. Water… I don’t recall. I do a bit of gardening, so perhaps? It’s… difficult to pinpoint, really. I try to avoid getting things in my ears, but… well, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Right, gardening. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No, not really. Maybe a bit… tired, generally? But I put that down to… well, everything. No dizziness, no pain, no discharge. Just the… blocked feeling. Honestly, it’s just annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, dizziness, or discharge. Just the fullness and a bit of general fatigue. Do you have any hearing loss with that ear, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I think I hear alright. My wife… well, my late wife used to say I didn't listen enough, but that was… different. No ringing, no. Maybe it's slightly muffled, but I figured that was just getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, possibly slight muffled hearing. Let’s take a quick look. I'm just going to use an otoscope to examine your ear canal. It won’t hurt, just let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Right, alright. Sounds… sensible. Go ahead, Doctor. Just be gentle, if you would. It's a bit sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay… I see a bit of cerumen – earwax – buildup in the canal. It looks impacted, meaning it’s quite firmly stuck. There’s also some mild redness of the ear canal, which could be from the irritation of the wax, or a minor inflammation. The eardrum itself looks intact, which is good. I don't see any obvious signs of infection right now.
PATIENT: Oh. Wax, you say? Well, that’s… something. I’ve always had a bit of trouble with that, I think. My wife used to try and clean them for me, but… never really got it all out. So, is it serious? Will I go deaf?
DOCTOR: No, you're not going to go deaf. Impacted earwax is quite common, and rarely causes permanent hearing loss. It can cause temporary muffled hearing, discomfort, and a feeling of fullness, which sounds like what you're experiencing. The redness could indicate some mild irritation from the wax, or possibly a slight inflammation, but it doesn’t seem severe at the moment. We can remove the wax. I have a couple of options. We can try earwax softening drops, and you can come back in a week or so if that doesn’t fully clear it. Or, we can do an irrigation – gently flushing the ear with water – to remove it today. What do you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Irrigation sounds… quicker. I don’t really want to come back if I don't have to. Drops… I’m terrible at remembering things, you see. I’d probably forget to use them. As long as it’s not… painful, I think the flushing sounds best.
DOCTOR: Okay, flushing it is. It shouldn't be painful, but you might feel some slight pressure. I'll use body-temperature water. I'm going to gently insert this syringe into your ear canal and flush it with water. Please let me know immediately if you feel any sharp pain, dizziness, or discomfort. We’ll stop right away. Do you have any allergies to any medications or cleaning solutions?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife… she always took care of all that. Just… be careful, alright? It's a bit sensitive, as I said. And… quickly, if you can?
DOCTOR: Okay, starting now. Just relax and breathe normally. You might hear some gurgling sounds. How does that feel?
PATIENT: A little… strange. Feels like pressure, a bit. Not painful, exactly. Just… odd. Is it supposed to feel like that?
DOCTOR: That’s normal – the pressure is from the water flushing the wax out. It should gradually ease. Okay, let's take a look. There… that looks much better. The ear canal is clear of most of the wax now. The eardrum still looks normal. How does that ear feel compared to before?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, that's... better! A lot less blocked, I think. It's still a bit… muffled, maybe, but definitely not as full. I can… hear you clearer, I think. Yes, definitely better.
DOCTOR: Good. That's a good sign. The muffled feeling might take a day or two to completely resolve as the remaining wax softens and comes out on its own. I'm going to give you a prescription for some earwax softening drops, just in case. Use them once a day for a week. And I'll provide some written instructions as well. If the muffled feeling doesn’t improve within a week, or if you experience any pain, discharge, or dizziness, please come back and see me. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very helpful. It’s good to have it sorted, finally.
DOCTOR: Alright, you’re very welcome, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m glad we could get that taken care of. Here are your written instructions and the prescription. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again. I will. Goodbye, Doctor.
