DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need “clearance.” Honestly, a waste of perfectly good time, but here I am. It’s a bit of vanity, I suppose. Getting a little… saggy, you know? Don't have time for this nonsense, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. You’re here for medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure, and your daughter encouraged you to come in for an evaluation beforehand. That’s very thoughtful of her, and a good idea, actually. To help me assess whether you're a good candidate, could you tell me a little more about what procedure you're considering?
PATIENT: It’s a face lift. Plain and simple. Though I doubt it’ll do much good at my age. Everything’s going south, you know? And don’t tell me about healthy living, I’ve lived a long life, thank you very much. I just want to know if I'm… strong enough, I guess, to go through with it. And quickly, if you don’t mind. I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s good to know you’re generally healthy, and I appreciate your directness. To determine if you're strong enough for the procedure, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes, years ago. Doctor put me on a little pill, I take it every morning. Nothing else, really. And I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. As for the rest, I feel fine. Always have. Don't bother with fancy tests, I tell you, just a waste of money. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you’re currently taking medication for high blood pressure, which is good. Do you know the name of that medication, and the dosage?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly, no. My daughter handles all that. She fills those little pill organizers for me. Says I’d forget my head if it wasn't attached. Something with an 'A' in it, I think? Amlodipine, maybe? She’s the one who keeps track of everything. Look, is this important? Can't we just look at my blood pressure and move on? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Orwin, but we can certainly focus on the essentials. Amlodipine is correct, and that's very good you're taking it regularly. Knowing the dosage helps, but we can proceed for now. To get a better understanding of your current health, would you mind if I took your blood pressure, pulse, and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don't expect miracles. I've lived a long life working with stone, you know. It takes its toll. And be quick about it. I have a fishing trip planned for tomorrow, and I need my rest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. We'll be as efficient as possible. Just relax, and I'll let you know what I find. Blood pressure is a bit elevated today, 140 over 85. It's not critically high, but it’s something we should be aware of. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Pulse is 72 and regular. Do you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. Never have. And no chest pain, thankfully. Dizziness… sometimes when I stand up too fast, but who doesn’t? I’m an old man, you know. Things go a little wonky sometimes. Honestly, I'm perfectly healthy for my age. All this fuss over a little sag, it’s ridiculous. Can we get this over with already? I’m starting to feel like I'm in a doctor's office, and I hate those.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. It's good to hear you haven't experienced any chest pain. Occasional dizziness when standing up can be common, especially at your age. We'll keep that in mind. Just to complete the picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Appendicitis when I was a boy. And a hernia repair, oh, maybe 30 years ago? That’s about it. Nothing major. I’ve always been a strong man, avoided the doctors as much as possible. They just poke and prod and tell you what you already know. Now, are we nearly done? I have things to do, you know. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And you’ve generally been healthy and avoided surgery for the most part. Finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the Amlodipine?
PATIENT: No, just the blood pressure pill. My daughter makes sure I take it. She’s a worrier, that one. Always fussing over me. She says I need to take care of myself, but honestly, I've lived a long life just fine without all these pills and poking and prodding. Can we please wrap this up? I’m starting to get impatient. I have a fishing trip to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for your patience and for answering my questions. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, it seems you are generally in good health for your age. However, your blood pressure is a little elevated today. Before we proceed with clearance for the facelift, I recommend a few things. First, it would be best to get a more accurate reading of your blood pressure over a few days. Your primary care physician can do this, or you could monitor it at home. Second, it’s important to ensure your blood pressure is well-controlled before undergoing any surgical procedure. I also recommend discussing this with your daughter and her primary care physician. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: Ugh. More doctors. Just what I needed. Fine, fine. I’ll ask my daughter to make an appointment with… whoever. But don’t expect me to go running to a specialist. I’ve lived a long life without them, and I’m not about to start now. Just tell me if I’m strong enough to go through with this thing or not. Yes or no? I don’t have time for maybes and shoulds. I have a fishing trip to prepare for, you know. And I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your impatience, and I appreciate your directness. However, I cannot definitively clear you for the facelift without more information about your blood pressure control. It's important to minimize any risks during the procedure. Given your current blood pressure reading, I would advise postponing the facelift until it's consistently well-controlled. It would be irresponsible of me to clear you without ensuring your safety. I can provide you with a referral to a primary care physician if you'd like, or you can continue seeing your current physician. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I strongly recommend prioritizing your health and well-being before proceeding. .
