DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Uh… well, I think it’s about the surgery? The weight loss surgery. Honestly, it feels a little… blurry how I got here, but my wife, she did a lot of the paperwork, and she said this was the next step. I think it's a check-up before they... do the surgery? Sorry, I’m not the best at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common to feel a little overwhelmed with all the details involved in a procedure like weight loss surgery. It sounds like you're here for a pre-operative evaluation. We’ll just go through some questions to make sure everything is in order before proceeding. Let’s start with a little bit about why you decided to pursue weight loss surgery. Could you tell me about that?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Why… hmm. It’s… hard to put into words. I guess… I’ve always struggled with my weight. It’s gotten harder to do things, you know? Like, just walking around is tiring. My wife worries about my health, and honestly, I worry too. It’s just… frustrating. I want to be able to… live a normal life, I guess. Play with my grandkids without getting winded. Things like that. It’s been a long time coming, I think. I just… want to feel better. Is that… enough of an answer?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good answer, Mr. Kochubey. And a very understandable one. It sounds like this decision is very important to you and your quality of life, and that's excellent. We're here to help you achieve that. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about how long you've been experiencing these difficulties with your weight and activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, man… a long time. I mean, since I was a kid, really. But it’s gotten worse in the last… ten years, maybe? Definitely worse after… after my time in Iraq. Not that it's from there, exactly, but… things changed after that. It’s just been steadily getting harder and harder. I used to be able to… well, I used to be more active, I guess. Now, even just climbing the stairs is a chore. I don’t really know how long exactly, though. Time gets away from me, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like this has been a long-term struggle, and changes after your time in Iraq may have contributed to the progression. We'll certainly keep that in mind. To help me understand your current health status better, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. I think my wife mentioned something about my blood pressure being a little high at one point? But I don't really go to the doctor much. Honestly, I try to avoid it when I can. I don't like feeling poked and prodded, you know? I don't have… like, diabetes or anything. I don’t think so. I’m not sure. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. My wife probably knows more than I do. Would it be okay if I… checked with her when I get home? I’m really bad at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. That’s perfectly alright. It’s often helpful to have a family member’s perspective. We can certainly note that you'll follow up with your wife to gather more information about your medical history. While we're on the topic, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I think… I broke my arm when I was a kid, and they had to set it? But that was a long time ago. And… I had some shrapnel removed after… after Iraq. That’s about it, I think. Just the arm, and the… the bits. It wasn't a big surgery, more like… they took some stuff out. It was a while ago, though. Everything feels… distant. I hope that’s helpful. I really wish I could remember more details.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It's good to know about the arm fracture and the shrapnel removal. It’s alright if the details are blurry; we’re just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My dad, he had… heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was still pretty young. And my mom, she had… high blood pressure, like me. I think. She's still alive, thankfully, but she’s… old. She forgets a lot of things. I don’t really know much about what other illnesses anyone else had, to be honest. We weren’t a big family for talking about health stuff. It was more like… you just dealt with it, you know? Sorry, I’m not much help on this one either. It feels like I’m just… rambling.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Kochubey. You’re providing me with valuable information. It’s common for families not to discuss health extensively. Knowing about your father's heart problems and your mother's high blood pressure is helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never liked it. My wife, she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. She said it was the worst thing she ever did. I always stayed away from it. I don’t have any interest in cigarettes. They smell bad, too. It’s one thing I don’t have to worry about, thankfully. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Mr. Kochubey. That’s good to know. And congratulations to your wife on quitting. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I have a beer sometimes. Usually on the weekends. Nothing crazy. Just one or two. My wife will have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. We don’t really drink much. It’s not really a habit, just… social stuff. Sometimes when we’re watching a movie. It’s nothing to worry about, I don’t think. Definitely not every day, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Kochubey. Occasional social drinking isn't typically a concern. Finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. My wife, she has pills for her blood pressure, but I don’t take anything regularly. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I used to take something for my stomach, but that was years ago. I think it just upset my stomach more, so I stopped taking it. I think that's it. Nothing important. I really try to stay away from medications if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, to get a better understanding of your current physical condition, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I guess I should have worn a better shirt. Just… don’t poke too much, okay? I don't handle that very well.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Okay, your height is 5 feet 1 inch, and your weight is 139 pounds. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath for me… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yeah, a little there. On the… right side, I think? It’s not a bad pain, just… sensitive. It's been like that for a while, I think. Not getting worse, just… always a little tender. I don't remember exactly when it started. I just try to avoid pushing on it, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Kochubey. That’s helpful. It could be a number of things, and we may need to investigate further. Now, I’m just going to take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your family history. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. I'd like to order some lab work to get a more complete picture of your health. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. We’ll also need a urinalysis. Would you be able to provide a urine sample before you leave today?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. I can do that. A urine sample, right? I think I can manage that. It's just… I’m not very good at remembering all these medical terms. Lab work and stuff… It all sounds a little scary. What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? Is something seriously wrong? I just want to make sure I know what’s going on, you know? My wife… she’ll want to know everything, too. She's the organized one.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Kochubey. It’s good you’re asking questions. These lab tests are routine and help us establish a baseline of your overall health before considering surgery. They'll give us a clearer picture of your kidney function, liver function, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, and overall health. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The complete blood count checks for infections and anemia. The comprehensive metabolic panel looks at your kidney and liver function and electrolyte balance. The lipid panel assesses your cholesterol levels, which is important for heart health. And the urinalysis can detect infections or other abnormalities in your urine. We’ll review the results together, and I’ll explain everything in detail. We can also discuss any concerns your wife may have. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little more sense. So it’s just… checking things. Not necessarily looking for problems. That’s good. I guess. Um… yeah, one question. The surgery… it’s a big surgery, right? What are the… the risks? I don’t want to sound scared, but my wife… she read some things online, and now she's worried. I just want to know what I’m getting into. Honest, like. Not… sugar-coated. Can you tell me about the risks? And… what happens if something goes wrong?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Kochubey, and I commend you for asking. It's crucial to be fully informed. Weight loss surgery, like any major surgery, does carry some risks. Some common risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, and leakage from the staple line. There’s also a risk of complications with anesthesia. Less common, but more serious, risks include damage to other organs, bowel obstruction, and even, in rare cases, death. We take many precautions to minimize these risks, including thorough pre-operative evaluation, careful surgical technique, and close post-operative monitoring. Specifically, regarding your concerns, we’ll be closely monitoring for signs of infection and leakage after surgery. We’ll also provide you with instructions on how to prevent blood clots. It’s also important to remember that these risks are individualized. Your overall health, weight, and any other medical conditions you have will all influence your risk level. Before proceeding, we’ll discuss all of these risks in detail and answer any further questions you and your wife may have. We'll also ensure you understand the lifestyle changes required after surgery to maintain long-term success. I want you to know that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions about the surgery at this time?
PATIENT: Wow… that’s… a lot. It sounds scary, to be honest. But… I guess everything does. I think… I think I need to talk to my wife about all this. She's really good at understanding medical stuff. And… she'll want to ask her own questions. So… what happens next? Do I need to schedule another appointment? And… what about the lab work? Where do I go for that? And… when do I need to tell them about my wife, so she can come to appointments? I'm sorry, I know I'm asking a lot of questions. I just… want to make sure we're doing the right thing.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and want to gather as much information as possible. Here’s what happens next. I’m going to write you a lab order for the blood work and urinalysis. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance—I can provide you with a list of nearby labs if needed. Once the results are back, our office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. At that appointment, we can discuss the risks and benefits of surgery in more detail and answer any questions you and your wife may have. We encourage your wife to attend all appointments with you. Please let the receptionist know when you schedule the appointment that she will be joining you. I’ll also have our nurse provide you with some pre-operative instructions, including information about dietary restrictions and medications to avoid before surgery. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. That… really helps. Okay, so lab work, then a follow-up appointment with my wife. And tell the receptionist. Got it. Thank you for… being patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now. Unless… Oh! What about… after the surgery? How long will I be in the hospital? And… what will I be able to eat? That’s probably a silly question, but… I eat a lot. And I don't want to be hungry all the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s my pleasure. And those are excellent questions, not silly at all! Typically, patients stay in the hospital for 2-3 days after weight loss surgery. This allows us to monitor your recovery, manage any pain, and ensure you’re able to tolerate fluids and a soft diet. Initially, you'll be on a liquid diet for about a week or two, followed by a gradual introduction of soft foods, and then eventually a regular diet. It’s true that your eating habits will need to change, and portion sizes will be significantly smaller. We have a registered dietitian on staff who will work with you before and after surgery to develop a personalized meal plan and provide guidance on healthy eating habits. They will also help you manage any feelings of hunger or cravings. The goal is not to leave you feeling deprived, but to help you make sustainable lifestyle changes that will promote long-term weight loss and overall health. I'm happy to provide you with some informational pamphlets on post-operative diet and lifestyle changes. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be great. A diet plan… and stuff. My wife will be happy to see that, too. She’s always trying to get me to eat healthier. Okay, so I have lab work, then a follow-up appointment with my wife, and now diet pamphlets. And tell the receptionist. I think I’m getting the hang of this. Thank you again, Doctor Glowka. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little less scared now. I think I’m ready to go get this lab work done.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Here are those pamphlets. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I wish you all the best with your lab work. I look forward to seeing you and your wife at your next appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
