DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Trestrail. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor, yes? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place, you know? Need to find a doctor. Medicare said to come here. Not feeling bad, exactly. Just… a check-up, I guess? Old doctor… far away now. Very far.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient visit. That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Szmyd. It’s always good to establish care with a physician when you relocate. So, to clarify, you aren’t experiencing any specific complaints at the moment?
PATIENT: Complaints? No, no complaints. Just… old. Everything is old, you know? Body, life… everything. Not sick, not hurting. Just… existing. Is that enough? Should I be complaining about something? People always complain. I don’t like complainers.
DOCTOR: Well, a check-up is perfectly valid, Mr. Szmyd. It’s preventative medicine. However, even without specific complaints, it's helpful for me to understand your overall health history. Let's start with the basics. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant… problems? Hmm. Let me think. There was… something. A long time ago. In Russia, of course. Everything happened in Russia. I think… my stomach? Maybe? Or was it my… back? Honestly, Doctor, it was a very long time ago. They gave me pills. Many pills. It didn't fix much, but… that's Russia for you. Not like here, I expect.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a past medical issue involving either your stomach or back, treated with medication while you were in Russia. Do you recall what the medication was?
PATIENT: Medication? No. Absolutely not. Little white pills, maybe? Or blue. It was a long time ago! They just… gave me something. I didn't ask questions. You didn't ask questions in Russia, Doctor. Bad idea. And honestly, I don't remember details. Why would I remember details about old pills? I was sick, they gave me something, I got better… mostly. It was a very long time ago, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We can proceed without specific medication names. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now that I remember. One. Just one. My… appendix, I think? When I was young. Very young. They cut me open, fixed the thing, stitched me back up. It hurt, of course. But I lived, didn’t I? So it was a good surgery. All I remember is a lot of white… everything. White sheets, white coats, white… pain. But it’s gone now, so it doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: An appendectomy when you were young. Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh. That is… complicated. My wife… divorced. Long ago. No children. My mother… gone. Father… also gone. Very long ago. Brothers… sisters… not close. We don't talk. So… no family to worry about, really. Not relevant, I think. They are all… fine. Or not. I don't know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes family medical history isn't readily available. Moving on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think… No. I don't think so. I eat everything. I used to eat… everything. Not so much now, but… I’ve never had a problem. Maybe a little… stuffy nose sometimes? But that's the weather. Not an allergy. I eat fish, I eat meat, I eat… everything. No problems. Very strong stomach, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not anymore. The Russian doctors gave me many pills, long ago, but I stopped taking them. They didn’t help, you know? Just made me… tired. Now I take nothing. Just… air and water. And maybe a little vodka sometimes. For… health. Is vodka a medication?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, vodka is not a medication. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline understanding of your current health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Hmm. Always poking and prodding. Very unpleasant. But… fine. I suppose. Get it over with. Just… be gentle. I am an artist, you know? My hands… important. Don't break anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please, extend your arm. Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Slightly elevated blood pressure, but we can monitor that. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and another… and exhale. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now I’m going to check your abdomen. Please lie back. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No. Nothing. Press all you want. It’s a very strong stomach, you know? Like a rock. Always has been. I eat anything. Even… bad things. No problem. Press harder. Still nothing. Are you sure you're pressing hard enough, Doctor? Maybe you need to be… stronger.
DOCTOR: No significant tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and bowel sounds are normal in all four quadrants. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your leg. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Overall, physical exam is within normal limits, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Do you have a history of high blood pressure, or have you ever been told you have elevated blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Never. Not that I remember. Doctors in Russia… didn’t tell me much. They just gave me pills. Many pills. Maybe it was elevated then? Who knows. I don’t worry about it. It’s probably nothing. Just… excitement, maybe? Moving to a new place… very stressful. It's probably just… life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and the lack of a clear history, I recommend we repeat the blood pressure measurement in a few days, just to get a baseline. We'll also order some routine blood work - a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel - to assess your overall health. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking? Fine. If you must. But don’t take too much. I need my blood for… art. And don't keep me waiting all day. I have things to do, you know? Important things. Is it a long process? Will it hurt? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: It's a standard blood draw, Mr. Szmyd. It shouldn't take long, and the discomfort is minimal - just a quick pinch. We'll get the lab order sent over to the clinic’s blood draw station. They'll schedule an appointment for you. And while we wait for the results, I recommend trying to reduce your stress levels, and perhaps monitoring your blood pressure at home if you have access to a device. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. No, I don't think so. You poked and prodded, you took notes, you want more blood. What more is there to ask? Just… get it over with. And don't lose my blood. It’s very important blood. It makes beautiful paintings, you know. Perhaps you’ll see them someday. Now, can I go? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, you are free to go. The lab will contact you to schedule your blood draw. A nurse will provide you with instructions for the test. Please, call the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Good. Good day to you too, Doctor. And try to appreciate art sometime. It's important.
