DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Aye, nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this nausea, see. Happens most mornings now. And I have a bit of a… well, the specialist told me it’s heart failure, a few years back now. It's just gotten a wee bit worse lately, and this morning sickness is new. Never had that 'til now!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Benic. Nausea, especially in the mornings, and you mentioned a history of heart failure diagnosed a few years ago that’s been progressing. And you’re describing this as new – you’ve never experienced nausea like this before?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. Never. Not like this, no. It’s not like a bad stomach, more… a queasy feeling, right in my belly. And it usually passes after a bit, with a cup of tea, but it’s starting to bother me. Makes it hard to get going in the mornings, you ken? And I worry it means the heart's getting worse. I take my pills, mind you, every day, just as I was told.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the nausea is primarily in the mornings, a queasy feeling, and it does seem to improve somewhat with tea. You’re diligent about taking your heart medications as prescribed, which is good to hear. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the heart failure diagnosis?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. It was about… let me think, four years ago now. I started getting awfully breathless, even just walking up the stairs. And my ankles were swelling something fierce. The doctor sent me for tests, and that’s when they told me. Reduced ejection fraction, that's what they said. I don’t rightly know what that means exactly, just that my heart isn’t pumpin’ as well as it should. They put me on a few different pills to help, and for a while, I felt alright. Then, slowly, things started creeping back, you know? The breathlessness isn't as bad as before, but it's there, and now this nausea.
DOCTOR: Okay, so reduced ejection fraction, breathlessness, and ankle swelling were the initial symptoms that led to the diagnosis. You’ve noticed a gradual return of symptoms despite being on medication. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit more detail. When you say the breathlessness is "there," can you describe how often you’re experiencing it and what activities bring it on now?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it’s not constant, mind you. I can still manage most things, but anything that takes a bit of effort, like walkin’ uphill or carryin’ groceries, brings it on. Even a good brisk walk on a flat road leaves me a bit winded. It used to be just stairs, but now it's… more. Happens maybe three or four times a week, if I’m doin’ somethin’. I try to pace myself, but it's frustrating, you ken? Used to be a very active man.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Benic. It sounds like the breathlessness is limiting your activity level, which is understandably concerning. Now, let’s talk a bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a good question, Doctor. I have noticed I’ve put on a bit of weight, maybe five or six pounds in the last couple of months. I thought it was just age, to be honest, but now that you mention it… it might be more than that. I haven't been weighin' myself regularly, though. It's been warmer weather and I've been eatin' a bit more, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recent weight gain of approximately five to six pounds. We’ll need to keep that in mind. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet lately, other than what you experienced when you were first diagnosed?
PATIENT: Aye, yes! That's been comin' back, a bit. Not as bad as before, but my ankles are definitely puffier at the end of the day. I usually put my feet up for a while and it goes down a bit, but it’s there. And… now that I think about it, my belly feels a bit… bloated, too. Like water, maybe. It’s hard to say, but it's definitely not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, so we’re seeing a return of ankle swelling, as well as some abdominal bloating. Now, let’s quickly review your other medical history. Aside from heart failure, do you have any other medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nay, nothin' major. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it sorted itself out. And I had my appendix out when I was a lad, but that was ages ago. Otherwise, I've been fairly healthy, all things considered. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, 'cause the doctor said my levels were low, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant other medical conditions, just a history of a transient blood pressure issue and an appendectomy many years ago. You take vitamin D supplements. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nay, none that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anythin' they've given me. I've had a few pills over the years, for colds and such, but never anything serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And finally, could you tell me a bit about your current medications?
PATIENT: Right, let me see… I have… here we go. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Metoprolol, 50 milligrams, twice a day. Furosemide, 40 milligrams, every morning. And then there’s the Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams, also every day. I’ve been on these for… well, since the diagnosis, four years now. I keep them in a pill organizer, so I don't forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Metoprolol, Furosemide, and Digoxin. You’ve been taking these medications consistently for four years. Thank you for providing all of that information, Mr. Benic. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam now. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your legs and abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. Do as you need to. I'm used to the poking and prodding, after all.
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a listen… I hear a slightly S3 gallop – that’s a subtle extra sound that can indicate fluid overload in the heart. Your lungs sound clear, but there’s a bit of congestion at the bases. Blood pressure is 150/90, which is a little elevated. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel some fluid accumulation, as you mentioned with the bloating. And… … there is +2 pitting edema in both legs, meaning there’s noticeable swelling that leaves a dent when I press on it. Alright, Mr. Benic. Based on the exam and your history, it seems your heart failure symptoms are worsening. The fluid overload is likely contributing to the breathlessness, swelling, and nausea. Your blood pressure is also a little high, which can put extra strain on your heart. We need to address this promptly.
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn't sound good, does it? Aye, I was worried somethin’ was up. So, what do you think we should do, Doctor? I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: No, it's not ideal, but we can certainly work on improving things. It sounds like your current medications aren’t quite enough to control your symptoms right now. First, I want to order some blood tests. We need to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a BNP level, which is a marker of heart failure. We’ll also check your complete blood count and liver function tests to get a broader picture. I'm also going to order an EKG to see if there are any changes in your heart rhythm. In the meantime, I want you to strictly limit your sodium intake – no more than 2000 milligrams per day. That means avoiding processed foods, fast food, and adding salt to your meals. Also, it's very important to monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain of more than 2 pounds in a day, or 5 pounds in a week, you need to call us immediately. Finally, I'm going to increase the dose of your Furosemide from 40 milligrams to 80 milligrams daily. This will help you get rid of some of the excess fluid. We’ll see how you respond to that, and we may need to adjust the other medications as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Sodium, weight watchin’… I can do that. I'll keep a close eye on things. And a higher dose of the water pill, alright. I'd rather get on top of it now than wait for it to get worse. So, how long 'til I get the blood tests done? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad you’re willing to work with me on this. I've sent an order to the lab here in the clinic – you can go right now, and they should be able to draw the blood within the hour. The lab technician will give you instructions on any fasting requirements. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Alright, go to the lab now, results in a day or two… I can manage that. Emergency room if things get bad, got it. Hm… actually, yes, I do have a question. This nausea… could it be a side effect of the Digoxin? I’ve read things online, and it mentioned stomach problems. I worry about everything, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Benic. And you’re right to be mindful of potential side effects. Nausea is a possible side effect of Digoxin, although it’s not common. It can also be a sign of Digoxin toxicity, which is why we need to monitor your levels regularly. However, in your case, the nausea is more likely related to the fluid overload and the worsening heart failure. But we will definitely check your Digoxin level with the blood tests just to be sure. For now, try eating small, bland meals. If the nausea becomes severe, you can try an over-the-counter anti-nausea medication like Emetrol or Dramamine, but please let us know if it doesn’t improve. Do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: Alright, small meals… I can do that. And I’ll pick up somethin’ for the nausea, just in case. I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen and explain things so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowin' we're gettin' on top of it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could help. It's important to remember that we’re a team in this, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Now, go ahead and head to the lab. They’re just down the hall. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you again, Doctor. I will. Bye bye to you too.
