DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes. Well, my husband suggested I come. He's been…concerned about things. He wants me to fill out one of those forms. An “Advance Directive,” I believe he called it? Or a POLST form. Something to do with… what happens if I am unable to make decisions. Honestly, I find the entire notion rather…unpleasant. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. Those forms can feel a bit overwhelming, and it's perfectly normal to not want to think about those scenarios. It’s good of your husband to be proactive, though. They’re really about making your wishes known. Before we dive into those forms, perhaps we could just chat a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health? With all due respect, Doctor, I came here for a specific form, not a general check-up. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. I’ve always been quite robust. I do not need to discuss my…vital statistics with you at this moment. Let’s simply address the paperwork, shall we? I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely respect that. However, to ensure the Advance Directive or POLST form is appropriate and accurately reflects your wishes, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of your current health status. It doesn't need to be extensive. Just a few quick questions. It will help me guide you through the process and answer any questions you might have about the form itself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But make it brief. I suppose a few “quick questions” won’t hurt. But I must warn you, Doctor, I do not suffer fools gladly. And I have little patience for unnecessary medical probing. Begin.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I appreciate your patience. Let’s start with any current symptoms you might be experiencing. Anything at all that’s been bothering you lately – even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, I just told you I am perfectly healthy. I do not have symptoms. Perhaps if my husband were here, he’d conjure up a list of imagined ailments. But I assure you, I feel quite well. Though, admittedly, the air conditioning in this building is rather strong, and it is giving me a slight chill. Is that what you were hoping to hear?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to hear you're feeling generally well. Sometimes, even when feeling healthy, there can be underlying things we want to be aware of. Just to get a clearer picture, have you had any recent changes in your energy levels, appetite, or sleep?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying something? My energy levels are perfectly adequate. I maintain a rigorous schedule, thank you very much. My appetite is…normal. I eat what I wish, when I wish. And my sleep? I sleep soundly. Honestly, I find these questions rather…invasive. Are you a doctor, or an interrogator? Perhaps my husband should have come alone. He seems far more interested in dissecting my well-being than I am.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel invasive. That is absolutely not my intention. I'm simply trying to gather a bit of information to ensure we approach these forms in the most thoughtful way possible. It sounds like you are very active and maintain a good routine, which is wonderful. Perhaps we can shift gears then. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently, or have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have always prided myself on avoiding doctors as much as possible. They tend to overcomplicate things. Surgeries? Good heavens, no. I would never allow anyone to… tamper with my body. My husband took me to a dentist last year, and that was quite enough medical intervention for a lifetime. He insisted on a cleaning. A perfectly unnecessary procedure, if you ask me. Now, are we going to discuss these forms, or are you planning to catalogue my entire medical history – or lack thereof? I have a luncheon engagement.
DOCTOR: Understood. We can certainly focus on the forms. Before we do, just one quick question about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Doctor, really? Are you attempting to find something wrong with me? No! I do not take medications. I believe in a healthy lifestyle, not relying on artificial concoctions. A glass of red wine with dinner, perhaps, but that is hardly a medication. Honestly, I’m starting to regret agreeing to this appointment. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe we should proceed with these…Advance Directives. Or whatever they are called. I haven't all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can move on to the forms. Just before we do, and this is just routine, is there any significant medical history in your family?
PATIENT: Medical history? Doctor, my family is…was…a large and robust family. They lived long lives, mostly. There was an aunt, perhaps, who had a touch of… something. The lungs, I think. But she smoked incessantly, so it hardly counts. And my grandfather… he had a bad fall. Broke a hip, if I recall correctly. But honestly, tracing the medical ailments of distant relatives seems… a waste of time. Now, are we finally going to discuss the paperwork? I’m starting to feel quite faint. All this interrogation is rather draining.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Marija, and I apologize if I'm pressing too much. I assure you, I'm not attempting to find something wrong. These forms - the Advance Directive or POLST - are about ensuring your wishes are respected if you were ever unable to speak for yourself. It's about having a voice even when you can't. Perhaps, instead of focusing on your medical history, we could talk about what’s important to you?
PATIENT: My wishes? Doctor, my wishes are quite simple. I wish to live a long and healthy life, free from unnecessary medical intervention. I wish to maintain my independence. And I wish to be left in peace. Is that not sufficient? These forms seem… morbid. A pre-emptive surrender, if you ask me. I fail to see the necessity. Frankly, I think my husband is overthinking things. He worries excessively about everything. Now, if you insist on proceeding, please, let us get it over with. What exactly does one do with these papers? Do I simply sign my name? Or is there more…torture involved?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Marija. And you’re right, it is about your wishes. The forms allow you to specify what kind of medical care you would want, or wouldn't want, in different situations. It's less about surrender, and more about control. We can start with a simple document, if you prefer. The Advance Directive allows you to name someone you trust to make decisions for you if you're unable to. We can then discuss what values and priorities you want them to consider. It doesn’t require signing anything right away. We can simply talk through the options, and you can decide if it's something you want to pursue. Would you like me to explain the basic sections of the form, or would you prefer I just give you the document to review?
PATIENT: Review it myself? Honestly, I doubt I’ll understand half of the jargon. Doctor, I am a professor of literature, not a physician. Fine. Explain the basic sections. But keep it brief. And please, avoid medical terminology. I assure you, my patience is wearing thin. But if I find it too complex, I reserve the right to terminate this…exercise immediately.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This form is divided into a few sections. The first section is for naming your healthcare agent – that’s the person you trust to make decisions for you if you can't. It can be your husband, a family member, a close friend – anyone you feel comfortable with. The second section is about your general wishes for medical care. Do you want everything done to prolong your life, even if the quality of life is poor?
PATIENT: Hold. Everything done? Doctor, that sounds… barbaric. Of course not. I do not wish to be kept alive by machines, a mere shell of myself. I have always believed in a dignified ending. Quality of life is paramount. But honestly, the very thought of discussing such morbid details… it’s unsettling. Is this what modern medicine has come to? Pre-planning one's demise? Utterly depressing. Now, what else does this…document entail? Perhaps it’s best if I simply refuse to sign anything. That way, no one can force unwanted procedures upon me. Is that an option? A simple “no” to everything?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. You are not obligated to sign anything. The purpose of this form is to empower you to make these decisions, and you have the right to refuse any and all treatment. If you choose not to complete the form, your husband would likely be the one making decisions for you, should you become unable to do so. We can also explore a POLST form, which is a bit more specific and focuses on immediate medical wishes, like whether or not you want CPR or intubation. But that’s something we can discuss later, if you’re interested. For now, would you like me to simply leave the Advance Directive form with you, so you can review it at your leisure?
PATIENT: Very well. Leave the document. I will… glance at it. Though I doubt it will change my mind. I suspect it’s filled with legalese and unnecessary complications. And honestly, the mere act of reading such a morbid document is likely to lower my blood pressure. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve endured enough medical interrogation for one day. Is there anything else? Or am I finally free to leave? I have a luncheon engagement, you know. And I refuse to be late.
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for today, Marija. I appreciate you coming in, even if it wasn’t entirely comfortable. Here’s the form. Feel free to take your time reviewing it, and please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon. .
