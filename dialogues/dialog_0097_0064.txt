DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor! Nice to meet you too. Um, well... my chest. It's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels... tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it, you know? It started maybe... a week ago? I think so. It’s hard to remember dates, but a week feels right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week of chest tightness. That is worth checking out. Can you tell me a little more about that tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm... Okay. It's not a sharp pain, not like when you fall or something. More like... a heavy feeling. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just when I walk, like up the stairs to my apartment. Other times… I was washing dishes yesterday and it started then. It doesn't last long, maybe five minutes? Then it goes away. But it makes me nervous. It feels… different than anything before.
DOCTOR: Alright, a heavy feeling that comes and goes, triggered by activity like walking or even washing dishes, and lasting around five minutes. That's helpful. And you said it feels different than anything you've experienced before – can you elaborate on that difference?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That’s good you ask. Before, if my heart would flutter, it would just… flutter. Quick, quick, quick, and then stop. This is… steady. Like a weight. And it makes my arm feel funny sometimes. Not pain exactly, but… tingly? In my left arm, mostly. It doesn't happen every time, but when the chest feels tight, sometimes the arm feels that way too. It scares me a little. My husband, he says I worry too much, but… this is new.
DOCTOR: Okay, a steady pressure, not a fluttering, and tingling in your left arm sometimes when you're experiencing the chest tightness. That's important information. Has anything specifically made it start a week ago, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm... No, not really. Just… started. I was doing my usual things. Gardening mostly, I love my flowers. Maybe I lifted something too heavy in the garden? A big bag of soil, perhaps. But I do that all the time, I don’t think so. It just… began. It wasn’t after anything special. It's just been there, getting a little better, a little worse, you know? Nothing caused it, as far as I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific triggering event, just a gradual onset of symptoms. Now, let's talk about other things going on with your body. Have you noticed any shortness of breath along with this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath... Yes, a little, sometimes. Not like I can't breathe at all, Doctor. But when I walk up the stairs, or even just walk quickly to the store, I get a little winded. More than usual. I always thought I was just getting old! But maybe it’s connected to the chest? I don't know. It's not terrible, just… noticeable. I have to stop and catch my breath sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so shortness of breath with exertion, along with the chest tightness. That's definitely something we need to investigate. Now, have you had any nausea, vomiting, or sweating with any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No sickness or throwing up. And I haven’t been sweating more than usual, no. Just the chest and the breath. Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy, but that happens sometimes anyway, you know? Old age again! I don’t think that’s from the chest. It just… comes and goes. Like everything else, really. Not with the chest though, the dizziness. Mostly just the chest and the breath.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no nausea, vomiting, or excessive sweating, and the dizziness seems unrelated. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill for it, but I don't always remember to take it, to be honest. I forget! And I think he said something about my cholesterol being a little high too. I don’t remember exactly. I have Medicare, so I see doctors sometimes, but… I don't always listen very well. And no, no sugar sickness, I don't think. My husband says I eat too many cookies, but… that’s different! I don’t have sugar sickness. Just a little weakness for sweets. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: A little weakness for sweets is perfectly normal, Sherion! We can talk about that later. It's good you mentioned the high blood pressure, and possibly high cholesterol. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication you're taking, if you happen to remember?
PATIENT: Um... No, I don’t. It’s a little white pill. That’s all I remember. They give it to me at the pharmacy. Little white pill, once a day, sometimes. I forget sometimes, like I said. I have a lot on my mind! My grandson, he’s starting college… it’s hard to remember everything. I’m sorry, I wish I could tell you the name. Maybe my husband knows. He’s better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherion, don’t worry about it at all. We can look that up later. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. Yes, a long time ago. When I was young, I had my appendix out. A very long time ago. And… Oh! And I broke my wrist when I fell off a bicycle. That was when my grandson was little. He ran in front of me. I was okay, just a broken wrist. No other surgeries, I don't think. And no, I haven’t been in the hospital for anything else. Just the appendix and the wrist. A very long time ago!
DOCTOR: Okay, just the appendectomy and a broken wrist, both a long time ago. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she had heart problems, I think. She was always tired, and she had a lot of trouble breathing. She died when I was still young, maybe in her sixties. My father, he was fine, very strong. He lived a long life. And my brother… he had high blood pressure too, like me. He’s still alive, but he’s very old now. He lives in Colombia. That’s all I really remember about their health, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had heart problems, your father was healthy, and your brother has high blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I eat everything! Empanadas, arepas… I love all kinds of food. And I take some pills for my arthritis, but they don’t bother me. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not ever. I’m very lucky, I think. My husband always tells me I have a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! Now, you mentioned taking pills for arthritis, can you tell me which ones those are?
PATIENT: Oh, um... Here! I keep them in here. They’re for my hands, you know? They get very stiff and achy. The doctor gave them to me a long time ago. I take them when they hurt. Sometimes I forget, like with the blood pressure pill. I just take them when I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and naproxen for your arthritis. And how often are you taking these, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... Not every day! Only when my hands really bother me. Maybe… two or three times a week? Sometimes not even that. When it’s cold, or when I’ve been gardening a lot. It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t keep track, you know? I just take them when I need to. It's usually just a couple of pills at a time, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen and naproxen a few times a week as needed for your arthritis. Alright Sherion, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just listening and checking… that sounds good. I hope everything is alright. I do get a little nervous when doctors listen to my heart, you know? But I know you’re doing your best. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherion. I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your pulse is 88 and regular. I'm hearing some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs, and a very faint murmur when listening to your heart. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Now, I'd like to ask you to rate your pain level on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. And where exactly are you feeling this tightness?
PATIENT: Oh… That doesn't sound good, does it? The numbers... I don't really understand. The pain… well, it's not really pain, Doctor. It's more of a tightness. Right here, in the middle of my chest. Sometimes it spreads a little to my left arm, like I said. But mostly here. And… On that scale… maybe a 4 or a 5 when it's really bad. Most of the time, it’s more like a 2 or a 3. Just… uncomfortable. It’s scary, more than painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 2-5 on the pain scale, mostly discomfort with occasional tightness, located in the center of your chest, sometimes radiating to your left arm. That's helpful. Sherion, based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it's important that we investigate this further. Your slightly elevated blood pressure, the diminished breath sounds, the murmur, and your symptoms are concerning for a few possibilities, including potential heart or lung issues. I’m going to order a few tests: an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out other potential causes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear... Tests? For my heart? Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I don't like tests, but I want to know what’s going on. I don’t want anything serious. I just want to feel better. Yes, okay. Tests are fine. What do I need to do? Where do I go? I hope they don't take too long. And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Sherion. We’ll take things one step at a time. The EKG is very quick and painless – it just involves placing some stickers on your chest. The chest X-ray is also painless, though you will need to remove any jewelry or metal objects. And the blood work will involve a small sample of blood being taken from your arm. I’ll write you a referral to the lab and radiology center just down the street. The lab will draw your blood, and then you can go to radiology for the X-ray. They're both in the same building, so it won't be a long trip. They should be able to get everything done today. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or lightheadedness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Emergency room...? Oh, dear... I hope I won’t need to go to the emergency room. Okay… the stickers and the pictures… and the blood. I can do that. Down the street, you said? Both places in the same building? That's good. And then we talk about the results? Um… Will they tell me what’s wrong right away? Or will I have to wait? And… what if it’s something bad?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious about what the results might be, Sherion. Usually, the radiology center can give a preliminary reading of the X-ray pretty quickly, but the official results will be sent to me. The blood work will take a little longer, usually a few days, for me to get the full results. I will call you as soon as I have the results and schedule an appointment to discuss them with you in detail. We will go over everything together, and I will explain all of your options. If the results indicate something serious, we will develop a plan to manage it effectively. It’s important to remember that we haven’t confirmed anything yet. These tests are just to gather information so we can make an accurate diagnosis and provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any family or friends who can accompany you to the lab and radiology center for support?
PATIENT: That’s good… you’ll call me. I like that. I don’t want to be alone when I hear the results. My husband, Ricardo… he can come with me. He worries too, you know. He’s better at remembering things, he can ask questions I forget. Yes, Ricardo can come. He drives, too, so I don’t have to worry about that. Okay. Stickers, pictures, blood… and Ricardo. And you’ll call me. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Sherion. Having Ricardo with you is a wonderful idea. And you’re very welcome. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Here are the referrals to the lab and radiology center, along with my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel silly about worrying. I guess I’ll go see Ricardo and we’ll go get the tests done. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. And… I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could help. I understand your concerns, and I want to reassure you that we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I'll be thinking of you and Ricardo. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon. .
PATIENT: .
