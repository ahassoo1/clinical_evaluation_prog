DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well, I suppose. Though I must say, I've heard mixed things about these… alternative practices. My daughter insisted I come. She believes this marijuana… certification… will help with my nerves. Frankly, I think it's a bit ridiculous, but here I am. I’ve never been one for… all of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ellan. It's perfectly reasonable to feel that way. We're here to discuss whether medical cannabis might be a suitable option for you, and we’ll do that at your pace. Your daughter sounds like she’s looking out for you, and it’s good you're willing to explore options. To start, could you tell me a little more about these nerves you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, it's not as if I'm constantly shaking, Doctor. It's more… a persistent feeling of unease. A sort of flutter in my chest, particularly when I have to deal with… people. You understand. As a bailiff, I encounter a rather… unsavory crowd. It makes concentrating on the task at hand… difficult. And lately, it’s been getting worse. My husband says I’ve been more… irritable. Though he doesn't understand a thing about proper decorum, naturally.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a persistent feeling of unease, a flutter in your chest, and it seems to be triggered or worsened by social interaction, specifically related to your work as a bailiff. And your husband has noticed some increased irritability. That’s helpful to know. Could you describe a typical episode?
PATIENT: An "episode," Doctor? Really? It's not a drama. But… alright. Usually, it starts when I'm approaching a property. Before even knocking, there's this… tightness. Like a band around my chest. My palms get rather damp, and I find myself… checking my composure in the reflection of the car window. Then, when I have to speak to the… occupants? That's when it gets truly unpleasant. My voice feels… shaky. And I worry constantly that I'm not being… firm enough. It's simply dreadful, really. A proper bailiff must maintain authority, you see.
DOCTOR: It sounds quite distressing, Ellan, and certainly impacts your ability to do your job effectively. The tightness in your chest, the damp palms, the shaky voice... those are all signs of anxiety. It's good you're recognizing these feelings. To get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little about how long you’ve been experiencing these feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's not new, Doctor. Not at all. It's been… creeping up on me for years, I suppose. It was always manageable. A bit of nervousness before a particularly difficult eviction, perhaps. But lately… the past six months, maybe? It’s become… constant. It used to be something I could shake off. Now, it follows me. Even at home, I find myself… jumpy. My husband says I startle easily. It's most unladylike.
DOCTOR: Six months of worsening symptoms, with a prior history of manageable anxiety... That’s important information. And the fact that it’s now affecting you even at home is something we should definitely consider. Now, have you ever sought any treatment for anxiety before, such as therapy or medication?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Doctor, I am a perfectly capable woman. I've always dealt with my own affairs. Therapy? The idea! And medication… honestly, I wouldn’t dream of it. All those side effects! No, I prefer to… tough it out. Though, as I’ve explained, that's becoming increasingly… difficult. My daughter suggested this marijuana… arrangement as a last resort, of course. She worries incessantly.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your self-reliance, Ellan, and I understand your reluctance to try conventional treatments. It's good to be informed and cautious. Since you haven't tried other treatments, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well… let me see. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter. And my arthritis acts up now and again, mostly in my knees. The usual aches and pains for a woman my age, Doctor. Nothing serious. My blood pressure is a bit elevated, but my regular physician keeps it under control with diet. He’s a very good doctor, though a bit… bland. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed years ago. But that was decades ago. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of the flu, arthritis, slightly elevated blood pressure managed with diet, and gallbladder removal many years ago. All helpful to know. Do you take any medications regularly for your blood pressure or arthritis, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I specifically requested no medication for my blood pressure. My doctor tried to persuade me, naturally, but I'm quite firm. I manage it perfectly well with a low-sodium diet and regular… constitutional walks. And the arthritis… I simply ignore it when I can. A little discomfort is hardly worth all those pills and potential complications. I do take a multivitamin, religiously. And a calcium supplement, for my bones. My daughter insists on that one. She’s quite… persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no regular medications aside from a multivitamin and calcium supplement. And you’re managing your blood pressure with diet and exercise. Excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always had a rather… robust constitution. I can eat almost anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to… well, anything, really. I’ve seen my share of tropical ailments, growing up in the Dominican Republic, but I always managed to bounce back. I consider myself quite fortunate. Though, I do find dust bothersome. And the smell of certain perfumes… but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, no known allergies. Just a sensitivity to dust and perfumes. Now, to finish up with your history, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical background?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Where to begin? My mother lived to be a very respectable age, but she suffered terribly with… digestive issues. Constantly complaining, she was. And my father had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away rather suddenly, quite a shock it was. My brother… he’s a bit of a hypochondriac, always convinced he’s on the verge of something terrible. He’s a doctor himself, ironically. And my daughter… well, she’s perfectly healthy, thankfully, but she does worry incessantly. A bit of a nervous disposition, she's always had. Like me, I suppose. Is that… helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ellan. History of digestive issues in your mother, heart problems in your father, and a nervous disposition in your daughter. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general well-being. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose it's… thorough. Though, I must warn you, I am rather particular about my personal space. And please, no cold instruments. They give me a fright. I don’t understand why doctors insist on everything being so… clinical. But, proceed. I suppose it’s best to get it over with. Quickly, if you please. And gently.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I understand completely. I'll be as gentle and respectful of your space as possible. No cold instruments, I promise. Okay, first, let's take your blood pressure. Taking blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 148 over 82. Not alarmingly high, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Now, let's check your pulse. Checking pulse. Your pulse is 78, regular and strong. I'm going to listen to your lungs now. Listening to lungs. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. And finally, I’ll listen to your heart. Listening to heart. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It doesn't seem concerning at this moment, but we should monitor it. Overall, you appear to be in good general health, Ellan. No obvious signs of distress. Now, do you have any questions for me before we discuss whether medical cannabis might be appropriate?
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Oh dear. My father had a murmur. I suppose it runs in the family. I did always suspect something wasn't quite right. And you say it's not "concerning" at this moment… what does that mean? Will I need further tests? Honestly, Doctor, I am beginning to regret this whole endeavor. I simply came to appease my daughter. This is all rather… unsettling. And frankly, I'm not convinced this marijuana is going to solve anything. But, proceed, I suppose. Tell me about this cannabis, then. What exactly would it do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ellan, and I apologize if the mention of the murmur caused you distress. It’s a mild murmur, and many people live perfectly normal lives with them. We can certainly discuss further testing if you’d like, but it doesn’t necessarily mean there's an immediate problem. As for the cannabis, it wouldn't necessarily "solve" anything, but it may help manage your anxiety symptoms. The active compounds in cannabis can interact with your body’s endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating mood, stress response, and sleep. For some people, it can provide a sense of calm, reduce feelings of nervousness, and improve sleep quality. It wouldn’t be a cure, but it could potentially offer some relief from the unease you’ve been experiencing. We would start with a very low dose, and gradually increase it until we find the optimal level for you. We would closely monitor your response, and adjust the dosage as needed. It's important to remember that everyone reacts differently to cannabis, and it’s not a guaranteed solution. Do you have any specific concerns about trying cannabis?
PATIENT: Concerns? My dear Doctor, where do I begin? It’s… illegal, isn’t it? Well, mostly. And I’ve read things… about side effects. And the smell! I simply cannot abide a strong smell. And I certainly don’t want to become… giddy. Or forgetful. Or… dependent! I’ve seen what it does to people. It's simply not… proper. And frankly, the idea of deliberately altering my state of mind… it’s rather shocking. Honestly, I’m not sure I can do this. My daughter will be terribly disappointed, but I may simply have to tell her it’s… not for me. This whole conversation is giving me palpitations. Perhaps a nice cup of chamomile tea would be more suitable.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ellan. They are very valid, and I appreciate you voicing them. You're right to be cautious and thoughtful about this. Let's address those concerns one by one. You're correct, the legal status of cannabis is complex, but here in this state, a medical certification like the one you're seeking allows for legal access. As for side effects, they can vary, but common ones include dry mouth, drowsiness, and dizziness. We would start with a very low dose to minimize these effects. And we would closely monitor your response. Regarding the smell, there are various methods of consumption, including capsules and tinctures, which have minimal odor. And the risk of dependency is low, especially with responsible use and under medical supervision. The goal isn't to alter your state of mind, but to alleviate your anxiety symptoms. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Ellan. If you're not comfortable trying cannabis, that is perfectly acceptable. Your health and well-being are the most important thing. Would you like to discuss other options for managing your anxiety, such as therapy or relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Therapy? Heavens, no. I’ve already told you my stance on therapy. And relaxation techniques… I am a relaxed person, Doctor! Relatively. This is simply a matter of… nerves, as I’ve explained. Honestly, I think I’ve made up my mind. This… this whole endeavor is too much. Too complicated. Too… unsettling. It's not for me. I appreciate your time, Doctor, and your… patience. But I believe I’ll just stick to my chamomile tea and constitutional walks. And perhaps a stronger tonic for my nerves. Thank you, but no thank you. I believe that's all. And please, no further tests. I've had quite enough excitement for one day. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. I completely respect your decision. It sounds like you have a good routine in place, and if that's working for you, that's wonderful. I'll document our conversation and the fact that you've declined a cannabis certification. I want to thank you for coming in and openly sharing your concerns. If you ever change your mind, or if you'd like to discuss other options, please don’t hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
