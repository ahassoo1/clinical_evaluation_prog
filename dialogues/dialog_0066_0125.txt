DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Condray. Good to meet you too. Look, I just... well, my wife thought it was a good idea. She worries too much, honestly. I wanted to get checked for... you know... the HIV thing. Just to keep her happy. It's probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and it's wonderful your wife encourages that. Even if it's just for peace of mind, getting checked is a smart move. So, just to clarify, you're requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. An HIV test. Though, honestly, I don’t see why I'd have it. I’ve… been careful. I mean, I’m married, haven’t… well, you don’t need to know that. But I haven't done anything risky. It's probably a waste of your time, really. But she insisted. So here I am.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation and wanting to be respectful of my time, and I assure you, I don't judge. It’s good you’re being responsible, and many people request testing for similar reasons – peace of mind, partner reassurance, or just general health screening. We take all requests seriously. To help me understand your situation a little better – and to make sure we do the appropriate testing – could you tell me a bit more about when you might have been exposed, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Exposed? Look, I already told you, I haven’t been exposed. This is… frankly a bit insulting. I’m a married man. I don't go around… well, never mind. It's none of your business, is it? You're asking a lot of personal questions for a simple test. I just want the test, can we just do it? Honestly, the whole thing is a bit ridiculous. She just reads too many articles online.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Jacquille. That wasn’t my intention at all. I’m asking because “exposure” isn’t always what people think, and understanding your history helps me determine the best testing approach and timeframe. It’s not about judgment – it’s about providing the most accurate and helpful care. However, I respect your boundaries. We can certainly proceed with the HIV test without going into further detail. To start, do you have any known allergies, especially to latex or any medications?
PATIENT: Latex? No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with… gloves or anything. I've had the usual vaccinations, I think. You know, the ones they give you when you're a kid. Tetanus, maybe? And flu shots, occasionally. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. My wife handles all the medical stuff. She's very… organised. So, no allergies. Can we just get this over with? It’s wasting my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. And it sounds like you've had standard childhood vaccinations, and occasional flu shots. That's helpful to know. To be thorough, and just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I eat reasonably well, try to get some exercise. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. My wife keeps trying to get me to take vitamins, but I refuse. All that stuff is just marketing hype. So, no. Nothing at all. Are we still doing this questionnaire? This is taking a very long time for a simple blood test.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements, that’s good to know. I understand your frustration with the length of the questions, Jacquille. I just want to be as complete as possible, and make sure we're doing the right test and interpreting the results correctly. Alright. Before we move on to the physical part, let me quickly check your vitals – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. That’s standard procedure. Then we can proceed with the blood draw for the HIV test. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, I have things to do. Vitals, whatever. It’s not like I’m sick or anything. I’m a perfectly healthy man. Just… hurry up, please. This is a complete waste of my time, honestly. I still think my wife is overreacting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as quick as possible. Your blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Those are all within the normal range. Everything looks good so far. Now, for the blood draw. We'll just need a small sample to run the HIV test. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Left arm is fine. I'm right-handed, so left arm is better. Just don't poke around too much. I hate needles. Honestly, I'm only doing this to appease my wife. It's ridiculous, really. A perfectly healthy man getting a pointless blood test. Just... get it over with quickly, please. And try not to make a mess. I don’t want to have to sit here for hours with a bandage.
DOCTOR: Alright, left arm it is. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, I promise. I'll use a clean technique to minimize any discomfort. And I'll have a bandage ready to apply afterwards. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure here for a moment. There you go. Keep that bandage on for at least an hour, and try to avoid heavy lifting with that arm for a bit. The lab results should be available in about 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them when they come in, or I can give you a call. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A call is fine. Honestly, I don't want to come back here if I can avoid it. It’s a complete waste of time. Just call me. And it’s probably negative anyway. I told you, I’m a perfectly healthy man. Just call. And make sure it's a quick call. I don’t have time for long conversations. My number is... There. Now, can I go? I really have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I have your number noted. I’ll call you as soon as the results are in – I promise to keep the conversation brief and to the point. Yes, you're free to go now. Thank you for coming in, Jacquille. If you have any questions or concerns before the call, don't hesitate to reach out to the clinic. Have a good afternoon. .
PATIENT: Right. Thanks.
