DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just… tired. Real tired. And I… I eat dirt now, okay? Not like, want to, but I do. It started a few months ago, I guess. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when. It’s just… happening. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: “Eat dirt?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Like… clay. From the garden, sometimes. And… I found some good stuff near the old construction site. Don’t look at me like that! It just… feels good going down, okay? It’s hard to explain. And it's not like I'm enjoying it. It's just… a thing I do when I'm really tired.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… unusual. And when you say "tired," can you describe that?
PATIENT: Unusual? I’m unusual now? Look, I don’t know what you want me to say. Just… heavy. Everything feels heavy. Like I’m dragging weights around all day. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And it doesn't matter how much I sleep. It's just… always there. And then… I crave the dirt. Honestly, it sounds crazy even saying it.
DOCTOR: It is a bit concerning, yes. And craving non-food items—what we call pica—can sometimes indicate an underlying issue. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings, or changes in your appetite besides this?
PATIENT: Pica? Is that what you call it? Fancy. No, just the dirt. I used to like sweet things, you know? Chocolate, pastries… But now, nothing really tastes good. It’s all… bland. And I don't really feel hungry, not like I used to. Everything just feels… off. My stomach feels… empty, even when I’ve eaten something.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I'm tired! I told you that. Is that not a symptom? My hands… sometimes they shake a little. Not all the time, but mostly when I'm really worn out. And... I think I've been a bit more forgetful lately. Like, I can't always remember where I put things. It's probably just… old age.
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness and shaking… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Ugh, really? Look, I don't spend my days thinking about my… you know. It's… normal. I guess. Maybe a little… different? Like, I haven't been… regular. Some days it's okay, some days it's… not. Honestly, it's nothing I've paid much attention to. This is… very personal, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand it's personal, Ms. Cantoran. But these details are important. It helps me understand what might be going on. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… Maybe? I haven’t been on a scale in ages. My clothes feel a little looser, I guess. But I haven’t been eating much, so… yeah, probably. It’s not like I’m wasting away or anything, but… I’m not as… solid as I used to be, if you know what I mean. Look, can we please hurry this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, Ms. Cantoran. Just a basic check. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It'll just take a few minutes. Would you mind stepping up there for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Just try to be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a bit low, 100/60. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, with mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses palpated. Skin appears pale, and I notice some slight swelling in the ankles. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, iron studies, and a thyroid panel. I also want to check your vitamin D levels. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Look, I don't have insurance, you know. This is going to cost me a fortune. What exactly are you looking for? And what’s the point of all this if you’re just going to tell me I’m old and tired?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns about the cost. We can discuss payment options with the billing department later. As for what I'm looking for, the blood work will help us determine if there's an underlying cause for your fatigue, cravings, and other symptoms. It could be an iron deficiency, a thyroid problem, or a vitamin deficiency, among other things. The dirt-eating—the pica—can be a sign of several different conditions. We need to rule out potential medical causes before we can determine the best course of action. It's not simply a matter of you being "old and tired." Do you consent to the blood work?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Do what you have to do. Just… don’t keep me here all day. And I swear, if this turns out to be nothing, I’m sending you the bill for my wasted time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the lab technician come in and draw the samples. It shouldn’t take long. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. I want to rule out any underlying digestive issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. We also need to address the pica. It can be harmful, and it's important to understand why you're craving dirt. It's possible there's a nutritional deficiency we're not detecting with basic blood work.
PATIENT: Gastro… what-ologist? Look, I don't need another doctor poking around in me. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? This is getting ridiculous. You’re sending me all over town for tests… what if it’s nothing? I’m a widow, I don’t have anyone to drive me to all these appointments.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns. It is a lot, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. However, we need to be thorough to figure out what’s going on. A gastroenterologist specializes in the digestive system and can help us determine if there are any underlying issues causing your symptoms, including the dirt-eating. As for getting to appointments, we can explore resources to assist you with transportation. Many community organizations offer ride services for seniors. We can also discuss the possibility of a home health visit if that would be more convenient. It’s better to be safe and rule out potential medical problems than to ignore them and potentially let them worsen. I truly want to help you feel better, and that requires some investigation. Would you like me to connect you with our patient resource coordinator to explore transportation options?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Okay, fine. Just… don’t give me a list of things I have to do myself. I’m tired enough as it is. If someone can drive me, that’s all I want. But honestly, I don't see how any of this is going to help. It's dirt. I eat dirt when I'm tired. What more is there to figure out?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have someone reach out to you. In the meantime, let's discuss some things you can do at home. It’s important to stay hydrated, even if you don't feel thirsty. And I want you to try to eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t have much of an appetite. We’ll get the blood work results back within a week, and then we can discuss the next steps. I understand you're skeptical, but I assure you, we’re doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on. Please try to focus on taking care of yourself in the meantime. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get it over with. The tests, the appointments… just let me know when I need to go. And please, have someone who can actually drive me. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I'll have the lab technician come in shortly for the blood work. Someone from our resource coordinator's office will be in touch regarding transportation. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they become available. Thank you for your time. Please let us know if you have any urgent concerns before then.
PATIENT: .
