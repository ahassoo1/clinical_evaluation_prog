DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, dear. Piet, you say? Well, it's… it's about this foot business, I suppose. Though I really don't see what all the fuss is about. People walk on their feet all the time, don’t they? It’s just… well, they want me to do things. And I don’t hold with all that poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s perfectly alright to feel that way. Sometimes it's hard to explain what’s bothering us, and sometimes tests are unnecessary. But let's just talk about what's going on with your foot for a moment. Can you tell me more about this “foot business”?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a little ache. Comes and goes, mostly. Been going on… oh, goodness, I can't rightly say how long. A while. It’s not crippling, you know? I still get around. I went to church just last Sunday, and I walked the whole garden afterward. Though Mildred does keep telling me I’m slowing down. Mildred's always got something to say. It's probably just old age, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little ache that comes and goes. And you've still been able to do your usual activities, like going to church and gardening. That’s good to hear. You mentioned it might be old age – and that can certainly contribute, but it's still good to check things out, just to be sure. Now, where exactly on your foot is the ache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it’s… well, it’s on top, I think. Near the… the straps of my shoe, maybe? It’s hard to say. My shoes are comfortable enough. I've had them for… years. They don’t pinch, not really. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull throb. Sometimes. Honestly, I’m not even sure I’d be here if they hadn’t insisted. All this Medicare stuff, you know? They want you to go to every specialist under the sun.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the ache is on top of your foot, near where the straps of your shoe are. And it's a dull throb, not a sharp pain. That’s helpful. Just to get a better picture, does it hurt more when you're walking, or when you're resting?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… it’s funny, isn’t it? I don’t think it’s worse when I’m walking. Though Mildred says I favor that foot. She’s always watching, that woman. No, I think it bothers me more… when I’m sitting. Especially if I’ve been up all day. It’s just a little nagging, you know? Nothing to write home about. Really. I just don't want them to start cutting on me or something. I've seen enough of that in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it bothers you more when you're sitting, especially after being on your feet all day. And you're understandably concerned about any kind of surgery. That’s perfectly reasonable. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. I suppose… I suppose it can’t hurt to look. But don’t go touching too much. I don’t like that. And don't expect me to take off my stocking. It's a perfectly good stocking, and I’m not getting cold feet about this, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course not, Wynell. We can absolutely leave the stocking on. I’ll just take a gentle look. I’m just trying to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Okay, I’m just feeling along the top of your foot. Do you feel any tenderness in this area, specifically?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! There. Right there. That’s a little sore. Not terribly, but… yes. You're pressing on it now, aren't you? See? I told you it was sore. It's probably just a pinched nerve. My cousin Beatrice had a pinched nerve once, and all she did was sit with her feet up for a week. That's what I should be doing, not being poked and prodded by a… well, no offense, dear.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Wynell. And you're right, a pinched nerve is definitely a possibility. Feeling tenderness in that spot is helpful information. Okay, can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I haven't done that in years. Let me see... There. Is that good enough? It feels a little stiff, you know? My ankles aren’t what they used to be. Everything creaks. Just like an old house. It’s the weather, I think. Always makes everything ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. A little stiffness, and that’s understandable. And if you don’t mind, just stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you can. Just so I can see how you move. No need to rush.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But don't expect any miracles. There. See? I walk just fine. A little slow, maybe. And I lean a little, I suppose. But that’s just… me. I always have leaned. My sister always said I had terrible posture. She was always criticizing something.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You're walking, but I notice you are favoring your right foot a little, and leaning slightly. It does look like you're compensating a bit. Alright, Wynell. Based on what you've told me and what I've seen during the exam, it sounds like you might have a bit of arthritis in the top of your foot, and potentially some mild nerve compression. The walking and the leaning suggest some compensation for discomfort. It's not necessarily a severe problem right now, but it's good we're looking into it. Do you have any history of arthritis in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Arthritis… let me think. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she had terrible hands. Couldn’t even button her own coat. And my uncle, he had something in his knees. Always complaining about it. So, yes. Arthritis. It runs in the family, I suppose. It figures. Everything bad runs in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. A family history of arthritis certainly increases the likelihood. Now, have you tried anything to help with the pain so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What haven't I tried? Mildred keeps giving me these creams. Smelly creams. And I soak my feet in warm water sometimes. That feels nice, for a little while. And I try not to walk too much. But you know… you have to live your life. I can’t just sit in a chair all day. Though Mildred wishes I would. She's always saying I overdo it. She's a worrier, that one.
DOCTOR: I understand. Creams, warm soaks, and trying to pace yourself. Those are all good first steps. Alright, Wynell, I think we can start with a few things. I’m going to order some X-rays of your foot just to get a better look at the bones and confirm if there’s any arthritis present. I also want you to try over-the-counter pain relief – either ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to take them, following the instructions on the bottle. And I’d like to recommend some simple exercises to help strengthen your foot and ankle. I can have the nurse print you out a handout with those. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more things. Honestly. X-rays and pills and exercises… It all sounds like a lot of bother. But… I suppose if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like the sound of pills, though. I never have been good with pills. And exercises… well, I’ll try. But don’t expect me to be doing jumping jacks. And please, no strong smells. I get enough of that from Mildred’s creams.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no jumping jacks, Wynell. And we can certainly avoid anything with a strong smell. The X-rays will just give us a clearer picture, and the pills are just to help with the discomfort in the meantime, if you need them. You can always stop taking them if they don't agree with you. I’ll have the nurse print out the handout with the exercises, and she can also schedule your X-rays. Do you have any allergies to medication that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. I think I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin once, years ago. Itchy rash, I think. And I don’t do well with anything with codeine in it. Makes me terribly sleepy. Mildred tried to give me some once for a toothache, and I slept for two days. Two days! She never lived that down. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve lived a long life, you know. You pick up a few things along the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin and codeine. I’ll make sure that’s noted in your chart. So, we’ll avoid those. Alright, Wynell. I think that covers everything for today. The nurse will be in shortly with the exercise handout and to schedule your X-rays. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. Pills and X-rays and exercises… Just… try not to make it too complicated, dear. And please, no more poking and prodding. I think I’ve had enough of that for one day. Honestly. And tell Mildred to stop giving me those smelly creams.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. No more poking and prodding, and I'll certainly mention the creams to Mildred. We'll keep things as simple as possible. Thank you for coming in today. Please call if you have any questions, and have a good afternoon. .
PATIENT: Alright, dear. You too. And thank you... I suppose. It was… interesting. Though I still think it’s just old age. .
