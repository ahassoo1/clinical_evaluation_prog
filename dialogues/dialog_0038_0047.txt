DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Cleo. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh... well, it's about... long-term care, I think? My daughter, she set this up. Said I needed to get looked at for… insurance. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It’s been a bit of a blur since… well, since my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I understand, Cleo. It's perfectly alright if things are a bit hazy right now – grief can do that to anyone. And it's very thoughtful of your daughter to get this arranged for you. So, it sounds like this is partly a check-up, potentially for long-term care planning, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Planning… that’s what she said. I mostly just do what I can, day to day. I work down at the docks, moving stuff around. It keeps me busy. Not much thinking involved, which is good sometimes. I just want to make sure… well, make sure I can still do things, I guess. For as long as I can.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Cleo. It's good you're staying active. Working at the docks sounds physically demanding – that’s good for you, but also means we should check in and make sure everything's holding up alright. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what a typical day at the docks looks like?
PATIENT: Well… it's mostly lifting, you know? Crates, boxes… sometimes machinery parts. Not too heavy, usually, but it adds up over a day. Lots of walking too, back and forth. And… directing things. Making sure the right stuff goes on the right trucks. Been doing it for… a long time. Twenty years, maybe? Or longer. It all kinda blends together after a while. My back gets a little stiff sometimes, at the end of the day. Nothing major. Just… old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, twenty years is a good stretch of time doing that kind of work. And it's not uncommon to have some stiffness with that level of physical activity. Just to get a clearer understanding, could you describe the stiffness a little more?
PATIENT: Uh… it's mostly lower back. Starts kinda dull in the afternoon, and gets a little sharper if I bend over too much. Doesn't really go away completely, even after resting. I usually just take some… over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, I think it is. Works okay, mostly. It hasn’t stopped me from working yet, though. That’s the main thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back stiffness that's worse with bending, comes on in the afternoon, and you manage it with ibuprofen. And that's been going on for how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It's kinda come and gone over the years, you know? A little flare-up here and there. But… I guess it’s been pretty consistent for the last… six months, maybe? Since… well, since the weather got colder. Could be the cold. Makes everything ache, I think. Honestly, I don’t pay too much attention to it unless it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months of fairly consistent lower back stiffness, worsening with bending, and potentially related to the colder weather. That gives us a good starting point. Just to get a broader picture of your overall health, would you mind answering a few questions about other areas of your body?
PATIENT: No, no problem. Ask away. I don’t mind. I'm not much for complaining, usually, but I’ll try to remember things if you need to know. My memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take things at your pace. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Have you ever had any shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations – that’s a fluttering sensation in your chest?
PATIENT: Hmm… shortness of breath… not really. Sometimes when I’m walking up a big hill, maybe, but that’s just being out of shape, I think. Chest pain… no, not that I can remember. Palpitations… now what was that? Like your heart’s racing? I get a little winded sometimes, but I haven't noticed anything racing, no. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about fifteen years back.
DOCTOR: Good that you quit smoking, Cleo. That's excellent. And no chest pain or palpitations. Alright. Let's move onto your digestive system. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, boy… you’re asking a lot of questions. Uh… no nausea or vomiting. Constipation… sometimes, yeah. Especially if I don't drink enough water. Changes in bowel habits… I don't really pay attention to those things, to be honest. Old age, you know? Everything slows down. I just take some… something, from the drugstore, when I need to. Keeps things moving.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’re just trying to get a complete picture. Occasional constipation managed with something from the drugstore. Good to know. How about your urinary system?
PATIENT: Urinary system...? You mean… peeing? Uh… yeah, I pee. Everything seems… normal, I guess. No burning, no trouble going. I get up once or twice a night, maybe, but that's probably just getting old, too. Sorry, Doc, these are kinda personal questions.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Cleo. These questions are personal, and I appreciate you answering them honestly. It’s all part of making sure we understand your overall health. So, getting up once or twice at night to urinate – that's not uncommon with age, but we'll make a note of it. Now, one final section before we move on. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, hearing, or any numbness or tingling in your limbs?
PATIENT: Vision… not great. I need reading glasses now, started a few years back. Can’t see things up close anymore. Hearing… a little bit worse, maybe? My daughter always yells at me to turn the TV down. Numbness or tingling… no, not really. My hands get cold sometimes, working down at the docks, but that's just the weather. Everything feels pretty normal, all things considered. It's just… getting old, Doc. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo, thank you for answering those questions so thoroughly. It sounds like you're managing some age-related changes, which is perfectly normal. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… That’s a tough one. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years? Or more? I had… uh… pneumonia, once, a long time ago. And my wife… she had… well, she had a lot of things. But I don’t really remember what they all were. It was… a while back. I mostly just try to stay healthy, eat okay, and keep moving. I don't take any regular medications, except for the ibuprofen when my back gets bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, pneumonia in the past, and your wife had some medical issues. No regular medications besides ibuprofen for back pain. That’s helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Surgeries… uh… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That's about it, I think. And… I broke my arm once, when I was younger. Fell off a boat. But that wasn't a surgery. Just a cast. No other hospital stays, that I can remember. My wife… she had a lot more surgeries than me. I don't really remember the details, to be honest. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy as a child and a broken arm. Thank you for sharing that. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… My mom… she lived to be pretty old, I think. Eighty-something. My dad… he died when I was young. Heart trouble, I think. My wife’s family… her mom had… uh… something with her bones. Arthritis, maybe? I don't really know much about their medical history, to be honest. We weren’t very close. It’s been… a long time. I just know my wife was always… sick, towards the end. I’m not much help with this, am I, Doc?
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Cleo. It’s very common for family medical history to be unclear. You’ve given me what you know, and that’s perfectly alright. Now, one final few questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I quit smoking fifteen years ago, like I said. I don’t drink alcohol, never really liked it. And I definitely don’t use any… recreational drugs. I’m too old for all that. Just ibuprofen, when my back gets bad. That's all. I'm a pretty simple man, Doc. Mostly just work, eat, and try to stay healthy. And now, I guess, try to figure out this long-term care insurance. My daughter's been worried about me. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo, thank you for answering all those questions so honestly. That gives me a good starting point. It sounds like you're a very active individual, despite some age-related changes, and you take good care of yourself. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, Doc. My back’s been a little sore lately. And… I'm not much for needles. But I’ll do my best. I just want to make sure I can still take care of myself, for as long as I can. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Cleo. We’ll take things slowly and gently. And I’ll let you know before I do anything that might be uncomfortable. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll check your reflexes and range of motion. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. As long as you tell me what you're doing, I guess. I just… don't like surprises. And… please, be careful with my back. It gets stiff easily. And… I might need to sit down for a minute if I feel dizzy. I get lightheaded sometimes. But… go ahead. I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Of course, Cleo. We’ll take it very slowly, and I’ll be sure to let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. And if you feel dizzy at any point, just let me know, and we'll stop immediately. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. I’m just going to wrap this cuff around your arm… not too tight, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… not too tight. It feels… snug. But not too bad. Just… be quick, Doc. And tell me when you're starting. I just… don't like surprises. Go ahead. I'm ready. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo, I'm inflating the cuff now. You'll feel pressure on your arm for about 30 seconds. Just try to relax. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. I'm starting the reading now… 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically. Now I'm going to listen to your pulse… just resting here for a moment. 72 and regular. Good. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… I'm just going to place the stethoscope on your chest and back… it might be a little cool, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… cool… a little cool is fine. Heart and lungs… I haven’t really had anyone listen to those in a long time. Everything sounds… okay, I guess. Just… tell me if you hear anything strange. I just… don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra beats. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally—that means I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Breathing is normal and equal on both sides. No signs of congestion. That’s good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to gently tap on your tendons with this little hammer… it might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay?
PATIENT: Reflexes… Okay. Gently… that’s good. Not too hard, Doc. I’m not very good with surprises. Go ahead. Just… tell me what you’re doing. And… please be careful. My bones get brittle easily, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Just a quick tap here… and there. And here… good responses, 2+ bilaterally – that’s normal. Now, let’s check your range of motion. I’m going to ask you to move your arms and legs in different directions. Just try to move them as far as you comfortably can. I’m going to watch and see how easily you move. Okay?
PATIENT: Range of motion… okay. Just as far as I can… comfortably. Ooh… that's a little stiff. My shoulder gets tight easily. It’s probably just old age, Doc. Go ahead. Just… tell me if I'm doing something wrong. And… please be careful with my back. It gets sore easily, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. I see some limited range of motion in your shoulder and hip. It’s not drastically limited, but there is some stiffness and discomfort, especially with external rotation of the shoulder and flexion of the hip. That’s consistent with what you've described. No acute pain with movement, just some tightness. Your reflexes are normal and your lungs are clear. And your heart sounds regular. Just a bit of stiffness in the shoulder and hip that we may need to address. Now, one final quick check - I'm just going to feel your abdomen. It's to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Abdomen… Okay. Just… be gentle, Doc. I get… bloated easily. And… I have a little surgery scar down there. From when I was young. Just… don’t poke it too hard. Go ahead. Just… tell me if you find anything strange. I just… don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. I’m just feeling gently to check for any tenderness or masses. I feel a soft, old surgical scar in the lower abdomen—that’s not concerning. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender overall. No masses or guarding. Just a bit of bloating as you mentioned. Alright, Cleo. That completes the physical exam. Everything looks generally good. You have some stiffness in your shoulder and hip, some mild bloating, and an old surgical scar, but no acute concerns. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal, and your abdomen is soft. Now, let’s talk about what all this means and what we can do next. Do you have any questions for me before we start?
PATIENT: Questions… Uh… well… am I gonna be okay? Am I gonna be able to keep working? That’s the main thing. I need to keep working. And… is this all just old age? Is there anything I can do about the stiffness? Can you… fix it?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Cleo. And I understand your concerns completely. First, let me reassure you that overall, you appear to be in reasonably good health for your age. The stiffness in your shoulder and hip is likely multifactorial—that means it’s likely a combination of things, including age-related changes, some possible minor arthritis, and potentially some strain from your work. It’s not something we can “fix” completely, but there are definitely things we can do to manage it and improve your comfort and range of motion. As for whether you’ll be able to keep working, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn't be able to continue working, with some modifications if necessary. We'll talk about that in a moment. To get a clearer picture of the stiffness, I'd like to order some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. And I'd also like to get an X-ray of your shoulder and hip to see if there are any signs of arthritis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray… Uh… I don’t really like needles. And X-rays… are they safe? I’ve heard they can… you know… make you sick. Is it really necessary? Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong without all that? I just want to know if I can keep working. That’s all. And… how much is all this gonna cost?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Cleo. Needles and X-rays can be unsettling, and I want to assure you that both are very safe. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is minimal—less than what you're exposed to on a cross-country flight. And the blood tests are just a small sample to rule out any underlying conditions—it’s a standard precaution. I understand you're primarily concerned about being able to continue working, and I truly don’t believe these tests will change that—they are simply to give us a more complete picture and ensure we are managing your condition effectively. As for cost, I’ll have the receptionist check your insurance coverage and give you a detailed estimate before we proceed with anything. We can also discuss options for managing your condition without extensive testing if you prefer, but I would strongly recommend the tests to give us the most accurate information. If you’re still hesitant about the blood tests, we can certainly start with just the X-ray of your shoulder and hip. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Just the X-ray… Yeah… just the X-ray. That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And… as long as it doesn’t cost too much. Will the X-ray tell me if I can keep working? Can it show me if my bones are… broken? I just want to know… am I gonna be okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Cleo. Just the X-ray it is. That's perfectly fine. An X-ray won’t necessarily tell you if you can continue working—that's something we’ll assess based on your symptoms and the exam findings. But it will show us if there are any underlying issues with your bones, like arthritis or any fractures. It can help us rule out any structural problems that might be contributing to your stiffness. The X-ray itself is quick—it should only take about 10-15 minutes. As for cost, I’ll have the receptionist check your insurance coverage and give you a detailed estimate before we proceed. And to answer your question: based on my exam and your history, I don’t believe your bones are broken. But the X-ray will give us peace of mind and confirm that. I'll write an order for the X-ray now, and the receptionist will schedule you for an appointment. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and develop a plan to manage your stiffness and keep you working comfortably. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Just… let me know when I need to go. And… please, make sure they don't poke me too hard. I get… bruised easily. And… thank you, Doc. You’ve been very helpful. I just want to get back to work. That's all. I just want to be okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Cleo. I'm glad I could help. I’ll make sure the technician is aware of your concerns, and they’ll be very gentle. The X-ray technician will take good care of you. They will be mindful of your concerns. I'll have the receptionist schedule the appointment and give you all the necessary information. Once the results are in, we'll discuss them together and come up with a plan to help you stay comfortable and keep working. For now, are there any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve answered everything. Just… thank you again, Doc. I feel… a little better now. I just want to get back to work. Okay. I guess I’ll go talk to the receptionist. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Have a good day, Cleo.
