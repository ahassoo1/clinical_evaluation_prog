DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. I'm just…tired. Really tired. And I keep…eating dirt. It's stupid, I know. Don’t look at me like that. It just…happens. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Cantoran. It’s not stupid at all to want to explain what’s going on, and I appreciate you being honest. “Really tired” and…consuming dirt – those are certainly things we can explore. Just to clarify, when you say “really tired,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Explore? Look, I program machines, okay? CNC stuff. It's…complicated. But I'm always tired. Like, bone tired. Doesn’t matter how much I sleep. And the dirt…it just…feels good. Like something I need. I don't know why. It started a few months ago, maybe? Honestly, things are kinda blurry these days. Is this going to take long? I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: CNC programming – that is complicated work. And it sounds very physically and mentally demanding. Bone tired despite adequate sleep…and this urge to consume dirt, starting a few months ago… I understand you're concerned about time, and I'll do my best to be efficient. When you say it "feels good," can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, describing feelings. Fine. It’s…hard to explain. Like, when I eat it, it’s…calming? Like something’s missing, and the dirt fills it up. It's not a pleasant feeling, exactly, but it makes the tiredness…less bad. For a little while. And then I just…need more. It's weird, I know. Look, can we just get a pill or something? I don't want to talk about my feelings.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Cantoran. We don’t have to delve deeply into feelings if you’re not comfortable. We can certainly explore possible medical causes for what you're experiencing, and then discuss options. It's good you're acknowledging it's not a pleasant sensation, even if it provides temporary relief. Before we jump to medications, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. It helps me build a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the fatigue and this urge – anything with your appetite, your weight, your mood, or any unusual cravings besides the dirt?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay, fine. Changes…Let me think. My appetite is…shot. I barely eat anything. And yeah, I’ve lost weight. Probably. I don’t really bother looking anymore. Mood…what mood? I’m just…always tired and cranky. I guess. And…oh! I get these headaches. Bad ones. Sort of behind my eyes. They come and go. Is that important? And no, I haven't been sick or anything. Just…tired. Look, I really need to get back to work. This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Reduced appetite, weight loss, consistent fatigue, irritability, and headaches behind the eyes – that’s helpful information. The headaches are definitely important. Before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Look, I haven't been to a doctor in…years. Honestly, I don't even remember. I had…chickenpox when I was a kid, I guess. And…my husband, he…passed away a few years ago. He had…something with his heart. That's about it. I don't do…illnesses. I just work. And now I eat dirt. Is that on the test? Look, can we just skip this and give me something for the tiredness? I have a deadline. A big deadline.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Knowing about your husband’s cardiac history is helpful, and the lack of recent medical care does give us a bit more ground to cover. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. No. Not that I know of. I eat whatever. Take whatever pill you got. I'm not picky. I really need to get back to work. This is ridiculous. I'm a perfectly capable person, and I'm wasting my time here talking about dirt and…feelings. Just…give me something. Anything. Look, can we just agree that I'm tired and I eat dirt and give me a prescription? I'll sign whatever you need me to. A deadline is a deadline.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand you’re under a lot of pressure and frustrated with the time this is taking. However, I can't simply prescribe medication without a proper assessment. Providing a prescription without understanding the cause of your symptoms could potentially be harmful. Given your symptoms – the persistent fatigue, weight loss, unusual craving for dirt , and headaches – it’s important to rule out several possibilities. These symptoms could indicate a variety of underlying issues, some of which are quite serious. Would you allow me to perform a physical exam and order some basic blood work?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood work? Seriously? Look, I hate needles. And physical exams? I just…no. I don't need to be poked and prodded. I'm telling you, I'm just tired! Maybe I work too much. Maybe I need a vacation. Why does everything have to be so complicated? I’m perfectly healthy. I just eat dirt sometimes. Fine. Give me a vitamin. A big one. A B12 or something. That’s all I need. Please. I really need to get back to work. I'm losing money sitting here. This is insane.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your reluctance, and I respect your wishes. However, a vitamin alone is unlikely to address the underlying cause of your symptoms, and could even mask a more serious problem. Pica, especially in adults, is often associated with nutritional deficiencies, but it can also be a sign of other medical conditions. While I won't force you to undergo any tests, I strongly recommend we at least consider some basic blood work to check for iron deficiency, vitamin deficiencies, and other potential imbalances. We could also check a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. It would give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. If you’re absolutely opposed to blood work, I can offer a limited physical exam – checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick neurological assessment. But without further investigation, I'm unable to provide a safe and effective treatment plan. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Fine. But only the bare minimum. No poking and prodding. Just…check the basics. Heart, lungs…whatever. And no needles! Absolutely no needles. I swear, if you even mention a needle, I'm walking out. I have a deadline! A big deadline! Just get it over with, so I can go back to work. And don't expect me to come back. This is a one-time thing. A one-time, extremely reluctant, bare-minimum thing. Now, let's just get it over with. The faster you do it, the faster I can go. Don't talk to me about feelings. Don't ask me about my life. Just…check. And go. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I understand. We’ll keep it brief and focus on the basics. No feelings, no life story, just a quick check of your heart, lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. First, I’m going to take your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes and coordination. Could you please sit back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Here. Just get it over with. And be quick. Seriously. I have a deadline. A big one. And don't be surprised if I'm grumpy. I haven’t slept in days. This whole thing is ridiculous. Just…hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Relax your arm for me, please. Just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. Slightly elevated, but not concerning in the context of your stress. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Deep breath. It's hard to relax when I have a deadline looming over my head. This is all a waste of time. Just…hurry. I can feel my blood pressure going up just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. I’m detecting a slight murmur, which could be related to anxiety or dehydration. Your lungs are clear, but I do notice slightly labored breathing. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment. I’m just going to check your reflexes and coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Follow the finger. This is so stupid. I program machines, not…play eye games. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Good. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Squeeze. Like this? Is that tight enough? Honestly, I have better things to do than play hand games. Just tell me if I’m healthy or not and let me go. A deadline is a deadline.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your grip strength is normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap your knees with this small hammer. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little brisk, but within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Based on this brief examination, your vital signs are slightly elevated, likely due to stress. Your heart sounds are normal, but a little fast. Your lungs are clear, but you're breathing slightly labored. Your neurological assessment is normal. However, the murmur, labored breathing, and your reported fatigue and pica are concerning. While I can't definitively diagnose anything based on this limited examination, I strongly recommend some blood work to rule out any underlying issues, such as iron deficiency, anemia, or other nutritional deficiencies. I also suggest a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Would you be willing to consider those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Fine. But just the blood work. No X-rays. Absolutely no X-rays. I don't want radiation or whatever. Just…get the blood work done and tell me if I'm healthy or not. And hurry! A deadline is a deadline!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Just the blood work it is. I understand your concern about radiation. We'll proceed with a comprehensive blood panel, including a complete blood count, iron levels, vitamin levels, and a metabolic panel. I’ll write you a lab order now. The lab is just down the hall – the front desk can direct you. They’ll need your insurance information, but since you mentioned being uninsured, we can explore options for financial assistance. The results usually take 24-48 hours. I'll also give you a list of resources for stress management, as that could be contributing to your symptoms. And, while we wait for the results, I recommend prioritizing rest and hydration as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Ugh, questions? No. Just…the blood work. And tell me how to get to the lab. And hurry! I have a deadline.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The front desk staff can give you specific directions, but it’s the first door on the left after you pass the waiting room. They’ll need your photo ID and this lab order. They also have information about payment options if you need it. I'll have my assistant call you with the results in 24-48 hours. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe fatigue – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Thank you for coming in, Ms. Cantoran. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. .
