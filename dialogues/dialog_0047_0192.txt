DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, right. It's... the army thing. The exam. Gotta get it done, you know? They want me to take this test before… well, before anything happens. Seems like a waste of time, honestly, but my wife said I should. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Right. The army… a pre-employment physical, is it?
PATIENT: Employment? No, no. Recruitment. Big difference. I'm not looking for a job, I'm… well, it's complicated. It's for the… the forces. Look, does it matter? I just need a piece of paper saying I'm fit enough. Don't need a whole life story written down, do I? I'm a strong lad. Always been. Worked with engines my whole life, you know? Builds character.
DOCTOR: Complicated, alright. And you're hoping for a quick assessment, then. While I understand your… eagerness, Mr. Hartness, a proper medical examination is vital, even for recruitment. It’s not just about if you’re strong, it’s about identifying any potential issues that could be problematic down the line. It's for your safety, and the safety of others. Now, let's start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems – anything at all that bothers you?
PATIENT: Problems? No. Not really. Bit of a bad back sometimes, after a long day bending over engines, but who doesn't have a bad back? It’s just… aches. Rub some cream on it, it's fine. And I get tired, but that's just… being 51, isn't it? I don't go running marathons, if that's what you're thinking. Don't need to be a super athlete to fix a carburetor. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with anything. You just need to sign the paper.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, with all due respect, “rubbing some cream on it” isn’t a medical assessment. Back pain can indicate a number of things, and fatigue can be a symptom of various underlying conditions. We need to rule those out. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never been to a doctor before this, not unless you count when I broke my arm when I was a kid. Fell out of a tree, stupid thing. Healed fine. Look, I’m a practical man. I fix things. I don’t have problems. I just need a signature, like I said. Is that so hard? You’re wasting my time and my wife's money. She doesn't like these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to conduct a thorough examination. This isn’t about wasting time; it's about responsible medical practice. We need to understand your medical history to ensure you’re fit for the demands of… service. Let’s start with your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, who keeps track of that? My father smoked too much, that’s about it. He coughed a lot. And my mother… well, she just got old, like people do. No fancy diseases or anything. They both worked hard, that’s all. Look, I’m telling you, this is a waste of time. You ask me about my carburetor, maybe I could help you. I'm good with engines, really good. This… this is ridiculous. Are you sure you're even a real doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, that is incredibly disrespectful. I assure you, I am a fully qualified physician. And while I appreciate your… mechanical skills, they are not relevant to this examination. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Why would I be taking medications? I told you, I don’t have problems. I eat good food, work hard, sleep enough. That's all you need. I might take a painkiller if my back really bothers me, but that's it. Some cheap stuff from the store. Doesn’t even work very well, to be honest. This whole thing is just… I don't know. Is there a shorter form? Maybe just a quick blood pressure check and a signature? I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I’m going to ask you one more time to cooperate. “Cheap stuff from the store” is not a medical history. We need to know what you’re taking, even occasional painkillers, because they can interact with other conditions and affect your health. And I cannot simply sign a form without conducting a proper assessment. Now, let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My father did, like I said, but I always told him it was stupid. Waste of money and bad for your lungs. I drink a beer sometimes, with dinner, maybe a couple on the weekend. Nothing fancy. Just… normal. This is getting ridiculous. You’re treating me like I’m some sort of… sick person. I feel perfectly fine. A bit tired, maybe, but who isn't? Can we just… be done with this?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Since you insist you are in perfect health, let's at least perform a basic physical exam to confirm that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Then, we’ll proceed with a quick weight and height measurement. Please remove your shirt and sit on the examination table. I must insist you do this so I can complete the assessment.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect anything. I'm telling you, this is a waste of time and money. And don't go poking around too much. I don't like being touched by strangers. Honestly, the army is getting soft if they need this much paperwork for a simple recruitment. It’s just… engines, that's all I need. Engines and a wrench. Now, hurry up. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: “Your reflexes are a bit sluggish, Mr. Hartness. And your blood pressure is slightly elevated – 148 over 92. That's not ideal. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.” “Anything?
PATIENT: A bit tender, maybe. I get heartburn sometimes, like I said. Too much coffee, probably. And a bit of indigestion if I eat something rich. Nothing serious. It's just… old age creeping up, I suppose. Don't make a big deal out of it. Honestly, I don’t see what this has to do with fixing a carburetor. My stomach’s always been a bit sensitive. A bit of pressure, it’s nothing. You’re making me nervous, poking around like that. Just sign the paper. Is that so hard? It’s just a piece of paper.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply disregard these findings. Your elevated blood pressure, sluggish reflexes, and abdominal tenderness are all cause for concern. I need to order some blood tests to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. We also need to rule out any potential underlying heart problems with an EKG." “I’m going to write you a requisition form for these tests. You’ll need to go to the lab down the street. And I strongly advise you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on your recruitment application until we have a clearer picture of your health status."
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! You’re serious? This is ridiculous! Blood tests, EKGs, cardiologists… for joining the army? I’m perfectly fine! I’ve been working hard my whole life, haven’t had a day off sick in years. This is a waste of my time, my money, and my wife’s money! I don't need a fancy doctor telling me I'm sick. This is… this is the last straw. Forget it. Forget the army, forget the tests, forget everything. Just… just give me the paper and I'll be on my way. A simple form is all I need. I'm not dealing with this anymore. .
DOCTOR: "Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically sign a form stating you are fit for duty without a proper medical assessment. It would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I have a duty to protect your health, as well as the safety of others. While I respect your decision to decline further testing, I strongly advise you to reconsider. I can provide you with a list of affordable cardiology clinics and labs in the area. I also suggest you discuss these concerns with your wife. “I will document my findings and my recommendation for further investigation in your chart. Good day, Mr. Hartness."
