DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here today regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the requirements for wearing masks and other protective equipment. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Right, an exemption... regarding work requirements. I see. And what specifically is making it difficult for you to comply with the mask and equipment protocols?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… difficult to explain concisely. It isn't a physical ailment, not exactly. I experience a significant… discomfort, a feeling of being restricted, when I have things covering my face for extended periods. It causes me a great deal of anxiety, and it ties back to… historical experiences with my people. It’s a deeply rooted feeling, and I find it very upsetting. It affects my ability to focus and do my job safely, both for myself and those I serve. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Historical experiences… I understand that can certainly have a profound impact. It sounds like this is causing you significant distress. So, to clarify, it's not a typical allergy or breathing problem, but a psychological response triggered by face coverings?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is precisely it. It is not a physical reaction, no allergies or trouble breathing. It's… a response within myself. A feeling of being… contained, and it brings up difficult memories and emotions. It makes it hard to think clearly, and I worry about making mistakes when I'm feeling this way. It’s a very personal matter, but it’s impacting my work. I apologize if it's hard to understand; it's not something easily explained.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright, Mr. Knabenshue. I appreciate you sharing this with me. It’s important to understand the full picture. And you're not wrong, these things aren't always easily explained. Hmm… Do you have any history of anxiety or have you sought any mental health support in the past for this, or related issues?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. I have not been formally diagnosed with anxiety, if that's what you mean. I have always been a private person, and I haven’t really discussed these feelings with anyone until now. I’ve tried to manage it myself, mostly by… avoiding situations where I am required to wear a mask. But that is becoming increasingly difficult with the requirements at work. I haven’t sought professional help, no. This is a new development, really, in the sense that it’s interfering with my job.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it’s a relatively new impact on your daily life. And you haven’t been formally evaluated for anxiety or similar conditions. I understand. To be thorough, and before we discuss possible exemptions, I do think it would be helpful to get a better understanding of your overall mental health. Would you be open to a brief screening questionnaire, or perhaps a referral to a mental health professional for a more comprehensive evaluation?
PATIENT: That is… understandable, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. A full evaluation sounds… perhaps a little overwhelming at the moment, if I’m honest. A brief questionnaire might be a good starting point, if it’s not too intrusive. I’m willing to try that, yes. I just… I'm a little worried about what it might reveal, to be perfectly frank. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Knabenshue. It is a vulnerable thing to explore these feelings. The questionnaire is simply a tool to help me understand where you're at, and it’s not a diagnosis in itself. We can take things at your pace. Let me pull up a standard anxiety screening form on the computer here… It will mostly be multiple-choice questions about how you’ve been feeling over the past two weeks. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds manageable. Multiple choice is… less daunting than a full conversation right now. Two weeks feels… contained enough, I suppose. Thank you for being so understanding. I appreciate you not pushing me into anything I’m not comfortable with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here you go. Take your time. There’s no rush. I’ll be here if you have any questions while you’re completing it. Just answer honestly, to the best of your ability.
PATIENT: … Alright. This first question… it asks about feeling nervous or anxious. Yes, I… I have felt that. More often than I’d like, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for completing that, Mr. Knabenshue. Let me review these results… Hmm… The results indicate a moderate level of anxiety. Not a definitive diagnosis, of course, but it does suggest further evaluation would be beneficial. It doesn't necessarily mean you have a clinical anxiety disorder, but it does indicate you're experiencing significant distress. Do you have any questions about the results?
PATIENT: Moderate… That’s… not entirely surprising, I suppose. It confirms what I’ve been feeling, at least. No, Doctor, I don’t think I have any questions about the results themselves. It just… feels a little overwhelming to have it written down so plainly. What does this mean for my request for an exemption? Is that still a possibility? That was, ultimately, why I came here today.
DOCTOR: Right. The exemption. It's… complicated, Mr. Knabenshue. Legally, and ethically, simply feeling discomfort isn't usually sufficient grounds for a medical exemption. But given your cultural experiences, and now these screening results suggesting underlying anxiety, it changes the picture somewhat. I wouldn’t be comfortable providing a blanket exemption without further evaluation by a mental health professional, though. They can provide a more definitive assessment and, if appropriate, recommend accommodations. Would you be open to a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist?
PATIENT: … I had hoped to avoid that, if I’m honest. But… I understand your position, Doctor. I don't want to put you in a difficult situation. And I suppose a professional opinion would carry more weight. Yes, a referral would be… acceptable. Do you have anyone you would recommend? Someone who… understands cultural sensitivities, perhaps? It's important to me that I feel comfortable with whomever I speak with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s a very valid point. I have a few colleagues I can recommend. Dr. Evelyn Red Cloud is a psychiatrist who specializes in Native American mental health and has a strong understanding of historical trauma. She’s located about 20 minutes from here. Alternatively, there’s Dr. Ben Carter, a psychologist, who has experience working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds and a trauma-informed approach. I can provide you with their contact information and websites. Would either of those sound suitable?
PATIENT: Dr. Red Cloud… that name sounds… familiar, in a good way. If she specializes in Native American mental health, that would be… ideal, yes. Please, if you wouldn’t mind, Doctor, could you provide me with her contact information and website? And thank you. For everything. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad I could help, even if it’s just to point you in the right direction. Here you go. This has Dr. Red Cloud’s contact information, website, and a brief summary of her practice. I also included a form for you to request your medical records, should you wish to share them with her. In the meantime, I recommend trying to avoid situations that exacerbate your anxiety as much as possible. And remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Sham, I believe that is all. This is… a good starting point, I think. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. I will reach out to Dr. Red Cloud and see what the next steps are. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, truly. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mr. Knabenshue. Take care of yourself. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns in the future. .
