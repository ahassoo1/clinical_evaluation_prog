DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been noticing a… a lump, I guess you could call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s a bit concerning, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright, a lump in your lower abdomen. That's good you're getting it checked out. Hmm… and how long exactly have you noticed this lump?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it's been maybe four or five weeks now? It wasn't very noticeable at first, just felt a little different. But it's definitely grown a bit over the last couple of weeks, and now I can feel it pretty clearly.
DOCTOR: Okay, four to five weeks…and it’s been gradually getting larger. Has there been any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain at all. It doesn't hurt to touch, or when I move around… nothing like that. That's part of why I waited a little to come in, honestly. If it hurt, I would have come right away. It’s just… it’s there, and it’s new.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. It’s good it’s not painful, but new lumps are always worth investigating. Have you noticed any other changes along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. My… bowel movements have been pretty normal, I suppose. No changes in weight, no fatigue… nothing else that I can think of. I haven’t been feeling unwell at all, just a little… anxious about what it could be.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes in bowel habits, weight stable, no fatigue. Just anxiety, which is perfectly reasonable. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to anything before, as far as I know. I don't take any regular medication either, just over-the-counter pain relievers if I need them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and no regular medications. Good. Now, have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had… chickenpox when I was a child, like everyone else, and a broken arm once when I was quite young. Nothing major, nothing that required ongoing treatment or anything like that. My family history… my mother had high blood pressure, but that’s about it, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no significant medical history on your end, mother had high blood pressure. And you mentioned a broken arm as a child, any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries at all. The broken arm was just a cast for a few weeks, thankfully. Nothing needed… cutting into. It healed fine on its own. Is that information helpful, Doctor? I’m happy to provide anything else you need.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very helpful, Amy. Thank you. Now, to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We’ll just gently feel your abdomen to assess the lump. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. I understand that's part of the process. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amy, I'm just going to press gently here. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m feeling… yes, I can feel a distinct mass in your lower abdomen, roughly… two centimeters in diameter. It feels… fairly firm, but not particularly hard. It doesn't seem to be causing any tenderness when I press on it. It appears to be slightly mobile. I'm also listening to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. Do you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn't hurt. It feels… well, it feels like the lump, but nothing more than I've been feeling myself. It's not painful at all, just… there. You mentioned it’s mobile… does that mean it can move around? What does that… signify? I’m probably asking silly questions, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No, not silly questions at all, Amy. It’s good you’re asking. Mobility means I can gently move it slightly with my fingers, which can be a good sign. It suggests it's not fixed to underlying tissues. However, it doesn’t tell us everything. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I think an ultrasound of your abdomen would be a good first step. It’s non-invasive and will give us a better look at the size, shape, and characteristics of the mass. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, an ultrasound sounds… sensible. If that’s what you recommend, then please do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Will I need to do anything to prepare for it? And… roughly when would I be able to get that done? I have a choreography workshop next week, and I'd like to avoid scheduling it during the appointment, if possible.
DOCTOR: Good. An ultrasound is a good first step. You shouldn't need to do any special preparation for it; you can eat and drink as normal. The clinic has appointments available on Monday and Wednesday of next week. We can likely accommodate either day. Would either of those work for you?
PATIENT: Wednesday would be better, actually. It gives me a little more flexibility with the workshop schedule. Wednesday afternoon, if that’s possible? And… what happens after the ultrasound? Will you be able to tell me the results immediately, or will I need to wait? I apologize for all the questions. I'm just a little anxious, as you know.
DOCTOR: Wednesday afternoon is perfectly fine, Amy. Let me schedule you for 2:00 PM. And as for the results, the radiologist will review the images, and I'll receive the report within 24 hours. I'll then contact you to discuss the findings and what the next steps should be. It’s unlikely we’ll have a definitive answer immediately after the scan, as it takes time for proper review. But I’ll do my best to get back to you as quickly as possible. Now, do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that answers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me, and I feel a lot more… at ease, honestly. Knowing what to expect next is a big help. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. We'll take things one step at a time. If anything changes or you experience any new symptoms before your appointment, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed and your appointment information. Have a good day, and I'll see you on Wednesday.
