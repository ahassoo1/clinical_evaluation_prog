DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be perfectly honest, it’s a bit difficult for me to recall all the specifics, but I believe I’m here for a check-up before… before a surgery? A cosmetic one. I apologize for the vagueness; things haven’t been the clearest lately.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic surgery, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It… involves my face, I think. I’m so sorry, it’s frustrating not to have a clearer memory of it all. My husband… he handled most of the arrangements. It was a while ago now. He… passed away shortly after, and I haven’t really had the… energy to revisit things. Is that alright? It’s probably a bit… disorganized, my explanation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like you've been through a great deal. It’s perfectly understandable that things are… hazy. We'll take things slowly. Before we delve into any specifics about the surgery, let's just start with a general overview of your health. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t believe so. I was generally quite healthy, I think. I used to be very active, gardening mostly. And my husband was very particular about regular check-ups… though I’m afraid I don’t recall the results of those either. I do take a daily vitamin, if that counts for anything? And, honestly, I haven’t seen a doctor in… quite a long time. Is there a way to… check? Perhaps a record somewhere? I apologize for being so… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Let me pull up your records here. Ah, yes… it says you had a physical with Dr. Ramirez about five years ago. Mostly unremarkable – standard blood work, cholesterol within normal limits, blood pressure slightly elevated but manageable. No significant findings noted. And you mentioned a daily vitamin – is that over-the-counter, or prescribed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief to hear it was unremarkable! My husband always worried, you see. And the vitamin… it’s just over-the-counter, a standard multivitamin. I’ve been taking it for years, just a general health thing. He felt it was important. He was always very proactive about these things. I really appreciate you looking everything up for me; it’s a weight off my mind, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another tricky one. I don't think so, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never really had a strong reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything, and I haven’t had any issues with medications in the past, to my knowledge. Is it possible to… check if there are any notes on file? I'm so sorry for being such a… puzzle.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Brightful. We'll piece things together. The records are… sparse. No documented allergies. Let’s move on to medications. Aside from the daily vitamin, are you currently taking anything else – prescription drugs, herbal supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else. Just the vitamin, as I said. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. I prefer a natural approach, if that makes sense. My husband… he was the one who usually dealt with any prescriptions if they were necessary. I truly don’t recall taking anything regularly, aside from that. It's all a bit… blurred, honestly. Is it alright if we perhaps focus on the surgery itself now? If that's possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. You mentioned a cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… the most difficult part. It was something to do with my face… a lifting, perhaps? Or around my eyes? I really wish I could be more specific. I remember discussing it with the surgeon, of course, but the details are… fragmented. My husband said it would improve my… appearance, make me feel better. He handled all the appointments, the pre-op tests... I simply trusted him. Is there a way to find out which surgeon it was? Perhaps they would have a record of the procedure?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Brightful, I find it rather… unusual that you have so little recollection of a surgical procedure. It's a significant event, and generally patients have at least some memory of the details. Let me see if I can locate a record of the surgeon based on your name and approximate date of the procedure. But frankly, your lack of recall is concerning. It may be worthwhile to discuss this further with a specialist in… cognitive function. Have you experienced any other memory issues recently?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. I hadn’t thought of it that way. No, I haven’t experienced any other… issues, not that I’m aware of. Just… this. The gaps. It’s mostly related to things around the time of my husband’s passing, and… the surgery. I just assumed it was the grief, the stress. It’s been… a difficult few years. Are you suggesting there might be something… wrong? I assure you, I’ve always been quite… sharp. And I truly do apologize for being so unhelpful. I wish I could provide more information. Perhaps the surgeon’s records would shed some light on it all? I would be very grateful for that.
DOCTOR: Let me see… searching for surgical procedures performed on Mackenzi Brightful in the past five years… Ah. Here we are. You underwent a facelift and upper blepharoplasty – eyelid surgery – with Dr. Alistair Finch on July 12th, 2022. He’s a plastic surgeon in the city. We can obtain your records from his office, though it may take a few days. In the meantime, I recommend a neurological evaluation to assess your memory issues. I’ll write a referral order. And frankly, Ms. Brightful, it's rather irresponsible to pursue further cosmetic procedures without a clear understanding of your medical history and a stable cognitive state.
PATIENT: July 2022… Dr. Finch… I… see. I suppose it makes sense. He was very… persuasive. A neurological evaluation… yes, of course. If you think it's necessary. I just… wanted to feel better. I didn't realize it would… lead to this. And I apologize for any inconvenience. I truly do. But pursuing further procedures... No, I don't think that's a good idea. Not until… until I understand what's happening. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. Even… the difficult news.
