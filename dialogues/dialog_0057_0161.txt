DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I come talk about… something to help prevent HIV. She said it was a good idea, just to be safe. I don't really know much about it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very smart of you to be proactive about your health, and your friend is right to suggest we talk about HIV prevention. There are several options available, and we can discuss what might be right for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your current risk factors?
PATIENT: Risk factors… hmm. Well, I’m single, haven't been with anyone long-term in a while. And you know, just… dating can be unpredictable. I’m careful, but… things happen. I guess that's what my friend meant. I mostly just want to be prepared. I don't want to end up regretting anything, you know? Is that… a risk factor? Just being a single woman?
DOCTOR: That is a perfectly valid concern, Helaina, and it's good you're thinking about this. Being sexually active is a risk factor, yes, and it’s very responsible of you to consider preventative measures. It doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong, just that it’s important to be informed and take precautions. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, good. I was worried I was sounding silly. Well… it's not constant, if that makes sense. I date a little, go out sometimes. Mostly just casual things, a few dates here and there. It's been… maybe two or three different people in the last year? Nothing serious. And I always… I always use protection. Condoms, usually. But my friend said there was something more I could do. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Using condoms is excellent—that significantly reduces your risk. Your friend is right, there are other options available, primarily Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PrEP. It's a daily medication that can prevent HIV infection. Before we discuss PrEP in detail, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture of your health history. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I think… maybe three or four times in the last five years? My doctor at the time suggested it regularly, just as a precaution. Always negative, thankfully. I can give you dates if that helps? I remember vaguely when I had them, just because I had to keep track of it for paperwork.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Helaina, and very responsible of you to stay on top of that. Knowing your status is crucial. Dates would be helpful, if you recall them. Even a rough estimate is fine. While you're thinking about that, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I have high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I take a small dose of lisinopril every day. And I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but other than that… I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I walk a lot, try to eat well, you know? Nothing major. And I'm on Medicare now, so I get regular checkups. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. High blood pressure, controlled with lisinopril, and a gallbladder removal ten years ago. And being on Medicare is helpful. Are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years, for colds, the flu, little things. Never had a reaction, thankfully. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don't think that runs in the family… or at least, I've never had any problems with it. I'm usually pretty good with medications, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and no reactions to penicillin. That's good. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Didn’t really enjoy it, honestly. And I've never been much for smoking or anything like that. Just not my thing. I prefer a good cup of tea, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Helaina. That's very healthy. Okay, one last few quick questions, then we can talk about PrEP in more detail. Can you tell me about any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… My father had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my mother had… arthritis, pretty bad towards the end. Oh, and my grandmother on my mother's side had heart disease. Other than that… nothing really springs to mind. It wasn't a very health-conscious family, if that makes sense. We didn't talk about this stuff much.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your father, arthritis in your mother, and heart disease in your grandmother. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Helaina, now that I have a better understanding of your health history, let’s talk about PrEP. Do you have any questions about it before we get started?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, a lot! What exactly is it? My friend just said it was something I should look into, but she didn’t really explain how it works. Is it a shot? A pill? And… are there side effects? I’m a little worried about adding another medication to my routine, to be honest. I already take something for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Helaina, and it’s good you’re asking them. PrEP stands for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It's a daily pill – currently, there's only one formulation approved in the US. It contains two medications that, when taken consistently, are highly effective in preventing HIV infection. Think of it like taking a vitamin every day to stay healthy. It doesn't protect you from everything, but it dramatically reduces your risk. As for side effects, most people don’t experience any. However, some people can experience mild nausea, diarrhea, or fatigue when they first start taking it. These side effects usually go away within a few weeks. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, such as kidney problems, but these are uncommon and we monitor for them with regular blood tests. We would start with blood tests to ensure you're a good candidate for PrEP, and then discuss if it’s the right choice for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay, a daily pill. That’s… not as bad as I thought. But blood tests… what are you looking for exactly? And how often would I need those? I worry about going to the doctor all the time, to be honest. It's a hassle, with everything. And... what if I forget to take it? Does it still work if I miss a dose now and then?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Helaina. The blood tests are to check your kidney function – to make sure you're healthy enough to take the medication – and to confirm you don’t already have HIV. We also check for other sexually transmitted infections, like syphilis and gonorrhea, just as a precaution. If everything looks good, we would start you on the medication. We’d need to repeat the HIV test every three months, just to make sure the medication is working and you haven't contracted the virus. We also do a general health checkup and STI screening at those visits. As for forgetting a dose… consistency is key for PrEP to be effective. Missing a dose now and then isn’t the end of the world, but it can reduce the effectiveness of the medication. If you miss more than a few doses, it’s best to contact me and we can discuss whether you need to be re-tested. We can also talk about strategies to help you remember to take it – setting an alarm on your phone, for example. Does that help address your concerns?
PATIENT: Okay, three months for the HIV test, and STI screening. That’s… manageable, I think. And setting an alarm, yes, I could do that. So, if I take the pill every day, and get tested regularly, it will really protect me? How much protection are we talking, exactly? Is it 100%? Because nothing is ever really 100%, is it?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about that, Helaina. Nothing in medicine is ever truly 100%, and PrEP is no exception. However, when taken consistently as prescribed, PrEP is highly effective. Studies have shown that it reduces your risk of acquiring HIV by over 99% when taken daily. It's important to remember that PrEP only protects you against HIV. It doesn’t protect you against other sexually transmitted infections, like gonorrhea or chlamydia, so it’s still important to practice safe sex, like using condoms. And consistent use is key. If you miss a lot of doses, the protection decreases significantly. Would you like me to explain the medication itself a little more?
PATIENT: Okay, over 99%... that's pretty good. And yes, I understand about the other STIs, I've always used condoms. Yes, please. What exactly is in the pill? And what does it do to my body? I worry about side effects, even if they're rare. And... will it interact with my blood pressure medication? That's a big concern.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, those are very important questions. The pill contains two medications: tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine . They work by blocking an enzyme that HIV needs to replicate, so the virus can't establish an infection. As for side effects, most people experience none at all. However, some people can experience mild nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, or headache when they first start taking it. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, such as kidney problems or decreased bone density, but these are uncommon and we monitor for them with regular blood tests. Regarding interactions with your lisinopril, the risk is generally low. However, both medications can affect kidney function, so we would need to monitor your kidney function closely if you start taking PrEP. I can also check a drug interaction database to be certain there aren’t any unexpected interactions. It's always best to be cautious. To summarize, PrEP is a highly effective medication that can dramatically reduce your risk of acquiring HIV, but it’s important to be aware of the potential side effects and monitor your kidney function closely. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. So, regular blood tests for my kidneys, and you’ll check for interactions with my blood pressure medicine. Okay… it sounds… a lot. But also, like it could really help. What happens next, if I decide to try it? Do I need to get more blood work now? And… how much does it cost? I’m on Medicare, but I know they don’t cover everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a lot of information, and it’s good you’re thinking it through carefully. If you decide to try it, the next step would be to do some more comprehensive blood work. This will include a complete blood count, a chemistry panel to assess your kidney and liver function, an HIV test to confirm you’re negative, and STI screening. We’ll also need to get a baseline urine analysis. Regarding cost, Medicare does generally cover PrEP, but there may be copays or deductibles depending on your specific plan. I can have our billing department check your coverage and give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. They can also help you explore any potential assistance programs if you’re concerned about affordability. And of course, we won’t start you on the medication until we’ve reviewed all the results and discussed them with you in detail. It's important you feel comfortable and confident with this decision. Would you like me to go ahead and order those blood tests, or do you need more time to think about it?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Let's go ahead and order the blood tests. It's probably best to just get it done and see what the results say. It doesn't mean I have to start the medication, right? If the results aren't good, or if I change my mind, I don't have to do anything?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Ordering the blood tests doesn’t obligate you to start the medication at all. It simply gives us information about your current health status. If the results aren’t good, or if you change your mind at any point, we can discuss other preventative options or simply not proceed with PrEP. I'll write the orders now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. They’ll need you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and answer any questions you may have. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now, or any concerns you’d like to address before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I was really worried about this, but I feel a lot better now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here to answer any questions you have along the way. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if anything comes to mind. We'll get those tests scheduled, and we'll talk soon. Have a good day, and take care.
