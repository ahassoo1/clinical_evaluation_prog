DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's this… this mess with my stomach. It's been going on way too long, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. I really don't have time for this, you know?
DOCTOR: "Things," you say. Right. Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. Can you be a bit more specific about what 'things' you've tried?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. Herbal teas, those yogurt drinks… I even tried that bland diet my sister-in-law swore by after her stomach issues. It was awful. All I want to know is what's causing this and how to stop it, not what I should be eating or drinking. I just want it gone. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask, Ms. Woodring. But to figure out what's causing it, I do need to ask some questions, and yes, that includes what you've been eating and drinking. It’s all connected. Let’s start with the actual symptoms. When did this start?
PATIENT: Honestly, it feels like forever. Maybe a month? A month and a half? It started gradual, just a little… off. Now it's… constant. And it's not just a little off, it’s… well, you can imagine. I don’t really keep track of dates, to be frank. Is that important? It's just… diarrhea. A lot of it. And it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: A month to a month and a half of diarrhea… alright. And you said it started gradually?
PATIENT: Yes. It wasn’t sudden. I didn’t wake up one day just… having it. It built up. First it was just a little softer than normal, then more frequent, and now… well, now it’s a problem. Look, I'm a painter, okay? I need to be able to work. I can’t be running to the bathroom every hour. It's impacting my livelihood, not just my… comfort.
DOCTOR: A painter. I understand needing to be… regular, for lack of a better word, to maintain your work. Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Really? You need to ask that? No! Look, I’m not an idiot. If there was blood, I’d be at the emergency room. It’s just… watery. A lot of it. And it smells… awful. Honestly, it's humiliating. Are we going to get to the point of actually figuring out what’s wrong, or are you just going to ask me about my bathroom habits all day?
DOCTOR: I’m simply gathering information, Ms. Woodring. It’s necessary. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I’m tired, obviously. I haven't been sleeping well, running back and forth. And I’ve been a little… shaky, I guess. But that could just be from not eating properly. I've lost a few pounds, but honestly, I don't weigh myself regularly. Is that helpful? I'm really not good at this whole… symptom reporting thing. It all just feels awful.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, tiredness, shakiness, some weight loss… and you mentioned not sleeping well. Any fever, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: No fever. No vomiting. I did feel a little queasy a few times, especially after trying to eat something, but I wouldn't call it vomiting. Just… unsettled. It's mostly just this… constant, awful diarrhea. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s just something I ate. Though, I can’t think of what. I eat pretty normally. I’m a simple person. Look, can we just give me something to stop it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, while I understand your frustration, simply stopping the diarrhea without knowing the cause isn't responsible medical care. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. Have you travelled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Travelled? No! Where would I have travelled? I haven’t left the state in years. I’m a painter, remember? I work locally. This is ridiculous. I just want to feel normal again. Are you even listening to me? I need to get back to work. This is costing me money. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I am listening to you. And I understand your livelihood is important. However, dismissing potential causes without investigation is negligent. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease?
