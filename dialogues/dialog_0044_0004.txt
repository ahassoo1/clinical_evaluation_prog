DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Just here for my shots, like we talked about. Routine stuff, you know? Keepin’ up to date.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Routine vaccinations are important, absolutely. Just to confirm, we're discussing the standard adult vaccinations – tetanus booster, influenza, and pneumococcal, is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I mostly just remember the nurse mentioning a few, and somethin’ about flu season comin’ up. I don't really keep track of names, if I'm honest. Whatever keeps me healthy, I suppose. Is one of them the flu shot? That’s the one I was thinkin’ about mostly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Teah. Many people don't memorize the names! The flu shot is definitely on the list, especially with flu season approaching. Let me just take a look at your chart here… I see you've had your tetanus booster within the last ten years, which is good. And it looks like you haven't had a pneumococcal vaccine recently, so that’s likely one we’ll discuss today as well. Do you have any allergies to vaccines or any medications in general?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of, no. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes with mosquito bites, but nothin’ serious. And I take somethin’ for my arthritis, but it’s just an over-the-counter thing, you know, like ibuprofen when it flares up. Not a regular thing, though. Mostly try to manage it with heat and movin’ around.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know – no known vaccine allergies, and just occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. That's helpful. And just to clarify, when you say “arthritis,” do you have a specific diagnosis from a doctor, or is it more of a general ache and pain?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been diagnosed. Years ago now, actually. The doctor said somethin’ about osteoarthritis, in my knees mostly. He gave me some exercises to do, but honestly, I'm not very good at keepin' up with 'em. That's why I mostly just use the heat and try to stay active when I can. It just gets stiff sometimes, especially when it’s cold or damp.
DOCTOR: Okay, osteoarthritis in the knees, diagnosed previously. I understand about the exercises – they can be tough to stick with! We can talk about that a bit later if you'd like, and maybe find some resources that are easier to incorporate into your routine. But for now, let's focus on these vaccinations. Have you had the flu shot every year?
PATIENT: Usually, yes. My husband reminds me, mostly. He's good about that sort of thing. Sometimes I miss a year if I’m feelin’ run down, or if it’s a really bad winter and gettin' out is hard. But I try to get it as often as I can. I figure it’s better safe than sorry.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, and it's wonderful you have someone looking out for you. Consistency is key with the flu shot, since the strains change each year. Okay, it looks like your last flu shot was in October of 2023. So you are due for one now. Before we proceed, are you experiencing any symptoms currently – fever, cough, body aches, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' like that. Feelin’ pretty good, actually. Just a little tired sometimes, but that’s just gettin’ older, I suppose. No cough, no fever, nothin’ a good night’s sleep can’t fix. I was just a bit achy yesterday after helpin' my granddaughter with some gardenin', but that's it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Teah. A little soreness after gardening is perfectly normal. Alright, sounds like you’re a good candidate for the flu shot today. I’m going to give you the high-dose flu vaccine, since it's recommended for people over 65. It provides a stronger immune response. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, high-dose, huh? Sounds good to me. Whatever works best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s gonna pinch a lot! I'm not terrible with needles, but I don't exactly love 'em, either.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s a standard pinch, similar to any other injection. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll get your arm cleaned with an alcohol swab, then a quick injection, and then a bandage. Just relax your arm for me… This will just take a moment.
PATIENT: Okay… here goes nothin'. You're right, that alcohol does feel cold! Just tell me when it's done, alright? I'm tryin' to think of somethin' else... my granddaughter's birthday is comin' up, gotta remember to get her a present. She's eight, and obsessed with horses right now.
DOCTOR: All done! See?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that did pinch a bit more than I remember. But it’s over now, right? Good. Horses are a big deal, you wouldn't believe. She can tell you every breed, every color… It’s kinda impressive, honestly. So, what’s next? Pneumococcal, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, we talked about the pneumococcal vaccine. It protects against pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections. There are different types, and based on your age and health history, I recommend the PCV20 vaccine – one dose is all you need. It's generally very well-tolerated. Are you familiar with the pneumococcal vaccine at all?
PATIENT: Pneumo… I think I've heard of it, maybe on the news? Somethin' about older folks gettin' sick with pneumonia? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not the best at rememberin' all these medical things. Is it somethin' I really need? I mean, I haven't been sick with pneumonia or anything. I just get a little sniffly sometimes in the winter.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, and it's good you're asking. Even if you haven't had pneumonia, the pneumococcal vaccine can help prevent it, especially as we get older. Your immune system weakens over time, so this vaccine gives it a boost. It also protects against other serious infections, like meningitis and ear infections. The CDC recommends it for all adults over 65. We can look at the potential side effects if you'd like, but they are usually mild – soreness at the injection site, maybe a little fatigue. Is that somethin' you'd be interested in?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. So, it’s just a little extra protection, basically? And the side effects aren’t too bad? Alright… if it's recommended, and you think it’s a good idea, then I guess I'm okay with it. I trust your judgment. Just… please tell me if it's gonna pinch as much as the flu shot! I'm startin' to feel a little nervous again. Maybe talk to me while you do it? Just distract me a little. What kinda doctor are you, anyway? Egyptian, you said? That’s pretty cool. I’ve never met an Egyptian doctor before.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's a little extra protection, yes, and the side effects are typically mild. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible with this one, and I promise to talk to you to distract you. And yes, I am Egyptian. My family emigrated here several generations ago, but we still have strong ties to our heritage. I specialize in internal medicine – basically, I take care of all sorts of adult medical issues. And I can assure you, this pinch is usually a little less noticeable than the flu shot. What about you, Teah?
PATIENT: Well, I'm Tlingit, born and raised here in Alaska. My family's been here for… well, forever, practically. We’re pretty tied to the land and the water. I used to work construction, building stuff, but my knees aren’t what they used to be, so I had to switch to inspectin' things instead. Less physical, you know? It’s good work, though. Makin' sure things are safe for people. Okay… ready when you are. Go ahead. And thanks for talkin’ to me, Doctor. It really does help.
DOCTOR: All done! See?
PATIENT: Ooh, that wasn't bad at all! Really. Not bad at all. You're very good, Doctor. Much better than the nurse I had last time. Well, I think that's everything, isn't it? Both shots done. What happens now? Do I need to come back for anything? And do you have any advice for me? Besides gettin’ more sleep, which my husband tells me all the time. He's always worried about me.
DOCTOR: Excellent! I'm glad it went smoothly. And yes, that’s everything for today. No need to come back for anything unless you develop any concerning symptoms – fever, severe pain, redness, or swelling at the injection sites. As for advice… Staying active is good, but listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard, especially with your arthritis. And I know your husband worries about you, which is lovely. Getting enough rest and staying hydrated are important. I also have some information on managing arthritis that I can print out for you, if you'd like. It covers gentle exercises, heat and cold therapy, and over-the-counter pain relief options. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor. The arthritis information, I mean. Always good to have more ideas. And no, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You explained everything really well. Thank you so much for your time and patience. You’re a very kind doctor. I guess I’ll just head home and take it easy. Maybe have a cup of tea and watch some TV. A nice, relaxing day, hopefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teah. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could help. And a relaxing day sounds perfect. Here you go. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns or questions later on. And if you ever need a referral to a specialist for your arthritis, we can certainly arrange that as well. Have a wonderful day, Teah, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I will. You too. And thank you for bein’ so patient with my questions. You’ve been a big help. Bye now!
