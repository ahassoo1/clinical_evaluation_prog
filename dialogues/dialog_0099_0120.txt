DOCTOR: Right, Carmaleta Villarreal. 43 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. I just… want to make sure any pregnancy I have goes smoothly. No problems. I lost my husband a few years back, and… well, I'd like to try again. I don't want any complications, you know? I just want it easy. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Easy isn't exactly a medical term, but I understand. Preconception planning is sensible. We want to optimize things, certainly. Losing your husband must have been difficult, and it’s good you’re thinking about this now. Let's start with the basics. Have you been actively trying to conceive, or are we just… preparing for when you do?
PATIENT: Preparing, mostly. It hasn’t… been a focus, if that makes sense. It's been a while since I thought about all that. I just figured I’d get checked out before anything happens, so there aren’t any nasty surprises. Honestly, I don't really want to get into the details of why I'm doing this now. It's personal. Is there a test I need? Let's just get that done, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. I respect your privacy. Though, knowing a bit about your medical history does help me ensure a smoother pregnancy, should you conceive. But we can proceed as you wish. Before ordering anything, let's just quickly run through a few things. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Not that I remember. It was all… a long time ago. Maybe I had my appendix out when I was little? I don’t know. My husband always handled all that paperwork. I really don’t keep track of that sort of thing. Is it important? I feel like we're going in circles.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Villarreal. Knowing what's happened medically in the past helps me assess your risk factors. An appendectomy is useful information, yes. Alright. We’ll proceed with a basic panel then, but it will be less comprehensive without a more detailed history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I take a multivitamin, that's about it. Look, are we sure I need to remember everything? I'm not a doctor! I just want to be told if there's something wrong, and then how to fix it. This is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Tedious, perhaps, but necessary. I understand you'd prefer a quick answer, but proper medical care requires a certain level of detail. Very well. Let's move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he didn’t approve. And frankly, neither do I. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's it. Really, I'm a very healthy person. I eat well, I walk… I just want a guarantee everything will be alright. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: A "guarantee" isn't something any doctor can provide, Ms. Villarreal. There are always risks involved in pregnancy. But we can certainly minimize them. Alright. Finally – and I apologize for asking, but it is important – what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to the sensitive stuff. Look, my mother had… something. I don't even remember what. She died a long time ago. My father was healthy, as far as I know. Honestly, it wasn't a very close family. I really don’t have much information. Can we please just get the tests done? I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Very well. A limited history will have to suffice. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. We'll also check your blood type and Rh factor. And I will order a urine analysis. While those results are pending, I'll schedule you for a physical exam. We need to assess your current health status. I’ll also order a Pap smear to rule out any cervical abnormalities, a standard part of preventative care, even when planning for pregnancy.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. How long will these tests take? And can I get the results sent to me electronically? I don't have time to keep coming back here. .
DOCTOR: The results will typically take 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. And yes, we can absolutely send them to you electronically through our patient portal. I'll have the nurse provide you with the necessary information to set that up. I'll see you for your physical exam next week, then. Please call the office to schedule a convenient time. And Ms. Villarreal, I strongly recommend thinking about your family history. It could prove crucial.
