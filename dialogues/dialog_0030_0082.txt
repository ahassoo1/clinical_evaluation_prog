DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh… yeah. I need… shots? For travel. My wife… she liked to travel. Now I… gotta go. Somewhere. I don’t… remember exactly where. It was her favorite place. Lots of… hot weather, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. It sounds like you need some travel vaccinations. Not remembering the specific location is alright, we can still figure out what you might need based on common destinations with hot weather. Just to be thorough, do you have any idea when you're traveling?
PATIENT: Soon. Very soon. Like… next week, maybe? I booked the ticket after… after everything. It’s… important. I think it was a package deal. Everything was done for me. I didn’t really… pay attention to the dates. She always handled that stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. That's perfectly alright. "Soon" is helpful. And it's common to rely on others for travel planning. Let's focus on figuring out what vaccinations you might require. To help me narrow it down, can you tell me anything else about this destination?
PATIENT: Hmm… water. Lots of water. And… monkeys? I think I saw a picture with monkeys. And… food smells good. Spicy food. She liked spicy. Really spicy. Everything was… colorful. Like a market, maybe? Lots of people. Loud.
DOCTOR: Okay, water, monkeys, spicy food, a colorful market... That’s helpful. Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like you might be going somewhere in Southeast Asia, possibly Thailand or Indonesia. To be certain and ensure you receive the correct vaccinations, let me quickly review your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… don’t think so. She always gave me the pills. Whatever they were. I never asked. Just took them. Sometimes they made my stomach… upset. But she said that was normal. I don't… know what they were.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s alright, we’ll work through this. Not knowing the medications you've taken in the past isn't ideal, but we'll proceed cautiously. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or a heart condition?
PATIENT: No. She kept me healthy. Lots of… vegetables. And walks. I’m… okay, usually. A little tired, maybe. But that’s… everything. I miss her cooking.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you were generally healthy. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Serious… illnesses? Not that I remember. Maybe a cold, sometimes. She gave me… tea with honey. That always helped. Surgery… no. Never had surgery. I… I don’t like doctors. She always went with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. Thank you for sharing that with me. It's alright to feel that way about doctors. We'll try to make this as comfortable as possible. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure you're generally healthy enough for travel. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Like… poking and prodding? She… she told me I was healthy. She always checked my… everything. I don't… I don’t know. Can’t we just give me the shots? I need to go.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Odell. I truly do. However, it’s important for me to assess your current health status before administering any vaccinations, especially since we have limited information about your medical history. It's a standard precaution to ensure your safety. The exam will be quick and relatively painless. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief visual assessment. We can take things slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Would you be willing to let me do a quick check-up?
PATIENT: Fine. But… quick. Very quick. And no needles right now. I… I need a moment. She… always held my hand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Odell. Quick and no needles right now. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I can certainly hold your hand if you’d like. First, let's check your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just… be careful. And don't take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relaxing your arm for me. Deep breaths. 130 over 85. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but that can be due to anxiety, especially with travel coming up. Now, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Sounds clear, but your heart rate is slightly elevated as well. Let's check your temperature. 98.6, normal. Everything seems okay so far, but the elevated blood pressure and heart rate are worth noting. Have you been experiencing any stress lately, besides planning the trip?
PATIENT: Stress? Everything’s stressful. Now. Before. After. She… she took care of everything. I don’t do stress. I… just go. She always told me not to worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've been through a lot. It’s common to experience stress after a loss. We can address that later, if you'd like. For now, let's focus on getting you prepared for your trip. Given your travel destination - potentially Southeast Asia with hot weather and monkeys - and the limited information we have, I recommend the following vaccinations: Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster, if you haven’t had one in the last ten years. We should also discuss Malaria prevention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hep… what? Malay… what? Too many words. I just need the shots. So I can go. She booked everything. Package deal, remember? Whatever they give everyone. Just… do it. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. We can certainly proceed with a standard travel vaccination package. However, I want to ensure you are fully informed. Hepatitis A protects against a liver infection contracted through contaminated food or water. Typhoid protects against a bacterial infection, also contracted through contaminated food or water. It’s important to be aware of these potential risks, especially in Southeast Asia. Malaria is a mosquito-borne illness, and we’ll need to discuss medication to prevent it. Before administering anything, are you comfortable with me calling the travel agency to confirm the specific destinations included in your package?
PATIENT: No! No calls. She handled everything. I… I don’t want to bother them. Just… give me the shots. And make it stop. This talking is… too much. She would have… just done it. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. I understand. We can proceed with a standard travel vaccination package, but I want to be absolutely clear: without knowing your specific destinations, we're making an educated guess. I strongly recommend you consult with the travel agency as soon as possible to confirm the locations and any specific health advisories. Before we proceed, I need to document that you've declined to provide more specific destination information and have requested vaccinations without a full assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Just… do it. Write whatever you need to write. I just want to go. Please. Stop asking questions. She… she would have just gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. I understand. I am going to administer the Hepatitis A, Typhoid, and a Tetanus booster, as a standard travel package. Please be aware that these vaccinations may cause mild side effects such as soreness at the injection site, fever, or fatigue. If you experience any severe side effects, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. I’m going to administer these in your left deltoid muscle. It’ll be a quick pinch. There you go, Odell. All done. Apply gentle pressure to the injection site. I will also provide you with a prescription for Malaria prophylaxis. Please start taking it as directed by the pharmacist. Odell, I want to reiterate my strong recommendation that you contact the travel agency to confirm your destination and any specific health advisories. Your health is my primary concern, and it’s important to be fully prepared before your trip. I’m also going to provide you with a referral for a grief counseling service. This can be a difficult time, and it’s important to seek support. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. You take care. And please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here are your discharge instructions and the referral information. Safe travels, and take care of yourself. .
