DOCTOR: Good morning, Ricky. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my foot, see? It’s been swelling up. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. Mostly my right one. It’s a bit hard to explain… it just… puffs up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit hard to explain is perfectly alright. We'll figure it out together. So, the swelling is mostly in your right foot, you said. And it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yeah, comes and goes. Not every day. Some days I hardly notice it, other days… oof. It feels tight, like my shoe is too small, even when it isn't. And it feels warm, sometimes. Not burning, just… warmer than my other foot. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ricky. Warmth can be a really helpful clue. And tightness is good to know too. When did you first start noticing this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe three, four months ago? Around April, I guess. It was just a little puffiness then, I didn't think much of it. Thought I maybe just walked too much one day. But it hasn't really gone away completely since then, and it’s been getting a little worse lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually around April, and has been slowly worsening. Have you noticed anything specifically that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question. Let me think... I think it's worse after I've been on my feet all day. I do a lot of walking, you see? My job… well, it involves going to people’s houses, doing paperwork for loans. Lots of walking and standing. And maybe… maybe if it's really hot outside? I can't say for sure, but I feel like it puffs up more on a hot day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so prolonged standing and potentially hot weather seem to be triggers. That's helpful. And you mentioned paperwork for loans... is this a new job, or have you been doing this for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not new. I’ve been doing this loan work for… goodness, almost ten years now. But they changed how we do things a little bit. Used to have an office, now we mostly go door-to-door. More walking, that’s the difference. Before I had a chair, you know? Now it’s mostly just… pavement.
DOCTOR: Right, a change in your work routine with more time on your feet. That definitely could be playing a role. Have you experienced any injury to your right foot – a sprain, a twist, anything like that – even a long time ago?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I remember. I might have twisted it once, years ago, playing football with the kids. But that was a long time ago, and it didn’t feel serious. I just rubbed it for a bit and it was fine. Nothing like a bad sprain or anything, never needed to see a doctor for it. I don’t think that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant injury that you recall. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any pain associated with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. More… achey. Like a dull ache, especially at the end of the day. It’s not sharp, it's not throbbing, just… uncomfortable. And it sometimes feels a little stiff, especially in the morning. It doesn't stop me from walking, but it's definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, achey and stiff, more uncomfortable than painful. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about other things. Do you have any other medical conditions - like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. I mostly stay active, eat okay… haven’t really needed to go. My mother had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but that was a long time ago and I don't think I got that from her. I just figured this was from all the walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you mentioned your mother had some joint trouble. Do you happen to know what kind of joint trouble it was?
PATIENT: She always called it…arthritis, I think? But she didn’t go to the doctor much either, so I don't really know what kind. It was mostly in her hands and knees, she said. She used to complain about them being stiff and achy, just like mine now, sometimes. She lived back home, you see, and things were different then. Not like here with all the doctors and tests.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of arthritis is helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it, you see? I just try to rest when I need to and power through when I have to. But this foot… it’s starting to slow me down a little. That’s why I came in.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, and you’re here because it’s starting to impact your daily activities. That's a good reason to get it checked out. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I eat everything, haven’t had any trouble with food, and never had a bad reaction to any pills I've taken in the past – which, like I said, isn’t often. Just the usual sniffles with a cold, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam of your foot and ankle. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It’s just… this foot, it’s a bit of a worry, you see? I need to be able to walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ricky, I'm checking for swelling, tenderness, and how well your foot moves. I do notice some swelling around your ankle and the top of your foot, as you mentioned. There's some mild tenderness when I press here, on the outside of your ankle, and here, along the top of your foot. Your range of motion is a little limited, especially when you bend your foot downwards. It doesn’t seem to be causing you any sharp pain at the moment, but it’s definitely restricted. I’m also checking the skin temperature, and it does feel slightly warmer than your other foot. Your pulses are good, and your skin color looks normal. I’m going to write all of this down in your chart. Now, based on what you've told me and what I'm finding on the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some early signs of a sprain or tendonitis, possibly aggravated by the increased walking and standing. It's also important to rule out other possibilities, so I'd like to get an X-ray of your foot just to make sure there isn’t a fracture or any other underlying bone issue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds sensible. An X-ray, yes. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, you see? And I want to be able to keep working. So, yes, an X-ray sounds fine. Is it… will it take long? I have a few appointments later today.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take too long, Ricky. The X-ray itself will only be a few minutes. We have a radiologist here in the clinic, so we can usually get the results back pretty quickly – within an hour or so. We’ll review them together as soon as they’re ready. In the meantime, while we wait for the X-ray results, I recommend resting your foot as much as possible, applying ice for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and keeping it elevated. You can also take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen if you’re experiencing any discomfort, as long as you don’t have any allergies or medical conditions that would prevent you from taking them. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Rest, ice, and those… ibuprofen pills. I think I've taken those before, no trouble with them. Okay. Rest, ice, pills. And wait for the X-ray. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It's… it's a bit of a worry, you see. I need my feet for work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ricky. And I understand your concern – your feet are your livelihood. We’ll figure this out together. Let me go ahead and get an order for that X-ray. I’ll have the technician come in and get you set up, and then we'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Just let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
