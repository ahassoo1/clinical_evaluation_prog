DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It’s… my stomach. It’s been puffy. Real puffy. Honestly, I don’t have time for a lot of questions, Doc. Just… bloated. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Bloated. Right. And how long has it been "real puffy," as you put it?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know. A while. Maybe a week? Look, things just are, you know? I don't sit around measuring my gut every day. It feels like it’s getting worse, that’s all. Is that good enough? I got stuff to do.
DOCTOR: A week. Okay. And is it… consistently puffy?
PATIENT: Consistently? What kinda question is that? Yeah, mostly. It goes down a little after… well, after things come out, if you have to know. But it comes right back. It's just… uncomfortable, alright? And embarrassing. I don’t need a whole explanation of gas, Doc. I’m a grown man.
DOCTOR: Right. And any pain associated with this… discomfort?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. More like… pressure. A heavy feeling. Like I swallowed a watermelon or somethin’. Look, I work hard, okay? Pile driver operator. It's not a desk job. Maybe it’s just… from the work? I don’t know. I really don’t spend a lot of time thinking about my insides.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You gotta ask all this? No. No to all of it. Look, it's just bloat, alright? I eat, I work, I bloat. Is that so hard to understand? I haven't been throwin' up or anything, Doc. Just… puffy. Can we please move this along? I got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in my… what now? Look, I don't analyze my… business, okay? That’s a really inappropriate question. It looks normal. Brown. What do you want me to say? I don’t need a detailed interrogation about my… waste products. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Any fever, chills, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I work hard, I gain weight. And no fever, no chills. Look, I haven’t been sick. I just… bloat. This is… I swear. What kind of doctor asks this many questions about… everything? It’s just gas, right? Can you just give me somethin’ for gas and let me go? Seriously. I'm startin’ to feel like somethin' is wrong, and it’s probably your questions makin’ me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick abdominal exam. Just gonna listen and feel around, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to hold still long. I got things to do, remember? Just… be quick. And don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is distended, as you mentioned. Mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, no guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are… present, but somewhat hyperactive. No masses palpable. Okay. Given your history and the exam… it could be simple gas, possibly related to your diet or workload. But, given the persistence, and the fact that you're a… larger gentleman, we should rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Larger gentleman? What's that supposed to mean? Look, are you gonna give me somethin’ for the bloat or not? I don't need a lecture about my weight from a doctor. I work hard for my build. And “other possibilities”? What other possibilities? Is this gonna be expensive? Just tell me if it’s somethin’ serious or not, Doc. I don’t have time for a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Kristofik, I'm just being thorough. Given your symptoms, it could be something as simple as dietary changes, or it could be something more serious, like irritable bowel syndrome, or even a… blockage. To rule those out, I'm going to order some blood work. Complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a liver function test. And, I recommend a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites. We'll also do an abdominal X-ray to get a better look at things. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: X-ray? Stool sample?! Are you serious right now? This is over bloated, Doc! I came in here for gas, not a full medical workup! I don't have time for all of this, and frankly, it's insulting. No, I do not have any allergies, and no, I don't have any "current medical conditions". I work hard and eat normal food. Forget it. I'm going home. I'll just deal with it myself. This is a waste of my time. .
