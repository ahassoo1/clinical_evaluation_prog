DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, honestly? It’s just… things aren’t right. Been feeling a bit off, you know? Sleep’s been… patchy. And I wouldn’t say I’m exactly brimming with energy these days. My wife… well, she always kept me on the ball, made sure I was looking after myself. Now… it’s all a bit much to keep track of, I suppose. Fitness… that’s a good one. I used to be pretty active.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult adjusting to new routines, especially with… life changes. Patchy sleep and low energy are certainly things we can look into. Could you tell me a little more about this “patchy sleep”?
PATIENT: Patchy… yeah. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning all night, every night. Sometimes I’m fine, I sleep alright. Other times… I wake up. Several times. And I don’t… bounce back easily, you know? Like it takes ages to feel properly rested. I don’t even know why I’m waking up. No noises, no discomfort… just… awake. It's frustrating, really. I used to be able to jump out of bed, ready to go. Now I just… lie there. And then I feel sluggish all day. Honestly, I don't even remember the last time I felt properly awake when the alarm goes off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent – some nights are good, others not so much. And when you do wake up, it’s difficult to get back to sleep, leaving you feeling unrefreshed. No obvious triggers that you’ve noticed, which is helpful to know. Just… awake. That’s… frustrating, yes. Now, aside from the sleep and the energy levels, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. My appetite's been a bit off, maybe. Not that I'm not eating, just… not as hungry as I used to be. I mostly eat what’s easy, you know? Don’t really have the motivation to cook anything elaborate. And… well, I've been a bit more… irritable, perhaps. Snapping at people over silly things. It's not like I want to be rude, it just… happens sometimes. My daughter keeps telling me to slow down, but honestly, I’ve got things to do. Instruments don't fix themselves, you know? It’s just… everything feels like a bit of an effort. I don't really sweat much anymore either. Used to get a good sheen on when I was working on a complicated repair. Now… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, increased irritability, and you’ve noticed a decrease in sweating, even during physical activity. That's good information to have. And it sounds like these changes have been happening gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, yes. It wasn't like one morning I woke up and suddenly felt this way. It’s been… creeping up on me, I suppose. A little bit worse each week. Like the colour’s been slowly draining out of things. I used to enjoy my work, really get lost in it. Now… it's just a job, you know? Something I have to do. And I feel… distant. Like I’m watching my life happen, rather than living it. My daughter keeps saying I should see someone, talk things through. But I’m not one for… emotions. Always been a practical man. Fix things, get on with it. That's how I was raised. I just want to feel… normal again, I guess. Able to sleep, have some energy, enjoy my work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, that’s not too much to ask at all. And it sounds like you've been carrying this for a while now, trying to push through. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things. And it’s perfectly alright to not be alright. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that’s okay. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Past conditions… hmm. Let me think. Nothing major, I don't think. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned it a few years back, put me on some tablets for a while. I stopped taking them eventually, felt fine. Just a bit… forgetful, sometimes. Always have been, really. My wife used to keep track of everything. I don't even remember the name of the tablets, to be honest. Nothing else, I don't think. A few aches and pains, as you get older, but nothing serious enough to bother a doctor about. I had a bit of a nasty flu last winter, knocked me off my feet for a week, but that was it. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Waste of time, if you ask me. Usually just… gets better on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication in the past, and some forgetfulness. And a bout of the flu last winter. We'll definitely take a look at your medical records to confirm the details. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment. Like I said, stopped taking the tablets for the blood pressure a long time ago. I don't really take anything, unless I've got a bad headache, and even then, it's just… paracetamol, I think? The regular kind. I try to avoid medication if I can. Always thought it was better to let things… run their course. My wife… she was the one who insisted on all the check-ups and pills. I just… went along with it, to be honest. Now… it's just me. And I don't really see the point in… bothering with it all, if you understand what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always asked me that question, every time I went to the doctor. I always told her no, and she'd write it down in her little notebook. I don't even remember what she wrote about me these days… it's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I used to be good with details, but… everything seems to slip my mind these days. It's frustrating, really. I feel like I'm losing… myself, bit by bit. I don't even know why I’m telling you all this, to be honest. Probably just… need to vent, I suppose. It's been a long few months.
DOCTOR: It’s alright to vent, Mr. Redfern. That’s what I’m here for. And it’s completely understandable to feel that way. You’ve been going through a lot. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or mental health issues?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. Let me think. My father had a bad heart, I think. Passed away when I was young, heart attack. My mother… she was alright, as far as I know. Just… old age, eventually. A few cousins had diabetes, I think, on my wife’s side. She kept track of all that sort of thing, in her notebook. I don’t really pay attention to family medical history, to be honest. Always thought it was… irrelevant. You know, everyone gets sick eventually. It's just a matter of time. I don't see the point in worrying about what might happen. I just deal with things as they come. My wife… she used to say I was too stoic. Perhaps she was right. I don't know. Everything feels… hazy these days. It's hard to remember details. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, that is not too much to ask. And I appreciate you sharing this information with me, even if it’s difficult. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, what's there to tell? I work. I repair instruments. I live alone now. I eat when I'm hungry, mostly simple things. I don’t really exercise. I used to walk a lot with my wife, but… that was before. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. I used to enjoy gardening, but… haven’t had the energy for it lately. It’s all just… routine, really. Wake up, work, eat, sleep. Repeat. Not very exciting, I know. I don't really have any hobbies or interests anymore. I used to enjoy listening to music, but… even that feels… empty these days. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels… muted, somehow. Like the colour’s been drained out of things. I just want to feel… something again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. I don’t usually talk about things like this.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Mr. Redfern. It's helpful for me to understand what a typical day looks like for you. And it sounds like a lot has changed since your wife passed away. Before we move on, I'd like to ask about your social support system. Do you have any close friends or family members you can rely on?
PATIENT: Social support… hmm. My daughter visits sometimes. She worries about me, keeps telling me I need to look after myself. But she’s got her own life, her own family. I don’t want to burden her with my problems. I’ve got a few acquaintances at the workshop, but… it's not really a close relationship. We just talk about work, you know? Nothing personal. I used to have a few friends, but… we’ve all drifted apart over the years. It's just… easier that way, I suppose. Less complicated. I don’t really like relying on people. Always been a bit of a loner, to be honest. My wife… she was my everything. Now… it’s just me. And I’m used to it, I suppose. Not that I like it, but… what can you do? I don’t want to bother anyone with my problems. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m repeating myself. Sorry. It’s just… everything feels so hopeless these days.
DOCTOR: You are not repeating yourself, Mr. Redfern. And you’re not a burden. It sounds like you've been carrying a lot on your own, and it's completely understandable to feel hopeless. Now, I think it’s time we do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. Just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical examination… alright. I suppose so. I haven't been to a doctor in years. I don't really see the point, to be honest. But… if you think it's necessary, then go ahead. I don’t really have anything to hide. I’m just… tired. Everything feels… heavy. What will you be doing? I don’t like needles, if that matters. And I get a bit faint sometimes. Just… let me know what you’re doing, alright? I don’t like surprises. Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling again. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling. And I understand your concerns. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a quick neurological exam – just to see how your reflexes and coordination are. We won't do anything invasive, and we'll avoid needles if we can. I'll let you know what I'm doing every step of the way. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as you explain everything. And no needles, if possible. I get… nervous. My wife used to hold my hand during check-ups. I don’t have anyone to hold my hand now. But… I suppose I can manage. Just… take it slow. Everything feels… heavy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just go home. It’s probably all in my head anyway. I’m just… old. And tired. And lonely.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling, Mr. Redfern. And it's perfectly alright to feel nervous. We’ll take it as slow as you need. I will be right here. And while it’s easy to dismiss things as simply being “old” or “tired,” it’s important to rule out anything else that might be going on. Let’s start with your blood pressure, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure, you said? Fine. Just… don’t startle me, alright? Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. Everything feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea. Close your eyes if you’d like. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m just inflating the cuff now. This might feel a little tight, but it won’t hurt. Just breathe deeply. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Heart and lungs… fine. Just… don't startle me, alright? Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Instruments to fix. Although… I haven't really been feeling up to it lately. Everything feels so… distant.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take a few deep breaths for me. In and out. Good. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit faint. I’m listening to your lungs now. Your lungs sound clear, but a little bit diminished on both sides. It's subtle, but I want to note it. Okay, that didn’t take long. Now, I’m just going to check your abdomen. Just to make sure everything feels normal. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Abdomen… fine. Just… don’t poke too hard, alright? Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. Is this going to take much longer? I have… things to do. Instruments to fix. Although… I haven't really been feeling up to it lately. Everything feels so… distant. I just… want to feel something again. Anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your abdomen for me. I’m just feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. This shouldn’t hurt. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I don’t feel any abnormalities. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam. Just to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Neurological exam… fine. Just… don’t expect much, alright? Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. Is this going to take much longer? I have… things to do. Instruments to fix. Although… I haven't really been feeling up to it lately. Everything feels so… distant. I just… want to feel something again. Anything. I feel… tired. And old. And lonely.
DOCTOR: Alright. This won’t take long at all. I’m just going to check your reflexes with a small hammer. Just relax your arm. Okay, your reflexes are a little bit diminished, but that’s not necessarily a cause for concern. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at my finger and follow it as I move it. Okay, your eye movements are normal. And finally, I’m going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps. Just to check your coordination. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Walk… alright. Just… be careful, alright? Everything feels… hazy these days. I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. Is this going to take much longer? I have… things to do. Instruments to fix. Although… I haven't really been feeling up to it lately. Everything feels so… distant. Just… take it slow. Everything feels… wobbly. I don’t like this. I feel… old. And tired. And… scared. Is this it? Is this what it feels like to… fade away?
DOCTOR: Alright, that's enough. Please, sit back down. You’re doing fine. It's alright. Okay, Mr. Redfern. That's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. I can see that this is a bit overwhelming for you. Based on the physical exam and what you’ve told me, and the fact that you mentioned slightly diminished reflexes and your gait is a little shuffling, and the faint heart sounds, I’m a little concerned about a few things. But I need more information to figure out what’s going on. Would you be willing to do some blood work and an EKG?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG…? More tests…? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m rambling. Sorry. Perhaps I should just… close my eyes? It always helps with the… the feeling. The heaviness. I just want to go home. Everything feels so… distant. I don’t want more tests. I just… want this to be over. Is there anything wrong with me? Are you sure? Everything feels so… distant. I just… want to feel something again. Anything. I feel… tired. And old. And lonely. I don't think I can do any more tests. I just… want to go home. I feel like I'm fading away.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, it’s okay. You’re not fading away. And I understand you don’t want more tests. But these tests aren't about finding something wrong with you. They're about trying to understand why you’re feeling this way, so we can figure out how to help you feel better. The blood work will help us check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. The EKG will check your heart rhythm. I’m not trying to overwhelm you, I promise. But it's important to be thorough. If we find something, we can treat it. If we don’t, at least we’ll know that’s not the cause. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: No… just… no. I don't want to know. I just… want to go home. I just want this to be over. I just… want to feel something again. Anything. I feel… tired. And old. And lonely. I just… want to go home. I just… want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask? Just… let me go home, Doctor. Please. I just… want to go home.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Okay. We can absolutely stop here. You’re right. You deserve to feel comfortable, and if you want to go home, we will. However, I’m still a little concerned about your symptoms, and I strongly recommend you speak with your daughter about getting a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. I can provide you with some resources and contact information. I understand you’re feeling overwhelmed right now, and I respect your decision. I’ll write up a summary of our conversation, and I’ll include my recommendations. Would you like me to call your daughter to let her know you’re heading home?
