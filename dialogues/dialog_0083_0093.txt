DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Redfern's the name. Honestly, it's a bit of a blur why I'm even here. Something about not sleeping well and...being a bit unfit? My wife, bless her, she used to handle all this scheduling. It’s all just...gone from my head, you know? It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be stressful when responsibilities shift unexpectedly. No need to worry about the details right now. Let’s focus on what’s going on with your sleep and fitness levels. Perhaps we can unravel things together. So, you've been experiencing difficulty sleeping. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Difficulty is... putting it mildly. It’s just…there’s a lot of nothing. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, for hours. Not exactly nightmares, just...blankness. And then I'm exhausted all day. It's a waste, really. I used to be able to work all day in the shop, no problem. Now... I just feel…old, I guess. Even though I’m not that old.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds quite frustrating to be lying awake with racing thoughts, or in this case, a lack of thoughts, and then feeling exhausted the next day. It's good you’re recognizing that this is impacting your daily life. When did this start, approximately?
PATIENT: Approximate…hmm. Honestly? It feels like it crept up after…well, after she passed. But pinning down when exactly? Impossible. Months, definitely. Maybe six? Or was it eight? Time…it just blends together these days. It wasn't immediate, though. It got worse gradually, you know? First it was just a bit of trouble drifting off. Now…it’s a proper ordeal. Honestly, I just wish I could remember the little things.
DOCTOR: I understand that grief can significantly disrupt sleep patterns and cognitive function, and it sounds like you’ve been dealing with a great deal. It's perfectly normal for things to feel muddled during such a difficult time. We'll take our time. Just to clarify, you mentioned this started gradually after your wife passed away. Has anything else changed in your life recently, besides that?
PATIENT: Changed…? Not really. Shop's still open, though business is…slow. People don't fix instruments much these days. Everything's digital. I still go in every day, tinker around. Keeps me busy, I suppose. Nobody visits much, but a few regulars still pop in. Besides that… No, not really. I mean, I try to keep things…the same. It's easier that way. Don’t see much of my family, to be honest. They…they mean well, but they don't get it. It's just…different, you know? It's always awkward.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're maintaining a routine, which is good, but also perhaps isolating yourself a bit, which is understandable given the circumstances. Let's shift focus back to your sleep for a moment. Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both?
PATIENT: Both, definitely both. Falling asleep is…a battle. Just lying there, mind blank, waiting for something to happen. And then, if I do manage to drift off, it’s not a proper sleep. It’s…shallow. I wake up a lot. Maybe three or four times a night? Sometimes more. And then, when I finally do get up…I feel worse than when I went to bed. It’s ridiculous, really. A waste of time, a waste of energy. I used to be a sound sleeper. Could sleep through anything. Now…it's like a switch flipped.
DOCTOR: That certainly sounds disruptive and exhausting. Frequent awakenings and feeling unrested despite the time spent in bed are significant concerns. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sleep difficulties?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Well, I’m tired, obviously. More tired than usual. And…I’ve been a bit…forgetful, I suppose. More so than usual. Not major things, just…names, dates. Little things. Like what I had for breakfast. Or why I went into a particular room. It’s annoying, mostly. And…I’ve not been very…motivated, I guess. Can’t really be bothered with much. The shop keeps me occupied, but…outside of that, I just…exist. It’s probably just old age creeping in.
DOCTOR: Those symptoms – fatigue, increased forgetfulness, and loss of motivation – are certainly worth exploring further. It’s good that you’re recognizing these changes. While it could be related to the grief and stress, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. Do you experience any difficulty concentrating during the day?
PATIENT: Concentrating? Absolutely. It's terrible. I'll be working on an instrument, and my mind just…wanders. I'll lose track of what I'm doing. I have to keep starting over. It’s not a major thing, usually, but it's frustrating. It takes me twice as long to do things. And…sometimes, I just blank out completely. Like someone switched off the lights. It's only for a few seconds, usually, but it’s unsettling. It's like my brain is…slow. It's not like it used to be, that's for sure. I'm starting to get worried, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. These difficulties with concentration and occasional blanking spells are significant. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, years ago. The doctor put me on something for it, but I stopped taking it after a while. Didn't like the way it made me feel. Besides that…nothing major, I don’t think. A few aches and pains, as you get older. Nothing that required any serious treatment. I went to the doctor regularly when my wife was alive, just for check-ups, but… I haven’t been much since. Honestly, I can't really remember all the details. It was all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason in the past?
PATIENT: Surgery… No, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but that was it. Just a cast. Nothing major. Hospitalized… hmm. Once, when I had the flu, years ago. But that was just overnight. Nothing serious. That's about it, I think. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. Until recently, anyway. It's all just… different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My father… he had heart trouble, I think. Died when I was fairly young. Sudden thing. My mother… she lived to a good old age, but she had…dementia, I think? Or Alzheimer's. Something like that. She didn't remember much towards the end. And… my sister, she had cancer, a few years back. Lung cancer. Didn't survive. Not a very healthy bunch, to be honest. It’s probably just in the genes.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of heart disease, dementia, and cancer is certainly important information. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched it. My wife hated it. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not much anymore. Lost my appetite, really. And… drugs? Absolutely not. Never even considered it. I'm a simple man, really. Just keep to myself, work in the shop. That's about it. Not much of a social life, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but I stopped, like I said. Vitamins… I think I had some multi-vitamins in the cupboard, but I haven’t taken them in ages. Honestly, I can’t even remember. Everything's a bit of a blur, you know? I just…don’t really bother with all that stuff. It all seems a bit pointless, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That’s very helpful information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will just involve checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination…? Oh. Right. Well…I suppose so. I'm not a fan of doctors, to be honest. Always poking and prodding. But… if you think it’s necessary. Just try to be gentle, alright? And… don’t expect much. I’m a bit… out of sorts, you know? It's probably just old age catching up with me. Let’s just get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Redfern. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. We’ll take it slow. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, and your rhythm is regular. Your breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished in the bases. Your blood pressure is 145/90, which is slightly elevated, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your reflexes are a bit sluggish, and your coordination seems slightly impaired. Your gait appears slightly unsteady. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions now to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me the current date?
PATIENT: The current date…? Oh dear. Um… Let me think… It's…August, isn’t it? Yes, August. But what’s the date…? The second… No, wait. The third? I… I can't quite recall. It’s been a bit of a blur, you know. I’m sorry. I should know this. I really should. It’s just… slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s not a problem. It’s common to have some difficulty with recall. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Right. Go ahead. Let’s see if this old brain still works.
DOCTOR: “Apple, table, penny.” Please remember those words. I’ll ask you to recall them later. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. What year is it?
PATIENT: The year…? Oh dear. Let me think… It’s… it’s not 2024, is it? No… it must be 2025. Yes, 2025. But… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. It all just blurs together these days. I used to be so sharp. Now… it’s all just a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you tell me who the current President is?
PATIENT: The President…? Oh dear. Um… that man… the one who came after… Trump? No. That’s not right. The other one… Biden. Yes, that’s it. Biden. But… honestly, I'm not very good with politics. Never really paid much attention. It's all just a bit of a blur, you know? I'm sorry. I should know this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Redfern. That’s enough for now. Based on your history, physical examination, and cognitive assessment, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Your symptoms—difficulty sleeping, forgetfulness, loss of motivation, unsteady gait, and some difficulty with recall—could be due to a number of factors, including stress, depression, medication side effects, or early cognitive impairment. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to look for any structural abnormalities. We will also do a full lipid panel to check your cholesterol. I would also like you to complete a Montreal Cognitive Assessment to get a more objective assessment of your cognitive function. My nurse will go over the details of these tests with you. Finally, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a CT scan… a neurologist…? Oh dear. That sounds…serious. I just came here because I wasn’t sleeping well, and now… now you’re talking about all sorts of things. It's a bit much, to be honest. A neurologist…? I don’t even know what they do. I just want to be able to sleep again. Is that too much to ask? I… I don’t know. I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But… it all sounds very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Redfern. It can be overwhelming to hear all of this at once. And you’re right, it all started because you weren’t sleeping well. My goal is to simply figure out what’s going on and get you back to feeling like yourself again. The tests and the referral to a neurologist are just precautionary measures. We need to rule out any serious underlying causes, and if everything comes back normal, then we can explore other options, such as stress management techniques or medication. I will write down all the details for you. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent, and she can walk you through everything step-by-step. She'll schedule the blood tests and help you make an appointment with the neurologist. I’ll also give you a referral note to take with you. In the meantime, it’s important to prioritize self-care. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed, and engage in activities that you enjoy. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Regular sleep schedule… self-care… It all sounds very…complicated. Honestly, I’m not very good at looking after myself. My wife always did everything. I suppose… I suppose I just feel very lost. And scared. What if it’s something serious? What if… what if my brain is just… broken? And… how long will all this take? I don't want to be waiting weeks for answers. I… I don’t know. I suppose… I suppose I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling lost and scared, Mr. Redfern. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s natural to feel overwhelmed when things change. And it’s okay to not have all the answers right now. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get you the answers you need as quickly as possible. I'll expedite the referral to the neurologist, and Sarah will do her best to get you an appointment within the next two weeks. The blood test results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, if you're feeling particularly anxious or overwhelmed, please don't hesitate to reach out to Sarah or me. We can connect you with some resources that can help you cope with your grief and anxiety. There are also support groups available for people who have lost a loved one. For now, let’s focus on taking things one step at a time. We’ll get the tests done, see the neurologist, and then develop a plan together. Do you have any family or friends you can lean on for support?
PATIENT: No. Not really. My family… they live far away. And they… they don't understand. They keep telling me to "move on," but it's not that simple. And my friends… most of them are gone. Or… we’ve just drifted apart. I’m… pretty much on my own. I suppose I just have you. And Sarah. Thank you. For listening. And for… trying. It’s… it's more than I expected. I think… I think that’s enough for today. I just want to go home and… sleep. Or try to, anyway.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Redfern. And you’re not alone. Sarah and I are here to support you every step of the way. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I admire your strength. I’ll have Sarah print out a summary of our discussion and the details for the tests and referral. She’ll also give you some information on local support groups. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it’s okay to ask for help. I’m going to write a note to your primary care physician informing them of our findings. Do you need any assistance getting home?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can manage. It's… just down the road. I appreciate your kindness. And Sarah's. It means a lot. Thank you. For everything. .
