DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chakka. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I am…displeased with my current state. I have been noticing a rather concerning decline in my energy levels, alongside…uncomfortable night sweats. And, quite frankly, it's affecting my work. I am a graphic designer, and precision is paramount. This fatigue is simply…unacceptable. I would like to address this weight issue as well, though it feels secondary to the debilitating tiredness.
DOCTOR: “Unacceptable,” you say. Well, we all have standards, I suppose. Let’s begin with these…night sweats. How long have you been experiencing these, and would you characterize them as drenching – requiring a change of clothing, for example?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Drenching is an accurate descriptor. It’s rather…inconvenient, to say the least. It’s been occurring for approximately three weeks now, Doctor. Every other night, if not every night. And, yes, a change of clothing is…necessary. One does not simply tolerate being damp. It’s most undignified.
DOCTOR: Three weeks. Hmm. And is this accompanied by any fever, chills, or unintentional weight loss beyond what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: A fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. Though I suppose one doesn't always feel it, does one? As for chills…not precisely chills, but a general…weakness, a coldness within. And the weight loss…it’s subtle, Doctor, but noticeable. My clothes are fitting…less snugly, shall we say? It is a concern, as I maintain a very strict diet. It's quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: A “strict diet,” you say. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Well, Doctor, I prioritize lean proteins – fish, chicken, occasionally lamb. A plethora of leafy greens, of course. And limited carbohydrates – brown rice, quinoa, that sort of thing. Absolutely no processed foods, sugar is entirely forbidden. It’s a quite sensible regime, really. I assure you, it's not a haphazard collection of…indulgences. I am meticulous about what enters my system.
DOCTOR: Right. Meticulous. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well…there has been a slight…lack of appetite. Not complete, of course, but I don’t find myself craving meals as I once did. And I suppose…a general feeling of being unwell. It’s difficult to articulate precisely. A sort of…listlessness. And my sleep, aside from the…unfortunate perspiration, is rather fragmented. I wake frequently. It's interfering with my work, Doctor. This is becoming quite problematic.
DOCTOR: Fragmented sleep, night sweats, loss of appetite… Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? Doctor, I assure you, I am a remarkably healthy individual. I have not been diagnosed with anything of the sort. I maintain a very active lifestyle, and as I mentioned, my diet is impeccable. I do take a daily multivitamin, and occasionally vitamin D supplements, as one should, but beyond that…no. I’ve always been quite robust, actually. My parents attribute it to good genes and discipline.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Hospitalized? Absolutely not. I have never had occasion to be hospitalized. I take excellent care of myself, Doctor. Such things simply do not occur. A minor bout of influenza as a child, perhaps, but nothing requiring…intervention. Really, I find these questions rather unnecessary. Are we not addressing the current issue? This fatigue is quite debilitating, and these queries feel…irrelevant.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your family history then. Any significant medical conditions in your parents, siblings, or grandparents?
PATIENT: My mother…she had some…digestive issues in her later years. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a sensitive stomach. My father was quite healthy, a very active man until his passing. He died of a heart condition, unfortunately, at the age of seventy-five. My grandparents…both lived long lives, though my paternal grandmother had arthritis. Nothing else of particular significance, Doctor. I believe my family is generally…sturdy. Are we any closer to addressing my concerns? This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. Is this truly necessary? I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I do not smoke. I occasionally partake in a glass of red wine with dinner – a very small glass, for its health benefits, naturally. And recreational drugs? The very idea is…preposterous. I am a professional, Doctor. I maintain a certain…standard. I find this line of questioning…somewhat insulting, frankly. Are we going to discuss my ailment, or continue with these…inquiries into my personal life?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. It's standard procedure, despite your…objections. And then we’ll consider some blood work.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I find this entire process…unnecessary. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. However, if it will expedite matters, I suppose I can comply. Though I trust you will be gentle. I have important deadlines to meet. And please, refrain from unnecessary probing. It's most…undignified.
DOCTOR: Please lie flat, arms at your sides. I’ll begin with your lungs. Take a deep breath in…and exhale. Again…deep breath in…exhale. Heart sounds are normal, rate is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. Though…that area feels…slightly sensitive. Just below the ribcage, on the right side. It’s not painful, precisely, but…uncomfortable. And please, be gentle. My internal organs are quite delicate, I assure you. It’s probably just indigestion. Though, as I mentioned, I rarely indulge in such…vulgarities. Still, perhaps a small piece of chocolate last week…though it was dark chocolate, for its antioxidant properties, naturally. It hardly warrants this…prodding.
DOCTOR: Slight tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Liver and spleen are not palpably enlarged. Very well. Given your symptoms – fatigue, night sweats, loss of appetite, slight right upper quadrant tenderness – and a normal physical exam, I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a liver function test. Also, let’s include a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to rule out any thyroid issues. The lab results should be back within a few days. I suggest you avoid strenuous activity until we have those results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A complete blood count? A comprehensive metabolic panel? Must we subject me to such…exhaustive testing? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. But if it will finally put my mind at ease…very well. And the thyroid…is that truly necessary? I rarely feel cold, and my energy levels, aside from this recent…slump, have always been quite robust. No strenuous activity…well, that is simply unacceptable. I have deadlines to meet, Doctor. But I suppose I can manage…light work. Do I need to fast for any of these tests? And will the results be expedited, given my…circumstances? This is all rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for twelve hours before the blood work. No food or drink, other than water. And I will mark the order as urgent, though I cannot guarantee a faster turnaround time. The lab is quite busy, you understand. In the meantime, I’m prescribing a multivitamin with electrolytes to address any potential deficiencies. I highly recommend you get adequate rest and maintain a healthy diet – even without indulging in…chocolate. Do you have any other questions before I excuse you?
PATIENT: A multivitamin? Doctor, I already take a daily multivitamin. It seems rather…redundant. And “adequate rest”? That is hardly a solution, Doctor. I require energy to function. I am a professional graphic designer; I cannot simply “rest.” Is there anything else you can prescribe to alleviate this fatigue? Something…more substantial? Perhaps a B12 supplement? Or vitamin D, as I mentioned earlier? And what if the results are…conclusive? What then? Will I need to undergo further testing? I trust you have a competent specialist on hand, should the need arise. I do not have time for…inferior healthcare. This has been…less than satisfactory, Doctor. Perhaps you should have ordered a more thorough examination initially. I have deadlines to meet, and this…procrastination is most unwelcome.
DOCTOR: I understand your…frustration, Ms. Chakka. However, we must proceed methodically. A Vitamin D supplement is reasonable, given your previous mention of it. We'll revisit further testing once the initial results are available. I assure you, I have a network of excellent specialists should they be required. And frankly, a "thorough examination" is not always necessary when the initial assessment does not indicate a serious underlying condition. The lab requisition forms are at the front desk. Schedule an appointment for follow-up once the results are back. Have a…productive day.
