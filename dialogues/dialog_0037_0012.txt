DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m Velda Squiers. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some… information from a doctor. Just to say I’m fit enough to travel, you understand. Nothing serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. A pre-travel medical clearance form. That’s perfectly reasonable. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I was married for twenty years, but my husband passed five years ago now. He was a very healthy man, thankfully. I try to keep myself as fit as I can, though it’s not always easy on your own. I don’t have any… major complaints, if you follow. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? And my knees ache a bit in cold weather, but nothing a good warm bath won’t fix. I haven’t been to a doctor regularly, if I’m honest. Just when something really bothers me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Squiers. Thank you for sharing that. It’s good you're generally healthy. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any specific medical conditions you have been diagnosed with, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, years ago – perhaps fifteen years now – the doctor said I had… borderline high blood pressure. But it came down with a bit of diet and exercise, and he didn’t mention it again. And I had a touch of… shingles a few years back. Very painful, that was! But it cleared up quickly with cream. Other than that… honestly, I can’t recall anything major. I do have… a bit of trouble sleeping sometimes, but I put that down to worrying. And I wear glasses, as you can see!
DOCTOR: Okay, borderline high blood pressure in the past, shingles, and some difficulty sleeping. Thank you. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not even tonsils out! And thankfully, I’ve never had to be in hospital. A bit of flu now and then, of course, but nothing serious enough for a hospital stay. My husband, bless him, he had his appendix out when he was a boy, but I’ve always been lucky in that respect. I’m quite careful, you see. I don’t take risks.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Squiers. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, family… let me see. My mother, she had a weak heart, I believe. She passed when she was in her early seventies. My father, he was very strong, a farmer, but he did have… arthritis in his hands towards the end. And my brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he’s been diagnosed with… diabetes, a few years back. He manages it with pills, but it’s something that worries me, to be honest. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced, thankfully. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Ms. Squiers. Heart condition in your mother, arthritis in your father, and diabetes in your brother. Thank you. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, that’s the funny thing. I don't take any medications, regularly. Not a single pill! I try to avoid them if I can, you see. I believe in a good diet and fresh air. I might take a paracetamol now and then for a headache, but that’s it. And I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter, as the days are so short. But that's all, Doctor. Honestly, I’m very healthy for my age, I believe. I eat a lot of fish, you see, and I walk every day.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Squiers. That’s very good to hear. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Not a single allergy! My husband, he was allergic to bee stings, poor man, but I've always been very lucky in that respect. I can eat anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. I've always been very careful about what I put in my body, you see. It's important to know what agrees with you, isn't it? I’ve never had any trouble with hayfever or anything like that either, which is surprising considering how much time I spend in the garden.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Squiers. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I do sometimes get a bit… dizzy when I stand up quickly. It doesn't happen often, and it goes away quickly, but it's something I should mention, I suppose. And I sometimes have trouble remembering names, but I put that down to getting older! It’s not a serious problem, just a bit… frustrating. Other than that… no, I think I've told you everything. I really can’t think of anything else. I hope I haven’t bored you with all my details!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Squiers. That's very helpful information. The occasional dizziness and some memory lapses are good to know. Alright, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look in your ears and throat. It shouldn’t take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I have no objection at all. I trust your judgement, of course. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I do hope I don’t blush! I’m not used to doctors poking and prodding, you see. But I understand it’s necessary. Go ahead whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you’d like to sit or lie down on the examination table, that would be best. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lung sounds are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rhonchi, or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg, pulse is 72 beats per minute and regular. Ears are clear, no signs of infection or cerumen impaction. Throat is clear, no erythema or exudates noted. Everything sounds and looks good so far, Ms. Squiers. Now, can you stand up and I'll check your reflexes and balance?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Happy to do whatever you need. There we go. That's not too bad, is it? I do feel a little bit dizzy sometimes when I stand up quickly, as I mentioned, but it usually passes. Do you need me to do anything special? Just let me know. I hope I’m not making too much fuss! I do try to stay steady on my feet, you know. Gardening keeps me active.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Squiers. A little dizziness is not uncommon. I just want to make sure everything is stable. And now, if you don’t mind, I’ll briefly check your peripheral reflexes. Knee and ankle reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, Ms. Squiers. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, you appear to be in good health. I don't see any medical reason why you shouldn't be able to enjoy your cruise.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! Truly wonderful. I was a little bit worried, I confess, but it’s such a relief to hear you say that. I’ve been looking forward to this cruise for months, you see. It’s a trip around the Mediterranean, and I’ve always wanted to see Italy. So, what does this all mean? Do I need to fill out any forms for the cruise line, or do you have a letter I can take with me? Anything to prove I’m fit enough to travel, you understand. And is there anything I should be aware of while I’m on the cruise? Any precautions I should take?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad to hear that. I’ll prepare a pre-travel medical clearance form for the cruise line, stating that you are medically fit to travel. It will include a summary of our conversation and the findings of the physical exam. Here you go. This form should satisfy the cruise line's requirements. As for precautions, it's always wise to stay hydrated, especially in warmer climates. And be mindful of food safety – eat at reputable establishments and avoid drinking tap water. If you have any underlying medical conditions, make sure to bring a supply of your medications with you. And it’s a good idea to have travel insurance in case of any unforeseen circumstances. Given your occasional dizziness, be cautious when standing up quickly, and avoid situations that might cause you to lose your balance. And if you experience any new or concerning symptoms while on the cruise, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. The cruise ship usually has a medical facility onboard. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you so much for the form. And yes, that's all very sensible advice, thank you. I do always carry a small bottle of hand sanitizer, and I’m very careful about what I eat and drink. And I'll certainly be mindful of the dizziness. You know, I hadn’t really thought about travel insurance. That’s a very good point. I suppose it’s best to be prepared for anything, isn't it? I'll look into that as soon as I get home. No, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very thorough and helpful, Doctor. I really appreciate your time and attention. I feel much more confident about my cruise now. Thank you again. How much do I owe you for the consultation?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help. Travel insurance is always a good idea, just for peace of mind. The consultation fee is $120. We accept cash, credit card, or debit card. And Ms. Squiers, given you are uninsured, if you anticipate needing further medical care in the future, I can provide you with information about some local resources for affordable healthcare options. But for now, have a wonderful time on your cruise! And please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you return.
PATIENT: Oh, $120, that’s perfectly fine. Here you are. And thank you for the offer of information about affordable healthcare. That’s very kind, but I think I’ll be alright for now. I really do try to stay healthy, you see. I’m so looking forward to the cruise, and I promise to be careful. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. You’ve been a true professional. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: You have a wonderful cruise, Ms. Squiers! And please do take care.
