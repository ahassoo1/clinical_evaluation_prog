DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Condray, you said? Well, truthfully, I don’t rightly remember why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Said I needed to get this… sorted. Something about not wanting me to… well, I forget. Old age, you know? It’s a terrible thing. It just… slips away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Wynell. It happens. Don’t worry about it at all. Your daughter is probably just looking out for you, wanting to make sure everything is okay. We can figure things out together. Let’s start with this – can you tell me anything at all about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Oh, dear. Well, my feet. They ache, of course. Always aching. Been aching for… a long time now. I used to be a dancer, you know. A good dancer. Before… before things went wrong. But I don’t see what that has to do with anything. I’m a podiatrist, Doctor. I fix feet. I don’t complain about them.
DOCTOR: That’s quite a background! Fixing feet and then having your own give you trouble – ironic, isn't it?
PATIENT: Hmph. Don’t talk to me about irony. I've seen enough of life to know irony is just… a waste of time. It doesn't fix anything, does it? And these aches... they’re not just trouble, Doctor. They're a nuisance. A significant nuisance. And frankly, I don’t see why I need to spend a perfectly good afternoon discussing them with you.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. You’ve spent your life fixing feet, and now you’re dealing with this yourself. It's alright to want to get this sorted quickly. Let's try to be a little more specific about these aches. Where exactly do they hurt?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Honestly. Everywhere. It's not like I can pinpoint a specific spot. It's… a general discomfort. A throbbing, really. And… and they feel… old. Like they're about to fall off, if you want to know. Which, naturally, is ridiculous. But that’s how it feels. Honestly, I used to be able to diagnose these things with a single glance. Why I’m letting you poke and prod at them, I haven’t the foggiest.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Wynell, and I can see how frustrating this must be. It's helpful to know you have such a keen understanding of feet normally. Let’s see if we can narrow this down. Does the pain feel worse at any specific time of day?
PATIENT: Worse? Honestly, Doctor, it’s pretty much always worse. But… if I had to pick, I suppose it’s most bothersome in the evenings. After I’ve been on my feet, naturally. Even though I haven’t been on my feet properly for… well, a long time. And sometimes… sometimes it keeps me awake at night. A dull, throbbing ache. It's quite unpleasant. Honestly, I haven’t slept a full night in weeks. It's terribly disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the evenings, especially after being on your feet, and disrupting your sleep. That’s helpful. Do you notice any swelling in your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Oh, a little. Maybe. I suppose. It's hard to tell. My legs aren't what they used to be. Everything seems… puffy. And frankly, Doctor, I’m not particularly interested in cataloging every minor imperfection. I’m a professional, remember? I see these things. I just don’t want to deal with them. Especially not now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must. But don’t expect miracles, Doctor. I’ve seen it all before. And honestly, I doubt you’ll discover anything I haven’t already figured out myself. But fine. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, will you? I haven’t got the patience for any unnecessary discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. I’m just going to gently feel around your feet. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Alright. I’m noticing some mild swelling in both ankles and feet, particularly on the tops. There is tenderness to the touch along the arch of both feet, and some limited range of motion in your ankles. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your feet compared to what I'd expect. I also note some mild skin thickening on your heels. No open wounds or signs of infection. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? Sometimes. A little. Mostly in my toes. It comes and goes, really. It's… inconvenient, I suppose. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like you’re stating the obvious. I’m not completely oblivious to what’s going on with my own body, you know. I used to be able to diagnose these things with a single touch. And frankly, it’s all rather… expected. What are you getting at?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Wynell. You have a very good understanding of your body, and it sounds like you’ve already considered many possibilities. Given your history and what I’m finding on the exam, it seems like you may be experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy and osteoarthritis. The swelling and limited range of motion could be indicative of arthritis, and the numbness and tingling are consistent with neuropathy. However, to confirm this, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with a blood test to check for underlying conditions like diabetes, and possibly an x-ray of your feet to assess the extent of the arthritis?
PATIENT: Tests? Blood tests? X-rays? Honestly, Doctor, are you serious? I’m a podiatrist. I’ve seen hundreds of x-rays in my career. And I know perfectly well what diabetes can do. This is… rather insulting, don’t you think? I don't need you to tell me about my own body. But… fine. If you must. Get it over with. But I expect a quick turnaround. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. I understand your concerns, and I apologize if it feels like I'm stating the obvious. I just want to be thorough and rule out any other possibilities. I'll order the blood tests and x-rays right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the radiology department is on the second floor. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged standing or walking, and wearing comfortable, supportive shoes. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage the pain. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor. Do I look like someone who’s allergic to everything? No. I’ve taken all sorts of medications in my time. I’m a perfectly healthy woman… well, relatively. No allergies. Just… a general aversion to being poked and prodded. And wasting my time. But go on, order your tests. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. The staff will let you know when they're ready to take samples or perform the x-rays. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, Doctor, what questions could I possibly have? You’ve poked and prodded at my feet, you’re sending me off for unnecessary tests… I think that covers everything. No, I don’t have any questions. Just… get it over with. And please, don’t expect miracles. I’m a podiatrist. I know what’s going on. This is all rather… pointless, if you want my honest opinion.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Wynell. I appreciate your honesty and your expertise. I hope the tests provide some clarity, and we can develop a plan to manage your symptoms. Here are the lab and radiology orders. The staff will guide you through the process. Thank you for your patience today. If anything changes, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Goodbye, Doctor. And frankly, I expect a quick turnaround on these tests. I haven't got all day to waste. .
