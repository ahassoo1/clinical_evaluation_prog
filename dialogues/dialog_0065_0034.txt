DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's... well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, I guess? It's for Medicare... social healthcare, yeah. I don't really... know where to start.
DOCTOR: Right. A new patient establishing care. And utilizing Medicare benefits. Very well. While I appreciate you choosing my practice, Ms. Bonck, simply "getting set up" isn't a medical complaint. Is there a specific health concern you'd like to address today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right, sorry. No, not really... not right now. I just thought I needed to come in... like a check-up? To make sure everything's okay, since I'm new? I don't... I don't remember the last time I saw a doctor, honestly. Is that... is that okay?
DOCTOR: A preventative exam for a new patient is… acceptable, though generally reserved for patients with a more established history of regular care. Given your relocation and lack of recent medical attention, we'll need to perform a rather thorough assessment. To begin, let’s go through some basic information. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me?
PATIENT: Um... I think it's... August 14th? 2003? I’m pretty sure. It feels right, but I don’t really… keep track of dates. Sorry. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: August 14th, 2003. We’ll verify that with your insurance information. And it is perfectly acceptable to not readily recall dates. However, accurate medical records are paramount. Now, Ms. Bonck, I need you to be forthcoming. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Um... I think I broke my arm once, when I was little? Climbing a tree? But it healed. And… I get sick sometimes, like a cold, but nothing too bad. I don't really... remember anything serious. It was a long time ago, and I don't have a family doctor to ask about it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A childhood fracture, self-reported. And intermittent upper respiratory infections. Noted. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Um... I don't think so. I mean, sometimes I sneeze a lot in the spring, but I thought that was just... pollen? I've never been to a hospital for allergies or anything. I don't know if that helps. Sorry. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Pollen allergies are common, Ms. Bonck. But we must differentiate between seasonal discomfort and a true allergic reaction. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just... sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches. Like, when they're really bad. But that's it. No pills every day or anything. And no, I don’t do herbal stuff. My grandma used to, but I don't. Sorry if I'm not being helpful. It's just... a lot to remember.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed. Adequate. Now, regarding your family history… are your parents living?
PATIENT: Um... my mom, yeah, she's okay. She lives… far away. I don't talk to my dad much. He… wasn't around a lot. I don't really know about his health, to be honest. Sorry. I never asked. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: Mother living, father’s health unknown. Unfortunate, but not uncommon. Ms. Bonck, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no, no. Definitely not. I don’t smoke, I hardly ever drink – maybe a sip of wine at a fancy dinner? And I never do drugs. Not ever. My grandma would kill me. Is that okay? I hope that's a good answer.
DOCTOR: Reassuring. Now, Ms. Bonck, given your limited medical background and recent relocation, a comprehensive physical examination is prudent. I will need to assess your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Are you comfortable proceeding with a full exam?
PATIENT: Um... a full exam? Like... taking my temperature and stuff? I guess so. It's okay. Just... tell me what you're doing, okay? I get a little… nervous with doctors. Sorry. Just… explain things. That would be good.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Ms. Bonck. I will explain each step. We’ll begin with your height and weight. Then I'll measure your blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and temperature. After that, we’ll proceed with auscultation of your heart and lungs and palpation of your abdomen. Please disrobe to your undergarments and I’ll provide a gown. I’ll leave the room to allow you privacy. Please call out when you are ready.
PATIENT: Okay... um. Disrobe? Like... take all my clothes off? Even underwear? I... I didn’t know. Is that normal? Maybe I should just... stop. This is too much. I don't feel so good.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, a proper medical examination requires access to the relevant body parts. I did not specify complete disrobing, merely to your undergarments. You will be provided with a gown for modesty. However, if you are unable to comply with a basic examination, I cannot provide adequate care. It seems establishing care with me may not be… suitable. Perhaps you should consult with another physician.
PATIENT: Oh... okay. I... I'm sorry. I didn't know. I just... I get really nervous. I'll… I'll try. Just… please tell me everything, okay? And go slow. I just want to be healthy. Please don't yell at me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I assure you, Ms. Bonck, I will not "yell" at you. But a medical examination necessitates cooperation. Now, please, remove your clothing and put on the gown. I will remain outside until you are ready. And please, do not hesitate to call out if you require assistance.
PATIENT: .
