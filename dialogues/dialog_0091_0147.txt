DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. My name is Dr. Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I've been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out. It doesn’t hurt, not really, but it’s…there.
DOCTOR: I see. A lump in the lower abdomen. That's certainly worth investigating. When you say "a little while now," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Perhaps… three or four weeks? It started very small, I barely noticed it at first, and I just assumed it was something I ate. But it hasn’t gone away, and it seems to have gotten a bit bigger, so I decided it was time to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four weeks. And you've noticed it gradually increasing in size. Is the size change rapid, slow, or somewhere in between?
PATIENT: Slow, definitely slow. It's not like it doubled overnight or anything. More like… I only notice it's bigger when I'm lying down, and I'm consciously feeling for it. It’s hard to describe. It’s not a dramatic change, but noticeable over the weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand. A subtle but progressive enlargement. And you mentioned it’s only really palpable when you're lying down. Does it feel firm, soft, or somewhere in between?
PATIENT: It feels…firm, I’d say. Not rock hard, but definitely not squishy. It’s… resilient, if that makes sense? When I press on it, it doesn't just give way easily. It has some substance to it.
DOCTOR: Resilient, that’s a good description. And is there any associated pain with it at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. Like I said before, it doesn’t hurt. Sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of physical activity – I’m a choreographer, so I’m often moving around – I feel a slight discomfort, but it's not pain. More like…awareness of it. It's not enough to stop me from doing anything, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant pain, only a slight awareness of it with physical activity. Have you noticed any other changes accompanying this lump?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. My bowel habits are normal, no changes there. No weight loss, no fever, nothing like that. I've been feeling generally well, to be honest. That's why I was a bit surprised when I felt the lump in the first place. It just…appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No associated symptoms like changes in bowel habits, weight loss or fever. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a child, the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No surgeries, no hospitalizations, nothing like that. My wife keeps telling me I'm too healthy for my own good. I'm generally a pretty active person, I eat well… Just this lump, which is a bit concerning, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear regarding your overall health. No prior surgeries or significant medical issues. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart problems later in life. Nothing related to… abdominal issues, if that’s what you’re asking. My siblings are all healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major on either side of the family, to be honest. It’s probably not very helpful, is it?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. Knowing what’s not present is just as important. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I can take most medications without issue. I haven't had any reactions to anything in the past. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just to be safe, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I'll take a pain reliever if I really need it, but I don’t take anything regularly. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. I’m pretty good about trying to stay healthy and avoid needing medication in the first place.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to know. Thank you for providing me with that thorough information, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. Specifically, I’d like to palpate your abdomen to better assess this lump. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I was expecting that, to be honest. Please, go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need to figure out what's going on. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie flat on your back, and I’ll begin the examination. I’m going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. …I am noting some mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, in the left iliac region. The mass is palpable – approximately 3 cm in diameter, firm, non-tender to light pressure. It appears to be fixed, meaning it doesn’t move freely when I try to manipulate it. No rebound tenderness is present. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds in all four quadrants. Your heart and lungs sound clear. No palpable lymphadenopathy is noted. Based on the physical examination, we need to investigate this further. The fixed nature of the mass is concerning. I would like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The CBC will help to rule out any infection, and the CT scan will give us a more detailed look at the mass and the surrounding structures. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A CT scan and blood work… it sounds sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I trust your judgment completely. What’s the next step? Will I be scheduling those tests here?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel comfortable with that plan. Yes, you can schedule the CBC and CT scan directly through the clinic. The receptionist at the front desk will be able to assist you with that. They'll likely give you specific instructions regarding preparation for the CT scan, such as fasting beforehand. I’ll also send a referral to a general surgeon, Dr. Anya Sharma, for a consultation. While we don't know the exact cause yet, it’s best to have a surgical opinion given the nature of this mass. We'll want to discuss the imaging results with her and determine the best course of action. I will call in the orders for the blood work and CT scan now, and the receptionist will get you scheduled. Once the results are available, my nurse, Sarah, will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. A consultation with Dr. Sharma… yes, that makes sense. I appreciate you being so proactive and explaining everything so clearly. I’ll go speak to the receptionist now and get everything scheduled. Thank you, Doctor Delacour.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You as well.
