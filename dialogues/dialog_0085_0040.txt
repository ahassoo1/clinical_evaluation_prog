DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It keeps coming back. And…and I seem to be getting a lot of water infections these days too. It’s becoming quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Pain in your side and frequent urinary tract infections. Let’s start with the side pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s…well, it’s mostly on my right side, lower down. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it’s been happening more often lately. Sometimes it’s just a little discomfort, other times it’s quite noticeable. I’ve had it for…oh, a good while now, I suppose. Years, really. But it’s just gotten worse recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache on your right side, lower abdomen, that’s been happening on and off for years, but is worse recently. Does anything specifically trigger the pain, or make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think anything specifically triggers it, no. It doesn’t seem to be related to what I eat, or how much I move around. Lying down sometimes helps a little, but honestly, it comes and goes on its own. It’s very unpredictable, you see. Sometimes I wake up with it, sometimes it starts during the day. I haven’t noticed anything that reliably makes it better, sadly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Unpredictable pain that isn’t linked to any specific activity or position. Now, let’s talk about these urinary tract infections. How often are you getting them, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… it used to be maybe once or twice a year. But this past year… I’d say at least four or five times, maybe more. It’s hard to keep track, to be honest. Every time I get one, I have to go to the doctor, and they give me some tablets, and it goes away…but then it just comes back again. It’s quite tiring, really.
DOCTOR: Four or five times in the past year… that is frequent. And you said the tablets help temporarily, but they keep recurring. Do you notice any symptoms when you’re having an infection – like burning when you urinate, a frequent urge to go, or pain?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, all of those things, Doctor. Definitely a burning sensation when I go to the toilet. And I have to go so often, even when there’s not much there. And a sort of ache in my lower tummy, too, when it's bad. It’s very uncomfortable. And sometimes, the…the water is a little cloudy, if you understand me. That’s when I know I need to see the doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Burning, frequency, lower abdominal discomfort, and cloudy urine. That certainly sounds like recurrent UTIs. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with either the side pain or the infections?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. No, thankfully, I haven’t had any fever or chills. Sometimes, when the pain is really bad, I feel a little bit queasy, but I haven’t actually been sick, no. No vomiting. Just the discomfort, the burning, and the constant need to go to the toilet. It's more of a nuisance than anything serious, I think. Although, like I said, it's becoming quite frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No fever, chills, or vomiting. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a bit complicated, Doctor. I was told, years ago, that I have something wrong with my kidneys. Polycystic…polycystic kidney disease, I think it was called. The doctor explained it, but I confess, I didn’t understand all of it. They said I have…cysts on my kidneys. It's never really bothered me much until recently, with the pain and the infections. I don’t have diabetes or high blood pressure, no. I have been seeing a specialist for this kidney thing, but it’s been a while since my last appointment, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of polycystic kidney disease. That's important information, and likely related to both your side pain and the recurrent UTIs. Do you remember who your specialist was, or where you were seeing them?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It was…Dr. Sharma, I believe. Yes, Dr. Sharma. He was at the…the main hospital, you see. The one in Suva. It was quite a few years ago now. I haven’t been back since…oh, goodness, it must be almost ten years, maybe more. Things were fine for a long time, so I didn't feel the need to go back. But now, with this increasing discomfort, I suppose I should have. I feel a bit foolish for leaving it so long, really.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Espinueva, don’t feel foolish. Things get busy, and it’s easy to put things off. Knowing you saw Dr. Sharma at the hospital in Suva is helpful. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s okay. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and check for any tenderness. It looks like you do have some tenderness on your right side, but it's not severe. I’m also going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a general overview.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’ll just lie here. It does feel a bit sore on my right side, as you said. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I just want to get to the bottom of all this, and hopefully find a way to stop these infections. It's getting very tiring.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little bit elevated, 145/90, but not alarmingly so. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, given your history of polycystic kidney disease and your recurrent UTIs, I'm concerned about a possible kidney infection. Even though you don’t have a fever right now, it’s best to rule that out. I’m also going to order some lab work – a urine analysis to check for infection, and a blood test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of it. A urine analysis and a blood test… yes, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel better, and stop this constant worry. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better, really. And if it is a kidney infection… what would happen then? Do you need to do anything special?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. We’ll get those labs ordered right away. If it is a kidney infection, we’ll likely need to start you on a course of antibiotics. Depending on the severity, you might need to be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and fluids. We'll assess that once we have the lab results. We’ll also need to follow up with a referral back to a nephrologist – a kidney specialist – to manage your polycystic kidney disease. It’s important to monitor the cysts and prevent future infections. I’ll also want to discuss some preventative measures you can take to reduce the risk of further UTIs. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any tablets before. I can take most things, thankfully. That’s one less thing to worry about, I suppose. A nephrologist… yes, I should probably have kept up with that, shouldn't I? I seem to be making all the wrong choices, letting things slip. But I'm glad you're on top of it now. What sort of preventative measures are you thinking about for the water infections? I'm willing to try anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good. And don’t worry about letting things slip, it happens. We’ll get you back on track. For the UTIs, the main things are staying well-hydrated – drink plenty of water – and practicing good hygiene. That means wiping from front to back after using the toilet, and urinating after intercourse. Some people also find cranberry juice helpful, although the evidence is mixed. We can also discuss the possibility of a low-dose antibiotic as a preventative measure if the infections continue to recur despite these measures. I’m going to order the labs now, and the nurse will come in to draw the blood. We should have the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or back pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thank you. Drink plenty of water, good hygiene… I can certainly manage that. Cranberry juice… I do enjoy a glass of cranberry juice. I’ll give that a try. And I’ll be mindful of the fever and back pain. Everything makes sense. Actually… now that you mention it, my back has been feeling a little bit sore lately, on the right side as well. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache. It probably is related, isn't it? And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on, and what to look out for. I don’t think I have any other questions at the moment. I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again, Doctor Lahn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. The back pain is good to know, and it does support the possibility of a kidney infection. We'll get to the bottom of it. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if anything changes or you have any further concerns. I'll be reviewing your results as soon as they come in. Have a good afternoon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
