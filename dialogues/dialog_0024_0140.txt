DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I haven’t much time for this. It's…a nuisance. Something in my mouth. White patches, mostly on the tongue. My wife suggested I come, said it looked unpleasant. I assure you, it’s likely nothing serious.
DOCTOR: A “nuisance,” you say. Very well. Though I find dismissing potential ailments rather…unproductive. These white patches, when did you first notice them?
PATIENT: Honestly, I couldn’t tell you precisely. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It hardly demands a doctor’s visit. I’ve been rather busy with work. Fallers don’t have time for…mouth issues. It’s probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: “Fallers?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I fell trees. It's a profession. Requires a certain…stamina. And frankly, less time spent worrying about trivialities and more time ensuring a reliable lumber supply. Is this relevant?
DOCTOR: Potentially. Certain occupations, particularly those involving physical exertion and potential exposure to various elements, can predispose individuals to certain conditions. Now, have you experienced any pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A slight discomfort, perhaps. More…annoying than painful. It feels…rough. And I suspect it affects my taste. My wife’s cooking…isn’t quite as enjoyable as it used to be. Though that could be a blessing, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Right. Discomfort, roughness, altered taste. Have you noticed any difficulty swallowing, or any fever, chills, or weight loss alongside this…discomfort?
PATIENT: Fever? Absolutely not. Weight loss? I’m a working man, Doctor. I eat plenty. Swallowing is…fine. Perhaps a little more effort required, but I hardly think it warrants a full examination. Honestly, I’m starting to question the necessity of this entire visit. Are you sure this requires your time?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I assure you, I allocate my time based on clinical need. Though, it appears you are quite insistent on self-diagnosis. Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief examination, simply to…rule things out. Open wide, please. And try to refrain from offering commentary during the procedure.
PATIENT: Fine. But I assure you, you’ll find nothing of consequence. I have more pressing matters to attend to. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, as you said, white patches present on the dorsal surface of the tongue, extending somewhat onto the lateral borders. There's some mild erythema surrounding the affected areas. No obvious ulceration or bleeding. Lymph nodes are palpable, but not significantly enlarged or tender. It appears to be a case of oral thrush, Candida albicans infection. Common enough, particularly in individuals with altered immune function or those using inhaled corticosteroids. Are you currently using any inhalers or have you recently completed a course of antibiotics?
PATIENT: Inhalers? Antibiotics? Good heavens, no. I’m a perfectly healthy man! I haven't needed such things in…well, ever, I believe. I told you, it's likely something I ate. A bad piece of fruit, perhaps. My wife insists on buying exotic things I have no desire for. Is there a…quick remedy for this “thrush”? Because frankly, I do not have time for a prolonged treatment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, I understand your desire for expediency, but ignoring a fungal infection is…ill-advised. The absence of inhaled corticosteroid use or antibiotic history is noted. It’s possible, though less common, that it's related to your oral hygiene or possibly a temporary immune system compromise. Nevertheless, it requires treatment. I will prescribe a topical antifungal medication, Nystatin oral suspension. You will need to swish 10 milliliters four times daily for fourteen days. It's imperative you complete the full course, even if symptoms improve. Do you have any allergies to medications, particularly antifungals?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Though I prefer a good steak, truthfully. Fourteen days? That's…inconvenient. Is there not something faster? A pill, perhaps? And frankly, Doctor, I find your tone rather…patronizing. I am a grown man. I can assess my own risk. I expect a more efficient solution.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schieber, while I appreciate your…confidence in your self-assessment, medical treatment operates on established protocols. A systemic antifungal is generally reserved for more severe cases or those unresponsive to topical therapy. We will start with the Nystatin. If, after fourteen days, there is no improvement, then we can discuss other options. As for your risk assessment, the primary risk is the potential for the infection to spread. Now, I’m writing the prescription. I also recommend improving your oral hygiene—brushing twice daily and using an alcohol-free mouthwash. Here you are. Do you understand the instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Swish and spit. A ridiculous waste of my time, frankly. Very well. I trust this is all. I have lumber to oversee. And please, Doctor, refrain from questioning my hygiene. It's quite impeccable. .
