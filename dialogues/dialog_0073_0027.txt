DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let’s just get this over with. It's my stomach. Food keeps… coming back up. It’s a nuisance, really. I eat, and then… well, you get the picture. It’s not pleasant.
DOCTOR: A nuisance, you say. Yes, I understand. Vomiting can certainly be disruptive. How long has this been going on, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not vomiting, exactly. More like...regurgitation. And for… well, a while now. Months, I suppose. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It comes and goes. It’s not like it’s every single day, if that makes you feel better. I just figured it would sort itself out. It hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Months of intermittent regurgitation. Right. And can you describe what this “regurgitation” is like?
PATIENT: Well, it's food. Undigested food, mostly. Sometimes it’s just… liquid. Like, what I ate hasn’t even been digested, you know? It just comes back up. And it tastes… awful. Like, really awful. I don't need to go into detail, do I? It’s not a gourmet experience, that’s for sure. It happens when I lie down mostly, but sometimes even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Undigested food and liquid, primarily when lying down, but sometimes while sitting. And does this happen shortly after eating, or some time later?
PATIENT: Oh, usually a couple of hours after. Not right away, no. I’ll eat dinner, feel fine, then later… there it is. It's really bothersome when I’m trying to sleep. My wife gets annoyed, naturally. It’s not like I want this to happen. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: A couple of hours after eating. Alright. And what sorts of foods are you typically eating, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Look, I eat normal food! Meat, potatoes, vegetables… You name it. I’m not one of those fussy eaters. I don't go stuffing myself, if that’s what you're getting at. It’s not like I’m eating spicy chili every night, or anything. Just… regular meals. Nothing fancy. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: Regular meals, not particularly spicy or unusual. Do you experience any heartburn or indigestion along with this?
PATIENT: Heartburn? Sometimes, yes. A bit of a burning feeling, here and there. Not all the time, though. I just figured it was the food. Old age, maybe. You get all sorts of aches and pains when you get to be my age. It’s probably nothing serious. I don’t want you running a bunch of tests, if that’s what you’re thinking. I've got better things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about unnecessary testing, Mr. Altine. However, intermittent regurgitation with occasional heartburn does warrant some investigation. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my trousers do feel a bit looser. It could just be the summer heat, I suppose. I'm not one to obsess over numbers. It's not like I'm wasting away, if that's what you’re implying. I just… haven’t been as hungry lately. It's probably the stomach issue. Everything's connected, isn’t it? Look, can we just get a prescription or something? I don’t want to spend all day in here.
DOCTOR: A slight unintentional weight loss. Alright. And are you experiencing any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing? No, not exactly. Food goes down alright. It just… comes back up later. It's not like it's getting stuck, or anything like that. Honestly, Doctor, this is all very simple. I eat, it goes down, it comes back up, sometimes I get heartburn. It's a stomach problem. Can we please just deal with the stomach problem? I have a tee time this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. We can proceed with some initial measures. However, given your reported weight loss and the intermittent nature of this, I'd like to order a basic blood work panel to rule out any underlying issues. And I'm going to recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They can perform an endoscopy to get a better look at your esophagus and stomach. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An endoscopy?! Look, I knew I shouldn’t have come here. Blood work, fine. But an endoscopy? No, absolutely not. I don’t want anyone poking around in my stomach. This is ridiculous. Just give me something for the heartburn and be done with it. I'm a busy man, Doctor. I haven’t got time for all this fuss. I'm not going to lie down and let someone stick a camera down my throat. No. Just… no. I think I’ll find another doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Altine. I understand your reluctance. However, I strongly advise you reconsider the referral. Without a proper diagnosis, we're simply treating symptoms. I can provide a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor to manage the heartburn, but it's not a long-term solution. I will document your refusal of the referral. Please monitor your symptoms closely, and if they worsen or you experience any new symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or bloody vomit, seek immediate medical attention. .
