DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I’m Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Well, to be frank, it’s my… waterworks. They bother me. A lot. Keeps happening, you see. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it’s been… some time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, I understand. You’re experiencing some bothersome urinary issues. When you say “waterworks,” could you tell me a little more specifically what’s happening?
PATIENT: Oh… specifically? Goodness. It… burns, when I go. And I have to go… quite often. More than I used to, certainly. And… sometimes it just… hurts. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when I need to go. It's… difficult to explain. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: Okay, so burning with urination, increased frequency, and pain when you need to go. That helps. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t… I don't think so. It's… difficult to say, honestly. I don't examine it that closely, you see. I just… go. It’s… probably not, though. I don’t recall seeing any… red. But… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not always easy to notice things like that. And it’s alright if you aren’t sure. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Let me think. No, not that I recall. I… I haven't been feeling ill, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. My back… sometimes aches, but that’s just my age, I suspect. I've always had a bit of trouble with my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine – like the color being darker than usual, or a foul odor?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Odor… I… I haven't been sniffing my water, Doctor. Is that… is that what one does? I… it smells like… water, I suppose. Maybe a bit… stronger than usual sometimes. And the color… I haven't paid much attention. It’s usually… yellowish, I presume.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for a while now. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Right. Well… I was married, once. Does that count? No… I suppose not. Let me think… the doctor told me years ago my… cholesterol was a bit high. But I don't take anything for it. And… I had a bad knee, once. Replaced it, years ago. Apart from that… nothing comes to mind. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, high cholesterol and a knee replacement. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries besides the knee replacement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. No… I don't believe so. Maybe my tonsils when I was a child? But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Nothing as an adult, certainly. Just the knee. It’s been a bother, that knee. Still aches in the cold.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s… difficult. My mother… she had trouble with her stomach. Spent a lot of time in bed. And my father… he was a strong man, but he… he passed away when I was young. From… something. I don’t remember exactly what. And I don't really have much family left. It’s all… very distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, that’s alright. It’s not always easy to remember everything about family history. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your daily life?
PATIENT: Daily life? Oh… it's… quiet. Very quiet. I live alone now, you see. After the divorce. I mostly… potter about. A bit of gardening. I like to read. And I watch television. I try to keep busy. I don't go out much anymore. It’s… easier this way.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, certainly not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I… well, I had a glass of sherry with dinner sometimes, years ago. But I stopped that a long time ago. It didn't agree with me. Mostly I drink water, now. Which… is ironic, given my current predicament.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… medications. Let me think… No, not really. Just… a bit of ibuprofen now and then for my knee, when it’s acting up. But that’s it. Nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking pills, if I can. They always make me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wease. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, I don’t think so. I've never had any serious reactions to anything. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, with all the flowers blooming, but that’s just… pollen, I suppose. Nothing that requires a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and gently examining your abdomen. I’ll also need a urine sample to send to the lab. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. And a sample? Goodness. Well… I suppose so. If it helps. But please be gentle. My bones aren't what they used to be. And… I’m not particularly fond of… those facilities. But… if it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, I understand. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A bit elevated, you say? Goodness. Well, I was rather flustered, answering all those questions. Here I go… Careful now… my back is a bit sensitive, you see. Go gently… oh dear.
DOCTOR: I'm feeling your abdomen now, Ms. Wease. Does this cause any pain or tenderness?
PATIENT: Oh… a little… right there. Not terribly painful, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that… on and off. It’s not constant, you see. Sometimes it's better, sometimes it's worse. It's just… a general discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease. I'm noting tenderness in your right lower quadrant. Now, we need to collect a urine sample. I'll give you a container and some instructions. Just try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the container, and finish urinating. Do you have any difficulty with that?
PATIENT: Oh… a midstream? Goodness. I… I suppose I can manage. But… it's not always easy, you see. With my… condition. It’s… a bit unpredictable. I’ll try my best, Doctor. But please… don't rush me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wease, take your time. There’s no rush at all. I'll be right here when you're finished.
