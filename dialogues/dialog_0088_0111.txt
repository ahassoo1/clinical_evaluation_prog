DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion? I feel perfectly fine, just… tired, I suppose. Old age, you know. It’s probably nothing worth your time, really. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in. Even if you feel fine, it’s always wise to check things out. “Tired” can mean a lot of things, and we want to rule out anything serious. And your complexion is something we can take a look at. Before we do a physical exam, could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a general weariness. Always have been a bit of a night owl, you see. Worked long hours my whole life, reinforcing iron. A demanding job, that was. Not like these youngsters today, expecting everything handed to them. But I’ve been doing that for… well, a long time. I don't recall any sudden change. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is that all you need to know? This is rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. You've led a full life, it sounds like. And it’s helpful to know there hasn’t been a sudden change. Just a gradual wearing down. To clarify, when you say “aches and pains,” where are you feeling those most?
PATIENT: Everywhere, Doctor. Honestly, everywhere. My back, my knees, my elbows… it’s the price one pays for honest work, I suppose. Though, I can’t pinpoint any specific spot that's worse than another. It's all… a dull ache. Really, I don't see why we’re dwelling on this. I haven't collapsed or anything, have I? This is a waste of perfectly good time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. It sounds like you’re experiencing generalized aches and pains, which is common with age. We want to make sure there isn't anything underlying causing this, even if it's just typical wear and tear. Before we proceed with the physical exam, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… good heavens, that was decades ago. I honestly don't recall. I went to the doctor when I needed to, when I broke a rib on a construction site, or had the flu. Routine things. I never bothered with all these… preventative measures. Waste of money, in my opinion. I've always been a robust man. My wife handles all the paperwork, so if there was something, she'd know. Really, I think I'd remember if I had anything serious. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. I see here in the system… a documented case of hypertension diagnosed approximately 15 years ago, treated with a medication called Lisinopril. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… hypertension… sounds like something my wife would be concerned about. I take pills, yes, every morning. Small white ones, I think. But I can’t say I know what they're for, precisely. She sorts everything out. I just swallow them. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for remembering names of medications or ailments. It all blurs together after a while. Is this getting us somewhere, or are we simply recounting my wife’s concerns? I have errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Drahota. Many patients rely on family to manage their medications. So, you’ve been taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure for approximately 15 years. Good. And are there any other medications you take regularly, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally an aspirin for a headache. But that's it. I don't believe in filling myself with unnecessary chemicals. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, as much as an old man can. A bit of exercise when I can, though my knees don't cooperate much these days. And I eat… well, whatever my wife puts in front of me. She’s quite particular about my diet, you see. She says I need my strength. Frankly, Doctor, is this line of questioning going to yield anything useful? I'm starting to feel rather… agitated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. We're just trying to get a complete picture of your health. So, Lisinopril for blood pressure, occasional aspirin. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve lived a long life, exposed to all sorts of things. Dust, dirt, smoke… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Tough as nails, that’s what I am. I suspect these modern folks are too coddled, too worried about germs and sensitivities. It's ridiculous. Look, I’m perfectly healthy, and this entire exercise is becoming quite tiresome. Can we just… wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand your frustration. Let’s proceed with a quick physical exam, then we can discuss our findings. I'll keep it as brief as possible. First, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I’ve had more pleasant experiences at the dentist. And please, be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. This entire process is… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Just relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/90. Not alarmingly so, but higher than we'd like. And your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath in for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, my lungs have been perfectly functional for eighty-five years. I doubt a few moments with a stethoscope will reveal anything new. But fine, go ahead. Get it over with. I have… things to do. And try not to poke me too much. It’s rather uncomfortable. Though, truthfully, a bit of discomfort is the least of my concerns these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, though I do hear a slight murmur. It's not new, according to the records, and doesn't seem to be causing any issues at the moment. Lungs are clear, but you do have some diminished breath sounds, which is common with age. Now, I'd like to quickly examine your abdomen. Just lie back, if you could. I’ll palpate gently. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, there. Yes, a little bit tender, actually. Not excruciating, mind you, just… sensitive. It’s probably just indigestion. I had a rather… robust dinner last night. My wife tends to overfeed me. But I assure you, Doctor, it's nothing serious. It'll pass. Really, I fail to see the point of poking around in my stomach. It's rather… intrusive. Can we please expedite this process?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in my… Doctor, must we discuss such… personal matters? Really! I assure you, everything is… functioning as it should. Old age brings certain… adjustments, but nothing that requires your attention. I find this line of questioning deeply inappropriate. I’ve lived a long and respectable life, and I don't see the need to dissect every bodily function. This is… preposterous. Frankly, I'm growing increasingly agitated. Can we conclude this examination now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if any of my questions were intrusive. Based on my examination and your history, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, you have a heart murmur that’s been previously documented, and some diminished breath sounds, which is common with age. You also report some abdominal tenderness, which you attribute to indigestion. I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to recheck your blood pressure. I also suggest you monitor your abdominal tenderness. If it worsens or is accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, please contact the office immediately. Would you like me to write that down for you?
PATIENT: No, no, that's quite alright. I doubt anything will change in a month. And I'll be sure to inform my wife if anything… untoward occurs. Honestly, I suspect she's already anticipating every possible ailment. This entire visit has been a waste of my time, but if it satisfies her, so be it. Just… tell me, Doctor, is there anything seriously wrong with me? Yes or no, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Based on today’s examination, no, Mr. Drahota, there's nothing seriously wrong with you. Your findings are consistent with normal aging. However, it’s important to monitor your blood pressure and be aware of any changes in your condition. I'll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion and your follow-up instructions. Would you like a work note for any time you’ve missed today?
PATIENT: A work note? Good heavens, no. I haven't worked in decades! This entire visit is… absurd. Just… let me leave. I have errands to run, and frankly, I’m feeling rather faint. Yes, just… let me go. I'm sure my wife will pester me enough about following up, so there's no need for additional documentation. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. The nurse will be right with you. Thank you for coming in today. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. .
