DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Parascondola. I am Dr. Mutnick. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, my foot’s been swelling up, real bad. It started a few days ago, I think… maybe last Tuesday? It’s mostly on this side, <points to left foot> and it hurts when I try to walk on it. Not all the time, just when I put weight on it.
DOCTOR: Tuesday… alright. And is this a sudden onset, or did it gradually worsen since then?
PATIENT: Gradually, I’d say. It wasn’t like bam, one day it was huge. It started small, just a little puffiness, and then each day it got a bit bigger. I noticed it after I was doing some cleaning around the house, but I don’t remember exactly what I was doing… just moving things, you know? Boxes and stuff.
DOCTOR: Boxes… right. And have you noticed any discoloration?
PATIENT: Discoloration? Let me see… <looks down at his foot, flexing his ankle> Hmm. It’s a bit reddish, I think, especially around the ankle bone. Not bright red, more like… a dull red. And maybe a little bit purple-ish in spots. It's hard to tell with my skin, you know? I'm not always sure what color I’m looking at.
DOCTOR: I understand. And is there any pain at rest, or just with movement?
PATIENT: Just with movement, Doctor. When I’m sitting or lying down, it doesn’t bother me much. It’s mostly when I try to walk, or stand for a long time. A dull ache, you know? Not a sharp pain, thankfully. It's just… uncomfortable. Makes me worry, 'cause I do a lot of walking to the store and back.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any injuries to this foot in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. Not that I remember. I used to play soccer when I was a kid, back in Somalia, but that was… a long time ago. I don’t think I ever broke anything. I might have twisted it once or twice, but nothing serious. Just a little bit of pain, and it went away. I’m pretty sure about that. It’s been so long, though… my memory isn't what it used to be. Except for dates, oddly enough! I remember the day I left Somalia like it was yesterday.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Are you currently experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. No fever, no chills, and definitely no night sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Although I wake up a few times to use the bathroom, if that counts? But no sweating or anything like that. I feel fine, except for this foot. It’s just… worrying me, you know? I don't like things being wrong with my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at the foot itself. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. <starts to carefully swing his legs over and onto the examination table, wincing slightly> This is a little high for me, but I can manage. <lies down carefully> There we go. Just let me know if you need me to move it a certain way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a visual inspection. I observe moderate edema, primarily localized to the dorsum and medial aspects of the left foot. There is mild erythema present, as you mentioned, with some areas of discoloration appearing purplish. Palpation reveals warmth to the touch and tenderness along the medial malleolus. <types rapidly into the computer> Do you experience any calf pain when I dorsiflex your foot?
PATIENT: Dorsiflex… what does that mean, Doctor? Just tell me what you want me to do. I'm not good with medical words, sorry. Is it going to hurt? I have a low pain tolerance, you know. Especially when someone touches my foot. It's sensitive!
DOCTOR: Dorsiflexion simply means pointing your toes upwards. <gently demonstrates the motion on his own foot> Like this. Now, try to relax, and I will gently move your foot upwards. Tell me immediately if you experience any significant pain. <prepares to gently dorsiflex the patient's foot> It’s a quick assessment, and we’ll proceed cautiously.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. I understand. Point my toes up… like this? <attempts to point toes upwards, but grimaces slightly> It's a little stiff, Doctor. And yes, that... that makes it hurt a bit. Not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable. A dull ache, right here <points to his calf>. It's not sharp, but... yeah. It feels weird. Like a pulling sensation. Please be gentle!
DOCTOR: Noted. Tenderness present upon dorsiflexion and palpable pain in the posterior calf. <pauses, stares at chart> Now, let's assess your pulses. Please remain still. <begins palpating the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses> Dorsalis pedis is… faint. Posterior tibial is… present, but diminished. <types rapidly> Hmm. This is… concerning. Do you have a history of blood clots, Mr. Parascondola?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Never been told I have blood clots. I've never even been in a hospital before, except for a check-up when I first came to this country. Everything was fine then, as far as I know. I eat healthy, mostly. Fruits and vegetables. And I walk a lot, as I said. So… no, no blood clots. What's going on? Is it bad? You're starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Parascondola, given your current presentation—the edema, erythema, calf pain, and diminished pulses—there is a possibility of a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. This is a serious condition. Given that you are uninsured, I recommend immediate referral to the emergency room for a Doppler ultrasound to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. They are equipped to handle this situation promptly. <pauses> It is imperative we act quickly to prevent potential complications, such as a pulmonary embolism. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Pulmonary… what now? And… emergency room? Oh dear. That sounds expensive. And scary. A… what was it, deep vein something? Is that life-threatening? I… I don't know if I can afford the emergency room, Doctor. I barely have enough money for food. I just wanted to get this foot looked at. Is there anything else we can do? Maybe some medicine? Or a wrap? I really don't want to go to the hospital. I have no one to… to help me there. <voice trembles slightly> Please, Doctor, is there any other way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Parascondola, I understand your concerns regarding the cost, however, this is a potentially life-threatening situation, and a Doppler ultrasound is necessary to determine the extent of the problem. I can write you a referral note to the nearest emergency room and advise you to inquire about financial assistance programs. Delaying treatment could have severe consequences. <pauses, looking at chart> Given your lack of insurance and limited financial resources, I have done all I can do at this time. I strongly advise you to seek immediate medical attention. Here is the referral note. <hands the referral note to the patient> .
