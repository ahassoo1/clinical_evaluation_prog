DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, right. Just... some lab work. The usual, I guess? Honestly, I don't really remember what they need anymore. My memory ain't what it used to be. Can we just get it done? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly get that lab work ordered for you. Just to be sure I have everything correct, and to make the most of your visit… would you mind if I asked a few quick questions?
PATIENT: A few quick ones… alright. As long as it doesn’t take long. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. What kind of questions? It’s probably all in your system anyway, right? I've been coming here… well, I think I have. For years.
DOCTOR: You are right, we do have quite a bit of information here, but things change, so a quick update is always helpful. And yes, you have been a patient here for quite some time – since 2018, according to our records. Let’s start with this year. Have you noticed any changes in your health since your last visit?
PATIENT: 2018… wow. That’s… a long time ago. Changes? Hmm. Not really, I don't think so. Everything feels pretty much the same. A little creaky, maybe? Old age, you know. I get tired easier, but that's just… life. I haven't been sick sick, if that makes sense. No fevers, no coughs, nothing like that. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Croonquist. “No sick sick” is a very helpful way to put it. And yes, that’s exactly what I was trying to understand. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I eat. Usually. Sometimes I don’t feel like much, but that's just… when it's hot, I guess? And weight… honestly, I have no idea. I haven’t weighed myself in ages. I'm pretty thin, always have been. Tall and skinny, that's me. Does it matter? I feel alright. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know all of this, Mr. Croonquist, even if it seems small. Changes in appetite or weight can sometimes be indicators of other things, but it sounds like you're generally maintaining. Now, have you noticed any issues with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… eh. It comes and goes. Sometimes I sleep fine, other times I'm up a few times during the night. Old man stuff, you know? Tossing and turning. I don't really worry about it. I've always been a light sleeper. It's not bad sleep, just… not a solid eight hours, if that makes sense. I get by. Is there a reason you’re asking? Can we just move on to the tests now? I’m starting to get a bit… restless.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I just ask as part of a routine check. So, intermittent sleep… and you don’t feel overly tired during the day?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I get tired easier, like I said, but that’s just age. I get things done. I work, I manage… things. I'm not laying in bed all day. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a busy man. Can we please just get this lab work ordered? I really don't want to take up your whole morning. What do I need to do? Blood work? Urine? Tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. I understand your need to get this done quickly. We will start with a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a urinalysis. It’s a standard set of tests to get a good overview of your health. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood, and I’ll give you a container for the urine sample. Do you have any difficulty with urination that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Urination… no. Not really. It… happens. Like it always does. No pain, no burning, nothing like that. Sometimes I have to go more often, especially at night, but I figured that was just… old age again. Look, is this going to take long? I really need to get back to… things. I’m a power plant operator, you know. Important job. Can't be gone all day. Do I need to fast before the blood work? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And no, you don’t need to worry about bringing a sample today, we can get that done after the blood work. It shouldn't take too long, Mr. Croonquist. The blood draw itself will only be a few minutes, and the technician will be in shortly. Then you can provide the urine sample before you leave. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials that the lab technician should be aware of?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven’t had any problems before, but it's been a while since I had… anything done. Honestly, I'm not even sure what latex is. I just… get things done. No reactions, no rashes, nothing like that. I’m pretty tough. Can we just get this over with? I'm starting to feel a little… anxious now. I really hate hospitals. Or… clinics. Whatever this is. I just need to get back to work. Power plants don't run themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. No latex allergy to worry about. I understand your aversion to clinics, and we’ll get you through this as quickly and comfortably as possible. I’ll just let the technician know you’re ready. They should be right in. While we wait, is there anything else you'd like to mention, any other concerns that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Honestly, I’m just tired. And anxious. Look, I’ve told you everything I can remember, which isn’t much. Can we just… get this done? I really need to get back to… things. I appreciate you being quick, Doctor. That’s all I ask. Just get it over with. I'm not a fan of waiting around. Power plants... you know. No time for dilly-dallying.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We'll get this done right away. Please, just relax. I'll let the technician know you're ready.
