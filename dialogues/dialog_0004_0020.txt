DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? My… the office said something about a telehealth visit, but I am here now. I hope that is okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. It appears there was a slight scheduling error. A telehealth visit would have been preferable, frankly. But we can proceed in person. A “check-up” is rather vague, Ms. Benites. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. A mistake. That is… alright. No problem, really. Hmm… symptoms? Not much, no. Just… feeling a little tired, I think. And my hands… they sometimes ache. It is probably just old age, though. I work with cars all day, you know. Lots of turning and… lifting. Is that what you mean by “concerns”?
DOCTOR: “Feeling tired” and “aching hands”. Alright. Let’s quantify this a little, shall we?
PATIENT: Quantify? I do not… understand. Sorry. You want me to… count how tired I am? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Benites, I don't need a number of tired. I want to understand how tired. Is this a new fatigue, or have you always been prone to feeling this way?
PATIENT: Oh! I see. New… yes, it is newer. I used to have lots of energy, even with the work. Maybe… the last few months? It is harder to get up in the morning, and I need more naps. My husband… he used to say I was like a little machine, always going.
DOCTOR: Okay. And the hand pain?
PATIENT: The hand pain… it comes and goes. It is mostly in the fingers, and the wrist. When I am working, it hurts more, of course. But even when I am resting, sometimes it is… a dull ache. Not sharp, you understand. Like they are… old. And stiff. Like they need oil, like my cars!
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this has been happening for the last few months as well?
PATIENT: Yes, about the same time as the tiredness. I thought maybe it was just the weather, to be honest. We had a very wet spring. The cold makes my joints… complain. But it has not gotten better, even with the warm weather now. It is just… a little annoying.
DOCTOR: Let’s go over your medical history, Ms. Benites. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My doctor… Dr. Novak, he passed away last year. He checked me every year. I… I do not think I have diabetes. My blood sugar was always good. High blood pressure… maybe a little high sometimes, but he said it was okay with the pills. Arthritis… no, he never said that. Just… old age again! I am 57, you know. Things are supposed to ache.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have the little bag with me. Here. I take… Lisinopril, for the blood pressure, Doctor Novak prescribed that. And… oh, just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when my hands are really bad, I take Ibuprofen. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with that. Not that I know of, anyway. My mother was allergic to bees, but I did not get that from her. I can eat anything, thankfully. I like to cook, you know.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Any significant medical conditions in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had a weak heart, I think. She passed away when I was young, maybe 60 years old. My father, he was very strong, lived to be 85. He had… nothing, really. Just old age, like me! I do not have any siblings, I am an only child. My husband’s mother had… something with her bones, I think. But he did not talk about it much. It was a long time ago. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally – social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor, absolutely not. I never touched a cigarette in my life. And I drink maybe… one glass of wine a month, with dinner. Just a small glass, to relax. And drugs? Never! I am a mechanic, I work with oil and gasoline, that is enough!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and feel your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is fine. Whatever you need. Just… tell me if it will hurt, okay? My hands are sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just checking your range of motion. There is some tenderness in both wrists, and a slight reduction in grip strength. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now… Breathing sounds are clear, heart rate is regular but slightly elevated. Palpating your joints… some crepitus in the fingers, which is not uncommon for your age. Overall, your neurological exam is within normal limits. Now, based on your history and this brief exam, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis, possibly exacerbated by the repetitive strain from your work. The fatigue could be related, or it could be something else entirely. We need to run some blood tests to rule out other possibilities – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and an inflammatory marker to check for underlying inflammation. I am also going to order X-rays of your hands to assess the joint damage. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Osteo… what did you say? Arthritis, you mean? From the work? That does not sound good. X-rays… blood tests… it sounds serious. Will it… will it stop me from working? I need to work, Doctor. I have bills to pay. And… will it hurt a lot? What can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions, Ms. Benites. “Suspect” is the key word here. We need the test results before we can confirm anything. As for your work, it’s possible that modifying your activities, taking breaks, and using proper ergonomic tools could help manage the symptoms. The blood tests will rule out other causes of fatigue that might be contributing, such as anemia or thyroid problems. The X-rays will show us the extent of any joint damage, if any. I will order those tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw blood and take the X-rays. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. Initially, this might involve over-the-counter pain relievers, physical therapy, and possibly injections to reduce inflammation. In more severe cases, surgery may be considered, but we are nowhere near that point yet. It's important to remember that many people live full and productive lives with osteoarthritis. With proper management, you should be able to continue working and enjoy your activities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Injections… that sounds scary. And physical therapy… I do not have time for that, really. But… okay. If you think it is best. I just… I need to know if I can still work. That is all. Can I get a piece of paper with the instructions for the tests? And… where is this lab, exactly?
DOCTOR: Here. This has the instructions for the lab tests and the address. It’s just down the hall to your left. They’re expecting you. And I understand your concerns about time, Ms. Benites, but physical therapy is crucial for maintaining your function and preventing further damage. I will write a referral for you to a highly-rated therapist in the area. It is your choice whether or not to go, of course. We will discuss the results of these tests at your follow-up appointment, which I will schedule for two weeks from today. That should give the lab enough time to process everything. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. Two weeks… I will remember that. I suppose I should go to the lab, then. .
