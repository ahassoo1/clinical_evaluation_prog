DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. I am here because… well, because it hurts. A lot. I want to get this over with quickly, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Reihner. I understand wanting to get to the bottom of things efficiently. “Hurts” is a bit broad, though. Could you tell me more specifically where it hurts, and what that pain feels like?
PATIENT: It hurts in my back. Lower back, mostly. Feels like… like someone is hitting it with a hammer, but it doesn’t stop. It’s just… constant. And when I move… it gets worse. Much worse. It started maybe a week ago, I think. I was fixing fence, like always.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain, constant, described as hammering, worsened with movement, onset about a week ago, associated with fence repair. That’s helpful. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Zero to ten… That’s… difficult. It’s not a ten, not that bad. But it’s not low either. Maybe a seven? Seven feels right. It’s enough to make it hard to… to do things. Like work. And even sitting is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: A seven, constant, impacting daily activities. Thank you. Now, does anything relieve the pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Not really. I tried some of those… heating pads. Didn’t do much. Sitting still helps a little, but I can’t just sit still. I have to work. And lying down… doesn’t change it. I’ve taken some of those over-the-counter pain pills, but they don’t seem to do anything either. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, heating pads and over-the-counter pain medication have been ineffective. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. No numbness. And no tingling. My legs feel… normal. I can walk. It hurts to walk, but I can walk. And my feet are fine. They don’t feel weak. Everything feels… solid, you know? Just… sore. It's mostly the back.
DOCTOR: Good. That's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: No. Never. Not like this. I’ve pulled muscles before, working. But this is… different. This isn’t just a pulled muscle. I've never had to come to a doctor for my back before. My husband… he used to fix everything. Now… I guess I have to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this is quite different from anything you've experienced before. We’ll figure out what’s going on. Have you had any other significant medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Just… the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I have Medicare, if that matters. And I… I’m a widow. My husband passed away five years ago. He took care of all the medical things. I don’t really… know much about any of this.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Reihner. It's perfectly alright if you're not familiar with medical details; that's what I'm here for. We’ll take things slowly. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just those pain pills I told you about. Ibuprofen, I think. The red bottle. And sometimes I take something for my… my blood pressure. A little white pill. But I mostly forget. It's not important. He used to remind me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed, and a blood pressure medication taken intermittently. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication, or the dosage?
PATIENT: No. I don’t know the name. It’s in a little bottle… I think it’s a small white pill. That’s all I know. He always filled it. I just… took it when he told me to. He kept everything organized. Now… I don’t even know what I’m supposed to take.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Reihner. We can certainly figure that out. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any. I can eat anything. I haven’t noticed anything I’m allergic to. I eat a lot of… traditional foods. Nothing bothers me. I’m Lakota. We eat a lot of… bison. And berries. But nothing gives me a reaction. I’ve never had one.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Reihner, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination of your back to better understand the source of your pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, that's fine. Just… please be quick. I have to get back to work. The fence… it needs fixing. But do what you need to do. I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to have you lie down on your stomach on the examination table. I'll need you to point to the exact location of the most intense pain. Then I’ll gently palpate your back to assess tenderness and muscle spasm. Please let me know immediately if anything causes significant discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. It hurts right here. And… it feels like it goes down my back a little bit, on both sides. But mostly right here. Be careful. It really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m feeling some muscle spasm and tenderness in the lumbar region, right here. And you are right, there is some discomfort radiating laterally. Can you tell me on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst, what's the pain level right now with me pressing here?
PATIENT: It’s… maybe an eight? It’s worse when you press on it. A sharp pain. Not just a dull ache. It makes me want to pull away. Please be careful. I don't want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, an eight with palpation. I understand. I will be very gentle. Now, I’m going to have you gently try to bend forward, as far as comfortable. Just let me know when you feel pain, and we’ll stop. This helps me assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Stop. Stop, please. It hurts too much. I can’t… I can’t go any further. It feels like something is going to break. It’s sharp, and it goes all the way down my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, please don’t strain yourself. That’s enough. I observed limited range of motion, and you reported pain radiating down your legs with bending. I’m also noting some muscle guarding. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. No obvious neurological deficits noted. I’m hearing no tingling or numbness still, correct?
PATIENT: No. Still no tingling. Still no numbness. Just… pain. A lot of pain. It feels like it’s getting worse just from… lying here. Are you finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner, I am finished with the physical exam for now. Based on your history and the physical examination findings – lower back pain, constant and sharp, radiating pain down the legs, limited range of motion, muscle spasm, and tenderness to palpation – it is highly suggestive of a lumbar strain or potentially a disc issue. However, to rule out any more serious causes and to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I would like to order some imaging studies, specifically an X-ray and potentially an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? An MRI? What does that… involve? I don’t want anything… invasive. And I don’t want to be stuck in a machine. I just want the pain to stop. Is that going to take a long time? And will it cost a lot of money? I’m on Medicare…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Reihner. An X-ray is a very simple and quick procedure. You simply lie on a table while a machine takes pictures of your bones. It doesn’t involve any needles or anything invasive. It's relatively quick, usually just a few minutes. An MRI is a bit more involved. You lie inside a large, tunnel-shaped machine, and it uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your soft tissues, including your discs and nerves. It takes a bit longer, around 30-45 minutes, and it can be a little noisy. We can discuss options for managing any potential claustrophobia if that's a concern. Regarding cost, Medicare typically covers both X-rays and MRIs when medically necessary. We will verify your coverage and inform you of any potential out-of-pocket expenses beforehand. I believe these studies are important to get an accurate diagnosis and ensure we are providing you with the best possible care. Would you like me to proceed with ordering these tests?
PATIENT: Alright. If it's going to help… yes. Order the tests. But please, no long waits. I have work to do. And… and make sure they know I get anxious in small spaces. I don’t want to panic. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And tell me how much it will cost before you do anything. Medicare… they can be difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will prioritize getting these tests scheduled as quickly as possible and will make a note in your chart regarding your anxiety and request accommodations if needed. I’ll have the scheduling department contact you directly to arrange the appointments. They will also be able to provide you with the estimated costs and confirm your Medicare coverage. In the meantime, I will prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a stronger pain medication to help manage your symptoms. I also recommend applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and avoiding any strenuous activity. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before prescribing anything?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. As I said before, nothing bothers me. Just… please, not anything that will make me sleepy. I need to be able to work. And I don't want to feel… out of it. I have to fix that fence. It’s important.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will prescribe a non-sedating muscle relaxant and a pain medication with minimal side effects. I will also provide you with clear instructions on dosage and potential side effects. Now, while we await the results of the imaging studies, if your pain worsens significantly, you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet, or you experience any difficulty with bowel or bladder control, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think… that's everything. Just… get those tests done quickly, and I need to get back to work. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Even if it's a lot of tests. I just want this pain to stop.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. I understand your desire to get back to work, and I will do everything I can to expedite the process. I will also have the scheduling department contact you as soon as possible to arrange the appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if your pain worsens, don't wait – go to the emergency room. Here’s a summary of our visit, including the prescriptions and instructions. Get well soon, Ms. Reihner.
