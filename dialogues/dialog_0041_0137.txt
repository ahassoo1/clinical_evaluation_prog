DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, welcome. It’s good to meet you. I'm Derell Polczynski, but you can call me Derell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day. My name is Lindra. Is okay to call you Derell, yes? I… I need paper for the home. The… the old people’s home. They need to know I am… good to go inside, you understand? For live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, it’s perfectly okay to call me Derell. And… you need a form, a paper, to show the home that you’re cleared to move in?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Paper. To show them I am… not sick, you know? To live there is good, but they need paper first. My husband, he say so. He is very… careful man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So your husband wants a note from me saying you're healthy enough to move into the home. That's very reasonable. Let's get some information down so I can write that up for you. Just to be clear, is this a new move, or have you been there before?
PATIENT: No, no before. Is new. We… we just decide now. Is getting too much for me, the house. Too many stairs, you understand? My legs… they not so good anymore. Husband do everything, but… he is old too, now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lindra. It sounds like a sensible decision. So, to get started, could you tell me a little bit about your health in general?
PATIENT: Hmmm… health. I… I take pills for the water. The blood pressure, they call it. And sometimes… sometimes my knees hurt very bad. And I get tired easy. But… mostly I am okay. I eat good food, my husband cook very good. Is not always easy to remember everything, you know? Old age… it does things to you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for your blood pressure and you have some knee pain and fatigue. That’s helpful to know. Do you remember what the name of the blood pressure medication is?
PATIENT: The name… Oh, is a white pill. Small white pill. I… I think it start with an “A”? But I am not sure. My husband, he gives me the pills. I just take them. Is not good memory, you know? I try, but… it go away.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lindra. Don’t worry about it at all. We can often find it in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. Mango, fish, chicken… everything. And I like flowers! My husband, he grow very pretty flowers. I never… never have problem with allergies. Is good, yes? No sneezing or… or itchy skin.
DOCTOR: That’s great to know. Have you been to the hospital or seen any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… recently? I… I think I see the eye doctor last year. For the glasses. And… and I go to the hospital maybe two years ago? For the… the cough. But is not so bad. Just a little cough. Is long time ago now. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you saw the eye doctor last year and had a cough two years ago. Do you have any major health problems like diabetes, heart trouble, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, no diabetes. My husband, he has that. Is very… careful with sugar. But me, no. And heart… doctor say my heart is okay. A little fast sometimes, but okay. I walk… I walk every day, you know? Not so far now, but I try. Is good for the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no diabetes, your heart is generally okay, just a bit fast sometimes, and you try to walk daily. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… My mama, she have the… the shaking. Old age shaking. And my brother, he have the… the sugar. Like your diabetes. But… I think that is all. My papa, he live very long life. Very strong man. No problems. Is hard to remember, you know? So many people.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lindra. So your mother had some shaking, and your brother has diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: No, no smoke! Never smoke. And… and I drink sometimes a little wine. With dinner. Very little. Just a small glass. And… and no other things. I am a good woman, you know? Very good woman. Always good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindra, that's very good to know. Just one last quick thing before we do a quick exam. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill and anything over-the-counter like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, when my knees hurt very bad, I take the… the white pill. For the pain. Husband buy it for me. Is not every day. Just when it hurt very much. And… and sometimes I take the vitamin. The orange one. For good health. Husband say I need it. Is all. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes you take a white pill for knee pain and an orange vitamin. Thank you for telling me everything, Lindra. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to just listen to your heart and lungs and take a look at your knees, just to get a better understanding. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. You listen to my heart, you look to my knees. Is good. I trust you, Derell. You are very kind man. But… be gentle with my knees, yes? They hurt sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. I'll be very gentle. Please have a seat here on the examination table. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It might feel a little cool. Your heart sounds a little fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at those knees. Can you bend them for me, slowly?
PATIENT: Okay… slowly. Like this? Ooh… that hurt a little. Is okay, is always hurt a little. But I can bend them. Is not so bad. You see? But be careful, yes? Is old knees.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. There's a little swelling and they are tender when I touch them. Range of motion is a bit limited, but you’re doing well to keep them moving. No major warmth or redness. It seems like some typical age-related wear and tear. Alright, Lindra. That’s all I need for now. It sounds like you're generally in good health, aside from the knee pain and slightly fast heart rate. Do you have any other concerns or anything else you want to tell me?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You listen very good. You see my old knees. Is good. I… I hope the paper you write is enough for the home. My husband, he worry so much. He want me to be safe. Is good man, my husband. Very good man. Is that okay, Derell? Will the paper be enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, I believe the paper will be perfectly sufficient. I'll write a note stating that you've been evaluated, are generally in good health, and are able to transition to the home. I’ll also mention your knee pain and slightly fast heart rate, so they are aware. I'm typing up the note now. It should only take a few minutes. We can also discuss some simple exercises you can do to help with the knee pain if you’d like. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please! Exercises would be good. My husband, he try to make me walk, but… I get tired easy. Maybe you can show me something easy? Something I can do inside, when the weather is bad. Is good if I can be strong. For the home, you know? I want to be strong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. Here's what I'll write in the note: “Lindra Abdollahi is a 72-year-old female who presents for medical clearance to transition to a new residential home. She is generally in good health, with controlled blood pressure. She reports intermittent knee pain and fatigue. Examination reveals mild swelling and tenderness of both knees, with limited range of motion. Cardiac auscultation reveals a slightly elevated heart rate. She is deemed medically stable for transition.” Now, for exercises. We'll start slow. Simple leg raises while sitting in a chair are a good start. Just lift your leg up as high as you comfortably can, hold for a few seconds, and then slowly lower it. We can also do ankle pumps – just point your toes up and down. These help with circulation. Do you think you can try those?
PATIENT: Oh, that… that look easy. Leg raise… yes, I can do that. And… and ankle pump? Like this? Is okay, yes? Not so much pain. But… maybe a little. I try, you know? I try for the home. And for my husband. Is good to be strong. You think… you think he will be happy with the paper? He worry so much.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Lindra! That's perfect. Listen to your body, and don't push yourself too hard. A little discomfort is okay, but stop if it gets painful. And yes, I am absolutely certain your husband will be very happy with the paper. It shows you’ve been thoroughly evaluated and are well on your way to a smooth transition. Here's the note. I’ve also included some simple exercise instructions on the back. Please share it with the home as well, so they are aware of what you're able to do. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Derell. Thank you very much. Is very… official looking. My husband will be so happy. No… no questions, I think. You explain everything very good. You are very kind doctor. And… and thank you for listening to my old knees. Is good to know someone listen. I… I think that is all. Thank you again. And… and tell your heart thank you for listening too!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Lindra. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I will certainly tell my heart thank you! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the future. I wish you all the best in your new home. And give your husband my regards.
PATIENT: I will. I will tell him. Is good to know good people still exist.
