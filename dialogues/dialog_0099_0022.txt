DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my tummy feels big. Bigger than usual, you know? And I don’t want to eat much. Not hungry. It’s been… a while, I think. A little hard to remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: "A while," is helpful. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… a few weeks? Or maybe longer. Time goes so fast these days! I used to be able to remember everything, but… not so much now. It’s just… feels different. Not painful, just… full and I don’t have much energy for eating. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a few weeks at least of feeling full, decreased appetite, and a little fatigue. And you say your abdomen feels bigger. Has anyone else noticed a change in your size?
PATIENT: Oh, no one’s said anything. I live alone, you see. Just me and my memories… which aren't what they used to be! I look in the mirror, and… well, I think it’s bigger. But maybe I’m just imagining things. It’s hard to tell, really. I used to be a sociologist, you know. Always looking at other people. Not so good at looking at myself now.
DOCTOR: Right. A change you’ve noticed yourself. And no pain at all?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not a bit. Just… uncomfortable. Like I ate too much, but I haven’t! It’s a strange feeling. And sometimes, just… a little tired. Not like sick tired, just… old tired, I guess. Is that… normal for someone my age? I'm ninety, you know. A long time to live!
DOCTOR: Ninety is a long time, Soila. Fatigue can be normal, certainly. But this feeling of fullness, the change in your abdomen... let's do a quick exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An exam is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… please be gentle? My bones aren’t what they used to be, you know. And… what exactly will you be doing? I get a little nervous with… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, gentle. I'll be listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then feeling it gently to check for anything unusual. It’s a standard procedure. We'll start with your stomach, just to get a baseline. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. Please just let me know if anything does bother you. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A table… yes. Here we go… slow and steady. Is this how it works? You listen and poke? I don't mind the listening, it's the poking that worries me. Just be careful, Doctor. Very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing normally for me, Soila. Deep breaths… in and out. Hmm. There's a bit of… fullness here. And it doesn’t feel entirely soft. Do you recall any recent weight changes, Soila?
PATIENT: Weight changes… Oh dear. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time, Doctor. I used to, but… the scale’s broken now, I think. Or maybe I just forgot to fix it. Everything gets mixed up these days. I eat… what I can. Not much, but… I don't think I've lost weight, but I don't know. Does it matter? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be important. Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. Is that a polite question, Doctor? Well… they’re… regular, I suppose. Not… different than usual. Maybe a little… less? But I’m not sure. Old age does strange things to your body, you know. Everything slows down. Is something wrong? Is my tummy very bad?
DOCTOR: "Very bad" is a strong term, Soila. We're gathering information. Alright, and any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no vomiting. Thank goodness for that! And… no, not nauseous either. Just… not hungry. And the fullness. It’s like I’m carrying a little… balloon inside. Not painful, just… there. Is it my stomach, Doctor? Is something wrong with my stomach? I used to eat so much, you know. Pierogi, borscht… all the good things! Now… I can barely manage a little soup. It's just sad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no nausea, no vomiting, decreased appetite, fullness, and no reported pain. Given your age and the lack of a precise timeline, and considering you are uninsured, I suspect it may be a case of constipation causing bloating. However, given the fullness you describe, and to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an abdominal X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood count, X-ray… it sounds… complicated. And expensive? I don’t have… money for that, Doctor. I live on a very small pension. What will it show? Is it something very bad? I’m an old woman, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life. Do we need to do all these tests? Can't you just… give me something for the fullness? Something to help me eat again? I miss my pierogi.
DOCTOR: The tests are necessary to rule out anything serious, Soila. A simple obstruction, for example, can become quite dangerous if left untreated. As for the cost… I can see what resources are available at the clinic. We may be able to find some assistance. However, without proper diagnostics, I cannot responsibly prescribe anything. An X-ray will give us a baseline. A blood count can identify any infection or abnormalities. We’ll proceed with the X-ray first, then discuss the blood work if needed. Do you agree to the X-ray?
PATIENT: Oh… an X-ray… alright. If it will help me eat again… yes. Yes, I agree. But please… be gentle. And tell me what you see. Everything, Doctor. I want to know everything. And… is it very painful? I get scared easily these days. And… will it take long? I have a little nap planned for this afternoon.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is painless, Soila. It's a quick procedure. A technician will position you on a table, and a machine will take a few images. It shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. I will review the results myself, and we will discuss them afterward. Now, I'll have the technician come in and get you positioned. Please just lie still and follow their instructions. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Fifteen minutes… yes. I can manage fifteen minutes. Thank you, Doctor. Please be careful with the pictures. I hope they don’t show anything too scary. Pierogi… I miss my pierogi… .
