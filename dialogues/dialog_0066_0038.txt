DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It… it concerns planning for the future, I believe. I was advised to inquire about… a document. Something to state my wishes, should I become unable to communicate them myself. An Advance Directive, perhaps? Or a POLST form, I think I heard mentioned. I confess, the details escape me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a very sensible thing to be thinking about. It sounds like you’re interested in learning more about advance care planning – and you’re right, both Advance Directives and POLST forms fall under that umbrella. To be clear, an Advance Directive is a broader document outlining your overall healthcare wishes, while a POLST form – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order specifically for serious illness. I see you’re 35 years old. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or hospitalizations that prompted you to think about this before, or is this more of a proactive step?
PATIENT: Proactive, I believe is the correct term. My memory… it isn't what it once was. There have been… instances. Nothing major, not requiring extensive hospital stays, as far as I recall. Mostly just periods of… feeling unwell, requiring rest. I wouldn't say they were particularly frightening, but they did make me consider what would happen if… if I were unable to express what I needed. That is why I thought it best to have something in writing. It's all a bit vague, I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. It's perfectly normal for things to be a little vague when you're thinking about these types of situations. It’s actually very responsible of you to be thinking about this now. So, periods of feeling unwell... can you tell me a little more about those?
PATIENT: It's difficult to say precisely. Just… a general feeling of being weak, exhausted. Some dizziness, I think. And a… a persistent headache. They always resolved on their own, with rest and plenty of fluids. It was my previous husband who suggested seeing a doctor on a couple of occasions. He was… rather cautious. I don’t believe anything conclusive was ever found. It's been several years, naturally. Perhaps it is best not to dwell on it. It’s the possibility of something similar happening again that prompted this visit, not a specific recurrence.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, and headaches that resolved with rest. And these happened several years ago, and you haven’t experienced them recently. Just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside those – things like fever, vision changes, trouble speaking, or any numbness or weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t recall any fever. Vision changes, possibly… a little blurring on occasion, but I wear glasses, and attributed it to needing a stronger prescription. Trouble speaking, no. And numbness… I don’t think so. It was very… gradual, these feelings. Not sudden or dramatic. It's hard to be certain, after so long. I truly don't remember anything significant accompanying those symptoms. Perhaps it was simply stress? I was… rather preoccupied during that period of my life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to cover all bases, are you currently experiencing any of those symptoms now – the weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, or headaches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I am feeling quite well, presently. That is why I wanted to address this now, while I am feeling well. To make sure my wishes are known, should my health decline unexpectedly. It feels… prudent, if that makes sense. I wouldn't want to be a burden, or cause confusion, if something were to happen.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Evann. That's very thoughtful of you. So, to recap, you're experiencing no current symptoms, but have a history of periods of weakness, exhaustion, dizziness and headaches that resolved on their own several years ago. And you’d like to discuss creating an Advance Directive to outline your healthcare wishes. Before we focus on the Advance Directive itself, let's quickly go through a brief review of your past medical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… no, I don't believe so. My previous husband insisted on regular check-ups, and everything was always… normal. Blood pressure, I suppose, was sometimes a little elevated, but nothing requiring medication. And I am not diabetic, as far as I am aware. I was generally quite healthy, despite those occasional periods of feeling unwell. Truly, I don't recall ever being diagnosed with anything significant. It was more… preventative care, if anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I haven’t had any surgeries. Hospitalizations… a brief stay once, many years ago, for a rather bad case of the flu. But it was very short, just overnight for observation. And nothing since then. Truly, I have been quite fortunate in that regard. I don't require much medical attention, generally. That is why this… this planning feels so strange. I don’t have a lengthy medical history to consider.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So no surgeries, and a brief hospitalization for the flu many years ago. Now, regarding family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that is a difficult question. My mother… she passed away when I was young. And I wasn't particularly close to my father. I know she suffered from… some form of heart condition, I believe. But I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… he was rather stoic, and didn't discuss such matters. I'm afraid I don't have much information to offer. It wasn’t a family accustomed to sharing medical details, if that makes sense. It’s rather frustrating, I admit. Knowing one’s family history feels important, but… it’s simply not something I have access to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright, and quite common, to have limited information about family history. We can still proceed without it. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I maintain a fairly… temperate lifestyle, if that makes sense. I prefer quiet evenings at home, reading or working on my etchings. I find it… restorative. I’ve always valued my health, and avoided anything that might jeopardize it. It's rather difficult to create detailed works when one is unwell, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not currently taking any medications. I occasionally take aspirin for headaches, but very infrequently. And I do not take any supplements. I prefer to address any minor ailments with rest and hydration, if possible. I’ve always been… cautious about introducing foreign substances into my system, if that makes sense. I believe in allowing the body to heal naturally, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, to summarize: you’re a 35-year-old female experiencing no current medical issues, with a history of occasional periods of weakness, exhaustion, dizziness, and headaches that resolved on their own. No chronic medical conditions, no surgeries, a brief hospitalization for the flu many years ago, limited information regarding family history, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drug use, and no current medications. Given all of that, and your desire to create an Advance Directive, let’s discuss what that entails. Are you familiar with the different components of an Advance Directive, like a Living Will and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I confess, I am not. I understand the concept – stating my wishes for future medical care – but the specific terminology is unfamiliar to me. Living Will, Durable Power of Attorney… these terms are new to me. Perhaps you could explain them? I am eager to learn, but I confess, I am rather lost in the details. I would be grateful for any clarification you can provide.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A Living Will, also known as an advance directive, outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to communicate them yourself. This could include things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment, such as a ventilator or feeding tube. A Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, on the other hand, designates someone you trust – a healthcare proxy – to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so. It's essentially giving that person the authority to speak for you and ensure your wishes are followed. Do those explanations make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… much clearer. A Living Will outlining what I want, and a Durable Power of Attorney designating who makes those decisions. So, it is two separate documents? One stating my preferences, and the other appointing someone to ensure those preferences are honored? It seems… sensible. I hadn't realized there were two distinct components. It's reassuring to know someone can advocate on my behalf, should the need arise. Is one more important than the other, or are they both equally crucial?
DOCTOR: That's exactly right. Two separate documents. And they are both equally crucial, but for different reasons. The Living Will ensures your wishes are known, even if the person you've designated isn't available. The Durable Power of Attorney ensures someone is authorized to make decisions on your behalf and advocate for your best interests. Many people choose to have both. Now, before we proceed with completing these documents, I want to be sure you understand the implications of these choices. Are you comfortable discussing some scenarios?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe that is prudent. I would prefer to be as informed as possible. Thinking through various scenarios seems… responsible. I would rather face difficult choices now, in a clear state of mind, than leave matters ambiguous. Please, feel free to present any situation you deem relevant. I am prepared to consider all possibilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start with this: Imagine you are in a hospital, suffering from a severe illness with no hope of recovery. You are unable to communicate, and your doctors believe continuing treatment would only prolong your suffering. Would you want life-sustaining measures, like a ventilator or feeding tube, to be used?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. Prolonging suffering… it is a disheartening thought. I believe… I would not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is truly no hope of recovery. I value quality of life, even if it is… brief. I would prefer a peaceful end, rather than being sustained by machines. However… the thought of actively stopping treatment is also unsettling. Perhaps it is best to simply decline life-sustaining measures, rather than requesting their removal? I am uncertain. It is a difficult distinction. Perhaps it depends on the specific circumstances.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable and thoughtful response. It’s perfectly alright to be uncertain. So, it sounds like you’d be comfortable declining life-sustaining treatment in the event of a terminal illness with no hope of recovery. You're not comfortable with actively requesting its removal, but are okay with allowing natural death. Now, let's consider a different scenario. Imagine you are in an accident and sustain a severe brain injury. You are in a coma, and doctors are unsure if you will ever regain consciousness. They are concerned about significant long-term disabilities. Would you want your healthcare proxy to make decisions based on your expressed wishes, or would you want them to prioritize your comfort and quality of life, even if that means foregoing aggressive treatment?
PATIENT: Another difficult question. Aggressive treatment… that is a loaded term. Quality of life is paramount, naturally. However, abandoning hope entirely… it feels premature. I believe I would want my healthcare proxy to initially pursue treatment, within reason. However, if there is no demonstrable improvement, and the prognosis remains bleak, I would want them to prioritize my comfort and dignity. A prolonged existence in a vegetative state… that is not something I would desire. I would want them to consider my wishes, as expressed now, but also to exercise their own judgement, guided by my best interests. It is a delicate balance. I trust their discretion. However, it would be beneficial if they had some indication of my preferences regarding… the level of intervention I would tolerate. For example… would I wish to be fed through a tube indefinitely? Or would I prefer to allow nature to take its course? It is those nuances that are difficult to convey.
DOCTOR: That is very insightful, Evann. You’re thinking through these scenarios with remarkable clarity. So, your proxy should initially pursue treatment, but prioritize comfort if there's no improvement, guided by your wishes and their best judgement. You also want them to be aware of your preferences regarding things like feeding tubes. We can document these preferences in detail in the Advance Directive. Before we move on, is there anyone specific you would like to designate as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: That… is a complicated matter. My previous husband and I are divorced, and I have limited contact with my family. I do have a close friend, Anya Petrova, whom I trust implicitly. She is a level-headed and compassionate individual. I believe she would be capable of advocating on my behalf, should the need arise. However… she is currently residing overseas, pursuing her research. I am uncertain if she would be able to travel here on short notice. Perhaps… I could list her as my primary proxy, with a secondary option? Someone local, whom I trust, but with whom I have less frequent contact? It is not ideal, but it may be the most practical solution. I hesitate to burden Anya, given her commitments. It is a difficult situation. Perhaps… I could consider a trusted legal representative? Someone familiar with medical ethics and capable of acting in my best interests? It feels… impersonal, but it may be the most reliable option. It is a difficult decision, and I am uncertain which course of action is best.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly understandable. It’s important to choose someone you trust, but also someone who is readily available. We can certainly list a primary and secondary proxy, and even consider a trusted legal representative as a backup option. Given Anya’s current location, and your concerns about her availability, let's explore the possibility of listing a local individual as your primary proxy, and Anya as your secondary option. Would you like to provide me with the name and contact information of someone local whom you trust?
PATIENT: There is… Mr. Jian Li. He owns the art supply shop where I purchase my materials. He is a quiet and observant man, with a keen sense of fairness. We have developed a friendly rapport over the years. He is not a close friend, per se, but I trust his judgement implicitly. He is a pillar of the community, and I believe he would act in my best interests. However… he is not particularly familiar with medical terminology. Perhaps I could provide him with some background information, and a copy of this Advance Directive, to familiarize him with my wishes? He is a quick learner, and I believe he would be capable of advocating on my behalf, given sufficient preparation. Yes… Mr. Jian Li would be an acceptable proxy, with Anya Petrova as my secondary option. I can provide you with his contact information. I apologize for the complexity of the situation. It is not easy entrusting one’s fate to others.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Evann. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about these things. Okay, so we have Mr. Jian Li as your primary healthcare proxy, and Anya Petrova as your secondary option. And we’ll document your preferences regarding treatment and feeding tubes in detail, and provide Mr. Li with a copy of the Advance Directive. Now, let's start completing the actual Advance Directive form. It will involve outlining your wishes in writing, and signing it in the presence of a witness. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have addressed all of my concerns. I am ready to proceed, whenever you are. I trust your guidance, and I appreciate your patience and understanding. It is reassuring to know that I am taking steps to safeguard my future well-being. Let us begin.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Wonderful. We’ll start with the first section – your personal information. It just asks for your name, date of birth, address, and contact information. And then we'll move on to outlining your wishes for medical treatment… one step at a time. Don't hesitate to ask questions at any point. We'll take as much time as you need. Here you go. Let’s start with your name…
PATIENT: Evann… BuoniconTi. B-U-O-N-I-C-O-N-T-I. And my date of birth is… August 12th, 1990.
DOCTOR: Perfect. And your address is…?
PATIENT: 14 Willow Creek Apartments, Unit 3B. 27 Hawthorne Street, Urban, State. Zip code… 90210.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And finally, your contact phone number…?
PATIENT: 555-123-4567. It’s a relatively new number. I… I changed it recently. For privacy reasons. It’s still… a reliable number, though. It connects to my voicemail, and I check it regularly. I apologize for the hesitancy. I’m simply… cautious about sharing personal information. It’s a habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. I understand completely. It’s always wise to be cautious. Okay, we have all of your personal information now. Let’s move on to the next section – your healthcare wishes. This is where you can outline your preferences for medical treatment, such as whether or not you want life-sustaining measures, like a ventilator or feeding tube, in certain situations. Are you ready to begin?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I believe so. It… feels rather daunting, but I understand the importance of articulating my wishes. Let us proceed. Perhaps it would be helpful if you guided me, providing examples of potential scenarios? It’s difficult to anticipate every possibility, but I would like to be as thorough as possible. I suppose we should begin with the most extreme cases, outlining my preferences in the event of a terminal illness with no hope of recovery?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's a very good place to start. And yes, I will guide you every step of the way. We can definitely start with the most extreme cases – a terminal illness with no hope of recovery. In that scenario, would you want life-sustaining measures, such as a ventilator, feeding tube, or CPR, to be used to prolong your life, even if it only extends your suffering?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I would not. I believe… prolonging suffering serves no purpose. If there is truly no hope of recovery, I would prefer to allow nature to take its course. I would not wish to be kept alive artificially, reliant on machines. I value quality of life, even if it is brief. I would prefer a peaceful end, rather than a prolonged existence in a state of suffering. I would like that explicitly stated. No life-sustaining measures. Allow natural death. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, Evann, that is very clear. "No life-sustaining measures. Allow natural death." We will document that explicitly. Now, let's move on to the next part of this section. In the event that you are unable to communicate your wishes, and you are suffering from a severe illness, but there is some possibility of recovery – even if it’s a very slim one – would you want all possible medical interventions to be used, or would you prefer a more conservative approach, prioritizing your comfort and quality of life?
PATIENT: That… is more difficult. I suppose… I would initially want all possible medical interventions to be used, if there is even a glimmer of hope. I would not wish to forgo treatment prematurely, simply due to pessimism. However, I would also want my healthcare proxy to exercise their own judgement, guided by my best interests. If the interventions prove ineffective, and the prognosis remains bleak, I would want them to prioritize my comfort and quality of life. A prolonged and futile struggle… that is not something I would desire. Perhaps it would be helpful if we included a clause specifying a time limit? If there is no demonstrable improvement within a certain timeframe, I would want them to shift their focus to palliative care? It feels… callous, but it is a necessary consideration. Perhaps three months? Or six? I am uncertain.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful and reasonable approach, Evann. It's excellent that you’re thinking about these nuances. Specifying a timeframe is a good idea. Three months is a common timeframe for such situations, and it allows for a reasonable period of evaluation. We can definitely include a clause specifying that if there is no demonstrable improvement within three months, the focus should shift to palliative care. So, to summarize: you want all possible medical interventions initially, but if there is no demonstrable improvement within three months, the focus should shift to palliative care. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is correct. All possible interventions initially, but with a clear timeframe. And with a shift to palliative care if there is no demonstrable improvement within three months. I believe that encapsulates my wishes accurately. It is reassuring to know that it is being documented so precisely. What is the next consideration? Perhaps the question of a Durable Power of Attorney? We have already established my healthcare proxy, but is there a separate document required to formally designate them?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're exactly right. Now we'll move on to formally designating your Durable Power of Attorney. This document is crucial because it legally authorizes Mr. Jian Li to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. We'll need to include his full name, address, and contact information, and a statement declaring him as your designated healthcare proxy. We'll also need to include a section outlining his authority – specifically, what types of decisions he is authorized to make. Do you want to grant him broad authority to make all healthcare decisions on your behalf, or would you like to specify certain limitations?
PATIENT: Broad authority, I believe, would be preferable. I trust Mr. Jian Li’s judgement implicitly. To specify limitations would… undermine his ability to act effectively in a crisis. However… I would like to include a clause stating that he should always consult with my other designated proxy, Anya Petrova, if possible. Even if she is overseas, her input would be valuable. Perhaps… he should also consult with my primary care physician, to ensure that all decisions are aligned with my medical history and best interests. But, ultimately, the final decision should rest with him. He should have the autonomy to act in my best interests, even if it means deviating from the opinions of others. Yes, broad authority, with the caveat that he consults with Anya and my physician, whenever feasible. Is that a reasonable approach?
DOCTOR: Yes, Evann, that is very reasonable and thoughtful. Broad authority with the requirement to consult with Anya Petrova and your primary care physician whenever feasible. We will document that explicitly. Now, we just need to gather Mr. Jian Li's full name, address, and contact information. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. His name is Jian Li. L-I. And his address is… 88 Blossom Street, Urban, State. Zip code… 90211. And his phone number is… 555-567-8901. He owns the art supply shop on Hawthorne Street. He is a very reliable and responsible individual. I believe that is all of the information required to formally designate him as my Durable Power of Attorney. Is there anything else I need to provide?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Evann. We have all of the necessary information. Now, all that remains is the signature section. You will need to sign and date the form in the presence of a witness, who is not related to you and is not your healthcare proxy. Do you have someone in mind who can act as a witness?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. The receptionist, Mrs. Chen, has been very helpful throughout this process. She is a neutral party, and is not related to me in any way. Would she be acceptable as a witness?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Chen would be perfectly acceptable as a witness, as long as she meets the requirements – not related to you, not your healthcare proxy. Wonderful. Let’s proceed with the signature section. Please sign and date the form, and I’ll ask Mrs. Chen to witness your signature. This is the final step in completing your Advance Directive.
PATIENT: Is this sufficient? I am ready to proceed to the next step, if needed. It feels… reassuring to have this completed, finally.
DOCTOR: Yes, Evann, this is perfect. Everything is complete and properly signed and witnessed. Congratulations, you have successfully completed your Advance Directive. I will make a copy for your records, and Mrs. Chen will retain the original. This document is now legally binding, and will ensure that your wishes are respected in the event that you are unable to communicate them yourself. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe all of my questions have been answered. I am incredibly grateful for your patience and guidance throughout this process. It was… daunting, but you made it manageable. And I am deeply appreciative of Mrs. Chen’s assistance. It feels… reassuring to have this completed, finally. Thank you again for everything. I believe that will be all for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure to assist you. It’s truly admirable that you’ve taken the time to plan for the future. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns down the line. Have a wonderful day, and take care.
PATIENT: .
