DOCTOR: Hi Alese, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Let me see… well, it’s this pain, you see. Lower down, in my belly. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite severe. I believe my previous physician mentioned something about… something being amiss with my system? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, "pain in your belly that comes and goes, and can be severe." And you said your previous doctor mentioned something about your “system”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Something about my… internal workings, perhaps? It was quite a while ago, and truthfully, the details are… hazy. I do recall something about lupus being involved? Though, I can’t say for certain. It all feels rather distant, unfortunately. I’ve been seeing different doctors over the years, and things tend to blend together, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to keep track of everything. Lupus can cause abdominal pain, but it’s also a lot of other things. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on now. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that is a good question. It’s not a recent development, certainly. I believe it began… well, several months ago, perhaps? It started gradually, just a mild discomfort, easily dismissed. But then it began… escalating. It’s been particularly troublesome in the last few weeks, I would say. Though, pinpointing a specific date is… proving difficult. My apologies.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. "Several months ago, gradually getting worse, more troublesome in the last few weeks." Okay. And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, it’s… a cramping sensation, mostly. Deep inside. And a… a sort of ache, a dull throbbing. When it’s at its worst, it feels… sharp, almost like twisting. It comes in waves, really. Not constant, thankfully, but when it arrives, it's quite debilitating. It makes it difficult to… well, to do much of anything, to be honest. I find myself just wanting to lie down. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. "Cramping, deep ache, sharp twisting pain that comes in waves and makes it hard to do things." Okay. Does anything seem to trigger the pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven't noticed any specific trigger, not that I’m aware of. Though… I do believe it's worse after I’ve been… active, perhaps? A long walk, or even just a bit of gardening. And sometimes after eating… although, I haven’t been able to connect it to any particular food. It seems rather random, truthfully. It just… happens. It's quite frustrating, to be honest. I worry about… overdoing it, but then I also don't want to be completely inactive.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse with activity and sometimes after eating, but no clear pattern. And you said it comes in waves. How long do these "waves" of pain usually last?
PATIENT: Hmm… that varies, I believe. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes, a brief discomfort that passes quickly. But other times… it can last for hours. Truly, hours. Enough to disrupt my sleep, sometimes. It’s difficult to say definitively, as it changes from day to day, or even hour to hour. It’s quite unpredictable, which is… unsettling. I suppose I’ve just gotten used to… living with it, to some extent. But it’s certainly not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, lasting anywhere from minutes to hours. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I have been rather fatigued lately, more so than usual. And I’ve noticed… some swelling in my ankles, occasionally. Nothing dramatic, but definitely noticeable. Oh, and I suppose my appetite hasn’t been quite what it used to be, though that could simply be due to… well, everything, you understand. I haven’t really connected it to the pain specifically, but those are things I’ve noticed. I also have these… strange rashes from time to time, but those come and go as well. It’s hard to say what’s connected and what isn’t, truthfully. My apologies for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: No, this is helpful. Fatigue, ankle swelling, decreased appetite, and rashes. Okay. Now, I see here you have a history of seeing different doctors. Do you know if any tests were done related to this pain in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky question. I believe there were some blood tests, at some point. And perhaps an… imaging scan? A picture of my insides, maybe? But honestly, it was so long ago, and I’ve seen so many specialists, it’s all rather muddled. I don’t recall what they were looking for specifically, or what the results were. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I wish I could provide you with more concrete information, but my memory… simply isn’t what it used to be. I suppose I have relied on the doctors to keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: That's alright. We can review your records if that's alright with you. Let's see… Okay, here's a record from 2018 with a CBC, CMP, and a… an ANA titer. The ANA was positive, but the level wasn't terribly high. There's also a note about a possible lupus workup, but it doesn't seem like it was ever fully completed. Do you remember anything about this?
PATIENT: Oh… ANA titer… that sounds… familiar. Lupus workup… yes, I think I remember a doctor mentioning that. Something about my immune system being… a bit overactive, perhaps? But it was so long ago, and I was seeing a different specialist then. I don't recall any specific results, or what came of it. Honestly, it all feels rather distant. I mostly remember being told… not to worry too much, and to just… keep an eye on things. Which, I suppose, is what I’ve been doing. Is that… concerning? Should I have pursued it further at the time?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily concerning, but it is something we need to consider, especially with your current symptoms. A positive ANA can sometimes be a sign of autoimmune conditions like lupus, but it doesn’t always mean you have it. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll feel your abdomen to check for tenderness or any masses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, do whatever you deem necessary. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It’s… reassuring to have someone investigate, and perhaps shed some light on what’s been going on. I am rather… at my wit's end, to be honest. Do let me know if you feel anything… unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. And… okay, I’m feeling some tenderness in your lower abdomen, mostly on the left side. Not a sharp pain, but definitely sensitive to the touch. No masses that I can feel at this point. I'm also noticing some mild swelling in both of your ankles. How would you rate the pain right now, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Hmm… the tenderness is certainly… present. As for the pain level… right now, it’s probably a… 4, perhaps? Not debilitating, but definitely noticeable and uncomfortable. It's a dull ache, mostly, with a bit of a… throbbing sensation. It's not as severe as it gets, thankfully, but it's enough to be… distracting. And yes, the ankles are a bit puffy, I hadn’t even noticed it that much. I suppose I've just gotten used to… feeling unwell. It's difficult to say what’s normal anymore, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, 4 out of 10, a dull ache with throbbing. Given your symptoms – the abdominal pain, fatigue, ankle swelling, the rash, and the previous positive ANA – I think we need to investigate this further. I want to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker called an ESR and CRP, and repeat that ANA titer, as well as some other autoimmune tests like anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies. We'll also need a urinalysis. I also want to rule out any other potential causes of abdominal pain, so I’m going to order an abdominal ultrasound. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Abdominal ultrasound and blood work… I suppose it’s best to be cautious, and rule everything out. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I’m… rather grateful for your attention to this, to be honest. It’s been a long time coming, and I’m hopeful that we can finally get to the bottom of this. When will I be able to get these tests done? And will I need to fast for any of them?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever you're ready. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood work – that means no food or drinks other than water. The ultrasound can be done anytime, fasting is not required for that one. I'll give you a lab requisition form and the information for the imaging center. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It usually takes a few days to get everything back. In the meantime, if your pain gets significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, nausea, or vomiting, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Twelve-hour fast… yes, I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. No, I don't believe I have any questions at the moment. You've covered everything quite thoroughly. I’m… relieved to finally be taking some action, to be honest. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I will be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I have a better idea of my availability. And I will certainly heed your advice about seeking emergency care if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
