DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this… tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet, you know? It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me more. I just want to get it checked out, if that makes sense. I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Tingling, alright. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three, four months now? It started off just a little, like when your foot falls asleep, but it wouldn't go away after I moved it. Now it’s… constant, mostly. Not painful, exactly, just… annoying. It keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Constant tingling for three to four months. And is it the same in both hands and both feet?
PATIENT: Yes, pretty much the same. Maybe a little worse in my right hand, the one I use for… well, for everything, I guess. Being a mail carrier, you use your hands a lot! But both feet tingle, too, and it’s… evenly annoying, if that makes sense. Not one worse than the other, really.
DOCTOR: A mail carrier, you say. And does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Being off my feet helps, definitely. When I sit down and rest, it calms down a bit. But… when I’m on my route, walking all day, it gets worse. And cold weather makes it much worse. I try to wear gloves, even in the summer sometimes, but it's still not great.
DOCTOR: Worse with activity, better with rest, exacerbated by cold. Alright. And have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything, not really. I can still carry the mail, you know? But… maybe I drop things a little more often than I used to. But I’m also getting older, so maybe that's just me being clumsy! It's hard to say, honestly. I haven't thought about it much.
DOCTOR: I see. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I’ve been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn't? It's been a hot summer, and the route is… long. Oh! And my balance feels a little off sometimes, especially when I’m walking on uneven ground. But that could just be my old age, too. Everything’s just… creaky these days.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, and some balance issues. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay after I started watching my salt. Otherwise… no, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, if I'm being honest. It's hard to get time off work.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, currently controlled with diet. Alright. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not even tonsils! And I've never been in the hospital, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot for work, and I eat… well, I try to eat healthy. It's hard when you're on the go all day. Mostly sandwiches and fruit. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My mother, she had arthritis in her hands when she got older, real bad. And my father… he had some problems with his legs, swelling mostly. But that was a long time ago. They both lived a good long life, though. Ukraine is… was a difficult place, you know? Not a lot of doctors where they lived.
DOCTOR: Family history of arthritis and leg swelling. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any regular medications. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it. Over-the-counter stuff, you know? Tylenol or something. Nothing prescribed. I try to avoid medications if I can. They never seem to do much good, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. Ukrainian food… we use a lot of garlic! Never had a problem with that, anyway. I think I'd know if I had an allergy, wouldn't I? I’ve been eating for a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm getting too old to be falling apart! Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm not very good with… poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat here. I’ll start with your reflexes. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little tap with this. Then we’ll move on to strength and sensation. Please relax your leg, and I'll check your knee reflex first.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here goes nothing, I suppose. Just be gentle with me, Doctor. This old body isn't what it used to be. And don’t mind if I flinch a little. I'm a bit jumpy these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Reflexes are a little diminished, but still present bilaterally. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh. Like this? Is that tight enough? It's a little sore, actually. From all the mail, I guess. I carry a lot of mail. I don’t think I’m as strong as I used to be, though.
DOCTOR: Grip strength is slightly reduced bilaterally, more so on the right. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. Close your eyes. I’m going to touch your hands and feet with this cotton ball, and tell me when you feel it. Tell me “yes” when you feel the touch. Starting with your right hand…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Closed. Yes… that’s right there. I feel that. It’s… a little tingly, actually. Is that normal? It’s hard to tell what’s tingling and what’s… the touch. It's always tingling, you know? That's the problem.
DOCTOR: Sensation is diminished to light touch in both hands and feet, consistent with your report of tingling. Now, I'm going to check your feet. No visible swelling or deformities. Capillary refill is normal. Range of motion is slightly limited in both ankles, but no acute pain reported. Alright. It seems like we’re dealing with some diminished sensation and strength in your hands and feet, along with slightly reduced reflexes. This could be due to a number of things. It's consistent with peripheral neuropathy, but we need to rule out other causes.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what-now? Is that bad? I just want to know what’s causing the tingling, and if there’s something I can do about it. I really don’t want to stop carrying the mail, you know? That’s all I do these days. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy simply means there’s some damage to the nerves in your extremities – your hands and feet. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can be caused by a variety of things. Diabetes is a common cause, as are certain vitamin deficiencies. Sometimes it’s just age-related. We need to run some tests to determine the exact cause. I’m going to order a blood glucose test, a complete blood count, and a vitamin B12 level. We should also consider a nerve conduction study, but we can discuss that later. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, never been diagnosed with diabetes. My mother had it, I think, but I never have. I don’t eat that much sugar, honestly. Mostly just… sandwiches and fruit, like I said. I’ll get those blood tests, then. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this tingling. It’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the lab order. You can take this to the lab across the street. They're open until 5 PM. Once you have the results, you can either schedule a follow-up appointment with me, or you can have them faxed directly to the clinic. I recommend scheduling a follow-up, so we can discuss the results in detail. In the meantime, try to keep your feet warm, and avoid any activities that exacerbate the tingling. If the tingling gets significantly worse, or you develop any weakness, please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Warm feet… and no mail. I suppose I can try. Faxed to the clinic is probably best. I'm not good with scheduling appointments. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… try to keep my feet warm and avoid mail. It sounds… difficult. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. I’ll see what the tests say, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you have any concerns before your follow-up, don't hesitate to call the office. .
