DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer, that’s right. Betty Schneer. Well, now… things haven’t been so clear lately. Folks mumble, ya know? Or maybe I mumble. Hard to say. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Said I need to get me ears checked.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’ve noticed some difficulty hearing, and your daughter is concerned. That’s very thoughtful of her. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, is this a new issue, or has your hearing been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… a while now, I reckon. Not somethin’ I paid much mind to, to be honest. Always been a bit of a noisy one myself, workin’ in that factory all them years. Machines clatterin’ and whatnot. Probably did a number on me ears, I suppose. It just feels… quieter lately, is all. Harder to make out what people are sayin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lot of years working in a factory can certainly contribute to hearing loss. It’s common. And it’s good you’re addressing it now. You mentioned it just feels “quieter” and harder to hear – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… it’s like when folks talk, it’s just… muffled, ya know? Like they got a mouthful of somethin’. And sometimes, I just… don’t hear it at all. Especially the womenfolk, they have higher voices, it seems. My grandson, little Timmy, he yells a lot. I can usually hear him alright. Funny, that. Does that make sense, Doctor? I'm not good with explainin’ things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. You're explaining it very well. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with clarity and potentially with higher-pitched sounds. It’s also not uncommon to notice it more with certain voices. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a quick hearing test. It’s a simple procedure where we present different tones and words at various volumes and you let me know when you can hear them. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test, huh? Sounds alright to me. Never had one of them before, but I ain't afraid. As long as it doesn’t involve pokin’ and proddin’, I suppose. Just tell me what I gotta do, and I’ll give it me best shot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding, I assure you. Just listening. I'm going to have you sit in this chair here, and I’ll place these headphones over your ears. I will then play a series of tones and words at different volumes, and I’ll ask you to indicate when you can hear them – usually by raising your hand or pressing a button. I’ll be right here the whole time, so just let me know if you have any questions or need a break. Before we start, do you have any pain, ringing, or dizziness in either of your ears?
PATIENT: No, no pain, Doctor. Not a bit. And thankfully, no dizziness. Though sometimes… sometimes me head feels a bit fuzzy, ya know? But that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. No ringin’ though, thankfully. Never liked a lot of noise, even when I was workin' in that factory. So, headphones, huh? Let's get to it, then. Don’t want to waste yer time.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. No ringing is good. And a bit of fuzziness is common as we get older. Let’s go ahead and get started with the hearing test. I’m going to start with your right ear. I’ll explain everything as we go. Now, I'm going to play a tone. Please raise your hand as soon as you hear anything - even if it's very faint. Ready?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let 'er rip, then. I’ll give ya a shout if I can’t hear a thing. Don't be shy about adjustin’ 'em if they’re uncomfortable, ya hear? Me ears are a bit particular, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And… okay. Now a slightly higher pitch… and… Yes, good. Now a lower frequency… and… Okay. Let's try a few more at this level… Alright, that’s good. Now let's move on to the left ear.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just keep 'em comin'. This one feels a bit… muffled, maybe? Hard to say. Me ears aren't what they used to be, that’s for sure. Are we almost done, Doctor? Me neck’s gettin' a bit stiff.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’re almost finished, Mr. Schneer. Just a few more tones, and then we'll be done. I appreciate your patience. Alright, that’s all. Thank you very much. Based on the results of the hearing test, it appears you have a moderate hearing loss in both ears, with a slightly greater reduction in the higher frequencies. This is consistent with what we often see in individuals with a history of prolonged noise exposure, like working in a factory. It's not unexpected, given your background. Would you like me to explain the results in more detail?
PATIENT: Moderate, ya say? Sounds fancy. Noise exposure, that figures. That factory was a beast. Explanations… sure, I suppose. I don’t pretend to understand all this doctor talk, but I’d like to know what it means. What’s gonna happen now? Am I goin’ deaf? Don’t sugarcoat it, Doctor, I can take it. Just tell me straight. And if I need one of them hearin' aids, how much are they gonna cost? My daughter’s gonna want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. You're not going deaf, but your ability to hear certain sounds, especially higher-pitched ones, has been reduced. Think of it like turning down the volume on a radio – you can still hear, but some sounds are quieter or harder to distinguish. Inside your ear are tiny hair cells that vibrate when sound waves enter. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can damage those hair cells, and once they’re damaged, they don’t regenerate. That’s what the test showed. As for hearing aids, they can be a very effective way to amplify sounds and improve your hearing. They're custom-fit to your ears and programmed to your specific hearing loss. The cost can vary depending on the technology and features, but typically ranges from around $2,000 to $6,000 per ear. Medicare will often cover a portion of the cost, but there’s usually a copay and deductibles involved. We have a dedicated audiologist here who can evaluate your specific needs and discuss financing options with you. Would you like me to schedule an appointment with the audiologist?
PATIENT: Two to six thousand dollars? Goodness gracious. My daughter’s gonna have a fit. Copays and deductibles… it all sounds mighty complicated. An audiologist, huh? Alright, I suppose. If it’s gonna help me hear me grandson better, it’s worth lookin’ into. Schedule an appointment, then. Just… just tell 'em I'm an old fella with a lot of noise in me past, and not much money in me future. And if they try to sell me somethin' fancy, tell 'em to hold on a minute. I need to think about it, ya hear? I’m a simple man, Doctor. Don’t need all the bells and whistles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. I’ll make sure to note that you’re looking for a practical solution and would like to discuss financing options. I’ll schedule you an appointment with our audiologist, Ms. Evans, for next week. She's very patient and will explain everything clearly, without any pressure. She’ll also discuss the different types of hearing aids available and recommend the best option for your needs and budget. I have you scheduled for Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Is that time alright?
PATIENT: Tuesday at ten… sounds fine. As long as I don't have to run a marathon beforehand. Thank ya, Doctor. Appreciate ya takin' the time with an old timer like me. I reckon that's all for now, then? Unless there’s somethin' else I'm forgettin'… which is entirely possible, ya know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about forgetting anything, that’s perfectly normal. I'll have the nurse print out a summary of our conversation and the hearing test results for you to take home. And just to be sure, before you leave, do you have any questions for me about anything we've discussed today?
