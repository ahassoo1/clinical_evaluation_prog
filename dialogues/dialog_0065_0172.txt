DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I’m here. My husband insisted, you see. New to the area, he says I need a “check-up.” Really, I feel perfectly fine. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I see. Well, even feeling “perfectly fine” warrants a baseline assessment, especially when establishing care with a new physician. It’s good your husband is proactive. Let's start with a bit of your medical history then. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Heavens, no. Doctors are for when you’re sick, not for poking around when you aren’t. I’ve had a physician when necessary, of course. Back in… well, somewhere. It was a very long time ago. I truly can't recall the details. It's all rather fuzzy, you understand. My husband handles all those things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. Perhaps we can start with what you recall, then. Any significant illnesses or surgeries you're aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Surgeries… there was something with my… appendix, I believe? When I was quite young. And a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that's hardly significant. Honestly, Doctor, I've been remarkably healthy my entire life. I eat well, I get plenty of rest… or, I did, before all this moving around. It's all terribly inconvenient, you know.
DOCTOR: An appendectomy and a bout of the flu. Noted. And you say you’ve been generally healthy. Any family history of serious illness that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Family history… now that’s a difficult question. My parents… well, they’re both gone now. And I wasn’t particularly close to their families, you see. Lots of… cousins, I suppose. I honestly couldn’t tell you if anyone suffered from anything specific. It’s all a bit of a blur. I’m not one for dwelling on the past, Doctor. It’s much better to focus on the present, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your perspective, Ms. Engelhaupt. However, family history can sometimes provide important clues. Alright, let's move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I've always been able to eat anything put in front of me. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I certainly haven’t had any… serious reactions to anything. Honestly, Doctor, I find all these questions rather… unnecessary. Are you quite finished? I have a bridge game this afternoon, you know.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the initial questions, Ms. Engelhaupt. Just a few more to get a complete picture. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I detest taking pills. Never have, never will. My husband occasionally tries to get me to take something for my… joints, I suppose. But I refuse. I believe in natural remedies, you see. A good rest and a cup of tea are far more effective. Really, Doctor, I'm perfectly capable of managing my own health. Are you certain this is necessary?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief physical examination then, Ms. Engelhaupt. It will give me a baseline to work from. I'll start by checking your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examine my abdomen? Really, Doctor! I haven't the faintest idea why you need to listen to my heart when I feel perfectly well. This is all rather… intrusive. But, very well. Get it over with quickly, if you must. I have a schedule to keep. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Ms. Engelhaupt. I will be as efficient as possible. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Slightly elevated, but not alarming at this point. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16, normal and unlabored. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a faint murmur. Not immediately concerning, but warrants further investigation. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. I do note some mild guarding. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Also, an EKG would be prudent given the murmur. I also recommend a chest X-ray. These will help us get a clearer picture of your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A complete what now? And an EKG? Doctor, are you attempting to frighten me? All this… poking and prodding and tests… it’s simply absurd. My husband will be furious if I’m stuck here all day. I told you, I feel perfectly fine! No. Absolutely not. I will not be subjected to any further tests. I’ve answered your questions, you’ve listened to my heart… what more do you need? I’m leaving now. I’m sure my husband can find another doctor who won’t waste my time with all this… unnecessary fuss. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Engelhaupt. I respect your decision. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. Ignoring potential health concerns can have serious consequences. Please take this information with you. I wish you the best of health.
