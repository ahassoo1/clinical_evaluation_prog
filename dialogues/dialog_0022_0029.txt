DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full awful quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I could burst. It’s been happening for a couple months now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds uncomfortable. So, feeling full very quickly, even with small amounts of food, for about two months now. And you said it doesn't seem to matter what you eat?
PATIENT: That’s right. Soup, bread, fish… doesn't make a difference. Used to be able to put a good plate of salmon away, but now… three or four bites and I gotta stop. My wife, Elsie, keeps saying I’m not eating enough, and she’s probably right. It’s just… unpleasant, you know? I don’t want to force it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that you’re listening to your body and not forcing yourself to eat when you're feeling full. Has there been any nausea or vomiting associated with this, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Not even close. Just… that stuffed feeling. And sometimes a bit of heartburn, but I get that anyway, you know, old age and all. Elsie makes a good chili, but it does play havoc with my stomach sometimes. It's not always the heartburn though, it's mostly just the quick fullness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no vomiting, mostly just the early fullness and occasional heartburn, which you experience sometimes regardless. Has this fullness been accompanied by any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits – either constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, maybe a little bit of bloating. Not terrible, just… a bit uncomfortable after I eat. Like I've got a bit of a bubble in there. Bowel habits… haven't really changed, no. Regular as clockwork, thankfully. Elsie always said I was a creature of habit, and she's not wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about the bowel habits being regular. And the bloating being mild is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any unintended weight loss since this started happening?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Elsie’s been weighing me, she worries something fierce. And yes, I think I have lost a bit. Not a lot, but a few pounds, I reckon. She says it’s enough to be concerned, and she's usually right about these things. I haven’t been keeping track myself, to be honest. It just hasn't been something I've focused on.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unintentional weight loss noticed by your wife. That's definitely something we want to investigate. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… forty years now? And high blood pressure, Elsie keeps on at me about that, makes sure I take my pills. Other than that… not much. Bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just old age again. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing serious that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal forty years ago, and high blood pressure currently managed with medication. And arthritis in your knees. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. And I take a glucosamine and chondroitin supplement for my knees, but Elsie bought that at the health food store, so I don’t know if that counts. She says it helps, and it can’t hurt, so I take it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so blood pressure medication and the glucosamine/chondroitin supplement. And no known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Elsie always asks when the pharmacist gives me something new, just to be safe. She’s a cautious one, that Elsie. Good woman.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright, Mr. Obarr, let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen to see if there’s any tenderness or anything unusual. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Go ahead. Elsie always says I worry too much, so maybe you can tell me if it’s nothing to fret over.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Here we go. Try not to poke too hard, eh? Elsie will have my hide if you do!
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual noises there. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll start on your right side… Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Not particularly, no. A little pressure, but no pain. It feels… normal, I suppose. Elsie always says I’ve got a bit of a spare tire, so maybe that’s why it feels firm. Go ahead, though. Just let me know if you find anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright… and how about here?
PATIENT: No, still nothing. A bit uncomfortable, maybe, but no real pain. It feels… like a bit of a bubble, I suppose, if that makes any sense? Especially after I eat. Like something’s… puffed up in there. But it doesn't hurt, you understand? Just… full. Very full, very quickly. And that bubble feeling lingers for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel a bit of fullness, and it’s not sharply tender. It does sound like there's some bloating there, as you mentioned. Given your symptoms of early fullness, unintentional weight loss, and the bloating, and taking into account your age and medical history, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. One possibility is gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining. Another possibility, and we need to rule this out, is something more serious like a blockage or even early signs of cancer. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, but we need to be thorough. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and some metabolic panels. I also want to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities. Finally, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be a good idea to get a clear picture of what’s going on in there. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cancer… that sounds scary. But you’re right, better to be safe than sorry. Blood work and a stool test, that sounds alright. A CT scan… well, I don’t like the idea of radiation, but if you think it’s necessary, I trust your judgment. Elsie will want me to get all the tests done anyway. She’s very thorough, that woman. So yes, go ahead and order them all. When can I get them done? And will they tell me what’s going on right away?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I understand your concern about the CT scan, and we'll certainly discuss the risks and benefits again before we proceed. We can also explore alternative imaging if you’re particularly worried. The blood work and stool test can be done right here at the clinic. The nurse will draw your blood and give you instructions for collecting the stool sample. They usually take a few days to come back. The CT scan will need to be scheduled at the imaging center across town; I’ll have the receptionist arrange that for you. It usually takes a week or so to get the results of the scan. We won't have definitive answers right away, but once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. We'll go through everything step-by-step, Mr. Obarr. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Step-by-step is good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. Elsie will be relieved that we're getting this checked out. And I'm glad you’re not dismissing it. So, the nurse will come and get me for the blood work then? And you’ll have the receptionist sort out the CT scan? That sounds good. Thank you. I suppose I’ll just wait here until they’re ready for me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And the receptionist will contact you to schedule the CT scan. In the meantime, try to relax. I'll also write out a summary of today's visit and the planned tests for you to take home. Do you have any questions for me before I finish this up?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Elsie always says I worry too much, and you’ve put my mind at ease somewhat. Just… thank you. For listening, and for taking this seriously. It’s good to know someone is looking into it. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse then. Thank you again, Doctor Tosca.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. That’s what I’m here for. Please don't hesitate to let me know if anything changes or if you have any concerns before the nurse arrives. Here’s a copy for you. The nurse should be with you shortly. .
