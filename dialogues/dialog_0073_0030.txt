DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor recently. It’s not… normal for me.
DOCTOR: A change in body odor… alright. And when did you first notice this change, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started maybe three or four weeks ago? Around the middle of July, I’d say. It's not constant, but definitely more noticeable than it used to be, even after a shower.
DOCTOR: Three or four weeks… okay. And is it localized to a specific area, or is it all over?
PATIENT: It seems to be… mostly under my arms, but I think I can smell it a little bit even when I’m just… standing here. Not a strong smell, but it's definitely there. It's hard to explain. It's not like the usual sweat smell, it’s… different.
DOCTOR: Different, you say. Can you describe the difference?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s tricky. It’s not… sour, exactly. And it’s not like onions or garlic. It's… almost musty? Like a damp cloth, maybe? And a little bit… sweeter than usual? I know it sounds weird. I’ve tried different deodorants, but nothing seems to really help.
DOCTOR: A musty, slightly sweet odor… right. Have you noticed any other changes accompanying this?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. My appetite’s been normal, I haven’t lost or gained any weight. I’ve been sleeping okay, maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that’s just the heat. No fever or anything like that. Oh! Actually… my feet have been a little bit more sweaty lately, now that I think about it. Is that connected?
DOCTOR: Increased foot sweating… possibly. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your skin – rashes, dryness, itching, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, my skin feels normal. No rashes, no itching, no dryness. I did have a little bit of a scrape on my elbow last week, from working – I fell while I was laying down some linoleum – but that’s healing up nicely. It’s not red or swollen or anything. Just a normal scrape, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Just what the doctor prescribes for my high blood pressure – Lisinopril, 20mg every day. And I take a Vitamin D supplement, but that's it. Oh, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches, when my joints are bothering me from work, but not regularly. I don’t have any allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, Vitamin D, ibuprofen as needed… okay. Now, I’m going to ask some slightly more personal questions, if you don’t mind. It’s important to rule out certain possibilities. Have you noticed any unusual vaginal discharge, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that is personal. No, Doctor, I haven't. Everything seems normal there. I get regular check-ups, and everything’s always been fine. It’s just… this smell. That’s why I came. I’m really worried something is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Purtee. It’s good you came in. Alright. We’ll do a quick physical exam, and then we can decide if further testing is needed. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your skin. Could you please sit up and loosen your shirt, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds good. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It’s really been bothering me, and I'm glad I came in about it. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Skin appears normal. No visible rashes or lesions. I don’t see anything obviously concerning. Now, let’s check your thyroid. It’s a long shot, but sometimes thyroid issues can cause changes in body odor. Thyroid feels normal. Not enlarged. Alright. It’s difficult to pinpoint the cause of this with just a physical exam. We'll need some lab work to be sure. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a TSH test to check your thyroid function.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Lab work is fine. What exactly will those tests tell us? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work tomorrow, so I hope it won't be too disruptive to my schedule. I lay flooring, you know, it's physical work. I need to be able to… well, to work.
DOCTOR: The complete blood count will rule out any underlying infection or blood disorders. The metabolic panel assesses your kidney and liver function, which can sometimes contribute to body odor. And the TSH test, as I mentioned, checks your thyroid. It's unlikely to be the thyroid, but we need to be thorough. As for the results, the lab usually takes about 2-3 business days. I can have the results sent directly to my office, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. I'll also order a urine sample, just to be safe. It's a simple test, but it can sometimes reveal hidden issues. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss before you leave, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: A urine sample, okay. That's… fine. Two to three business days, so maybe by the end of the week? And you said a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Will that be a phone call, or do I need to come back in? And… will I need to change anything with my medication while we wait for the results? I don't want to stop taking my blood pressure medicine if I don't have to. I've been on it for years.
DOCTOR: The results should be back by the end of the week, yes. As for the follow-up, it’s best if you come in, so I can explain the results thoroughly and answer any questions you may have. A phone call is rarely sufficient for a proper discussion. And no, you absolutely should not stop taking your Lisinopril. Do not adjust your medication without my explicit instruction. I'll have my nurse give you the lab requisition form and instructions for the urine sample. She'll also schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other concerns, Ms. Purtee?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running the tests. It's a relief to know we're trying to figure it out. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I’ll wait for the nurse then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Purtee. Have a good day.
