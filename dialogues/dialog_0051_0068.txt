DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my leg, you see? It’s been… puffy. After the treatment, it started. For the cancer, I mean. It’s just… swollen. It’s a bit uncomfortable, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy… swollen. And this started after your cancer treatment. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… maybe a month ago? A little more? It wasn't right away after the last… the stuff they gave me. It took a little bit. I noticed it when my shoes felt tight, you know? And then I looked, and… yeah, it was puffy. It's mostly in my right leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month ago, right leg. And it started subtly, noticing your shoes felt tighter. Has the swelling been getting worse, better, or stayed about the same since then?
PATIENT: It’s… stayed about the same, I think. Some days it’s a little more, some days a little less. But it hasn’t gone down, that's for sure. It’s not painful, really, just… there. And feels heavy, you know? Like I’m dragging it around.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent swelling, no significant pain, but a feeling of heaviness. Has anything specific made it feel worse or better?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I try to put my leg up when I can. Doesn’t seem to do much, honestly. I walk a little, but not too much. I get tired easily now, after everything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Sasha. Fatigue is very common after cancer treatment. Now, let’s talk a bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes since the treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… well, I get… a little breathless sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… walk upstairs, maybe. And my skin feels… dry, I think. It’s hard to say. I’m always cold now, even when it's warm. And… I just don't have much energy, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion, dry skin, feeling cold, and low energy. These all sound like things we should investigate. Have you had any chest pain or discomfort at all?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Nothing like that. It's just… when I try to do things, I get tired very quickly. And then my leg feels heavy, and… I have to sit down. It’s just annoying, really. It’s not hurting, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating, Sasha. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urination – more frequent, less frequent, or any difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. Now you mention it… I have been going to the bathroom a little more often, maybe. At night, too. I thought I was just getting old! I didn’t think it was anything important.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Sasha, thank you. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I want to take a closer look at your leg. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on with my leg. And… maybe get some energy back!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll do our best. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Heart sounds are… regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, but a little diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your leg. I do notice some swelling in the right lower leg, mostly around the ankle and calf. The skin is warm and slightly dry. No visible signs of injury or infection. I'll also check your pulses. Pulses are present, but slightly diminished in the right leg compared to the left.
PATIENT: Oh… diminished? Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Sasha, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Diminished pulses can indicate a few things, and we want to rule out any potential circulation issues. Now, I’d like to order a few tests, if that’s alright. I think a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a D-dimer test would be a good starting point. A D-dimer test can help us rule out a blood clot in your leg. We should also get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And finally, I think an ultrasound of your right leg would be helpful to visualize the blood flow and see if there’s a clot or any other blockage. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. But… yes, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to feel better, like I used to. And not be so tired all the time. When will I get the results, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand it feels like a lot, Sasha, but it's best to be thorough. We're just gathering information to understand what's going on. The lab work should be back within a day or two. The ultrasound might take a little longer, depending on availability. My nurse will schedule you for that. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and give you a call to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend continuing to elevate your leg when you can, and staying well-hydrated. If you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you feel short of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… please call me as soon as you know something. I don't like feeling like this. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sasha. I understand, and I will. We'll get to the bottom of this. My nurse will come in shortly to schedule your tests and go over the instructions. Again, please don’t hesitate to go to the emergency room if you experience any worsening symptoms. It was nice to meet you, Sasha. And thank you for coming in today. .
