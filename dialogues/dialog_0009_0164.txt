DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and kind of yellow, and it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I didn’t really put two and two together at first, but now I think that’s the problem. It’s just… odd.
DOCTOR: That is odd, Ms. Haggar. Yellowing of the skin, and fatigue… and specifically linked to fava beans. That’s very interesting information. Could you describe the fatigue for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just feeling sleepy, you know? It’s… everything feels heavy. Like a weight is on me all the time. Even simple things, like walking up the stairs, take a lot of effort. And I just don't have the energy to do much of anything. It started a few weeks ago, I think. It comes and goes, but it’s definitely worse after I eat those beans. I used to enjoy them, actually. We had them a lot growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling, impacting even everyday activities, and worsening with fava bean consumption. And this started a few weeks ago. Has anything else changed around the time this began?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Everything’s been pretty normal, as normal as it gets. I haven’t been sick, haven’t started any new medications… I did take a trip to visit my sister in the countryside last month, but that was before this really started. Mostly just been… tired. And yellow. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve never had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Haggar. It is concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. This pattern of symptoms – fatigue and jaundice triggered by fava beans – is raising a specific possibility in my mind. Before we jump to conclusions, though, let's gather a bit more information. Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or anything like that. I haven’t been sick at all, no vomiting or nausea. And my… well, everything’s been regular, if you know what I mean. No changes there. It’s really just the tiredness and the yellowing. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like I feel sick, just… weak and off-color.
DOCTOR: Okay, no gastrointestinal symptoms, just fatigue and jaundice. That’s helpful. Now, have you noticed any dark urine or pale stools?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I have noticed my urine seems a bit darker than usual. I thought it was just because I wasn't drinking enough water, but maybe it’s something else? And… yes, I think my stool has been paler as well. Not dramatically, but noticeable if I’m paying attention. I’m starting to get a bit scared, to be honest. What could be causing this?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing those details, Ms. Haggar. Dark urine and pale stools, combined with the other symptoms you’ve described, are definitely something we need to investigate further. The history you’ve provided is strongly suggestive of something called Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency. It’s a genetic condition where your red blood cells don’t function properly, and certain things – like fava beans – can trigger them to break down. However, we need to confirm this with a blood test. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency… I’ve never heard of that. But if that’s what it sounds like, then… yes, absolutely. A blood test sounds good. Whatever we need to do to find out what’s going on. It’s just… is it serious? Is there a cure? I’m a little overwhelmed, to be honest. I’ve always been healthy, and this is all very new and frightening.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Haggar. It is unsettling to face something new and unfamiliar. G6PD deficiency isn’t typically life-threatening, but it can cause complications if it's not managed. The good news is it's often relatively straightforward to manage. The primary approach is avoiding triggers – like fava beans – and certain medications that can also cause problems. There isn’t a “cure” in the traditional sense, but you can live a perfectly healthy life with it. First, let’s get that blood test ordered. Then, depending on the results, we can discuss this in more detail and create a plan to keep you feeling your best. Before we proceed with the test, let's quickly review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies, and are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… reassuring, somewhat. Avoiding beans doesn’t sound too bad. As for allergies, I’m allergic to penicillin – I get a rash. Other than that, no. And I don’t take any medications regularly, not even vitamins. I used to take a calcium supplement, but I stopped a few months ago. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally, if I have a headache. Nothing else. And no herbal supplements or anything like that. I’m pretty careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Penicillin allergy noted. And no other medications or supplements. That’s very helpful. Okay, I'm ordering those tests for you now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take the samples right away. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid fava beans and anything containing them, just as a precaution. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay for now. Just… avoiding beans, right? And wait for the results. I guess there’s not much else I can do. Thank you, Doctor Petrimoulx. You’ve been very helpful. I was really scared before, and I feel a bit calmer now, knowing what we’re looking at. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. And yes, just avoiding fava beans for now. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you wait for the results – like fever, severe fatigue, or yellowing that spreads – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a lab requisition. The lab technician will need this. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. Take care. .
