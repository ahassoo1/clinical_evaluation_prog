DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, it is… the gas. A lot of gas. It is… embarrassing, really. More than usual, you see. I am not sure what is causing it.
DOCTOR: “Embarrassing” is a perfectly reasonable way to describe it, Mr. Goodstein. It’s good you came in to address it. “More than usual” is a start. Can you describe when this gas started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It began, I believe, about… oh, three weeks ago, perhaps? Around the middle of July. It was not sudden, you understand. It built up slowly. I did not pay much attention at first, but it has become… noticeable. I eat the same things, usually. Burgers, fries… sometimes a hotdog. Nothing new, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, mid-July. Gradual onset. And you haven't changed your diet at all?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No changes to my diet. I go to the same… establishment, you see. “Burger Bliss”. Every Tuesday and Friday. Always the same order. A double cheeseburger, large fries, and a diet cola. And sometimes, a small vanilla milkshake. But I have had that before, many times. It is… perplexing, this gas. It is not the milkshake, is it?
DOCTOR: While it could be something in the milkshake, it's unlikely if you've consumed them previously without issue. To get a better understanding, can you describe the gas itself?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well… it is… frequent. Several times a day. And… quite loud, I am afraid. Not always, but often. It does not hurt, exactly. More… uncomfortable. A bloating feeling, mostly. And the smell… well, it is not pleasant. I try to excuse myself, you understand. But it is difficult to… control. It happens at any time of the day.
DOCTOR: Frequent, loud, uncomfortable, bloating, unpleasant odor... and no specific time it occurs. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this gas?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… other symptoms… Well, my stomach does rumble a bit more than usual. And sometimes, a little bit of… heartburn. But I take those little tablets for it. The pink ones. Tums, I believe they are called. They help, usually. But no… I don't think anything else. No pain, no… changes in my bowel movements. Everything seems normal in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Rumble, some heartburn relieved with Tums, no bowel movement changes. And you said you've been taking Tums for this concurrently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I started the Tums around the same time as the gas, maybe a week or so after it began. I thought it was just… indigestion, you see. From the burger, perhaps. But the gas… it continues, even with the Tums. I take two, maybe three, after lunch. And sometimes, one with dinner, if I feel it coming on. They don’t… solve the problem, but they help with the burning.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to rule out a few things. I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, family history, and things like your daily habits. This will help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the Tums?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the Tums. Nothing else. I do not like taking pills, you see. I only take the Tums when I need them. I have not been to the hospital for… oh, many years. Maybe ten years ago, for a bad cold. But no surgeries, never. And my family… my mother had some trouble with her stomach, I think. But I don't remember the details. She is no longer with us. It was a long time ago. I mostly keep to myself, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I do not drink. And I certainly do not use… those things. I am a very… simple man, you see. I prefer a quiet evening at home. Perhaps watching the television. I do not partake in such… activities. I do enjoy a cup of chamomile tea before bed, though. Does that… count?
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea doesn’t count. It’s… actually quite soothing. Now, let’s talk about your weight. I see here you're 171 cm and 129 lbs. Have you experienced any recent weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. My weight has been… stable, you see. I have not lost or gained any weight. Always around the same. 129 pounds. I weigh myself every… other week, perhaps. Just to be sure. I like to keep track. It is important, you see, to… maintain a consistent weight. It shows good health, does it not?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and just gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or masses. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, you may proceed. I trust your judgment, of course. I am a bit nervous, you see, but I understand it is necessary. Please, do not hesitate. I want to get to the bottom of this gas. It is… unsettling, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. Okay. I’m listening now… and gently pressing… I’m not detecting any significant tenderness or masses. I do hear some… increased bowel sounds, which is consistent with gas. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Normal bowel sounds, increased. Abdomen soft, mildly distended. No guarding or rebound tenderness.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring, Doctor. That there is no… serious problem, you mean? The distended… what was it? The dis-ten-ded? Is that bad? I do feel a bit… full, sometimes. After the burger, you see. But I always finish it. I do not like to waste food.
DOCTOR: “Distended” simply means slightly swollen. It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Goodstein, and it's likely related to the gas. It explains the feeling of fullness. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it’s most likely a functional gastrointestinal issue, meaning it's a problem with how your digestive system is working, rather than a structural issue like a blockage or inflammation. However, to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a stool test to check for any infections or parasites. And a blood test to check for Celiac disease and lactose intolerance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, I am agreeable. A stool test… and a blood test. I do not mind. I would like to know what is causing this gas, you see. To be certain. I trust your judgment. It is… good to be thorough. And if those tests show nothing… what then? Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Perhaps… change my diet? Avoid the Burger Bliss? Though I do enjoy it so…
DOCTOR: Those tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. If they are negative, it’s likely a case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, or perhaps a sensitivity to certain foods. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, you could try keeping a food diary. Write down everything you eat and drink, and note when you experience gas. That might help identify a trigger. And yes, temporarily reducing your intake of gas-producing foods – beans, cabbage, broccoli, carbonated drinks – could provide some relief. As for Burger Bliss… it’s difficult to say definitively, but reducing your frequency of visits might be helpful, just in case. I’ll send these orders to the lab now. The stool test requires a sample collected at home. The lab will provide instructions. And the blood test can be done here, at the clinic. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A food diary… I suppose I can do that. It sounds… tedious, but if it helps… I will try. And the blood test here at the clinic… good. That is convenient. The stool test… how does one… collect such a sample? Is it… unpleasant? And what about the instructions? Will someone explain it to me? I am not very good with… these things, you see. I live alone, and there is no one to help me. I do not want to do it incorrectly.
DOCTOR: It’s a fairly straightforward process, Mr. Goodstein. The lab will provide a collection kit and detailed instructions. Essentially, you’ll collect a small sample of stool in a provided container. It’s… best to collect it after a bowel movement. There are specific guidelines regarding diet and medications before the collection, to ensure accurate results. The instructions will detail those. And yes, the lab technician will be happy to explain the process to you in detail. Don’t hesitate to ask them any questions. They are used to it. We'll have the results back in about 5-7 business days. I'll also print you a handout on managing gas and bloating. It outlines some dietary recommendations and over-the-counter remedies. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. That is… reassuring, to hear about the instructions. And the handout… good. I appreciate that. One more question, if you do not mind. You mentioned… Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Is that… serious? Is it… contagious? I do not want to… bother anyone with it. And what is the treatment? Will I have to… take pills forever? I do not like taking pills, you see. I prefer a simple life.
DOCTOR: Irritable Bowel Syndrome is not serious in the sense that it’s life-threatening, Mr. Goodstein. It’s a chronic condition, meaning it can last a long time, but it’s manageable with lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medication. It is not contagious. It's not caused by an infection. Treatment varies depending on the severity of your symptoms. For mild cases, dietary changes, stress management, and over-the-counter remedies may be sufficient. For more severe cases, medication may be needed. However, it’s not always necessary to take pills forever. We can explore different options to find what works best for you. We'll start with the tests, and then we can discuss a personalized plan based on the results. Do you have any other questions before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have been very patient with me, and I appreciate your explanations. I will collect the stool sample and come back for the blood test. And I will try the food diary. Thank you again, Doctor Trestrail. I feel… a bit better, knowing what to expect. I do hope we can find a solution to this… gas. It is quite unsettling, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Goodstein. The lab orders are printing now. The receptionist will schedule your blood test appointment on your way out. And remember, if your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
