DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I am Dr. Pipkorn. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s difficult to explain precisely. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, you see. Like I might fall. It’s been happening for… some time, I believe. Though pinning down when is proving… elusive.
DOCTOR: “Rather unsteady,” you say. And “some time” is… how long, precisely?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s the trouble, isn’t it? It feels like… months, perhaps? Possibly longer. Everything feels a bit… blurred, if I’m honest. My husband… he always kept track of these things. Before… well, never mind. It’s just… not a clear recollection. It’s not sudden, but it’s definitely worsened lately. I nearly tripped over the rug just yesterday, and that was… unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Blurred.” Right. And you say it’s worsened recently… specifically how would you describe the worsening?
PATIENT: It’s… harder to walk straight, I think. And I feel a bit dizzy sometimes, not constantly, but enough to make me pause and hold onto something. It used to be just a little wobble, but now… well, now it feels like I need to concentrate very hard to keep my balance. It’s… worrying, to be frank. I work with machinery, you see, and unsteadiness isn't exactly… ideal.
DOCTOR: Machinery, you say. And this dizziness… is it associated with any specific movements, or does it come on spontaneously?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I… I don’t believe so, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific. Sometimes it’s there when I get up in the morning, other times… just randomly throughout the day. It’s not a spinning sensation, more like… a lightness in my head. And sometimes a slight nausea, but that doesn’t happen every time either. It’s… frustrating, because I can't pinpoint a cause.
DOCTOR: “Frustrating” is understandable. Let’s move on to other symptoms, then. Have you experienced any changes in your vision – blurring, double vision, anything like that?
PATIENT: Vision… Now that you mention it… Perhaps. It’s difficult to say for certain. Things seem… less sharp, maybe? I attributed it to needing new glasses, and I have been meaning to schedule an appointment for that. It’s not a constant blur, but sometimes things just don’t look as clear as they used to. I haven't noticed any double vision, though. Just… a general lack of clarity, I suppose. It's rather subtle, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Subtle. Very well. And have you noticed any headaches associated with this unsteadiness or the blurred vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… yes, occasionally. Not debilitating, thankfully. More like a dull ache at the back of my head. They come and go, and I often just dismiss them as stress-related. Working with the machinery can be quite demanding, and I don't always get enough sleep. It's hard to relax, you see. I wouldn't say they're directly connected to the unsteadiness, but they do occur from time to time. They are… intermittent.
DOCTOR: Intermittent. Of course. Let’s shift gears. Any changes in your hearing, ringing in your ears, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: That’s… another good question. Now that you mention it, perhaps a slight… ringing? It’s very faint, and I often dismiss it as the sound of the machinery at work. It’s not constant, and it’s not particularly bothersome. I wouldn’t say it’s new, but perhaps it’s become more noticeable lately. It’s difficult to say for certain, honestly. Everything feels a little… muffled sometimes, but I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my hearing, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: “Muffled.” Right. And have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… no, not exactly. A bit of fatigue, perhaps, after a long day at work, but not true weakness. Numbness… no, I haven't experienced any numbness. My hands sometimes ache, but that’s likely from the vibrations of the drill, I suspect. I haven’t noticed anything… unusual, in terms of weakness or numbness. Just a general feeling of being… worn down, if that makes any sense. It’s hard to describe. It's not a sudden thing, more like… a gradual decline.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s talk about your medical history, Ms. Snerling. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My husband handled most of those details. I… I believe I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that was quickly resolved with antibiotics. He always said my blood pressure was a little elevated, but he managed it with… I can't recall the name of the medication now. And… I believe I had my gallbladder removed some time ago. Beyond that… I honestly can’t recall. It all feels rather… distant. He was always so diligent about keeping track of everything. I’m truly sorry, Doctor, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Let me see… according to the record, you were diagnosed with hypertension seven years ago, treated with lisinopril. You also underwent a cholecystectomy five years ago. The record indicates no other significant medical conditions. Are you currently taking any medications besides lisinopril?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… yes, that’s it! He always insisted I take it regularly. And… no, I don’t believe so. Just the lisinopril, as far as I know. He filled all my prescriptions and kept them organised. I just… took them as directed. I haven't started any new medications recently, no. I'm truly relying on my memory here, Doctor, and it’s not proving very reliable. Perhaps it would be best to double-check with the pharmacy? They would have a more accurate record, I suspect.
DOCTOR: The record also indicates a recent refill of lorazepam, prescribed three months ago for anxiety. Do you recall this?
PATIENT: Lorazepam… anxiety…? Oh dear. Now that is a surprise. I… I don’t recall being prescribed anything for anxiety. I have been feeling a bit… unsettled, of course, since my husband’s passing, but I haven’t spoken to a doctor about it. Perhaps he… perhaps he prescribed it without telling me? He was always trying to… to ease my worries. I truly don’t remember requesting or receiving any medication for anxiety. That’s… rather disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I am aware of. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication or food. I occasionally experience a bit of hay fever during the spring, but that’s more of an inconvenience than an allergy, I suppose. Nothing severe. I have a slight sensitivity to dust, perhaps, but it’s not… debilitating. I don't have any known serious allergies, no. Just the usual seasonal sniffles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Snerling. Given your symptoms—the unsteadiness, blurred vision, ringing in your ears, and the recent prescription for lorazepam—and your history of hypertension, I would like to conduct a physical examination. This will include a neurological assessment, blood pressure and pulse check, and examination of your ears and eyes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A physical examination seems prudent. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed as you see fit. I want to understand what is causing these… disconcerting symptoms. I just want to feel… steady again.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes – don't move your head, just your eyes. And then we’ll proceed with the neurological assessment. Blood pressure is 160/95. Pulse is 78 and regular. Elevated, but not critically so. Now, follow my finger… excellent. Any blurring or double vision with this movement?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no blurring or double vision. It’s… slightly uncomfortable, but my vision remains clear. Though, I do feel a little… lightheaded now. Not severe, but a definite sensation of… being off balance. Perhaps the examination is making me more aware of the unsteadiness? It’s difficult to say. It’s just… a subtle feeling. Perhaps we should proceed slowly?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. We will proceed at your pace. I’m going to check your balance now. Please stand with your feet together and arms at your sides. Close your eyes, if you feel comfortable doing so. There is moderate sway with eyes closed. She requires slight corrective maneuvers to maintain her balance. Romberg sign is positive. Now, please walk a straight line, heel-to-toe, for ten steps.
PATIENT: Oh dear. This is… more difficult than I anticipated. You are right to be concerned, Doctor. I… I can feel myself losing my balance. It's not a sudden fall, but a definite… instability. I had to reach out to the wall to avoid stumbling. I do apologise. Perhaps this examination is best curtailed? I wouldn't want to risk a fall. My husband… he would have been concerned.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down immediately. You are correct to be cautious. Given your symptoms and these findings, I am concerned about a possible vestibular issue, and the potential for falls. We need to investigate this further. I am going to order a comprehensive blood workup to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I would like you to schedule an MRI of the brain to assess for any structural abnormalities. I'm also referring you to an ENT specialist for a thorough vestibular evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blood work, an MRI, and an ENT specialist. It sounds… thorough. And rather alarming, if I’m honest. But I appreciate your diligence. I want to understand what’s happening, and to prevent any… further instability. Yes, please, proceed with those tests. I trust your judgment implicitly. When can I schedule these appointments? I suppose I should also discontinue the lorazepam, given your concern?
