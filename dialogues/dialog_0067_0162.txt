DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I got stuff to do. It’s my stomach, okay? It’s… bloated. Just feels puffy all the time. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure how long, honestly. It’s annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're feeling bloated and it's been going on for a while. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if it’s annoying. “A bit now” is helpful, but could you try to be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Ugh. Look, I don't do specific. Maybe… a couple of months? Three? It all kinda blends together, you know? Since… well, since things happened with my wife. My head hasn't been right. Does that even matter? It's my stomach that's the problem now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. Significant life events absolutely can impact physical health, so yes, that matters. It's perfectly normal for stress to manifest physically. We’ll get to the bottom of this. So, bloating for roughly three months, coinciding with some difficult times. Aside from the bloating, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I eat, I… go to the bathroom. Normal stuff. I’m not a doctor, you know. Look, I just feel full and uncomfortable a lot. Maybe some gas. Does that count? I really don't see what other symptoms there would be. It's not like I'm bleeding or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no bleeding, that’s good to know. "Full and uncomfortable" and some gas. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – like are they more frequent, less frequent, looser, harder, different color than usual?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You want to talk about… that now? Look, I don't exactly monitor my… output. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's okay, sometimes it's… not. I don’t know. Normal-ish. It's brown, okay? It's usually brown. What do you want me to say? I'm a pile driver operator, not a… a stool inspector. Can we please move this along?
DOCTOR: I understand this isn’t comfortable to discuss, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if I’m pushing. It’s important information, though. “Normal-ish” and usually brown is helpful. Let's shift gears then. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? I eat when I’m hungry. Not much has changed there. Maybe I don’t eat as much as I used to, but… well, what’s the point? Everything tastes kinda… bland now anyway. But yeah, I haven't lost my appetite, if that's what you're asking. I still like a good steak when I can get one. But again, it doesn't really matter does it? It's the bloating that’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, appetite is relatively unchanged, though food might taste bland at times. No significant weight loss. That’s helpful. Let’s talk about pain. Do you experience any abdominal pain along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. It’s not like stabbing or anything, just… a dull ache. Mostly after I eat. Like a heavy feeling. It comes and goes. I just figured it was the food. Look, I push my body hard all day. I expected some discomfort. It's not like I'm doubled over in agony. It’s just… annoying. Can we get to the part where you tell me what's wrong? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache after eating, not severe. I understand you're frustrated and want answers. To help me understand what might be going on, let’s quickly go over some medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Look, I'm a pretty healthy guy, alright? Always have been. Pile driving keeps you in shape. No fancy diseases or anything. I had the flu once, a long time ago. Does that count? Aside from that… nope. Nothing. My wife… she had some issues, but that's not relevant, is it? I just want to fix this stomach thing and get on with my life. I don't have time to list off childhood illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no known medical conditions, and you haven’t had the flu recently. That’s good to know. And you’re right, your wife’s health history isn't directly relevant at this point. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never had anything cut open. I don't like hospitals. Bad memories. Look, can we please just skip all this and get to the part where you poke my stomach or something? This feels like a waste of time. I got work to do. I don't need a life story checkup for a little bloating.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I apologize if this feels thorough, but it helps me rule things out. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Steak, rice, potatoes… I don't exactly have a delicate stomach. Never had a reaction to anything. I don't take any pills. I don’t believe in them, frankly. Just want this bloating to go away, that’s all. Can we please move on? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your stomach with my stethoscope, and then gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. The faster this is done, the better. Don't poke too hard. I'm a tough guy, but I don’t need any unnecessary pain right now. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm listening now. Your bowel sounds are… present, but a little sluggish. And gently pressing… Some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. No obvious masses. It doesn't sound like anything acutely dangerous, but the sluggish bowel sounds and tenderness suggest something is going on. Have you had any recent changes in your stress levels, aside from what you’ve already mentioned?
PATIENT: Stress? What kind of question is that? Look, my wife died. What do you think my stress levels are like? It's kinda hard to not be stressed when you lose the love of your life, wouldn’t you say? I’m trying to run a business and keep things together, and my stomach is bloated. I don’t need you pointing out the obvious. It's probably just… grief. Is that what you want to hear? I'm not a doctor, I'm just a guy trying to get by. Can we just order some pills or something? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Mr. Kristofik. That was a poorly worded question, and I understand your frustration. It’s completely understandable that you’re experiencing immense stress, and it’s not my intention to minimize that. Grief absolutely can manifest physically, and that’s very likely contributing to your symptoms. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like Irritable Bowel Syndrome could be a possibility, exacerbated by your stress. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some blood work. It'll check for things like inflammation and celiac disease, just to be safe. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Ugh. Fine. Whatever it takes to make this go away. Just… don’t tell me I have to fast or anything. I skipped breakfast this morning, I’m already feeling weak. Is there a lab nearby? And how long will this take? I really don’t have all day. I got a job to run, you know? Just get it over with. Pills and blood work. That’s what I figured it’d come down to. Can we please just hurry up?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fasting required for these tests. We’ll send you to the lab right across the street. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. I'll have the results sent to me and we can discuss them next week. In the meantime, let’s talk about some things you can do to manage your symptoms. Increasing fiber in your diet, staying hydrated, and managing stress can all help. We can also discuss some over-the-counter medications that might provide some relief. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Fiber? Stress? Look, I eat what I can when I can, and I'm already stressed enough, alright? What kind of questions are these? Is there a pill for stress? I really don't want to talk about my diet right now. Just… let me know when the blood work is done. And if it's nothing serious, just write me a prescription for something to stop the bloating. I really don't have the energy for all this. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll focus on getting the blood work done and seeing what the results show. I will have the lab send the results directly to me, and I'll call you next week to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for an antispasmodic medication – it can help to reduce the cramping and bloating. It’s not a long-term solution, but it might provide some temporary relief. Here's the prescription. Take it as directed, and let me know if it doesn’t help. I understand you’re going through a lot, and I want to assure you that we’ll work together to find a solution that works for you. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I got a business to run. Thanks… I guess. Just get it done. Stop wasting my time. .
