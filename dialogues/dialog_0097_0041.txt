DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling weak, you see. It’s been getting worse lately. Not all at once, but… little by little. It’s in my legs mostly, makes walking a bit hard. Been this way a while now, the doctors been saying it’s… Multiple Sclerosis. I just want to know how it’s going, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores. Weakness in your legs that’s been developing gradually... and you’ve been told by other doctors it could be Multiple Sclerosis. I understand wanting to get a clear picture of what’s going on. To help me understand better, can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did I first notice? That’s a good question. It was… maybe five years ago? Something like that. It started with just… tripping a little more often. I thought I was just getting old, you know? Then it got to where I had to hold onto things sometimes, and now… well, now it’s like my legs don’t always listen to me. It's hard to explain. It’s not pain, just… tired. And weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five years ago, starting with some clumsiness and tripping, then progressing to needing support, and now feeling tired and weak in your legs. That's helpful. And is this weakness the same in both legs, or is it worse on one side than the other?
PATIENT: I think… it’s a little worse on my right side. Not a lot, but if I’m walking a long way, that’s the leg that gives out first. The left one feels… okay for a bit longer. It’s funny, sometimes it feels better in the morning, then gets worse as the day goes on. Is that… normal? I don’t know much about this Multiple Sclerosis thing.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing those details, Mr. Astores – it is helpful. It's not uncommon for symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis to fluctuate, so feeling better in the morning and worsening throughout the day is certainly something we see. And it's good you're aware of the difference between your legs. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old too! It comes and goes, not all the time. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a little numb, like pins and needles, in my hands and feet. Not always, but it happens. And I get tired… really tired. Not just my legs, but… all over. Does that make sense? I sleep plenty, but still feel worn out.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Mr. Astores. Blurry vision, numbness or tingling in your hands and feet, and fatigue... those can all be associated with Multiple Sclerosis. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any problems with balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. Yes, actually. A little bit. I don’t fall often, but I feel… unsteady sometimes. Like I might stumble. Especially if I turn my head quickly. My wife has been noticing it too. She says I wobble a bit. It’s not bad enough to fall, but I have to be careful. I mostly just take things slow now. It worries her, you know? She’s been very good to me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have a supportive wife, and it's good that she's noticing these changes too. And that unsteady feeling, especially with quick head movements, is something we need to note. Now, let's talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for that every day. And… I had a surgery on my knee, a long time ago, when I was playing football. Other than that… not much. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life, until this weakness started. I don’t really go to the doctor much, unless I have to. I try to stay active, you know? Even with my legs being weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee surgery. That’s good to know. And you’ve been generally healthy otherwise. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… no, just the one for the blood pressure. Sometimes I take something for aches and pains, like ibuprofen, but not every day. Only if I really need it. And… oh! I take a Vitamin D supplement. The doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. But that’s it. Nothing else. I don’t like taking too many pills, you know? Makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen for aches and pains, and a Vitamin D supplement. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a problem with anything like that. I eat pretty much anything. My wife is the one with the allergies, she can’t eat shellfish. But me? I’m fine with everything. Never had a rash or anything like that. I think I’m lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Astores. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother… she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had something with his heart, I think. But… not much else that I know of. My family… they didn’t really talk about health problems much. It was just… something you didn’t bring up. Not a lot of doctors in my family, you know? Mostly fishermen and farmers.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, and a heart condition in an uncle. That's helpful. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I’m retired now, used to be a football coach. I still try to stay active, I walk when I can. I enjoy spending time with my wife, we like to garden. I like watching football on TV, of course! I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly, I just try to take things easy these days. Enjoy life, you know?
DOCTOR: That sounds very pleasant, Mr. Astores. It’s good you’re staying active and enjoying your retirement. Okay, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. And your reflexes are a bit diminished on your right side compared to your left. That's consistent with what you’ve described. Now, I’m going to check your strength in your legs and arms. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m squeezing as hard as I can. It feels a little weaker on this side, my right side. I can feel it. It’s not much, but it’s definitely weaker.
DOCTOR: You're right, your grip is noticeably weaker on your right hand. Now, I’m going to have you sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle. Can you lift each leg up against my resistance?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Here we go. This is harder than it looks, you know? My right leg… it’s definitely weaker. I can feel it tiring out quicker. I’m trying my best, but it’s just… not as strong.
DOCTOR: You're right, your right leg is weaker, and you fatigue more quickly. I’m also going to check your coordination and balance. Could you please try to touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Oh… that’s a little harder than I thought. I’m trying to be steady, but it’s hard to keep my balance. My wife says I wobble sometimes, and she’s right. It's easier with my eyes open, though. It’s not a lot, but I can feel myself being unsteady.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astores. Thank you. That was very helpful. Based on your history and the physical exam, the symptoms you're describing – the gradual onset of weakness in your legs, the numbness and tingling, the fatigue, and the coordination issues – are strongly suggestive of Multiple Sclerosis. The diminished reflexes and weakness on your right side further support this. Now, I’ve reviewed your records and it appears you’ve already had some preliminary testing. To confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease, we'll need to do an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will allow us to look for lesions, which are characteristic of Multiple Sclerosis. I’m also going to order some blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood tests? So, you think it is this Multiple Sclerosis thing? The doctors been saying that for a while now, but… it’s still hard to believe. What does the MRI show? And what does all this mean? Will I… get worse? Will I end up in a wheelchair? I’m sorry, Doctor. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Mr. Astores. It is a lot to take in. And you're right to ask those questions. The MRI will show us if there are any lesions, or areas of damage, in your brain and spinal cord. These lesions are a hallmark of Multiple Sclerosis. The blood tests will help rule out other conditions that can mimic the symptoms of MS. As for what it means… Multiple Sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. It causes inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, which is the protective covering around your nerve fibers. This damage can disrupt communication between your brain and the rest of your body, leading to a variety of symptoms. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people experience mild symptoms that progress slowly over many years, while others experience more severe symptoms that progress more quickly. It's impossible to say for certain what your course will be. However, with appropriate treatment, we can often slow the progression of the disease and manage your symptoms effectively. There are several disease-modifying therapies available, and we’ll discuss those options with you once we have the results of the MRI and blood tests. The risk of ending up in a wheelchair is a concern, but it's not inevitable. Many people with MS live full and productive lives with minimal disability. Right now, let's focus on getting the MRI and blood tests scheduled. Would you like me to help you with that?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Help me schedule those tests. That would be… a big help. And… can you tell me a little more about these treatments? What are they like? And… what can I do now? Just to… help myself, you know? Before we get the results? Is there anything I should be doing… or not doing?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Astores. I’m happy to help with the scheduling, and we can definitely discuss treatments and things you can do in the meantime. Okay, I’ve scheduled the MRI for next Tuesday at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across town. They’ll need you to arrive 15 minutes early to fill out some paperwork. The blood tests can be done any time at the lab next door; I’ll give you a requisition form. As for treatments, there are several disease-modifying therapies, or DMTs, available. These medications work by reducing the inflammation and damage in your brain and spinal cord. They come in different forms – injections, oral medications, and infusions – and have different side effects. We’ll discuss the best option for you based on your individual circumstances once we have the MRI results. In the meantime, there are several things you can do to help yourself. First, it's important to manage your stress. Stress can worsen MS symptoms, so finding healthy ways to cope with stress is important. Things like yoga, meditation, or spending time in nature can be helpful. Secondly, regular exercise is beneficial. It can help improve your strength, balance, and coordination. But it's important to avoid overexertion, especially in hot weather. Finally, it's important to eat a healthy diet. There's no specific diet for MS, but a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is always a good idea. And most importantly, listen to your body. Rest when you're tired, and avoid activities that worsen your symptoms. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot of information, Doctor. Thank you. I think… I think I understand. Stress, exercise, healthy eating… and listen to my body. I used to be a football coach, so I know a little about exercise. But I’ll have to be careful, you said. And… the stress thing… that’s going to be hard. My wife… she worries a lot, and that stresses me out. Maybe I can talk to her about it. And… what happens if the MRI doesn’t show anything? Could it be something else?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Astores. It's good you’re thinking ahead. It’s certainly possible the MRI could come back negative, or show findings that aren’t conclusive for Multiple Sclerosis. In that case, we would need to explore other possible diagnoses. There are several other conditions that can mimic the symptoms of MS, such as vitamin deficiencies, infections, and other neurological disorders. We would likely order additional tests to rule those out. It's important to remember that a negative MRI doesn't necessarily mean you don't have MS. Sometimes, lesions aren’t visible on an MRI, especially in the early stages of the disease. And yes, managing stress is crucial, and it’s great you’re recognizing that your wife’s worries contribute to your stress levels. Perhaps we can discuss some strategies to help her manage her anxiety as well. Family counseling can be very helpful in these situations. Do you think you would be open to exploring family counseling if needed?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. If it would help, then yes. My wife… she loves me very much, and she just wants what’s best. But she does worry a lot. I’ll talk to her about it. So… we wait for the MRI results. And then we see what happens. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. I think that’s all I can think of for now. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astores. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. And you're right, we'll wait for the MRI results and then discuss the next steps. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And remember to listen to your body and take things easy. Take care, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
