DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these… episodes. My wife, she’s been after me to come for weeks. I get… confused. Not all the time, mind you. Just… moments. Like I don't know where I am, or what I was doing. It’s embarrassing, really. A man shouldn't be forgetting things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It is concerning when those moments happen. And it's good that your wife encouraged you to come in. It's certainly better to look into these things. “Episodes” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: More about them… Hmm. Well, usually it’s in the afternoon. After I’ve been working, you know, setting tile. It’s hot out, that probably has something to do with it. I just… feel off. Like my head isn’t clear. Then I can’t recall things. Simple things! Where I parked the truck, what I had for lunch… things like that. It doesn’t last long, maybe ten, fifteen minutes. Then it’s just… gone. But it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Lason. It does sound unsettling. And the timing—after work, in the heat—is good information. Let's try to get a clearer picture. You mentioned feeling "off" – can you describe that sensation more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically… well, it’s not a pain, not exactly. More like… a fuzziness. Like looking through dirty glass. Everything seems… distant. And I feel… agitated. Not angry, just… restless. Like I should be doing something, but I can’t remember what. It makes me a bit anxious, if I’m honest. A man doesn’t like feeling lost in his own head.
DOCTOR: "Fuzziness" and "distant" – those are helpful descriptors, thank you. And the restlessness, the feeling of needing to do something but not knowing what… That gives me a better idea. Now, Mr. Lason, has anything like this ever happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: To my knowledge? Well, not like this. I mean, I’ve always been a bit forgetful, like everyone gets. Misplacing tools, forgetting names… normal things. But this is… different. It's not just a simple lapse of memory. This is… a feeling. A disorientation. Never had that before. Not that I recall, anyway. My wife might say different, she remembers everything.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re able to distinguish it from typical forgetfulness. And it’s very helpful that you’ve noticed this difference. Now, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me see. I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it. Can’t remember the name right off hand, something blue. And my knees, they bother me, arthritis. I get shots for those, every six months. Other than that… no, I’m a pretty healthy man for my age. I’ve always been strong, worked hard all my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see here you're on amlodipine for hypertension. Good. And the arthritis shots… that's helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or herbal remedies, besides the amlodipine?
PATIENT: No, no supplements or herbal remedies. I don’t believe in that stuff, frankly. Just the amlodipine. And sometimes, if my knees are really bad, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But that’s it. I eat well, mostly. My wife makes sure of that. She doesn’t like me eating too much salt, with the blood pressure, you know.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I had a hernia operation a few years back. Nothing major. The hernia, it was bothering me for months. They fixed it right up, though. No problems since.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, Mr. Lason, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, children—had any problems with memory loss, dementia, or similar conditions?
PATIENT: Similar conditions… Well, my mother, she… she got a bit confused towards the end. She didn’t recognize people sometimes. The family said it was just old age, but she changed. Didn't know who I was a few times, which was upsetting, naturally. My father, he was always sharp as a tack, right until the day he died. No, no one else that I recall.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. That's important information. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? A little. Mostly with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Sometimes two, if it’s a special occasion. Nothing excessive. I'm not a drinker, never have been. I just enjoy a little wine with my meal. Helps me relax, you know? My wife enjoys it too.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he always warned me about it. Said it was a terrible habit. I listened to him. No, I don't smoke, and never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I'm allergic to penicillin, always have been. Gives me a terrible rash. Other than that… no, nothing I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. No food allergies, no pollen allergies… nothing. Just the penicillin.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I will check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment – just some simple tests to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds fine. I’m not afraid of a little exam. Just get it over with, eh? I’ve got tiles to set tomorrow, you know. Need to be in good shape. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here, and we’ll get started. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Your gait is steady, but slightly slow. No noticeable instability. Finally, I'm going to check your eyes with a flashlight. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Alright, that concludes the brief exam. Everything appears generally normal, but the diminished reflexes and slightly slow gait are something we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further, eh? What does that mean? Am I sick? Is it something serious? I just thought it was the heat, and working hard. What are you thinking, Doctor? Don’t tell me I need to retire. I’ve still got plenty of work left in me!
DOCTOR: Please don’t worry, Mr. Lason. I'm not suggesting you need to retire at all! It’s simply that your symptoms – the episodes of confusion, and what I found during the exam – warrant further investigation to determine the cause. There are several possibilities, and it's too early to jump to any conclusions. The diminished reflexes and slow gait can be normal for your age, but combined with your reported confusion, we need to rule out some other conditions. I’m thinking we should start with some blood tests to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and rule out any infection. It would also be helpful to get a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it expensive? My Medicare… will it cover that? And what are you looking for, exactly? Is it something bad? You're scaring me now. All I wanted was to find out why I get those confused moments. Now you're talking about scans and… and what was that, vitamin B12? Is that something old people get?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Lason, and I apologize if I’ve frightened you. A CT scan is a relatively safe and common procedure. It's primarily to rule out any potential underlying cause for your confusion—things like small strokes, or other structural issues in the brain. Medicare should cover it, but we will verify that before scheduling anything. As for the vitamin B12, it’s not specifically an “old people” thing, but deficiencies become more common with age. It can cause neurological symptoms, including confusion and memory problems. That's why we want to check it. I want to be thorough, Mr. Lason. We're not assuming anything is serious, but we need to gather information to make an accurate diagnosis. It could be something simple—a vitamin deficiency, or a side effect of medication. Or it could be something more complex. The tests will help us determine the cause. Would you like me to explain the CT scan procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain the scan, yes. Tell me what it involves. And how long it takes. And will it hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded, you know. I’ve had enough of that from my wife when she’s worried about my knees. And will I have to lie flat for days afterwards? I’ve got work to do, Doctor. This is important. Just tell me everything, plain and simple. No medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I'll explain everything in plain language. A CT scan is essentially a series of X-rays taken from different angles around your head. It’s like taking a detailed picture of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s open on both ends, so you won't feel closed in. The scan itself takes only a few minutes—usually less than ten. You won’t feel any pain during the scan, but you'll need to lie very still. The technician will be able to see and hear you at all times, and you'll have a button to press if you feel uncomfortable. You won’t need any special preparation beforehand, and you can resume your normal activities immediately afterward. You won’t need to lie flat or avoid any activities. The main risk is a small amount of radiation exposure, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That… doesn’t sound too bad. Lying still, I can manage that. And no special preparation… good. So, it’s just like getting a picture? Not like they're poking around inside my head? And the radiation… is it a lot? I read about that, people getting sick from radiation. My wife warned me about that too.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the radiation, Mr. Lason. It's a valid concern. The amount of radiation you're exposed to during a CT scan is very low – similar to what you experience from a few days of natural background radiation. It's significantly less than the radiation from, say, a cross-country flight. The benefits of finding out what's causing your confusion far outweigh the small risk of radiation exposure. And no, it's not like poking around inside your head at all. The machine simply takes images from the outside. It's completely non-invasive. We're not inserting anything into your body. Now, if we decide to go ahead with the scan, I'll write an order for it, and you can schedule an appointment with the radiology department. They'll explain the procedure in more detail, and answer any further questions you may have. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If you think it's best… then go ahead and write the order. But I’m still worried about those tiles. I promised old Man Hem I’d get his bathroom done next week. I don't want to disappoint him. And if it turns out to be something serious… will I still be able to work? I need to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the tiles and Mr. Hem, Mr. Lason. I want to assure you we're going to do everything we can to find out what's going on. And I want to be honest with you. It’s too early to say whether this will affect your ability to work. It depends on the diagnosis. If it’s something simple, like a vitamin deficiency, you’ll likely be able to continue working as usual. If it’s something more complex, we’ll discuss your options and make a plan that’s best for you. Here’s the order. The radiology department will call you to schedule an appointment. They are located at [address and phone number]. I would recommend calling them as soon as possible. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call my office. We're here to help. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… try not to find anything too bad, eh? I’ve got a life to live. And tiles to set. Thank you for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I understand completely, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can. And I hope it’s nothing serious at all. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Take care, and I wish you all the best with your tiling.
