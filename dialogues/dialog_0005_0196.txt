DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… um… chronic… fatigue, right? That's what the lady on the phone said I was here for. Honestly, things are a bit… fuzzy these days. It’s just… tired. All the time. I don't really… remember much else about why I'm here, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is a good way to put it. Okay. Chronic fatigue… we can definitely look into that. It’s good you're getting it checked out. Now, when you say “tired all the time,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh… it's not like… just needing more sleep. I sleep, you know? Eight hours, usually. But I wake up… still tired. Like I ran a marathon in my dreams or something. And then all day… everything feels… heavy. Even thinking is hard sometimes. It's… frustrating. I used to be so much… sharper.
DOCTOR: Eight hours of sleep and still fatigued… alright. And you mentioned it’s affecting your ability to think clearly. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh dear… building up, I think. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. A while now, definitely. Maybe… six months? A year? It’s all a bit… of a blur, honestly. My husband… he would have remembered.
DOCTOR: Six to twelve months, gradual onset. Okay. And has anything specific happened in the last six to twelve months that might have contributed to this?
PATIENT: Specific… oh, goodness. Let me think… My husband, George… he passed away last year, in November. It was… sudden. A heart attack. Everything sort of… changed after that. I don’t really remember much before that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Oh, Ms. Licano, I am so sorry for your loss. That’s… a tremendous change. Of course, that would have a significant impact. It's perfectly understandable that things feel…fuzzy. It's important to acknowledge that grief can manifest in many ways, fatigue being a very common one. Let's talk a little more about this fatigue, but I want to also ensure we address the emotional toll of your loss. Have you had any support since George passed?
PATIENT: Support… a little. My daughter, Maria, she tries. She calls a lot, comes over sometimes. But she has her own life, you know? A job, kids… I don't want to burden her. And… I don't really do groups or anything. Just… try to keep busy. Mostly just around the house. I used to love gardening… but even that feels too much now.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're trying to cope, but it's clearly been difficult. And it's very thoughtful of you to consider your daughter's time as well. Alright. Let's shift gears a little bit. Aside from the fatigue and the gardening, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… oh dear. Let me see… Sometimes my muscles ache, a bit. Not all the time, just… here and there. And I've been… a little more forgetful than usual, I guess. Not just the general fuzziness, but like… misplacing things, forgetting appointments. Which is… embarrassing. And… I’ve been feeling… sort of down, I suppose. Not exactly sad, just… empty.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches, increased forgetfulness, and feeling empty… Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Appetite… not really. I eat… I think. Maria makes sure I have something. But it doesn't really taste like anything, you know? And weight… I don’t really know. I haven't weighed myself in ages. Everything feels… unimportant now.
DOCTOR: Loss of taste, no known weight change… Okay. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills… night sweats, not that I recall. And like I said, the weight… I haven’t noticed any change. Honestly, the biggest thing is just… this tiredness. And… the forgetting. It’s scary sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Before we do a quick physical exam, let me ask about any medications you’re currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… I take something for my blood pressure… a little white pill. I think it's Lisinopril? Maria refills it for me. And… that's it, I think. I used to take something for arthritis, but the doctor took me off of it a while ago. Allergies… no, I don’t think so. I haven't had any reactions to anything.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure, no known allergies… Alright. Now, let’s do a quick exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. It won't take long. If you could just have a seat here for me.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that sounds… fine. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Everything feels… a bit wobbly today.
DOCTOR: No, just relax and try to breathe normally. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not dramatically. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright, everything seems within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh dear… elevated blood pressure? That doesn’t sound good. Is that… because of the tiredness? Or is it something else? I just want to feel… normal again.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily because of the tiredness, Ms. Licano. Blood pressure can fluctuate for many reasons, and it's something we need to monitor. We're going to run some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will help rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and the elevated blood pressure. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, a vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check your B12 levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Anything to find out what’s wrong. The blood work… will it take long? And… will it hurt? I don't do well with needles.
DOCTOR: No, it won't take long at all, Ms. Licano. Just a few minutes. And you’re right to mention the needle. It's a quick pinch, but it's usually over before you know it. The phlebotomist, Maria—no relation to your daughter—is very good, and will be gentle. We'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home, if you have a cuff available. If you don’t, we can arrange for you to borrow one. I’d also like you to try to get some gentle exercise each day, even just a short walk, if you’re able. It will help improve your mood and energy levels. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Manageable… yes, I think so. A short walk… Maria has a treadmill. I haven't used it in ages. What if… what if it’s something serious? I don't want to be a burden to Maria.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Licano. But let’s not jump to conclusions. The blood work will give us a lot of information, and we’ll take things one step at a time. Most of the time, fatigue has a treatable cause. And you are not a burden to Maria. It sounds like she cares about you very much. We'll also discuss some coping strategies for the emotional toll of your loss, and I can provide you with some resources for grief support, if you’d like. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, if anything changes or you feel worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… yes, that sounds… good. Coping strategies… that might be helpful. And… resources for grief… yes, please. It’s just… sometimes it feels like a heavy weight. Thank you, Doctor Donate. You’ve been very kind. I think… I think that’s everything for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. Remember, we're in this together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions before you leave. And please, try to take things easy. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll see you next week.
