DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Havird. Well, things not really right, you see. I does be feeling awfully thirsty all the time, even if I just drink something. And hungry too! Not like a normal hunger, but… always wanting to eat. Is very strange.
DOCTOR: Hmm, constantly thirsty and hungry, even after drinking and eating… that is unusual. And how long has this been going on for, Bianca?
PATIENT: Let me think now… hmm. Maybe… three, four months now? It start slow, you know? Just a little more thirsty than usual. But now, is all the time. And the hunger… that come a bit after the thirst start. I does try to drink plenty water, but it don’t help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. And it’s been gradually worsening. Have you noticed any changes in your… bathroom habits?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? You mean… going to the toilet? Well now that you mention it… yes. I does be going to the toilet more often than before. To pee, you see. And sometimes… my stool is a little… loose. Not always, but sometimes. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. Increased urination and changes in stool… alright. Have you had any unintentional weight loss recently, Bianca?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm… no, I don't think so. Maybe a little, but I put that down to the heat, you see. Is very warm these days. I does sweat a lot, and I haven't been eating less exactly... just always wanting to eat more. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It does, Bianca, it does. It sounds like you’re experiencing some changes that warrant a little investigation. Have you noticed any blurry vision, or increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. I does need my glasses, you know, for reading and such, but that’s always been so. Fatigue though… yes, I does feel a little more tired than usual. But I is a woman of sixty-three, Doctor! I expect a little tiredness, eh? But yes, maybe more than usual. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Well, not much, Doctor. I does get a little pressure sometimes, so the doctor give me something for that, a little white pill. I take it when it bother me. And I does have the usual aches and pains for a woman my age, you know? Nothing serious, never had anything really bad. I don't remember any big sicknesses. Does that help?
DOCTOR: A little white pill for blood pressure… okay. Do you happen to know the name of it, Bianca?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I does not know the name. My husband does the shopping, you see, and he gets it for me. He does not tell me the names of things, just give me the pills. I just take them when I feel the pressure in my head. Is that bad, Doctor? Not knowing the name?
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal, Bianca. But we'll manage. And any family history of diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother, she had something with the sugar, yes. She had to be careful with what she eat. She wasn’t feeling well and always thirsty, I remember that. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had something with his kidneys, I think. He had to go to the hospital often. But that was a long time ago, Doctor. I wasn’t so young then, and I don’t remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of diabetes and kidney problems. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just that little white pill for the pressure. Nothing else. I does take a little pain reliever sometimes for my joints, but only when they bother me bad. And I does drink a little bush tea, you know, for relaxing. Is that… is that a medicine?
DOCTOR: Bush tea… okay. Right. I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I think we should do some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Anything you think is best. My blood pressure does bother me sometimes, so you check that good, eh? And I does get a little breathless climbing the steps, so you listen to my chest good too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is regular at 78. Lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight… wheezing on exertion. I'm going to have you take a deep breath for me. Still slight wheezing. Now, I want to check your feet. Skin is warm and dry, good sensation. No obvious swelling. Everything seems… fairly normal, but those blood work results will tell us a lot more.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. About the feet, that’s good. I does worry about my feet sometimes, you know? Old age things, eh? So the blood work will tell us more? What sort of things will it tell us? What am I looking out for?
DOCTOR: The blood work will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and a few other things. We’re mostly looking to see if your blood sugar is high, which could explain the thirst and hunger. The kidney tests will help us rule out any kidney problems, given your family history. It's just a precaution, Bianca. Don't worry too much. I'll send you to the lab now, and then we’ll discuss the results when they come back. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound alright. High sugar… like my mother? Is that bad? And how long will the results take? I does not want to wait too long, you know? And… what if it is the sugar? What happens then? I does not want to end up like my mother… always worrying about what she eat.
DOCTOR: We'll know more once the results are in, Bianca. Don’t jump to conclusions. The lab usually takes a couple of days. If it is high sugar, we’ll discuss diet and medication to manage it. It’s not the end of the world, and with proper care, you can live a perfectly normal life. Now, let’s get you to the lab. I'll have the nurse give you the requisition form. Don’t worry so much, alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A couple of days, eh? I will try not to worry. But it's hard, you know? I just want to feel normal again. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I will go to the lab now.
