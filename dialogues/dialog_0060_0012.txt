DOCTOR: Right, Velda Squiers. 45 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. I’m planning a cruise – a small one, just to get away for a bit – and the cruise line needs a wee bit of information from a doctor, just to make sure I’m fit enough to travel. It’s nothing serious, mind you, just a formality, I think.
DOCTOR: A formality, yes. Those cruise lines… always needing something. Still, best to be thorough. So, “fit enough to travel” – can you tell me a bit more about what you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Well, I lost my husband, Hamish, two years ago now. It was… sudden. A heart attack. And while I’ve been feeling right as rain since, I suppose they want to be sure my heart is alright. I’ve had no trouble, though. No chest pains, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I just… well, I worry a bit, you know? It’s a long way to go on that water.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss is…difficult. And it's sensible to be cautious, given your husband's history. So, no chest pain, no shortness of breath – good. Has anything else changed since then?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. My appetite's been fine, maybe a bit smaller portions than Hamish ate, but that's hardly a medical concern! I sleep alright, usually. Sometimes I wake up in the night, thinking things over, but who doesn’t? I’ve not been feeling faint or dizzy, and my weight hasn’t changed much, thankfully. I do get a wee bit tired sometimes, but that's just from work, I expect. I’m a window dresser, you see. Lots of lifting and bending.
DOCTOR: Window dressing… strenuous work. Alright. And your weight has been stable?
PATIENT: Yes, quite stable. I’m usually around… oh, I’d say about nine stone, give or take a pound or two. I’ve not been dieting or anything, and I eat fairly regular meals. Mostly simple things, you know? Roast dinners on a Sunday, fish and chips now and then… nothing fancy. I used to bake a bit more when Hamish was around, but I don’t have much call for it now, and I find I don’t miss it.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Never have been much of a one for pills, if I can avoid it. And no allergies, not that I know of. I can eat anything, touch anything… Hamish used to tease me about it, said I had a constitution like a horse! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Though… now you mention it, I did get a bit of a rash once, years ago, from a bramble bush. But that hardly counts, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a bramble rash doesn’t count. Alright. Have you had any significant illnesses in the past, been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… when I was a wee girl, I had measles, of course. All the children did. And chickenpox. But that was decades ago. Oh, and I broke my arm when I was about ten, climbing a tree. Had a cast on for weeks! But other than that… no, I can’t think of anything serious. No hospital stays, no major operations. I've always been quite lucky, health-wise, touch wood.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother is still alive, she’s 82 now, and living in a care home. She's got a bit of… a memory problem, you see. She forgets things easily, poor soul. My father passed away years ago, from a cold, if you can believe it. And I have a brother, Alistair, he lives in Canada. He’s fine as far as I know, but we don’t see each other much. He's a sheep farmer, out there. As for any family history of serious illness… not that I’m aware of. Hamish’s side, there was a bit of… high blood pressure, I think, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no significant family history of heart problems or other major illnesses. Good. I suppose it’s worth just having a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure, just for the sake of it. Would you mind?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve no objections whatsoever. I told you, I’m not expecting any trouble. It's just a formality, isn't it? But best to be sure, I suppose.
DOCTOR: If you’d just sit up on the table for me. I’ll get my stethoscope. Blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Not bad, but a little elevated. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly faint. Lungs are clear. Alright. Your heart sounds are a little quiet, and your blood pressure is slightly high, but nothing terribly concerning. Given your husband’s history and your anxiety about the cruise, I’d recommend a simple ECG just to rule out anything untoward. And perhaps a basic blood test to check your cholesterol levels. Just to be on the safe side. Do you think that would be alright?
PATIENT: An ECG and a blood test… yes, that sounds sensible, I suppose. If it puts my mind at rest, it's worth doing. Though… is it something to worry about, Doctor? My husband’s heart, you mean? I didn't think… I haven't felt any symptoms, and I've been feeling perfectly alright.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. It's simply a precaution, given the family history and your understandable anxiety. We are merely trying to be thorough. The ECG will give us a snapshot of your heart's electrical activity, and the blood test will help us assess your cholesterol and overall health. It doesn't mean there’s anything wrong, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll get the nurse to take some blood now. The ECG machine is just down the hall, we can do that straight after. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. The nurse, you say? Right. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I have a bit of gardening to do this afternoon. But of course, my health comes first. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind, explaining everything so clearly. It's a relief to know someone is taking it seriously. Even if it is just a formality.
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse will be with you shortly. We'll get it sorted.
PATIENT: .
