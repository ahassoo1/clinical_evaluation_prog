DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my…business. In the bathroom, you understand. Not something a man likes to talk about, but here we are. There was blood. In the stool. Quite alarming, really. I’ve always been regular as clockwork, you see. Never had a problem like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. It's never easy discussing these things, but it's important we do. Blood in the stool is something we need to investigate. When did you first notice this, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… maybe three days ago? Yes, three days. It wasn’t a lot, mind you. Just…streaks. Like raspberry jam, if you must know. Though I don’t particularly like raspberry jam. Weak stuff. Now, I eat a good diet. Lots of meat, you know. Keeps a man strong. Not like these youngsters today and their…salads. Probably what's wrong with the world. But I digress. Three days. That’s when I noticed it.
DOCTOR: Okay, three days. And you said streaks, like raspberry jam… Was it bright red, dark red, or something else?
PATIENT: Bright red. Definitely bright red. Not dark and…old-looking. Fresh, you understand? Like…well, like fresh. A man knows his blood, you know. Spent enough time patching up scrapes and bruises in my day. Flying isn't all glamour, you see. Plenty of rough landings and mishaps. Though I was always the one doing the flying, not having the mishaps. Mostly. Still, bright red. That's what it was. And it's worrying. Very worrying.
DOCTOR: Bright red blood suggests it’s likely coming from lower in the digestive tract, which is…not necessarily an emergency, but we need to figure out why. Have you had any pain with this, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Pain? Now that you mention it… a little bit of cramping, maybe? Not severe, mind you. Just a…a discomfort. Like a mild ache. Nothing to write home about. I've had worse stubbing my toe. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have even bothered mentioning it if you hadn't asked. A man doesn't complain about a little cramping. It’s weakness. Now, there was some…difficulty, let’s say. Pushing it out. A little straining. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's important. Difficulty and straining… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently, besides the blood?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmph. Well, it hasn't been as…solid, I suppose. A little looser than usual. Not diarrhea, mind you, nothing that dramatic. Just…not as firm. And, well, I haven't been going as often. Usually, it's like clockwork, first thing in the morning. Now, it's…later. Much later. Sometimes not until after lunch. Disconcerting, really. A man likes routine. A man needs routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools, less frequent… and the blood and cramping. Right. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now there's a thought. Agnes, my…ex-wife, was always on about my weight. Said I needed to watch it. But I haven't been on the scales, not for…well, a long time. I suppose I might have lost a pound or two. But that's probably just old age. A man shrinks, you know. It’s inevitable. And frankly, it’s a little rude asking a man about his weight. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. Still flying, you know, even at my age. Though it’s mostly instructing these days. Dreadful pilots, the lot of them. Can't navigate to save their lives. But no, no significant weight loss. Just…age.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant weight loss. And you mentioned you’ve been flying for a long time. Any family history of colon cancer or other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmph. Family history… that’s a question. My father… he was a quiet man. Didn’t talk about things. Mother…she died young, pneumonia. No one ever talked about…digestive problems. A lot of stomach upset, I remember, but that was probably just nerves. She was a worrier. Agnes’s side…well, I didn’t pay much attention to her family. Never liked them much, frankly. A bunch of… complainers. So, no, I can’t really say there’s any family history. Not that I know of. And frankly, I doubt it. Strong genes on my side, you see. Pilot’s genes. Now that’s a legacy.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known family history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. I take a little aspirin, now and then, for my knees. They ache, you see, from all the landings. And a little something for my…waterworks. Getting old, you understand. Can't hold it like I used to. But that's it. Nothing fancy. And I take a multivitamin, every morning. Keeps me going. But that's hardly a medication, is it? Just good common sense. I don't believe in all these pills they try to shove down your throat these days. Mostly just poison, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, aspirin as needed, something for your waterworks, and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. I've eaten everything put in front of me in my life. Traveled the world, you see. Ate all sorts of strange things. Never had a problem. A little indigestion sometimes, but that's just from rich food. Agnes always said I ate too much. But a man needs his sustenance. No, no allergies. I'm a robust fellow. Can take whatever comes. Though I do avoid shellfish. Not a fan of the texture, frankly. But that’s a preference, not an allergy. Do you have to ask about everything? It's rather…intrusive, you know.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm being intrusive, Mr. Rowbottom. I just need to gather all the information to help you. Alright, no allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just listen to your abdomen, check your pulse, things like that. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. A physical exam, is it? Very well. Get it over with. Don't poke too hard, mind you. I'm a delicate instrument. Been flying for a long time, you see. Not as sturdy as I used to be. And be quick about it. I have things to do. Important things. Though I suppose poking and prodding is part of the business. Just don’t expect me to enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. Okay… I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. No immediate signs of blockage. And gentle palpation… a little tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but nothing alarming. Your pulse is a bit elevated, but that could be from talking. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little on the higher side. Okay, everything seems relatively normal so far, but the blood in your stool and the cramping still need to be investigated. I want to order a fecal occult blood test, just to confirm the presence of blood. And I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Anemia? Dreadful word. Always weak people who get anemia. Well, if you must. Tests, tests, tests. Seems all doctors do these days is order tests. Still, if it gets me out of here faster… Alright, do your tests. But I expect a clear explanation of everything. No medical jargon. I’m a practical man, you see. I understand engines and navigation, not…blood counts. And when do I get the results? I haven’t got all day to sit around waiting for you to poke and prod and analyze things. Get it done quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll order those tests right away. The fecal occult blood test just requires a small stool sample, and the lab will contact you to schedule a blood draw. Results usually take about a week. I'll also have the nurse give you instructions on collecting the sample. In the meantime, if you notice any increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. And to be safe, and because of your age, I’m going to recommend a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon. We can rule out anything serious. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Now hold on just a minute! A colonoscopy?! What in blazes for? Poking around in… there?! Absolutely not! I've heard stories. Invasive, unpleasant… unnecessary! I’m perfectly fine. A little blood, a little cramping… it’s just old age! I’ve lived a long life, you see. A very long life! I don’t need you poking around where the sun doesn't shine. No! Absolutely not! I won't do it. Find out what the tests say first. Then we'll talk. But no colonoscopy! Understand?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand your concerns. We don't have to do the colonoscopy right away. But I strongly recommend it. It’s the best way to rule out anything serious, like polyps or cancer. But we can wait for the test results. In the meantime, I'll also recommend increasing your fiber intake and drinking plenty of fluids to help with the constipation. And please, if anything changes, let me know immediately. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week to discuss the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fiber and fluids, is it? My mother always went on about fiber. Never did me much good. Still…better than sticking things where they don't belong. A week, you say? Very well. A week. But I expect a clear explanation of those tests. No…technical mumbo jumbo. And if the tests are clear, that’s the end of it. No further poking or prodding. Understand? And don't try to convince me about that…colonoscopy. I won't be swayed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to get out of here. All this talk has quite worn me out. Get me the nurse, if you please. And hurry. Doctors these days…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll get the nurse for you right away. And I assure you, I'll explain everything in plain language. Just trying to be thorough. I'll have the nurse come in with the instructions for the stool sample and to schedule your follow-up. You take care now. .
PATIENT: .
