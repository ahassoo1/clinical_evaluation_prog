DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my waterworks, really. They bother me. A lot. Keeps coming back, this… trouble. I don’t recall exactly when it started, but it's been a bit of a nuisance. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, it hurts when I… go to the bathroom. And I have to go often. Very often. Not a pleasant feeling, I assure you. It feels… burning, sometimes. I’m sorry, is that… too much information? I don’t mean to be rude.
DOCTOR: No, it’s… alright. Burning, frequent urination. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Not that I recall. My life is… pretty much the same. I drive my… thing. The big van. For work. And I eat. And I sleep. No new… places. No new… people. It just started, this trouble. I don't know why.
DOCTOR: You drive a van for work. And you haven't traveled anywhere new, or encountered any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, the van, yes. Recreational vehicles. I fix them. And no, no illnesses. I don’t get sick very often. Just… this. It’s just… irritating. I'm a very careful woman. I wash my hands. I really do. Perhaps it's just… old age? Is that what happens when you get old? Everything… stops working properly?
DOCTOR: “Old age” is rarely a diagnosis, Ms. Wease. Do you experience any pain in your lower back, or your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Sometimes, a little ache. In my lower back, yes. But I often have aches. I drive a lot, you see. It’s not a sharp pain. Just… a dull discomfort. And no, not in my… abdomen, as you say. Just the back. And the… waterworks. Is that enough information? I'm sorry I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed. And no chills, no. I haven’t been sick to my stomach, either. Just… this trouble with my waterworks. Honestly, Doctor, it's all so… confusing. It just keeps happening, and I don’t understand why. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical exam and possibly order some lab work. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection. Can we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But I don’t like doctors poking and prodding, if you don't mind my saying so. A lab, you say? What exactly… is that? Will it hurt? I just want this fixed, Doctor. Quickly, if possible. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: A simple urine sample, Ms. Wease. We collect it in a cup. It won’t hurt. And the exam is standard procedure. It’s necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. Please follow me to the restroom. I’ll provide you with a collection cup and instructions.
PATIENT: Oh. A cup. Well, that doesn’t sound too bad. Alright, Doctor. Lead the way. I do hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a vehicle to fix this afternoon, and Mr. Henderson is a very impatient man. Honestly, sometimes I wish I just stayed home. But a woman has to work, doesn't she?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wease. It won’t be long. Just a clean catch, midstream. I’ll explain it further in there. And try to relax. The more anxious you are, the more difficult it will be.
PATIENT: Oh, “clean catch”? What does that mean? And “midstream”? I don’t understand… is there a special way I’m supposed to…? This is all very confusing, Doctor. Perhaps you could… demonstrate? Or explain it very, very slowly? I’m not a medical woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wease, it simply means you start urinating, then collect a sample midstream – after the initial flow. We want to avoid any contamination from outside. I'll leave you with instructions; it’s quite straightforward. If you’re still unsure, ask the nurse. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. A nurse, you say? I suppose I can ask the nurse. A clean catch… and midstream. Honestly, Doctor, you make it sound so simple. But I’ll try. .
DOCTOR: Honestly. Some people…
