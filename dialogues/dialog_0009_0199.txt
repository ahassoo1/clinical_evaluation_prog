DOCTOR: Good morning, Marquie. My name is Dr. Petrímoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Yeah, good morning. It's… it’s nice to meet you too. Honestly? I’ve been getting really short of breath lately. It’s… hard to explain. Just feel like I can’t get enough air sometimes. It's been happening for a few weeks, I think. Maybe longer? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath for a few weeks, possibly longer. That’s good information to start with. “Fuzzy” is alright; we’ll try to clarify as we go. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it?
PATIENT: When… right. Um. It seems to happen when I’m, like, doing stuff. Work, mostly. I work at the water treatment plant, you know? Lots of walking around, checking things. But sometimes it happens just… sitting around, too. Not all the time, though. It's weird. I don't really… I don’t know what sets it off, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exertional – happens with activity at work – but also occurs at rest sometimes. And it's not consistently triggered by anything specific. Do you notice anything else when you’re short of breath?
PATIENT: Ugh… let me think. Sometimes my chest feels… tight. Not painful, exactly, just… squeezed. And I think… I get a little lightheaded, maybe? Not enough to fall or anything, but kinda wobbly. Oh, and I’ve been coughing a bit more than usual, I guess. Just a little, dry cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness in the chest, lightheadedness, and a dry cough. That gives us a little more to work with. When did you first notice the cough, roughly?
PATIENT: The cough… hmm. Probably around the same time as the shortness of breath, I think? A few weeks, maybe a month? It wasn’t bad at first, just a tickle in my throat. Now it’s… more noticeable, I guess. Like I need to clear my throat a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, cough and shortness of breath developing around the same time, a few weeks to a month ago. Have you had a fever, chills, or any body aches accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my body doesn’t hurt, no. I just feel… tired, all the time. But, you know, I work long hours. So that could just be the job. It’s just… this breathing thing is worrying me. It feels different than just being out of shape.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re paying attention to a change in your body. Fatigue along with the shortness of breath, cough and chest tightness is certainly worth investigating. Now, I’d like to ask a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly, I don’t really know. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. I moved here a few years ago, and I just haven’t really established with anyone. Back in Venezuela… things were different. I don’t really have records I can easily get to. I think I had pneumonia once, when I was a kid, but I’m not sure. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Marquie. Many people find themselves in similar situations. We’ll do our best to figure things out. No need to apologize. Now, have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a teenager, skateboarding, but that’s it. No surgeries, no… you know, heart problems or anything like that. Just the broken arm. I’m generally… pretty healthy. Or, was pretty healthy. This breathing thing is really throwing me off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical or surgical history. And you said you've generally been healthy until recently. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had lung problems like asthma, COPD, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, family… that’s… tricky. I haven’t spoken to most of my family in a long time. Things are complicated. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… something with her lungs when she was old. I think it was COPD. She smoked a lot. But other than that… I don’t really know. I’m sorry, I wish I could give you more information. My memory isn’t the best.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Marquie. We're gathering what we can. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. Never have. Always thought it was a terrible habit. My grandmother smoking was bad enough for me, I didn’t need to do it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. And do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: I drink sometimes. A beer or two with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing heavy. I don't really like getting drunk, honestly. It makes me feel sick. It’s not a regular thing, though. Maybe once or twice a week, if that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uhh... not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I take some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, like ibuprofen, and I haven't had any problems with those. No known allergies. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little stressed out with all these questions. It feels like I'm forgetting things. Can we... can we get to the actual checking now?
DOCTOR: You're right to mention that, Marquie. It’s perfectly okay to feel stressed, and it's helpful to know that this is making it harder to remember. We will get to the physical exam now. And we'll take things at your pace. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart with my stethoscope. Then, I'll check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter – that's a little clip that goes on your finger. After that, I'd like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. Anything to figure out what’s going on. The sooner we know, the better, right? Just... please be gentle. I'm a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could just take a deep breath in, and then exhale slowly… Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, mostly on the right side. Now, let’s check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within a normal range, but a little on the lower end. We want to see it closer to 97-98%. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not overly concerning. And your pulse is 88 beats per minute, which is normal. Everything so far is preliminary, but the wheezing and slightly lower oxygen saturation are things we need to investigate further. Do you feel comfortable if we order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… uh… Is it safe? I mean, is there a lot of radiation? I’m not a fan of radiation. And… what if it shows something bad? I’m just… nervous. I guess if you think it’s necessary… but I’d like to know more about it first. What are we looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Marquie. It’s good you’re asking. A chest X-ray does involve a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose, comparable to the amount of natural background radiation you’re exposed to over a few days. The benefits of getting a clear picture of your lungs far outweigh the risks in this situation. What we’re looking for on the X-ray is any sign of inflammation, infection, or blockage in your lungs. It can help us determine the cause of the wheezing and shortness of breath. Things like pneumonia, bronchitis, or even a possible asthma flare-up would show up on an X-ray. It can also rule out more serious conditions, which is why it’s important to get one. Would you be comfortable proceeding with the chest X-ray?
PATIENT: Ugh… okay. If you really think it’s necessary… then yes. Let’s just get it over with. But can you explain what will happen? I don't want any surprises. And… will I get the results right away? I’m anxious to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You will be sent to the radiology department, which is just down the hall. A technician will ask you to remove any jewelry or clothing with metal on your chest, and then they'll have you stand or sit in front of the X-ray machine. They’ll take a few images of your chest from different angles. It’s quick and painless – you just need to remain still for a few seconds at a time. The technician will then send the images to the radiologist, a doctor who specializes in interpreting X-rays. They’ll review the images and send a report to me. It usually takes a few hours to get the results, but sometimes it can take longer, depending on how busy they are. I will call you as soon as I have the results and we can discuss them together. Do you have any questions about the X-ray procedure or the results process?
PATIENT: No, I think that explains it pretty well. Just… a few hours? That feels like a long time to wait when I’m already feeling like I can’t breathe properly. But… okay. I guess I’ll just have to try and be patient. Thank you for explaining everything. Can I go change now? And… will you let me know as soon as you have the results, even if it’s late?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. I understand it feels like a long time to wait, especially when you're feeling anxious. I will absolutely let you know as soon as I have the results, even if it’s late. I will make a note in your chart to call you directly. Yes, you can go change now. The radiology department is just down the hall, on your left. They'll guide you through the process. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms while you’re waiting for the results. We’re here to help. Do you have any other questions before you head to radiology?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. I’m glad I could help. I hope it's nothing serious too, and we’ll do our best to figure it out. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
