DOCTOR: Hi Janie, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… chronic fatigue, I think the lady on the phone said? Honestly, it all feels a bit blurry. It’s just… tired. Always tired. It's been going on… a long time, I guess. Not sure exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, “chronic fatigue” is a good place to start. And it’s perfectly alright if the timeline is blurry – we’ll work through it together. When you say “always tired,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it's not like just needing more sleep. I do sleep, usually. But even after a full night, I wake up… drained. Like someone just… emptied me. And it doesn't get much better through the day. Everything feels like… a lot of effort. Even simple things.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s not just the quantity of sleep, but the quality as well, and it’s impacting your ability to do everyday things. Has this tiredness been gradually worsening, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh… gradually, I think. It’s hard to say. Things just… slowly got harder. A few years, maybe? It's just… been a rough few years, to be honest. My husband… he passed, and… well, things haven’t been the same. I don’t know if that’s got anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your husband, Janie. That’s a tremendous loss, and it absolutely can contribute to feelings of fatigue and exhaustion. It's completely normal for grief to manifest physically. Let's talk more about the fatigue itself. Are there any specific times of day when it's worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… afternoons are the worst, definitely. Mornings are… okay-ish, if I can get moving. But by the time lunchtime rolls around… forget it. I just want to sit. And then evenings… I try to do something, but it's a struggle. It's like… hitting a wall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worsening in the afternoon, with a bit of relief in the mornings. That's helpful information. Besides the tiredness and the afternoon slump, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. Sometimes… my muscles ache. Not all the time, but… a dull ache. And I’ve been feeling a bit… foggy, I guess. Like I can’t quite think straight. Like my brain is slow. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and mental fogginess… okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills that I can recall. And… weight loss? I don’t think so. Maybe a little? But I haven't been keeping track, honestly. I… I haven't been eating much lately, to be truthful. Just… no appetite.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some decreased appetite alongside the fatigue, muscle aches, and mental fogginess. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… now that you mention it… yes, a bit. Things are… slower, if you know what I mean. I haven’t… thought much of it, to be honest. Just figured it was… age, or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, slower bowel movements. We're getting a good picture here. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see. The doctor, before… he said my blood pressure was a little high once, but he put me on something… I don’t remember the name of it anymore. I stopped taking it a while back… after my husband… I just couldn’t keep track of everything. And… I think I had something with my thyroid a long time ago? But it was ages ago, and they said it was fine. Honestly, my memory is just… terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, and a past issue with your thyroid. We can look through your records to confirm those details, don’t worry about remembering the specifics right now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My gallbladder, I think? A long time ago. And… when I broke my wrist, years ago. Just a little thing, really. Nothing major. Oh! And when I had my appendix out, as a teenager. That was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, wrist fracture, and appendectomy. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes, I take something for my arthritis. It's over-the-counter, I don't need a prescription. Aleve, I think it's called. And sometimes, I take a vitamin D pill. Dr. something recommended it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aleve for arthritis and occasional Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything. I eat everything… well, not as much as I used to, but I don't have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's quickly talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But that was a long time ago. I don't really know much about the details. It was all… so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your mother and diabetes in your father. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh, goodness. Not much to tell. I live alone now, in the same house. Mostly I just… keep house. Read a bit. Watch TV. I don’t go out much anymore. And… I used to garden, but I don't have the energy for that anymore. It's… lonely, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. That gives me a really good understanding of what's going on. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I just… want to feel better. And… it's alright if I don't remember everything you say. I really do apologize.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janie. Don't worry about remembering everything, that's what my notes are for. And we'll take things at your pace. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is elevated, 145/90. Reflexes are normal. Strength is good in all limbs. Coordination appears normal. Alright, Janie. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, we're going to need to do some blood work to rule out some possibilities. We'll check your thyroid levels, complete blood count, vitamin D levels, and also look at your kidney and liver function. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… blood work. Lots of things to check. That sounds… thorough. No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It won't hurt much at all, just a quick pinch. The phlebotomist is very good at what they do. As for how long it will take, the blood draw itself is just a few minutes. But the results usually take a few days to come back, typically 3-5 business days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results then. In the meantime, is there anything that makes your fatigue worse or better?
PATIENT: Hmm... nothing really makes it better. Rest doesn't seem to help much. But… being stressed definitely makes it worse. Just… worrying about things. And… cold weather. The cold really drains me. It makes my bones ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress and cold weather worsen your symptoms, and rest doesn't provide much relief. That's helpful information. Given your symptoms - chronic fatigue, muscle aches, mental fog, slow bowels, history of thyroid issues, and the fact that stress and cold seem to worsen things - I'm considering a few possibilities. It could be related to your thyroid, even if previous tests were normal – thyroid issues can fluctuate. It could also be related to Vitamin D deficiency, or even something like early Fibromyalgia. It's also important to rule out other possibilities, which is why the blood work is so important. I'm going to order the blood tests now. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Fibro…what-now? Oh dear. That sounds… scary. Is that… serious? And the blood tests… where will I go for those? I don’t drive much anymore, and the bus… it’s not always reliable.
DOCTOR: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. It's not life-threatening, but it can significantly impact your quality of life. It's often managed with a combination of medication, lifestyle changes, and therapy. We’re not diagnosing you with anything yet, just exploring possibilities. The lab is just down the hall, Suite 203. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the appointment for you, and I’ll make a note that you have transportation concerns. They can often arrange assistance if needed. Do you have any other concerns or questions I can address right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…reassuring. A little. Thank you. No, I think that's all for now. Just… please, don’t use too much medical…jargon, when you explain the results. It all goes over my head. And… thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janie. I completely understand. I'll explain everything in plain language, and I'll be happy to repeat anything as many times as you need. My priority is to make sure you understand what's going on and feel comfortable with the plan. I'll have the receptionist schedule your blood work and follow-up appointment. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’ll see you at your follow-up. Take care, and try to get some rest, even if it’s just a few minutes of quiet time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
