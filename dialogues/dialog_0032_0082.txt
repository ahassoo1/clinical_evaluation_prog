DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tayar. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Pip... Pipkorn, right? Yeah. It's about... traveling. I gotta go somewhere. My wife... she wanted to go. Now... now I just gotta. It's a long story. Somewhere hot, I think. She liked hot places.
DOCTOR: Traveling, alright. And you’re here because… the trip requires some medical clearance, perhaps?
PATIENT: Clearance? What's that mean? Like... permission? I just need to know if it's safe. For me, you know. I don't want any problems. It's… important. She would have planned everything, but… I don’t know about shots or anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, “clearance” means ensuring it’s medically safe for you to travel, given your current health status. It involves assessing whether any vaccinations are needed, if your existing conditions might be affected by the travel environment, or if you need any preventative medications. To start, could you tell me a little about where you're planning to go?
PATIENT: Somewhere in... Africa, I think. She always talked about Africa. Lots of sun. And… animals. I don’t know the name of the place. She had the papers… everything. They're… somewhere at home. It’s a small village, I think. Not a big city. She said it was… remote.
DOCTOR: Africa, alright. And it’s a relatively remote village. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about you, Mr. Tayar. Have you travelled internationally before?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Just… India, once. A long time ago. With my wife. It wasn't… fancy. Just visiting family. That was… before all this. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. Just hot and crowded. And lots of people. No shots or anything then, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And since that trip to India, have you had any significant medical issues, been hospitalized, or had any new diagnoses?
PATIENT: Diagnoses? What's that? I… I had a bad cold last winter. A really bad one. But it went away. And… well, you know. Everything that happened. I haven't really been feeling good since then. Just… tired, mostly. And sad. Not sick, just… down.
DOCTOR: I see. While a cold is not usually a concern, it’s important to have a complete picture of your health. When you say “down”, are you experiencing any difficulty with sleep, appetite, or concentration?
PATIENT: Sleep? No, I sleep fine. Too fine, maybe. I just… lay there. For a long time. And I don't eat much. Not hungry. Everything tastes… wrong. And concentrate? What's the point? Nothing matters anymore. It's… complicated. I just wanna get this trip done. She would have wanted me to go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, while I understand you want to honor your wife’s wishes, it’s crucial we address your current state of health before considering travel. Your symptoms – loss of appetite, changes in sleep, and difficulty concentrating – could indicate several things, and need proper evaluation. Before we proceed, I’m going to need a more detailed medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Depression? Anxiety? No. I just… miss her. A lot. I’m sad. Is that… is that something you need a diagnosis for? I don't need a doctor to tell me I'm sad. I just want to go on the trip. She booked everything. All paid for. It's a waste if I don’t. She’d be so upset.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your grief and your desire to fulfill your wife’s plans. However, dismissing these symptoms as simply “sadness” is not responsible medical practice. These could be indicators of a more significant underlying issue that could be exacerbated by travel, particularly to a remote location. We need to rule out any potential medical causes. Do you have any family history of mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Mental health…? I don't... my mother always worried a lot. About everything. She complained about her stomach all the time. And my father… he just worked. He didn’t talk about feelings. Never. That’s all I know. Look, I’m not a doctor. I just want to know if I can go on the trip, or not. Is it safe? That's all I care about.
DOCTOR: Very well. To assess safety, I need to perform a brief physical exam. It will involve checking your blood pressure, pulse, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. This will give me a starting point. While this trip seems important to you, and I appreciate your desire to honor your wife's memory, your health is my primary concern. Let's begin with your vital signs. Could you please sit back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Examination table...? Oh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I just wanna know if I can go. It's… important, you know? She'd be so disappointed if I didn't. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your pulse is normal at 78, and your temperature is 98.6. Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Your reflexes are normal. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur, and your recent symptoms of fatigue and loss of appetite, I recommend a few tests. An EKG to assess your heart, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. We should also perform a thyroid test, as fatigue can sometimes indicate thyroid issues.
PATIENT: Tests…? So many tests… Look, is it safe to go on the trip, or not? Can you just tell me that? I don’t want to spend all my money on tests. She’d be so mad. I just… I just want to go and… and remember her. That's all. Is it safe, or not? You said her papers are all paid for. It's a waste to not go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, I understand your frustration, but I cannot provide a definitive answer without gathering more information. It would be irresponsible – and unethical – to clear you for travel without a proper medical evaluation, particularly given your current health status and the remote location of your destination. Travel can exacerbate existing conditions, and we need to ensure you are physically capable of handling it. I am not suggesting you cannot go, but I must rule out any potential risks. The tests I’ve ordered are standard procedure and will provide a clearer picture of your overall health. They are not excessively expensive, and the cost is far less than the potential medical expenses you could incur if something were to happen while traveling. We can discuss payment options if necessary. I will need to schedule these tests. Would you prefer to do them at our in-house lab, or would you prefer a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: In-house lab… just get it over with. I don’t want to deal with more people. I just want this done. She hated waiting. She always said time was precious. So, in-house. Whatever is fastest. And… can I just get a note, or something, that says I was here? Just in case. She always wanted proof of everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the lab technician draw your blood and prepare the samples. It shouldn’t take more than an hour to get the initial results. While we wait, I'll document your visit and provide you with a summary of our consultation and the tests ordered. Here is a summary of your visit, including the tests I’ve ordered. It also includes a note stating you’ve been evaluated by myself, Dr. Pipkorn. The lab technician is just down the hall, in room three. Once you’ve completed the tests, please return to me, and we’ll discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions before you proceed?
PATIENT: Room three… Okay. No. No questions. Just… let me know what you find. And… don’t take too long. She’d be so worried if I was gone too long.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tayar. I understand. Please go ahead to room three, and I will review the results as soon as they become available. I'll be right here.
