DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning. Look, I’m here for this… exam. For the military. They want me to get checked out first. Seems silly, honestly. I feel fine. Always have. But rules are rules, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-placement exam for the military. Even if you feel fine, it's good to get a baseline assessment done. It helps them, and it helps ensure your own health and well-being long-term. Let’s start with a little bit of background. Can you tell me a bit about why you're joining the military now?
PATIENT: Why? Honestly? It’s… a good job. A stable job. Things haven't been easy, you know? With the economy and all. My wife, Ingrid, she thinks it’s a good idea. Says it’ll be good for our future. Plus, I always liked taking things apart and putting them back together. This seems like a good way to use that skill, right? Not that I need you to tell me that. I just… figured I’d give it a shot. Better than flipping burgers.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A stable career is important. And mechanical aptitude is definitely a plus. Okay. So, no prior military experience?
PATIENT: No. Never. Look, I’ve barely been out of Sweden, let alone in the military. I worked in a factory for… well, a long time. Building… things. Engines mostly. Small ones, though. Not like… tanks or anything. Just… regular machines. It was alright, I suppose. Steady work. Until they downsized. That's why I'm looking at this now. You got any questions about the engines? I know a lot about them. More than most, I'd wager.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. I’m not here to quiz you on engine mechanics. Just gathering some background. Let’s talk about your medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. Not a one. I eat sensible, mostly. Ingrid makes sure of it. She’s very… particular. A little bit of herring now and then, maybe some potatoes. Nothing fancy. I’ve had a cold or two, like anyone, but nothing serious enough to go to a doctor over. I don’t believe in fussing over every little ache and pain. Weakens the constitution, you know? Besides, I’ve always been strong as an ox. Always.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chronic conditions. And you said no significant illnesses requiring a doctor’s visit. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never been under the knife. I take care of myself. What would I need surgery for? I’ve maybe had a tooth pulled when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. And it wasn’t even a real surgery, just the dentist poking around. Ingrid doesn’t even like doctors, so I avoid them if I can. She says they just want to sell you things you don’t need.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Let’s move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother, she passed away a few years back. Old age, mostly. She lived a good, long life. My father… he's still around. Up north, mostly. He’s… stubborn. Doesn't like to talk about much. Always been that way. Keeps to himself. He worked on a farm, all his life. A tough old Swede, that one. Never complained about anything. Not once.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did either of your parents have any significant medical conditions – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her joints when she got older. Arthritis, maybe? Ingrid would know better, she was always the one taking her to appointments. My father… he's always been… healthy, I guess. Just tough. Never seemed to get sick. He smoked a pipe for years, but that didn’t seem to bother him. He’s a hardy one, that man. Really. Never saw him sick a day in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about you – any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I eat everything. Herring, potatoes, meatballs… bring it on. I've never had a reaction to anything. Ingrid always checks the labels, just in case, but I always tell her it's a waste of time. A strong stomach, that's what I have. Besides, I don't take any medications. Never needed to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies or medications. Now, are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Supplements? No. Look, I eat a good, solid diet. Ingrid makes sure of it. I don't need fancy pills or powders. Real food, that's what keeps you healthy. Not those things. Waste of money, if you ask me. She tried to get me to take some fish oil once, said it was good for my joints. I told her I was fine. And I was. Still am.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. So, no vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies. Now, before we get to a physical exam, let’s briefly touch on your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, obviously. Ingrid wouldn’t allow it, even if I wanted to. Drink? A beer now and then, maybe with dinner on a Saturday. Nothing excessive. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. What do you think I am? A… a layabout? I’m a hardworking man. I don’t have time for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Good. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Alright, Mr. Hartness, that gives me a good overview. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just routine things – check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, reflexes… standard stuff. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know. I need to get back to Ingrid. She's making a special herring dish. And it needs to be eaten fresh. Just… try not to poke too much. I don't like being poked.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, rate around 70. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not a bit. Maybe a little ache in my back sometimes, from lifting things. But that's just… old age creeping in, I suppose. Nothing worth mentioning. Ingrid gives me a good rubdown every night, sorts it right out. She's very good with her hands. Honestly, I’m surprised you even bothered asking. I told you, I feel fine. Always have.
DOCTOR: Okay. No tenderness to palpation of the spine. Range of motion is slightly limited, likely due to muscle tightness. Alright, Mr. Hartness. Everything appears to be within normal limits, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and there’s some mild limitation in your spinal range of motion. To be cautious, I’d like to order a basic blood panel – just to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. And I recommend monitoring your blood pressure at home for a week.
PATIENT: Blood panel? Monitoring my blood pressure? Look, I told you, I feel fine. This seems… excessive. I don’t need any fancy tests. I just need a signature to get into the military. Is that too much to ask? Ingrid is going to be furious if I'm stuck here all day. She planned a special dinner.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. And I’m not trying to cause any unnecessary delays. However, these are standard precautions, especially given the requirements for military service. It's about ensuring your long-term health and identifying any potential issues before they become problems. The blood panel and blood pressure monitoring will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. It’s a relatively quick process, and I can provide you with a home blood pressure monitor and instructions. We can also discuss lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure if needed. And it will help fulfill the requirements for your pre-placement exam. Do you think we can proceed with those?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don't expect me to be happy about it. I suppose if it gets me into the military… But I’m telling you, this is a waste of time. Ingrid is going to kill me. Just… get it over with. And don’t poke too much. Where do I even start with this blood stuff?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Here’s the requisition form for the blood panel. There’s a lab just down the street – 123 Main Street. They’re open until 5 pm today. You don't need an appointment. As for the blood pressure monitoring, I’ll write you a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. You can pick it up at your pharmacy. It’s quite simple to use. I’ll also give you a sheet with instructions on how to take your blood pressure correctly and record your readings. You'll need to take it twice a day for a week and bring the readings back with you at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Questions? No. Just… get me out of here. And make sure that prescription is accurate. I don't want to be running around all day getting the wrong equipment. This is ridiculous. Honestly. Fine. I'll go do these… tests. But I'm not making any promises about being happy about it. And if Ingrid is furious, I'm blaming you. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope Ingrid isn't too furious. Have a good day.
