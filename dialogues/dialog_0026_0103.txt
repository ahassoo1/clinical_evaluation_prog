DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me. Lower back, mostly. Feels… old, you know? Like somethin’ is just wearin’ out. It’s been gettin’ worse lately, that's why I came.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Wearin' out," as you say, is a good way to describe it sometimes. And you said it’s been getting worse lately… could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. It started, oh, maybe six months ago? Just a little ache after I’d been standin’ a long time, doin’ somethin’ for the church. I do a lot of… collectin’ money, you see. For things. And standin’ at the door… it didn’t bother me much then. But now… now it’s almost always there. Even when I’m sittin’. And bendin’ over… oof. That’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, a little ache after standing, especially when collecting for the church. And now it's pretty much constant, even when sitting, and bending over is particularly difficult. Is there anything that helps the pain, even a little?
PATIENT: Hmm… not much, really. Layin’ down flat sometimes. But I can’t always lay down, can I? And… warm baths. They feel nice for a little while, but it comes back. I tried one of those heating pads my daughter gave me… it helped for an hour maybe. But it’s not a good fix, you know? I don't take nothin’ for it, either. I don’t like pills if I can avoid ‘em.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance to take medication. Laying down and warm baths offer some relief, but it's temporary. Heating pads only for an hour… alright. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, not really. It stays in my back. Sometimes it feels… stiff, like it’s hard to move. But no shootin’ pains down my legs. Just… a dull ache. And like somethin’ is… brittle, if that makes sense? My daughter… she said somethin’ about bones bein’ weak, but I didn't really pay much attention. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stiffness in the back, pain doesn’t travel down your legs. And your daughter mentioned something about your bones… I think it's good we explore that a little. Now, have you had any falls recently, or any injuries to your back in the past?
PATIENT: No falls, no. I’m careful. I walk with a cane sometimes, just in case, you know? But no bad falls. And I don’t remember any injuries to my back. Nothin’ I can recall. I used to work construction when I was young… lots of heavy liftin’. But that was… sixty years ago! I don’t think that’s it. I don’t think I ever hurt my back bad then. I just got… tired. A lot of tired. But not hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent falls, worked construction with heavy lifting many years ago, but no specific back injury you recall. Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I had a little trouble with my heart a few years back, but the doctor said it was okay now. Just gotta take it easy. And I got a touch of diabetes, but I watch my sugar. Mostly. I eat too many sweets sometimes. And... that's about it, I think. No insurance, so I don't go to the doctor much unless I have to. It's expensive, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. History of heart trouble, some diabetes managed with diet, and limited access to healthcare due to insurance. That's helpful to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your heart or diabetes?
PATIENT: Just one pill for the heart. A little white one. I don’t remember the name. The doctor gave it to me years ago, and I just keep takin' it. For the diabetes… nothin’. I try to control it with what I eat. Mostly. It's hard. I like baklava too much! My wife… she used to bake it. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. One heart medication, name unknown, and managing diabetes with diet. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to nothin’. My wife… she always made sure I didn't eat nothin' bad. She was a good woman. But no, no allergies. I eat almost anything. Except maybe liver. I never liked liver.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. I think I have a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on with your back and overall health. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and do a little palpation to see where the pain is most prominent. Is that okay?
PATIENT: That’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust you. Palpa… what was that again? Just tell me what to do. I’m an old man, not a fancy doctor. I’ll do whatever you want.
DOCTOR: Palpation just means I’ll gently press on different areas of your back to feel for tenderness or any abnormalities. No need to worry, it shouldn’t be painful. Alright, let’s start by having you stand up for me, if you’re able. And could you point to where you’re feeling the most pain right now?
PATIENT: Okay. There it is. Right here. And it kinda goes around here too. When I bend over… it’s like somethin’ is… stuck. And achin’. Real achin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling some tenderness here, and a little muscle guarding. And when I ask you to bend over, you said it feels stuck… can you demonstrate that for me, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: See? I can't go much further. It just… stops. And it hurts. Not a sharp pain, but… a dull ache. Like somethin’ is holdin’ me back. And standin’ up straight after… that’s the worst part. It takes a minute.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion, tenderness on palpation, and difficulty straightening up. I'm also feeling some stiffness along your spine. Your reflexes appear normal at this point, and I don’t detect any significant weakness in your legs. Given your history and what I’m finding on the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a musculoskeletal issue, possibly a strain or arthritis in your lower back. However, given your age and the duration of the symptoms, it would be prudent to rule out any other potential causes. I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a CBC, a CMP, and an ESR and CRP to assess for inflammation and other underlying conditions. Do you consent to having those tests done?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Blood work… sounds expensive. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just… I don’t have much money, you know? Will my insurance cover it? I don't have much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Mr. Vankampen. Don't worry, we'll see what we can do. Since you don't have insurance, we can explore some options. This clinic has a financial assistance program, and we may be able to get the tests done at a reduced cost, or even free of charge. We'll also see if there are any community resources available to help cover the expenses. I will have my staff assist you with completing the necessary paperwork. In the meantime, while we're waiting for the test results, I recommend continuing to rest, avoid any heavy lifting, and consider over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're able to tolerate them. We can also discuss some gentle stretching exercises that may help relieve some of the stiffness. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Restin’ and stretchin’… I can do that. Ibuprofen… I think my daughter gave me some once. I'll have to look. And stretchin'... what kinda stretchin'? I don't wanna make it worse, you know? I'm an old man, not a gymnast. Just tell me what to do. And thank you, Doctor. For helpin' me with the money. I appreciate it. A lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. We'll get you sorted out. And you're right to be cautious about stretching. We'll start with some very gentle exercises. How about this: sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor. Slowly lean forward, keeping your back straight, and reach towards your toes. Hold for 15-20 seconds, and repeat 5-10 times. Another one: lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently pull one knee towards your chest, holding for 15-20 seconds, and repeat on the other side. Only go as far as is comfortable, and stop immediately if you feel any pain. I'll have my staff print out a handout with these exercises and some other helpful tips for managing back pain. We can also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to review the test results and see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds… doable. Gentle stretchin’ is good. I can try that. And a handout… that's good too. I forget things easy, you know. A week… that sounds fine. Gives me time to try the stretchin’ and see if it helps. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. You're a good woman. Really. I appreciate you takin’ the time with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. It's my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. My staff will get the paperwork started for the financial assistance and print out the handouts for you. Have a good day, and try not to overdo it.
