DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the time for this, but my housekeeper insisted. Something about… not seeing and not hearing properly. It came on quite suddenly, you understand. It’s terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning that this came on so suddenly. Inconvenient is definitely a way to put it when it affects your vision and hearing. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that's difficult to say precisely. A few days ago, I suppose. It was gradual, at first. Like looking through a… a slightly dirty window, and then the sound… muffled. I really don’t remember the exact date, dear. I have a very busy schedule, you see. Is this really necessary to dwell on specifics?
DOCTOR: I understand your schedule is busy, Ms. Julie, and we don’t need to pinpoint the exact date if that’s difficult. Just a general timeframe is helpful. So, you noticed blurry vision and muffled hearing developing over a few days?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds about right. A few days. It’s all rather… unsettling. And truthfully, I haven't been sleeping well. Though I doubt that has anything to do with it. I simply have a great deal on my mind. Is there a quick test we can do to determine the problem? I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, muffled hearing, and some difficulty sleeping. We’ll certainly try to be efficient. A quick test is a good start, but to get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. First, with the vision changes, is it both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, dear. Both eyes. Really, must you ask such elementary questions? It's quite obvious, isn't it? If it were only one eye, I would have stated as much. I’m a surgeon, you know. I have excellent observational skills. This is becoming rather tedious.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to point that out, Ms. Julie. My apologies; I should have clarified. A surgeon’s eye for detail is invaluable, of course. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible. And with the muffled hearing, is that in both ears as well?
PATIENT: Yes, both ears! Is this truly necessary? It’s all quite… symmetrical, if you must know. Everything is happening at once, and it’s dreadfully inconvenient. I do not appreciate being asked such… basic questions. I trust you are a competent physician, and can simply diagnose the problem already?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions seem elementary. It’s important for me to gather a complete picture of your symptoms to ensure an accurate diagnosis. We need to rule out various possibilities, and I want to be thorough. To help me understand better, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the vision and hearing changes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. I have a life, you know. I don’t spend my days cataloging every minor ailment. A slight headache, perhaps. And a general feeling of… being overwhelmed. But that's hardly new. I really must insist, Doctor, if this is going to take much longer, I’ll have to reschedule. I have commitments. Very important commitments.
DOCTOR: Alright, headache and a general feeling of being overwhelmed. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you noticed any dizziness, ringing in your ears, or any facial weakness?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Ringing? Perhaps a little. It’s a noisy world, dear. And facial weakness? Good heavens, no! I maintain a very strict skincare routine, thank you very much. My face is perfectly symmetrical. Honestly, I don’t understand why you’re asking such… peculiar questions. Is this standard procedure? I’ve never been interrogated like this before. It's rather… unsettling. I think I’m done. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions are causing you discomfort. I assure you, I’m not trying to interrogate you. I'm simply trying to gather enough information to understand what might be causing your symptoms. Given your sudden vision and hearing changes, headache, and feeling overwhelmed, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re willing. This will involve checking your vision, hearing, reflexes, and a quick neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long, and it may help us determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
