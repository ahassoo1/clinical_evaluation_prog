DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just the results, please. I'm pretty busy, so if we can just skip the small talk, that'd be great.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand. Let's get right to it then. I pulled up your results from the lab. Just to be sure I have everything correct… you had blood work done on July 26th, is that right?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s the one. July 26th. Everything's all on the paper, right? I don’t really remember specifics.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is documented here. It looks like we checked a full panel… cholesterol, blood sugar, complete blood count… things like that. Hmm… everything looks generally within normal limits, but… your Vitamin D level is quite low. It's at 22 ng/mL. We generally like to see that above 30. Do you know anything about your Vitamin D levels, or have you ever had them checked before?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had them checked before, and honestly? No idea what that even means. Low is bad, right? Is it serious? I spend a lot of time indoors for work, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Low Vitamin D is quite common, especially if you spend a lot of time indoors. It’s not usually serious in the immediate sense, but it can contribute to fatigue, muscle aches, and even mood changes. And long-term, it can affect your bone health. Spending time indoors means your skin isn’t getting as much sunlight, which is how your body naturally makes Vitamin D. Do you experience any of those symptoms – fatigue, muscle aches, or have you noticed any changes in your mood lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. I have been feeling more tired than usual, I guess. And my back’s been a bit sore, but I figured that was just from sitting at a desk all day. Mood… maybe a little more irritable, but I always chalked that up to work stress. So yeah, probably all of those, actually. What do I do about it? Do I need a shot or something?
DOCTOR: Okay, that all fits with a Vitamin D deficiency. A shot isn’t usually the first step, thankfully! We typically start with oral Vitamin D supplements. D3 is the most effective form. We can start you on 2000 IU daily. It's an over-the-counter supplement, readily available at most pharmacies. We'll recheck your levels in about three months to see how you're responding to the supplementation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay, 2000 IU daily… Got it. Sounds easy enough. Three months… fine. Is there anything else? I really do need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Let's see… the rest of your blood work was within normal limits, which is good. No red flags there. I do always recommend a healthy diet and regular exercise, but you likely already know that! We also have some informational pamphlets on Vitamin D if you'd like to take one with you. They cover food sources, sunlight exposure, and other things to keep in mind. Otherwise, I think we've covered everything for today. Just remember the 2000 IU of D3 daily, and we'll see you back in three months for a follow-up. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. A pamphlet would be good, though, thanks. Seriously, I appreciate you keeping it quick. Gotta run.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand your time is valuable. Here you go. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up, don't hesitate to call the clinic. It was nice meeting you, Kahrin. Have a good day!
PATIENT: You too. Bye.
