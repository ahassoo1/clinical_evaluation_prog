DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sayar. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Fourney. It’s… a bit of a strange one, really. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it before they’ll approve my trip. It's for a trip I’ve already booked, actually.
DOCTOR: A letter stating you’re able to fly?
PATIENT: Yes. They said something about needing confirmation from a doctor that I don’t have any conditions that would make flying unsafe. It’s… a little frustrating, honestly, because I feel perfectly fine. But they won’t budge. I just need the letter to get everything sorted. It’s for a trip to visit family.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, insurance companies. Always something. Before I can just write a letter saying you’re fit to fly, I need to ask a few questions, just to be thorough. It’s… standard procedure, you understand. Now, have you been diagnosed with anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, I understand. Standard procedure makes sense. Let me think… Um, not diagnosed, exactly. My husband… he passed away last year, and before that, he needed a lot of care. I spent a lot of time at the hospital with him, so I know a little about things, but I haven’t been officially diagnosed with anything. Just… a lot of stress, I suppose. And grief. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Stress and grief certainly aren’t nothing, Ms. Sayar, but I need to know if you’ve experienced any physical symptoms that prompted a doctor’s visit. Things like chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, anything like that. It’s important to rule out underlying conditions, even if you haven't received a formal diagnosis. It's… due diligence. Have you seen a doctor in the last year, even for a routine checkup?
PATIENT: Yes, you're right to ask. It’s just… everything felt connected to losing him. Okay. I did go to the doctor about six months ago. I was having… palpitations, a really fast heartbeat. And I felt very tired, always exhausted. He did some tests – blood work, an EKG – and said it was likely just stress-induced. He recommended I get more rest and maybe talk to someone. He didn't find anything wrong, wrong, you know? But he did prescribe something for anxiety, a low dose. I took it for a bit, but honestly, I felt… foggy, so I stopped. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Foggy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very foggy. Like… I couldn't think clearly. It wasn't dangerous, just… unpleasant. It made it hard to concentrate, and I needed to be… present for things, you know? Dealing with arrangements and… everything. I didn’t want to feel numb, but I didn’t want to feel overwhelmed either. So I decided it wasn’t worth it. It’s been a few months now and I’ve been feeling much better, just… normal tired, I guess. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: It’s… relevant that you discontinued a medication prescribed by a physician without follow-up. Now, tell me, have you experienced any chest pain or shortness of breath since you stopped taking that medication?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And no shortness of breath, not at all. I've been perfectly fine, really. I've been walking every day, even. I just… wanted to get this letter so I can go see my sister. I haven’t seen her since the funeral, and she’s been having a hard time too. It’s a long flight, which is why they're being so difficult. It feels a bit silly, honestly, but I appreciate you being thorough. I just… want to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination, just to be certain. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It’s… a formality, but better safe than sorry, wouldn’t you agree?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you need. I understand. Better safe than sorry. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is perfectly acceptable. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling at all. My feet are… normal, I think. I haven’t really paid much attention, to be honest. They might be a little tired after the walking, but no swelling. Is that something I should be checking for?
DOCTOR: No edema noted. Alright, Ms. Sayar. Based on this brief examination and what you’ve told me, there’s no immediate medical reason why you shouldn’t be able to fly. However, I must advise you that stress can exacerbate underlying conditions. And discontinuating a medication without consulting a physician is… not ideal. I can write a letter stating you are cleared for travel as of today, with the caveat that you should consult with your primary care physician upon your return to discuss a long-term plan for managing stress and anxiety. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… perfectly acceptable. That sounds very reasonable. And yes, I will absolutely make an appointment with a doctor when I get back. I probably should have done that already, to be honest. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. I really appreciate you taking the time to do this. I just want to go see my sister.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Ms. Sayar. This letter outlines my assessment and recommendations. Please keep this with you during your travels. And remember, a follow-up with your primary care physician is essential. I strongly advise it. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Fourney. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate your time and your… frankness. I will definitely make that appointment when I get back. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a safe trip, Ms. Sayar. And do take care of yourself. .
