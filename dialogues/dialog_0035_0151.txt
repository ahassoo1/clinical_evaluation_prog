DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It's been going on for…oh, I don't know, a few weeks now, maybe a month? It’s just…annoying, really. Makes it hard to hold things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet for a few weeks to a month. I understand it’s annoying and makes it difficult to hold things. Can you describe the tingling?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not painful, exactly. More like…pins and needles, you know? Like when your foot falls asleep? But it doesn’t go away completely. It comes and goes, but it's there a lot of the time. Sometimes it feels numb too, not just tingly. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pins and needles, numbness…and it comes and goes, but is fairly persistent. Okay. And does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… Standing for long periods at work definitely makes it worse. That’s the mail route, you see. Lots of walking and being on my feet. And…cold makes it worse too. Really cold weather. As for better… honestly, not much. Maybe when I’m resting, but even then, it doesn’t completely go away. I try to wiggle my toes and shake my hands, that sometimes helps a little. But not much, really. It's just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so standing for long periods and cold weather worsen the symptoms, and rest offers minimal relief. You mentioned the mail route – how long have you been doing that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Thirty years, come September. Thirty years! It’s a good job, keeps me busy. But…it’s hard work, you know? It’s been getting harder as I’ve gotten older, but…what can you do? I need the money. My husband, God rest his soul, he passed away five years ago, and…well, I’m on my own now. Does that matter? Knowing how long I've been doing it?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters. Thank you for sharing that. Thirty years is a long time on your feet, and it's good to know about your husband's passing. I’m sorry for your loss. Let me just quickly review your chart here… I see no immediate red flags, but it's good to get a full picture. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness…hmm. That’s a good question. Not really, not obvious weakness. But sometimes, especially at the end of the day, my hands feel clumsy, you know? Like I can’t grip things as tightly as I used to. And my feet…they feel heavy sometimes, like they're dragging a little. But I just figured that was from being on them all day. Is that what you mean by weakness? I don't know if it's real weakness or just…tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness and a feeling of heaviness, particularly at the end of the day. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance, or have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no falls, thank goodness. But my balance…well, it’s not as good as it used to be, I'll admit that. I feel a little unsteady sometimes, especially when I turn my head quickly. Or if I'm walking on uneven ground. I haven't fallen, but I definitely have to be more careful now than I used to. I try to hold onto things when I can. My daughter worries about me, she keeps telling me to get a cane. I haven't done that yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some unsteadiness and a tendency to hold onto things for support. And your daughter is understandably concerned. Alright, Teretha. We've covered a good bit here. Just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my cholesterol a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been fine ever since. Other than that…nothing major. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, not too much sugar. And I don't smoke, never have. My husband, he smoked for years, but I always told him to stop. No, no diabetes, no high blood pressure. Nothing like that. I’m not insured, so I don’t go to the doctor much unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of cholesterol managed with medication, no diabetes, no high blood pressure, and no smoking. You are not currently insured, and you only seek medical attention when necessary. That’s good to know. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the cholesterol pill, like I said. Atorvastatin, I think it's called. One a day. And…sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I’ve been forgetting lately. It's one of those little things, you know? I used to be so good about taking it every day, but now…well, it slips my mind. Nothing else. No special supplements, no pain relievers or anything like that. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, just atorvastatin for cholesterol and occasional multivitamin. Alright, Teretha, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if we can. It's just…annoying, you know? Makes everything so much harder. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in…and out…Good. Everything sounds clear there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It's normal to have a little jerk when I do this. Okay, reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is that tight enough? It feels a little weaker than it used to, but I’m not sure. It's hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your grip strength feels a bit diminished, but not significantly. We’ll compare that to the other side. Now, I'm going to check the sensation in your hands and feet. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton swab, and I want you to tell me when you feel it. Close your eyes for me, please. Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel it. Right there? Is that okay? A little numb, maybe, but I feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one too. But…it feels a little different. Kind of…fuzzier? Not as sharp as the other one. It’s hard to explain. Like a tingling sensation even before you touch me. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Some diminished sensation and a tingling sensation. Alright. Now, I want you to open your eyes. Can you stand up for me, please, and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Careful now…it’s a little wobbly. Like this? Is that okay? I try not to rush, you know? Don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a slightly wide-based gait, and your step length is a little shorter than normal. You are compensating and using your hands for balance. Alright, Teretha, please sit down. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found in the exam, the tingling and numbness in your hands and feet, along with the diminished sensation, clumsiness, unsteadiness, and slightly wide-based gait, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy. It’s damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. There are many causes.
PATIENT: Peripheral…what? Neuropathy? Oh dear. Is that…serious? What causes it? And…can it be fixed? I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it something I caught?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you're worried, Teretha. Peripheral neuropathy just means there’s some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. It’s not something you “catch” like a cold. There are many possible causes. The most common are diabetes, but you don’t have diabetes. Other causes include vitamin deficiencies – especially B vitamins – certain medications, infections, autoimmune diseases, and sometimes it can be hereditary, or we can’t find a specific cause. Given your history and exam, I suspect it could be related to a vitamin deficiency or possibly something we need to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and rule out other possible causes. We'll also need to do a CBC to check for infection. I'm going to order those tests now. In the meantime, it’s important to protect your feet. Wear comfortable shoes with good support, avoid walking barefoot, and be careful not to injure them. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Blood tests…oh dear. That sounds expensive. I don’t have insurance, you know? Is it going to cost a lot of money? And…protect my feet? I always wear sensible shoes. But what about…the tingling? Is there anything I can do about the tingling? Will it go away? I just want it to stop, you know? It's so annoying.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Teretha. Let’s talk about that. I can write an order for the tests, and there are labs that offer financial assistance programs or sliding scales based on income. I can provide you with a list of labs in the area that offer those options. We’ll figure something out. As for the tingling, it's hard to say definitively if it will go away without knowing the cause. But addressing any underlying vitamin deficiencies or other medical issues can often improve symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with any discomfort, but they won’t address the underlying problem. We can also discuss options for managing the symptoms, like physical therapy or occupational therapy. I’m going to order a CBC, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I'm also going to order a thyroid stimulating hormone test, just to rule out that possibility. I’ll also give you a handout with information about peripheral neuropathy and some tips for managing your symptoms. Would you like me to write you a referral to a podiatrist as well?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? What would they do? And a handout is good, yes, that would be helpful. But…this all sounds so complicated. I just want to know what's wrong with me. I’ll see about the labs, yes. But I don’t know if I can afford all these tests. I'm really just a simple woman, you know? I just want to be able to do my mail route without feeling like I'm going to fall over.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. It is complicated, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. A podiatrist is a foot doctor. They can assess your feet for any nerve damage, recommend supportive footwear, and provide tips for preventing injuries. Even if we find the cause of the neuropathy, it’s good to have a podiatrist involved in your care to protect your feet. I'm writing a referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a podiatrist in town. She accepts patients with limited insurance and offers a sliding scale. I'll also give you the handout now. It explains peripheral neuropathy in plain language and has some exercises you can do at home. We'll take this one step at a time. First, we'll get the blood tests done. Then we'll review the results and discuss a treatment plan. The lab order and referral are right here. Please call the lab to schedule an appointment. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call my office. And remember, we’ll figure this out together. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
