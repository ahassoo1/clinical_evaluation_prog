DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s just something I wanted to do, you know? Better safe than sorry, I always say. It's not… anything specific, really. Just a check-up, preventative sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very responsible of you, Mr. Belan. It’s always good to be proactive about your health. And you’re right, better safe than sorry. We can absolutely do that for you today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about any potential exposures you might have had that are concerning to you?
PATIENT: Exposures? What do you mean? Look, I’m married. Been with my wife for… well, a long time. That’s… that’s the only exposure that should be relevant, isn’t it? I mean, I don't go around… doing things. I just want to be sure, that’s all. I don’t need a whole interrogation about my personal life, do I? It feels a bit… intrusive, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as intrusive, Mr. Belan. That was not my intention at all. It’s standard procedure to ask about potential risks, but you are absolutely right, a long-term, monogamous relationship significantly lowers risk. I just want to be thorough. So, to clarify, you’ve been in a monogamous relationship with your wife for the duration of your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. For the entirety. Look, I'm a Compliance Officer, Doctor. I deal with questions and protocols all day. I understand due diligence. But really, I think this is getting a bit… much. Are you suggesting something? It’s a simple test, isn’t it? Just do the test. I don’t need a life story analysis.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Mr. Belan, and I appreciate your patience. It’s my job to gather information, and I should have explained my reasoning better. A simple test is exactly what we can do. Before we proceed, just to be complete, have you ever shared needles for any reason – for example, for medical purposes, or recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Are you serious now? Needles? Do I look like the type? I told you, I’m a Compliance Officer. I have a reputation to uphold! This is… insulting. I mean, honestly. I’ve never touched a needle in my life outside of a doctor’s office. This is ridiculous. Just… skip that line of questioning. It's a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be upset, Mr. Belan. I apologize profusely. I am asking inappropriate questions and clearly making assumptions. That is unacceptable, and I will stop immediately. Let's move forward with the HIV test then. Have you had any other STI screenings recently?
PATIENT: No. Look, I’ve been married. For a long time. I haven’t needed to, have I? I mean, it's not like I'm out there… collecting them. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me feel like I’m under suspicion of something. It's quite frustrating. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do, you know. A perfectly good afternoon being wasted on… this.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel frustrated, Mr. Belan, and I sincerely apologize for putting you in this position. I am clearly not handling this conversation with the sensitivity it deserves. You’ve been clear about your monogamous relationship, and I should have respected that from the beginning. Let’s focus on getting you tested and providing you with peace of mind. Before we do that, just a quick check – do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Look, I’m perfectly healthy. I eat well, I exercise… I don’t go around getting sick. Honestly, Doctor, is this standard procedure for every patient? Because if it is, you might want to rethink your approach. It's… demeaning. Just do the test, please. I’m starting to regret even coming in here.
DOCTOR: You are right to question that, Mr. Belan, and I will take your feedback seriously. It appears I’ve allowed my questions to become overly intrusive, and I apologize for that. I assure you, this is not standard procedure, and I will be more mindful of my approach in the future. Okay, no allergies, healthy lifestyle. Let’s proceed with the blood draw for the HIV test. It will take a few minutes. I’ll also order a standard comprehensive metabolic panel just as a baseline, if you don’t mind. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A metabolic panel? Seriously? Look, I just want the HIV test. That’s what I came for. I don’t need a whole work-up just because… what? Because you've decided I need one? No. Just the HIV test. Please. I’m starting to feel like this is some kind of… a test of my patience, rather than a medical consultation. Get it done, and let me leave.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Mr. Belan. I apologize for pushing the additional test. You came in for an HIV test, and that is what we will do. I’ll prepare the requisition for the blood draw now. Would you like me to explain the process to you briefly, or would you prefer I just have the phlebotomist come in?
PATIENT: Just get the phlebotomist. I know what a blood draw is, Doctor. I'm not a child. And frankly, the less conversation, the better. I’m losing valuable time here. Just… let’s get it over with. Stop asking questions. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. I will inform the phlebotomist to come in right away. I apologize again for the unnecessary questions and for making you feel uncomfortable. I assure you, this is not how I typically conduct a consultation. Phlebotomist to room three, please. It will just be a few minutes. Please let me know if you have any questions while we wait, but otherwise, I will give you some space.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry.
