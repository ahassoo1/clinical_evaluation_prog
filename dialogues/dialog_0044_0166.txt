DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here about some numbness in my leg. It’s been…well, I can tell you exactly when it started, actually – July 18th, around 3:17 PM, if that’s helpful. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes it feels a little…distant in the right one too.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, actually! Precise details are always good. July 18th, around 3:17 PM... okay. And it started in your left leg, and occasionally affects the right. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, if that makes sense. More like…a pins-and-needles sensation, but not painful. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just my toes, other times it’s higher up, almost to my knee. It’s…difficult to explain, actually. It doesn’t feel sharp, and it’s not consistently there. Like, I can be walking perfectly fine, then suddenly notice it, and then it fades again.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like an intermittent pins-and-needles sensation, not consistently present, affecting your left leg primarily but occasionally your right, and ranging from your toes up to your knee. No sharp pain, just…a distant feeling. That's a good start. Now, can you recall anything specific you were doing around 3:17 PM on July 18th?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I was…setting up a motion capture rig for a new animation project. I had just finished calibrating the sensors and was adjusting the camera angles. It required a bit of reaching and bending, and I was standing for quite a while. It wasn’t particularly strenuous, but I was focused on getting the alignment just right. I remember thinking the lighting was a bit off, too, and I adjusted the studio lamps. It’s…a very detailed memory, actually. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does, Tarin. That level of detail is fantastic. So, you were setting up motion capture equipment, involving some reaching, bending, and standing for a prolonged period. And you were adjusting the lighting as well. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs, any changes in your balance, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No weakness at all, and my balance feels perfectly normal. I haven’t had any trouble walking, not even a little bit. I do a lot of hiking, you see, and I haven’t noticed any difference there. I was a bit worried about that, actually, so I’ve been paying attention. I walk about five miles every Saturday, usually up near the glacier. So, I would have noticed if something was off with my gait.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Tarin. Hiking five miles every Saturday is excellent – and very observant of you to monitor your gait closely. No weakness, no balance issues, and no changes in your walking. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all, to my knowledge. I’ve always been quite healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing serious. I've had annual check-ups with my family doctor back in Anchorage, and he always said I was in good shape. No surgeries, no chronic conditions, nothing like that. My mother has some mild hypertension, but that’s hereditary and she manages it well with diet and exercise. I haven't inherited that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. No prior medical diagnoses, no surgeries, and a family history of only mild hypertension in your mother. You've had annual check-ups and been told you're in good shape. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a single one. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in maintaining a healthy lifestyle – a good diet, regular exercise, and plenty of sleep. I occasionally take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side, but that’s it. And I haven’t taken anything for this leg numbness either; I wanted to see what you thought first. I prefer to understand the issue before resorting to self-treatment, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Tarin. That's a very sensible approach. No medications, not even over-the-counter, just a multivitamin occasionally. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, sir. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things – my grandmother was a wonderful cook, and she experimented with a lot of different ingredients – and I’ve never had any problems. I’ve also never had any skin reactions to plants or insects, thankfully. No allergies, not a single one. I believe my Yupik ancestors were quite resilient in that regard; they had to be, living in such a harsh environment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies. That’s very good to know. Okay, Tarin, I'm just reviewing your records here. It confirms what you've told me – no significant medical history, regular check-ups, and everything appears to be in order. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. It's a pretty straightforward process. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly alright. I understand the need for a physical examination. I trust your judgment, and I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please proceed at your convenience. I’m ready whenever you are. I have a good range of motion, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Relax your legs... good. And now, just push your heel down against my hand when I ask... excellent. Okay, and now the other side... good. Now, I'm going to ask you to push against my hand as you did before, but this time I'll be offering resistance. Just tell me when you feel any pain. Just a gentle push... good. And now the other leg... excellent. Finally, I’m going to lightly brush your legs with this. Just tell me when you feel the sensation. Start with your toes…do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It’s…a little diminished on the left foot, actually. It’s not absent, but it’s definitely not as strong as on my right foot. It feels…muffled, almost. It’s difficult to describe. On my right foot, it’s very clear and distinct; I feel the brush immediately. But on my left foot, it’s…subtle. It takes a moment to register. It’s…interesting, actually. And it’s consistent; it’s not like it’s stronger sometimes and weaker others. It’s just…always a little bit fainter. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Tarin. You're very observant. I'm also detecting a slight decrease in sensation on your left foot compared to your right. Reflexes are normal bilaterally, strength is good in both legs, but the diminished sensation on your left foot is noteworthy. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary exam findings, it sounds like we may be dealing with some mild peripheral nerve irritation or compression on your left leg. It could be related to the position you were in while setting up the motion capture equipment, or potentially something else entirely. We’ll need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a nerve conduction study and electromyography, or NCV/EMG. It's a painless test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles. It'll help us pinpoint the source of the problem. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly alright. A nerve conduction study and electromyography…I understand it’s to measure electrical activity, and to pinpoint the source of the problem. I’m happy to proceed with whatever tests you deem necessary. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this. I am rather particular about my physical well-being, you see. When will that be scheduled? And is there anything I should do to prepare for it?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Tarin. I appreciate your proactive approach. I’ll have the scheduling department contact you to arrange the NCV/EMG. Typically, they can get you in within the next week. As for preparation, there isn't much you need to do. Just avoid using lotions or creams on your legs the day of the test, and wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. It usually takes about an hour, and you can drive yourself home afterward. While we’re waiting for the results of the NCV/EMG, I’d recommend avoiding prolonged standing or repetitive movements that seem to aggravate your symptoms. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, sir, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. Avoiding prolonged standing and repetitive movements is sensible, and I'll take your advice regarding the pain relievers, should I need them. I'm quite capable of managing my own well-being, but I appreciate your guidance. I’ll await the scheduling department's call. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I feel considerably more reassured knowing we're taking a methodical approach to this. It's…satisfying, actually, to have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. I appreciate your cooperation and your attention to detail – it makes a significant difference. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns before your NCV/EMG, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I will certainly contact the clinic if any concerns arise. Thank you again for your excellent care. .
