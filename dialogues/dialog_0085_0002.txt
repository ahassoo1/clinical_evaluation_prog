DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen… yes, that’s right. Hmm… well, it’s my waterworks, you see. Been a bit tricky lately. Not… not flowing so good. It’s just… hard to get it all out, if you know what I mean. It’s been going on for… oh, a while now, I reckon. Not sudden, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty with urination, feeling like you're not completely emptying your bladder. And it's been gradual, not a sudden change. Thank you for explaining that. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. Not emptying… yes. It’s… frustrating, mostly. I have to… push a bit. And sometimes it just… stops. Then starts again. It's not painful, not really. Just… annoying. And I have to go more often, I think. Though maybe that’s just old age! I forget things easily, you know. My husband says I go to the bathroom all the time, but… well, he says a lot of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s frustrating, requires you to strain to urinate, and sometimes it starts and stops. No pain, which is good to hear. And you feel like you might be going to the bathroom more frequently. It's perfectly normal to experience changes in urinary habits as we get older, Ms. Stoffregen, and memory can definitely play a role in noticing those changes. Let's try to figure out what might be causing this. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like a burning sensation when you urinate, fever, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Burning… no, no burning. Thank goodness for that. And no fever, I don't think. I haven’t been feeling poorly, just… tired, you know? Old age again, probably. Blood… oh dear. I don’t… I don’t recall seeing any blood. Now that you mention it… I might have, once? But I’m not sure. It could have been something else in the toilet… I really don’t remember. My eyes aren't what they used to be, either. Hard to see little things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no burning or fever, just some fatigue. And you’re unsure if you’ve seen any blood in your urine. That's alright, it's good you’re letting me know what you do remember. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… My husband, bless his heart, he keeps track of these things. I go to the doctor for checkups, you know, regular ones. And I take a little pill… a white one… every morning. For my… something. He says it’s for my blood. Not to get too thick. High blood… pressure, was it? Yes, I think that's what he says. He worries about it, always fussing. I don’t really pay much attention, to be honest. He handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have high blood pressure and you take a white pill every morning to manage it. That’s helpful to know. It sounds like your husband is very involved in your healthcare, which is wonderful. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I really don’t. It’s in a little plastic bottle… with a childproof cap, of course. He fills it every month. He tells me to take one every morning with my breakfast. I just… take it. I don’t like to bother him with questions, he gets so flustered trying to explain things. He knows best, I always say. Maybe… maybe he’d have the name written down somewhere?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright if you don't know the name of the medication. It's very common to rely on others to manage those details. To help me get a clearer picture, let's talk about your past medical history a little more generally. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. A very long time ago. And… hmm… I think I had my gallbladder taken out, maybe? Something with my tummy. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember much about it, honestly. It was all a bit blurry. I’ve been to the hospital a few times over the years… mostly when I broke a bone or got a bad flu. Nothing major, as far as I recall. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and possibly gallbladder removal sometime in the past. A few hospital stays for broken bones and the flu. Now, let's talk a bit about your family. Is there a history of any medical conditions in your family – like kidney problems, bladder issues, or prostate problems in the men?
PATIENT: Oh, family… my mother, bless her soul, she always had a weak tummy. Lots of indigestion, you know. And my brother… he had trouble with his kidneys when he got older. Had to go to the doctor a lot. My husband’s side… hmm… I think his father had something with his… waterworks, maybe? It was a long time ago. The men in his family, they all get a bit… puffy when they get old. Lots of swelling in their legs and… down there. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. We didn’t talk about those things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of digestive issues in your mother, kidney problems in your brother, and some swelling in the men in your husband’s family. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband, he used to smoke a little, when he was younger. But he gave it up years ago. Doctor told him to, you know. Good for him, he did. Always a bit of a cough, though, even after he stopped. I always told him it wasn’t good for him, that smoking.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And good for your husband for quitting! Now, Ms. Stoffregen, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your blood pressure, and do a gentle exam to assess the area. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… sensible. If you think it will help. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just be gentle, alright? My old bones aren’t what they used to be. And don’t mind if I wiggle a bit, I get a little… restless sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And it’s perfectly fine to wiggle. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen now. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a bit high, isn't it? My husband will be upset. He's always fussing about my numbers. And… no, not painful. Just… a little tender, maybe? Down low. It’s hard to say, really. I get a little… uncomfortable in that area sometimes, even without being poked. It's a strange feeling, hard to describe. Like… a pressure, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness and a feeling of pressure down low. I'm going to try to palpate your lower abdomen a bit more carefully to see if I can feel anything specific. Okay, I'm feeling some slight fullness in your bladder, which is expected. There doesn't appear to be any significant pain with palpation, and I don’t feel any masses. I'm going to listen to your back now. Your lungs sound clear. Now, just to rule out a possible urinary tract infection, I’d like to order a urine sample. We can send it to the lab to check for any bacteria. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine sample… yes, that sounds sensible too. If it will help figure things out. It’s a bit of a bother, having to go to the bathroom so often just to give a little cup of water, but… alright. Where do I go? And is there a special cup? I don't want to make a mess. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. We have a private restroom right down the hall. The nurse will give you a sterile cup, and she can explain the process to you. She's very good at helping patients who have trouble with dexterity. It's no trouble at all, and we'll make sure you have everything you need. While you’re collecting your sample, I'll document our findings so far. We'll have the results back within a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very organized. I appreciate that. I’m not very good with all the medical… things, you know. I mostly just let my husband handle it. The nurse… yes, I’m sure she’s very nice. Down the hall, you say? Alright. I’ll go and… try not to make a mess. Thank you, dear. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It's my pleasure. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need any assistance. The nurse is just outside the door, and she’ll be happy to help you. We'll get to the bottom of this. Let me know when you've completed the sample, and we can discuss the next steps.
