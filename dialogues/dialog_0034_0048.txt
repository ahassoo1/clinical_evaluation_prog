DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Pleasure to meet you as well. Though, I must say, a young doctor seeing me... well. It's just… Anyway. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I've been…forgetful. Not me, mind you. She’s the one with the faulty memory. But she says I have these…episodes. Confusing times, she calls them. I just feel…out of sorts, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It's very common for spouses to notice changes in one another, and it’s good that your wife is looking out for your well-being. And please don't feel embarrassed; these things happen. "Out of sorts" is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me a little more about these "episodes"?
PATIENT: Episodes… hmm. It's hard to explain. It’s not like I suddenly don't know who I am, understand? It’s more like…things don’t quite connect. Like I'm trying to remember a name, or what I was doing five minutes ago, and it’s just…gone. Blank. Then it comes back, usually. But it’s frustrating. And it’s happening more often, my wife says. She worries. I tell her I’m just getting old. It happens. But she insists. We had one just last week, trying to fix the tile in the bathroom. Completely forgot where I put the grout. The grout, Doctor! A tile setter forgetting the grout…it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing periods of difficulty with recall and perhaps some disorientation. It’s good you can describe it so clearly, despite the frustration. And it’s certainly concerning if this is happening more frequently. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me about how long these episodes typically last?
PATIENT: Typically? Hmm. Not long, usually. Maybe…five, ten minutes? Sometimes less. It’s not like I’m out for hours, you understand. Just…a little bit of a pause. A gap. Long enough to make me look foolish in front of my wife. She fusses over me then. Says I should slow down, retire. As if I haven't spent my life laying tile! It’s good, honest work. But…I suppose it could be worse. It's just… unsettling. Like a broken tool, you know? Not working quite right. And it happens at random times, that's the worst of it. Sometimes when I’m busy, sometimes when I’m resting. No pattern to it at all.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Lason. The randomness is something we'll definitely want to explore further. Now, besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think. Well, my appetite hasn't been the best. Not much hunger, you understand? My wife keeps making these…elaborate meals. Says I need to "keep my strength up." It just…sits in my stomach. And…sometimes I feel a little…off balance. Not dizzy, exactly, just… unsteady on my feet. More so when I stand up quickly. It’s probably just age, though. Everything starts to go when you get old, you know. Joints ache, memory fades, balance goes… it’s the natural order of things. But my wife… she worries about everything. She thinks I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand. Loss of appetite and some unsteadiness are important things to mention. It's good you're bringing these things up, even if you feel they might just be related to age. We'll take everything into consideration. Now, have you experienced any changes in your vision, hearing, or speech?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. I suppose it’s not as sharp as it used to be. I need my glasses, of course. Have for years. But no…no real changes recently. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that's just the age, I think. Hearing…well, my wife talks a lot. Sometimes I have trouble picking up what she’s saying, but that's because she mumbles! And speech…I haven’t noticed any trouble speaking. I’m still perfectly capable of telling her what I think, believe me! No, Doctor, no changes there. Perfectly fine. I’m still the same Colt Lason, loud and opinionated as ever. Though my wife might disagree.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. It sounds like your senses are generally stable. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Well, now that's a question. High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me years ago, when I was still working construction mostly. Put me on some pills, I took them for a while. Didn’t like being on pills, so I stopped. He…well, he wasn’t happy. But I felt fine, so I just kept working. And…arthritis, in my hands. From all the tile work, you understand. It aches sometimes, especially in the cold. Nothing serious, though. Just a little pain. And… that’s about it, I think. Nothing else that I can recall. I've always been a strong man, good constitution. Didn't spend much time at the doctor, truthfully. Too busy laying tile.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of hypertension, which you’ve since stopped taking medication for, and arthritis in your hands. That's helpful. Have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…hmm. Just once, a long time ago. When I was a young man. Broke my arm falling off the scaffolding. Construction work, you understand. Dangerous business. They set it, put it in a cast. Didn’t like being idle. And…no surgeries. Never needed any. Always been lucky, that way. Good bones, strong hands. Though the arthritis is starting to slow me down. But no surgeries, Doctor. Never had any. I avoid doctors when I can, honestly. Too much poking and prodding. I prefer to be working, laying tile. It keeps me busy, keeps me strong. Though my wife…she doesn’t see it that way. She wants me to slow down. Retiring, she keeps saying. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a single hospitalization for a broken arm in your youth, no surgeries. That's good to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Well, that’s the thing. I don’t take much. Like I said, I don’t like pills. The arthritis, sometimes I take some ibuprofen, when it’s really aching. Over the counter, you understand. Nothing fancy. And… my wife makes me take a multivitamin every morning. Says I need the vitamins. I don't really pay attention to it. She just puts it on my plate with breakfast. That’s about it, Doctor. Just ibuprofen sometimes, and whatever my wife puts in front of me. Honestly, I try to avoid medication as much as possible. Natural remedies, that's what I believe in. Hard work and a good constitution. That's what keeps a man healthy. Though my wife…she doesn’t see it that way. She worries about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for arthritis and a daily multivitamin. We'll keep that in mind. Now, before we move on, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history…hmm. Now that’s a difficult one. My parents…they both passed away a long time ago. Heart problems, I think. My father, yes, definitely heart problems. Stroke, maybe. I don't remember exactly. We didn’t talk much about those things. It wasn’t something we Khmer families did, you understand. Just…dealt with it. My wife’s family… she has a lot of siblings. Some cancer, I think. Breast cancer, maybe. But honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to family history. Everyone gets sick eventually, doesn’t matter what their family history is. It’s just… part of life. I focus on staying strong, staying healthy. That's what matters. Though my wife… she keeps track of everything. She's always worried about something. She'll probably know more about family history than I do.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful information, despite the limited details. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, though. A lot. That’s probably why he had heart problems. Nasty habit. I always told him so. But he wouldn't listen. He said it helped him relax. Relaxing isn’t everything, you understand. Hard work is what keeps a man healthy. Always has been, always will be. So no, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have, never will. My wife would have a fit if I even thought about it. She’s very health-conscious, you see. Very worried about everything. And she’s right, of course. Smoking is a terrible habit. A waste of money, and it’s bad for your health. But I don’t need to be told that. I already know.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. A little, sometimes. With dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a beer. Nothing fancy. Not every night, mind you. Just when my wife makes something special. Or when we’re celebrating something. It helps me relax, you understand. After a long day of laying tile. But I don't drink to excess. Never have. My wife makes sure of that. She keeps track of everything. She'll pour me a glass, and that's it. No more. She's very careful about those things. She worries about my health, you see. And she's right, of course. Too much alcohol isn't good for you. But a little, with dinner, isn't going to hurt. It helps me unwind. It helps me relax. And it makes my wife happy. So yes, Doctor, I drink a little alcohol sometimes. But not too much. Never too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small amount of alcohol with meals. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your current living situation and daily activities?
PATIENT: Well, I live with my wife, of course. In a nice little house in the suburbs. We’ve been there for many years. I mostly work. Laying tile, you understand. Still working, though my wife thinks I should retire. I get up early, go to work, come home, have dinner with my wife, watch a little television. Nothing fancy. I try to stay active. I walk around, do some gardening. But the arthritis is slowing me down. It aches sometimes, especially in the cold. I’m still independent, though. Still able to take care of myself. Still able to work. I just… get tired sometimes. And I forget things. But that’s just part of getting old, isn’t it? It’s a good life, Doctor. A simple life. But my wife… she worries about everything. She wants me to slow down, to relax, to enjoy my retirement. But I like working. I like staying busy. It keeps me young.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Though I don't expect you'll find anything wrong. I'm still a strong man, despite my age. But go ahead, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just…be gentle with my hands. The arthritis, you understand. It aches sometimes. And my wife will be furious if I come home complaining. She already thinks I push myself too hard. So be careful, Doctor. Be gentle. And don’t keep me waiting too long. I have things to do, you see. Tiles to lay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I will be as gentle as possible. And I’ll try not to keep you waiting too long. First, I'll check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I’ll do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds…thorough, Doctor. A little unnecessary, if you ask me. But go ahead. Do what you need to do. I’ll cooperate. Just… try to be quick about it. I have tiles to lay, you understand. And my wife is making dinner. She'll be furious if I'm late. Though, she’ll probably be even more furious if I come home with a bad report. So… be gentle, Doctor. And be quick. And tell me if you find anything wrong. But I expect everything will be alright. I'm a strong man, despite my age. Just a little forgetful sometimes. That's all. Now, let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please. … 148 over 85. A little elevated. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Take a deep breath for me…and exhale. Again… Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear clear. Throat is clear as well. No signs of infection. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arm relaxed. … 2+ bilaterally. Good. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and point to your nose with your finger. …Good. Now, can you walk a straight line for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. I did it. A little wobbly, perhaps. But I did it. Though my wife will probably make a fuss. She always says I need to be more careful. She worries too much. But honestly, Doctor, I'm still a strong man. Despite my age. Just a little unsteady sometimes. That's all. What do you think? Is everything alright? Don't tell me I need to retire. I won't listen.
DOCTOR: You did well, Mr. Lason. Your reflexes are normal, and you were able to complete the balance test, though with a slight degree of unsteadiness. Overall, your exam findings are largely normal for your age. However, the elevated blood pressure and slight murmur warrant further investigation. The mild unsteadiness is also something we should monitor. I’m not saying you need to retire, Mr. Lason. But it would be prudent to address these findings. I recommend a few further tests, including an EKG to evaluate the murmur, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. We should also repeat your blood pressure reading on a separate occasion to confirm the elevation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tests… Of course. My wife will be thrilled. She's always wanted me to get more tests. She says I ignore my health. An EKG… a basic metabolic panel… It all sounds… unnecessary. But alright. Do what you need to do. But I expect everything will be fine. I'm a strong man, despite my age. Just a little forgetful sometimes, and a little unsteady on my feet. Will these tests take long? And will they interfere with my work? I have tiles to lay, you understand. And my wife will be furious if I miss any deadlines. She's very particular about those things. And… what if something is wrong? What if these tests show something serious? Don't tell me I need to retire. I won't listen. I'll keep laying tiles, even if I have to do it with one leg. It's what I do. It's who I am.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't believe they were important. They are simply a way to get a more complete picture of your overall health and rule out any potential problems. The EKG is a quick, painless test that takes only a few minutes. The basic metabolic panel requires a blood draw, which will also be relatively quick. Both tests can be completed at the clinic today. They shouldn’t interfere with your work schedule significantly. As for what if something is wrong, let’s not jump to conclusions. Many things can cause elevated blood pressure and a murmur, and most are manageable with lifestyle changes or medication. If we do find something that requires further treatment, we will discuss all your options and develop a plan that works for you. I want to assure you that I am here to support you every step of the way. We will take things one step at a time, and I will never push you to do anything you are not comfortable with. And I understand your passion for laying tiles, Mr. Lason. We will work to ensure you can continue to do what you love for as long as possible. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Order the tests. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And don't tell me I need to retire. And… thank you, Doctor. For… not telling me to retire. And for… listening. My wife doesn't always listen. She just tells me what to do. And… can I get a note for my wife? Telling her I'm getting the tests? She'll be furious if I don't tell her. She'll probably make me take a dozen vitamins. And… can we do it quickly? I have tiles to lay, you understand. And my wife is making dinner. She'll be furious if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I'll order the EKG and basic metabolic panel right away. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood sample and perform the EKG. It shouldn't take more than 30 minutes or so. And yes, I can certainly write a note for your wife, letting her know you’re getting the tests. I’ll explain that we're being proactive about your health and that you’re doing everything we recommend. I’ll also mention that we’re monitoring your blood pressure and evaluating a slight heart murmur. Here you go. I’ll also make sure the nurse knows to be as quick as possible. We understand you have a busy schedule. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… get it over with. And try to be quick. I have tiles to lay, you understand. And my wife is making dinner. She’ll be furious if I’m late. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not telling me to retire. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have tiles to lay.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. Thank you for coming in today. The nurse will be with you shortly. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Lason. And please, try not to overexert yourself. .
