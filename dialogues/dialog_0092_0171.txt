DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, morning. It's…the nails. They just look…off. Not right. I don't really…remember when they started, exactly. Just noticed them a little bit ago, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about changes to your nails. It's good you brought this to my attention. When you say "off," can you describe what you mean?
PATIENT: Well…they’re kinda…funny-looking. Not smooth, you know? And…a little bit thick, maybe? It’s hard to explain. I don't usually pay attention to my nails, to be honest. What should nails look like?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Thut, it's perfectly normal not to routinely examine your nails. Healthy nails are typically smooth, firm, and have a slightly curved shape. They shouldn't have significant ridges, pits, or discoloration. Let me take a quick look at your chart here... I see your height and weight are noted as 154 centimeters and 141 pounds. Do you have any known allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm…not that I know of. I don't really…react to anything. And medications…just, you know, normal stuff. For aches, maybe. Nothing regular. I forget what it's called. Medicare pays for it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and occasional medication for aches. That's helpful. Do you recall what you use it for specifically—like is it for joint pain, muscle soreness, or something else?
PATIENT: Uh…mostly my feet. They bother me sometimes. And my back. It's just…old age, I guess. It's a little white pill. I get it at the drugstore. Honestly, doctor, I don’t really keep track of these things. It helps the pain, that's all I know. Is this important for the nails?
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Ms. Thut, so thank you for letting me know. Some medications can affect nail health. To get a better understanding of what’s going on with your nails, would you mind if I take a closer look?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, sure. Whatever you need to do. Just…try to be quick, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm looking at your nails now. I do notice some thickening and a slightly yellowish discoloration, particularly on several nails. They also appear a bit brittle. Do you do anything specific to your hands—like gardening, cleaning, or use artificial nails frequently?
PATIENT: Artificial nails? Oh, no. Never. Too fancy. I…wash dishes, sometimes. And I do a little bit of dusting. Nothing much. Honestly, doctor, I don’t spend a lot of time on my hands. They just look funny, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not much in the way of hand treatments or exposure to harsh chemicals. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your nails or surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. A little itchy sometimes, maybe. But I just scratch it. It’s probably dry skin. I get dry skin all the time, especially in the winter. It’s nothing. Is this…serious? You're starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Thut. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. The itching is a good piece of information. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, this could potentially be a fungal infection of the nails, also known as onychomycosis. However, to confirm this, we'd need to do a simple test. It involves taking a small scraping from under the nail to look at under a microscope. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Fungus? Oh, dear. That sounds…bad. A scraping? Like…you’re gonna dig into my nails? That doesn't sound very nice. Is there any other way to tell? I really don’t like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Thut. It's a very minor procedure, and we take steps to minimize any discomfort. It does provide the most definitive answer. If you're truly uncomfortable with the scraping, we can consider a presumptive diagnosis of fungal infection based on the appearance of your nails, and proceed with treatment. However, it's important to know that without confirmation, we won't be certain if that's the correct cause. There are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. We could also consult with a dermatologist for a second opinion. They may have other diagnostic options available. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? That sounds…expensive. And a lot of waiting. Okay, fine. Do the scraping. But be gentle, alright? And quick. I don't want a big hole in my nail. What does the treatment involve, if it is fungus? Do I have to take pills? I hate taking pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut, I understand your concerns, and I will be as gentle as possible. We'll use a small instrument to carefully collect a tiny sample from under the nail. It shouldn't cause any significant discomfort, and it won't leave a large hole. As for treatment, if it is confirmed to be a fungal infection, there are a couple of options. Topical medications are available, but they often have limited effectiveness, especially for thicker nails. Oral medications are more effective, but as you mentioned, they do involve taking pills for a period of several months. There are potential side effects with oral medications that we would discuss thoroughly before starting treatment. We could also discuss laser treatment, which is a newer option, but it is not always covered by insurance. I'm going to start now. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. This will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, just get it over with. Be careful…I told you I don't like pills. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut, we're all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
