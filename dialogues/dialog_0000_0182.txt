DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, Doctor. It's about this... procedure. The one my daughter insisted I get checked out before going through with it. She worries too much, that one. Says I need "clearance." Honestly, a waste of time, but here I am.
DOCTOR: A procedure, yes. And what procedure would that be, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: It’s…well, it’s a bit of a lift. Face lift, to be precise. Getting a little saggy, you understand. Not thrilled about it, but apparently it’s…common at my age. My wife… well, she never needed any of this fuss. Good bone structure, she had. This generation, always something.
DOCTOR: Right. A facelift. And your daughter is concerned about your overall health before the surgery, which is… prudent, actually. I need to gather some information to determine if you are a suitable candidate. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, years ago. Doctor put me on something… a little pill, I think. Stopped taking it eventually, felt fine. Otherwise, no. Perfectly healthy for an eighty-one-year-old, thank you very much. Used to be a strong man, built like an ox, doing terrazzo work. Not much call for that kind of strength anymore, though. Don’t see the need to go through a list of things I don’t have.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Mr. Orwin, “feeling fine” isn’t a medical assessment. High blood pressure, even if it was in the past, is very relevant. And medication history is crucial. Do you remember the name of that pill?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. It was… a little white one. Small. Doctors always giving you pills these days. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. My daughter's the one who handles all that. She keeps a record. Ask her. This is ridiculous. I just want to know if I'm able to have this done, not recite my entire life story.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll have to get that information from your daughter. It's for your own safety, Mr. Orwin. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, latex… anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any allergies. Ate whatever was put in front of me, worked with all sorts of materials. Terrazzo dust, cement… didn’t bother me a bit. Tough as nails, that’s me. Honestly, this whole thing is a bit much, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's talk about your current medications, even if you believe you aren't on any. Do you take any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just a little fish oil. For the joints, you know? Getting a bit creaky in my old age. Otherwise, no. Nothing else. My daughter bought it for me. Says it's good for… well, everything, I suppose. Don't ask me the details. She's the health expert in the family.
DOCTOR: Fish oil… alright. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix, when I was a boy. Ages ago. And a hernia repair, maybe ten years back. A small one. Nothing major. Terrazzo work will do that to ya, lifting heavy things all day. Is this ever going to end?
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant conditions? Hmm… my mother had… well, she had a weak heart, I think. Died young. My father was strong as an ox, like me, lived to be ninety. That’s about it, really. Not much of a sickly family. Good genes, I suppose. This is all rather pointless, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Let's just cover a few more basics. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. My wife tried it once, hated it. Clean living, that’s what I always believed in. Kept me strong, it did. Now, are we done yet? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how much alcohol do you typically drink?
PATIENT: A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing excessive. Mostly water, actually. Good for the kidneys, you know. Are we still doing this? I thought you'd be examining me by now, not asking about my drinking habits.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. Let’s do a brief physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just generally assess your overall condition. Then we can discuss whether or not you are a suitable candidate for the facelift. Please sit back.
PATIENT: Finally. About time. Just get it over with. Don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Your heart sounds… a bit irregular, some mild murmuring. Lungs are clear. Skin elasticity is diminished, as expected for your age, and there’s some underlying muscle laxity. Overall, your general condition is… acceptable, but the irregular heartbeat and slightly elevated blood pressure need further investigation before proceeding with any elective surgery. I’m going to order an EKG and some basic blood work to get a clearer picture of your cardiovascular health.
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? Now you're just trying to make more work for yourself. Look, I’ve lived a long life. A little saggy skin isn’t going to kill me. I’m not sure I like where this is going. Is my daughter here? I want her to hear this. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, it’s not about “making more work for myself.” It's about ensuring your safety. Elective surgery carries risks, and it’s my ethical obligation to assess your fitness. I understand your frustration, but I cannot proceed without a proper evaluation. As for your daughter, I see she’s just arrived. Please, have her come in. Perhaps she can help clarify some of the medication information. It’s best if we all discuss this together.
PATIENT: Fine. Get her in here. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, a doctor's appointment should not take this long. She has all the answers anyway.
