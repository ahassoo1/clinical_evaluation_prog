DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. I don't have all day, so let's get right to it. I want a baby. And I want it to be… uncomplicated. I’m 51, not 80. I don’t want any… problems. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Quite clear, Ms. Shteynberg. While I understand your desire for a straightforward process, achieving a pregnancy at your age does present certain… complexities. Before we proceed, I need to gather a comprehensive medical history to assess your overall health and suitability for pregnancy. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, now we get to the negativity. Look, I’m perfectly healthy. I fix bicycles all day, you know? It’s physical work. High blood pressure? Please. Diabetes? I don’t eat sweets. And my heart is… fine. Divorced, not decrepit. Is that good enough? I really don’t have time to list every little thing. I’m strong. That's all you need to know.
DOCTOR: While physical activity is certainly beneficial, Ms. Shteynberg, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying medical conditions. A self-assessment isn’t sufficient for determining suitability for pregnancy. To clarify, have you ever been formally diagnosed with any medical condition by a physician?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Years ago… when I was married, actually. He insisted. They said I had… borderline hypertension. But it was stress, obviously! From him. They put me on a little pill for a while, but I stopped taking it as soon as I left him. It went away. Happy now? It was decades ago. Don't you have a machine to check these things? Or are we just going to sit here and interrogate me about my ex-husband?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Shteynberg. It's important to have a complete picture, even if the condition was resolved. We will be checking your current blood pressure, as well as performing other necessary tests. Now, let’s move on to surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… No. Nothing major. I had my wisdom teeth out when I was young. That’s it. And a mole removed, ages ago. Small thing. Really, I'm not a frequent visitor to hospitals. I prefer to fix things, not be fixed. Is that sufficient? Can we please move on? I have a very busy afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. And regarding family history, Ms. Shteynberg – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly? It’s a mess. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She didn’t talk about it much. And my father… he was a smoker. He died young. Lungs, obviously. Beyond that? I don’t keep track of everyone’s ailments. We weren’t a close family. Is that helpful? It's hardly a comprehensive medical record, is it?
DOCTOR: It provides some information, Ms. Shteynberg. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Do I look like someone who smokes? I told you, I fix bicycles all day. Do you think I’d ruin my lungs? As for alcohol… a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A very small glass. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I have standards. Really, are you trying to insult me? It's quite clear I lead a sensible life. Next?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. For general health. And sometimes ibuprofen for aches and pains, after a long day in the shop. That’s it. Honestly, doctor, I thought you were going to ask about my baby plans, not my entire life history. Is this all going somewhere, or are we just collecting data for a research project? I’m wasting precious time here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, a thorough medical evaluation is essential before considering pregnancy, particularly given your age. It’s not simply about collecting data; it’s about ensuring your safety and the potential health of the baby. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. This will include checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic abdominal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But I expect a clear explanation of everything you're doing. And I want results. Quickly. I don't have all day to sit here while you poke and prod. And please, no unnecessary questions. Just do your job.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll begin by checking your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is it serious? And don't just poke at me without explaining what you're doing. I'm not some… bicycle I can just be taken apart and put back together. Tell me what you find, in plain English. And hurry up. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, a murmur simply indicates turbulent blood flow. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but it warrants further investigation. That is why I am performing this examination. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to assess your overall health, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We will also need to perform a urine test. Additionally, given your age and the murmur, an EKG and an echocardiogram are advisable to evaluate your heart function more thoroughly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I'm allergic to incompetence, perhaps. And unnecessary tests! An EKG? An echocardiogram? Is this a normal procedure for someone who just wants a baby? This is getting ridiculous. I’m not some fragile old woman. I fix bicycles, remember? I don’t need to be poked and prodded like some… science experiment. Just tell me what’s wrong with me, and if it’s something I can fix. And stop suggesting I’m falling apart. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here. I expected a more… streamlined process. What’s the point of all this if it’s just going to lead to a list of things I can’t do? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration. However, these tests are not about suggesting you are "falling apart." They are about gathering essential information to ensure your safety and the potential health of any future pregnancy. A pregnancy at your age carries inherent risks, and it is my professional responsibility to mitigate those risks as much as possible. I will order the tests I mentioned - blood work, urine analysis, EKG, and echocardiogram. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I would strongly advise against attempting to conceive until we have a clearer understanding of your overall health status. Do you understand?
