DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, you understand. It’s been… a while now, and I thought it best to have someone take a look. I’m not entirely sure why it’s happening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verbos. There’s no need to be embarrassed; these things happen, and it’s always best to get them checked out. We’ll work through this together. To start, could you describe what you mean by “quite a lot”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s… difficult to say precisely. I suppose… more than, oh, every few hours. It feels like I’m constantly needing to go. Especially at night, which is… disruptive. I don’t recall ever having this problem before, not to this extent. Perhaps… three or four times a night? It’s vague, I apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Verbos, approximations are perfectly fine. Three or four times a night is certainly a significant change. And you mentioned it’s been going on for a “while now”—could you give me a rough estimate of how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Let me see… I believe it started… sometime after the spring, perhaps? So, maybe two or three months? It’s hard to pinpoint, you understand. Things tend to… blur together these days. I was traveling a bit then, and I suppose I didn't pay much attention until I returned home and noticed it was… persistent.
DOCTOR: I understand. Two to three months of increased frequency, especially disrupting your sleep, is certainly worth investigating. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. No, not really. The stream itself feels… normal, I suppose. Not weaker, not stronger. No pain or burning. Just… more of it, more often. And, now that I mention it, I have been feeling rather thirsty lately. I find myself drinking much more water than usual, which, I suppose, explains the increased bathroom trips. But it's a bit of a cycle, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a cycle, yes. Increased thirst and increased urination can often go hand-in-hand. And no pain or burning is good to know. Mr. Verbos, do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes… I don’t believe so. I’ve had the usual check-ups over the years, and nothing like that was ever mentioned. As for prostate issues… no, nothing diagnosed. I think I had a routine screening a few years back, and it was all clear, but… honestly, Doctor, I’m rather hazy on the details. My general practitioner retired, you see, and I haven’t established care with a new one yet. Things just… slipped through the cracks, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for details to get lost during transitions of care. We’ll do our best to get a clear picture today. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, perhaps ten or twelve years old. And… I believe I had a minor procedure on my knee a few years ago, a sort of… scope, I think they called it. Nothing major. Other than that… I don’t recall anything else. I was always quite healthy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed in childhood and a knee scope. Thank you. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That’s a good question. My father… he lived to a good age, thankfully, but I don’t recall him having any specific illnesses. My mother… she had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. And my sister… she’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. There wasn't much discussion of medical conditions within the family, to be honest. We weren't really the type to… dwell on such things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for what you can recall. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, absolutely not. I’ve never been a smoker. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps one or two times a week – but I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. And recreational drugs… good heavens, no! I’ve always lived a rather… temperate lifestyle, you might say. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Verbos. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any allergic reactions, thankfully. I’ve taken various medications over the years for minor ailments – the usual cold remedies, things like that – and never had any problems. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is that… is that all the questions? I feel rather thoroughly examined already!
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Verbos. Thank you for your patience. Just a few more, then we’ll move on to a physical exam. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, that's right. I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one. And… occasionally, when my joints are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. Nothing regularly, though. Perhaps once or twice a month. And that’s it, I believe. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Verbos. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and perform a neurological assessment. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I’m ready whenever you are. Though, if you don’t mind, perhaps you could explain what you’re doing as you go along? It helps to… calm my nerves a bit, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds, like murmurs or wheezing. This helps me assess the overall function of your cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Deep breaths… as you wish. I do hope I’m not breathing too heavily. It’s rather… a habit, I suppose. I always take a deep breath when I’m nervous, and this seems to be… a rather nervous occasion.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verbos. Deep breathing is perfectly normal. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen – that just means I'll feel it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. It’s… a bit sensitive, perhaps, but no sharp pain. Just… a general feeling of… fullness, I suppose. It’s often like that after dinner, to be honest. I do enjoy a good meal, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'm noting that your abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses are palpable. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function – that just involves testing your reflexes and checking your strength. I'll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll test your strength by asking you to squeeze my hands. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I’m quite willing to cooperate in any way I can. Though, if you don’t mind, perhaps you could explain what you’re looking for? It helps to… ease my mind a bit, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I’m checking your reflexes and strength to assess the function of your nerves and muscles. This helps me rule out any neurological causes for your symptoms. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes only?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I’m following it. There… there it goes. Up and down, and to the side… yes, I can see it clearly enough. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I can manage, I believe.
DOCTOR: Good. Your eye movements appear normal. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There you are, Doctor. I’m squeezing as tightly as I can. I used to have quite strong hands, you see, from gardening. But they’ve weakened a bit over the years, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Good. Your grip strength is slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mr. Verbos, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I believe your symptoms—increased urinary frequency, especially at night, and increased thirst—could be indicative of a few possibilities. One of the most common is benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is an enlargement of the prostate gland. It’s very common in men your age and can cause these symptoms. However, it's also important to rule out other possibilities, such as diabetes insipidus or even a urinary tract infection. To do that, I recommend we order some lab tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels, and a urinalysis to check for infection. We'll also want to check your prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, to assess your prostate health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. BPH, you say? I’ve heard of it, I believe. It’s… reassuring to know there’s a possible explanation. And yes, please, order the tests. I trust your judgment entirely. The more information, the better, I suppose. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if you understand. The constant trips to the bathroom are… rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Verbos. Disruptive is a good word for it. Alright, I’ll order those lab tests for you right away. The lab is located just down the hall, and you can go at your convenience. The nurse will give you the necessary paperwork. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or blood in your urine, please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate your thoroughness. The paperwork, you say? Very well. I’ll head down to the lab and take care of it. I suppose… this concludes our consultation for today?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verbos, this concludes our consultation for today. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to give you the paperwork and instructions. Thank you for coming in today. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for your time and attention. I feel… considerably better already, knowing there’s a plan in place. I wish you a good day as well. .
