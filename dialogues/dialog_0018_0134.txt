DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling poorly for a little while now. Not a sharp pain, just… unsettled. And I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It’s strange, really. I used to have a good appetite.
DOCTOR: I see. “Unsettled” and a decreased appetite… thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a hard one. Seems like… a few months, maybe? It wasn’t sudden, just… gradually getting worse. I think it was around the time I finished helping Old Man Tiber with his sheep shearing. That was… spring, I believe? Though the years all sort of blur together these days. I'm sorry, I don't have a good memory for dates.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. Spring is a good reference point. So, a gradual onset of these symptoms starting around springtime. And you mentioned helping Old Man Tiber with the sheep shearing – was that a particularly strenuous activity for you?
PATIENT: Oh, not particularly strenuous, no. I’ve been helping him for years. Mostly just keeping the sheep calm while he shears, talking to ‘em, you know? Animals respond to a gentle voice. Though… I do remember feeling a bit more tired than usual afterward. Just a little worn out, which isn’t uncommon, really. It’s the concentrating, I think. Keeping track of which sheep’s been done and which hasn’t. My mind doesn’t work like it used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. And you’ve noticed this fatigue alongside the stomach issues and decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. The tiredness… it comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, a bit slow maybe, but okay. Other days… I just want to lie down. It’s not a bad tired, like being sick, just… heavy. And it seems to be getting worse alongside this trouble with my stomach. It’s all a bit worrisome, to be honest. I haven’t been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Kelder, and it's good you came in to get this checked out. Now, could you describe this “unsettled” feeling in your stomach a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not really a pain, like a cramp or something. It’s more like… a queasiness, a feeling of fullness really quickly. Even if I only eat a little bit, like a few bites of toast, it feels like I’ve had a big meal. And sometimes, it just feels… hollow. Empty, but not in a hungry way. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, it feels the same.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Kelder. That’s very helpful. And you said it doesn’t matter what you eat. Have you noticed any particular foods that seem to make it worse, or any that are easier to tolerate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I mostly eat simple things these days. Soup, toast, eggs… things like that. I tried a little bit of fried chicken last week – Old Man Tiber brought some over – and it didn’t seem to bother me any more than usual. Which is to say, it didn't help, but it didn't make it worse. I’ve just sort of lost my appetite for much of anything, honestly. Everything seems… bland. It’s not the taste, exactly, just… unappealing.
DOCTOR: I see. A loss of appetite with a general feeling of fullness and discomfort regardless of what you eat. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no vomiting. Thankfully. Just… the queasiness, like I said. It’s not a sharp sickness, just a constant feeling of being… off. And sometimes, especially in the mornings, I feel a little… faint. Not enough to fall down, just a bit dizzy. It usually passes after I sit for a bit. But it's enough to make me nervous. I don't like feeling unsteady.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That’s very helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about things I don’t really like to talk about. Let me see… I suppose they’ve been a little… irregular. Not terribly so, but not like they used to be. More… frequent, maybe? And… well, looser. But not diarrhea, not exactly. Just… softer. I’m sorry, Doctor, I’m not very good at explaining these things. It’s all a bit embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Kelder. You're doing perfectly fine, and it's important to share all of this information so I can get a clear picture of what's going on. More frequent, looser stools, alongside the other symptoms you’ve described… Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. No, no blood. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, I think. I always check, you know? Just… common sense. No, thankfully, no blood. It’s just… well, everything’s a bit… off. Like my body isn’t working right. I hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I’m an old woman, but I still like to be independent. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder, and I assure you we will do our best to figure out what's going on. Now, let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… let me think. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. Must be… forty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, makes it hard to do some things. But that's been the same for a long time. And… oh, yes. I had some treatment for breast cancer a few years back. Radiation, I think it was. They said it was successful, but… I still go for checkups, of course. That’s why I mentioned it. It was a long time ago, though. I’m not sure if that has anything to do with this. Everything feels so mixed up.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Kelder. That's important to know. Past gallbladder removal, arthritis, and a history of breast cancer treated with radiation. And you still attend regular checkups for the breast cancer, that’s excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill, I think. And something for the arthritis, a yellow one. And… oh, yes. A baby aspirin every day, the doctor said it’s good for my heart. That’s about it, I think. I keep them in a little box on the kitchen counter. I try to remember to take them every day, but sometimes I forget. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? I'm sorry, I'm not very organized. I'm sure I'm forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. We can review everything thoroughly. So, medication for blood pressure, arthritis, and a daily baby aspirin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And it just hurt, it didn’t make me sick. No, I don’t have any allergies. I’m lucky that way, I suppose. Everything else seems to agree with me, or at least, it used to. This stomach trouble is new. It’s very worrying. I really do hope it’s nothing serious, Doctor. I'm a bit of a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Kelder. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be a very old woman, almost ninety. She was a strong woman, always worked hard. My father died when I was young, heart trouble, I think. And I had a sister, but she passed away a few years back. She had… I think it was diabetes. And… oh, yes. My grandmother on my mother’s side had something with her stomach, but I don’t remember what it was. It was a long time ago, and my mother didn’t talk about it much. I'm afraid I don't have a very good memory for these things, Doctor. Everything seems so far away.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That’s helpful to know. History of longevity in your mother, heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your sister, and a family history of stomach issues on your mother’s side. Now, can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history… Well, I was married for a long time, but my husband passed away about ten years ago. We didn’t have any children. I used to work with animals, training them mostly. Dogs, horses… I just loved being around them. I retired a few years back. Now I mostly just keep to myself, tending to my garden and visiting with Old Man Tiber. He’s a good friend, always needs help with his sheep. I don’t get out much anymore, but I’m not lonely. I have my animals, and I have my memories. It’s a quiet life, but it’s a good life. I used to smoke a bit when I was younger, but I quit about forty years ago. Never really drank much, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. That’s about it, I think. A simple life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That gives me a good understanding of your background. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m an old woman, you know, things don’t work like they used to. But I’ll do my best to cooperate. Just take your time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness during the abdominal exam. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Your pulse, temperature and respiration are all normal. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's move on to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Does this cause you any discomfort, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Just a little. Right… about there. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tender. Like a dull ache. It’s been like that for a little while now, I think. I just assumed it was my age. But it’s good you’re checking, Doctor. It’s good to know what’s going on. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just when you press on it. It’s… unsettling. Like something isn’t quite right.
DOCTOR: I see. Tenderness in the upper right quadrant. No rebound tenderness, which is good. It sounds like there may be some sensitivity in the area. Given your history of gallbladder removal and the tenderness here, we'll want to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and liver function tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I don’t mind a little poke, as long as it helps figure out what’s going on. I just want to know what’s wrong, and how to fix it. Liver function tests, you said? Is that… serious? I'm not sure I understand. Is it something to do with my gallbladder? I'm sorry, I'm just a bit worried now. I get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Ms. Kelder. It’s good you’re expressing your concerns. Liver function tests will help us assess the health of your liver and gallbladder. While the tenderness could be related to prior gallbladder removal, it’s important to rule out other potential causes of abdominal discomfort, such as inflammation or blockage. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s best to investigate to be sure. We’ll also check your complete blood count to look for signs of infection or anemia, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney function and electrolytes. It’s a standard set of tests, and it will give us a good baseline to work from. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Oh, I see… So it’s just to be thorough, to make sure everything is alright. That makes sense. No, I don’t think I have any questions. You’ve explained it very clearly, Doctor. A complete blood count… and the metabolic panel… and the liver function tests. Just to see what’s going on. Alright. And how do I go about getting these tests done? Do I need to make an appointment somewhere? And… will they be able to tell me the results quickly? I just want to know what’s going on, and I don’t like to wait. I'm a bit of a worrier, you see. Old age makes you anxious about these things, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Kelder. We’ll get this moving as quickly as possible. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. I’ll send an order electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. They’ll draw some blood, and it usually takes a few hours to get the results back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. Here’s the form. Please take this with you to the lab. Do you need assistance getting there?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I think I can manage, yes. It’s just down the hall, you said? I’m not very good with directions, but I’m sure I can find it. And the nurse will call me with the results… That’s good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking before the tests? I just want to be prepared. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. Old age makes you ask a lot of questions, you see.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It's my pleasure. For the tests, it's best to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks other than water. That will ensure the most accurate results. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and getting some rest. And if your abdominal pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever or nausea, please call us immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything. Fast for eight hours, drink plenty of fluids, and rest. And call if anything gets worse. I’ve got it. Thank you so much, Doctor Stilaire. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I feel much better now that I know what’s going on, and what to do. I really appreciate your patience with an old woman like me. I think I’ll go and get those tests done now. Thank you again. And… have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And you have a good day as well.
