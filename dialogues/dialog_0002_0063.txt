DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back… it hurts really bad. It’s been hurting for a little while, but now… now I can’t do much. It’s hard to even get up from a chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain that's gotten worse and is now making it difficult to get around – that sounds really frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp pain all the time. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, and sometimes… sometimes it feels like something is stuck. And it goes down my leg a little bit, you know? Not all the way to my foot, but down the back of my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that sometimes feels stuck, and it radiates down the back of your leg… that gives me a better idea. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about three months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little sore after I’d been working. But it’s been getting worse every week, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, starting with soreness after work and gradually worsening. What kind of work do you do, Larin?
PATIENT: I work at the fish place. The one down by the water. We clean and pack the fish. Lots of bending and standing. It's… it's not easy work, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, that sounds physically demanding. Lots of bending and standing can definitely put a strain on your back. And when you’re bending and standing, where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It's mostly in my lower back. Right across here. But like I said, it goes down my leg sometimes, too. It’s not always in my leg, but when it is, it feels… kind of tingly. Not numb, just tingly.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain that radiates down your leg with some tingling – that’s helpful. Does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, lots of things. Bending, like when I’m picking up things. And standing for too long. And… sitting for too long, too! It's hard to get comfortable. And… sometimes, even coughing makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending, standing, sitting, and even coughing aggravate the pain. Are there any positions or activities that make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… laying down, usually. If I lay flat on my back, it feels a little better. And… sometimes if I walk a little bit, it loosens up. But not for long. Just for a little while. And… warm water. A warm shower helps a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat and warm water seem to provide some relief. Have you tried anything else to manage the pain – like over-the-counter medications, or any stretching or exercises?
PATIENT: I’ve taken some of those pain pills. You know, the ones you get at the store. They help a little, but not enough to really do anything. And… my daughter tried to show me some stretches, but… they hurt too much to do. I didn’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over-the-counter pain medication offers limited relief, and stretches were too painful. Have you had any problems with your back before, like injuries or previous pain episodes?
PATIENT: Yes… um… a few years ago, I had a bad fall. I was carrying something heavy and tripped. I had to go to the hospital then. They said… they said something about a disc. I don't really remember all the details. And… I also have… cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous fall with a disc issue and a history of cancer. That's important information. I'm sorry to hear about the cancer, Larin. Can you tell me a little more about the cancer?
PATIENT: It's in my lung. They found it… about two years ago, I think. I've been getting… treatments. They said it's… not going away completely. We're just trying to keep it under control. That's why I'm worried about this back pain, you know? I don’t want it to be… something else, too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Larin. It's completely reasonable to be worried, especially with your history of lung cancer. We need to figure out what's going on with your back. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think will help. I just want to know what’s happening. And if it’s something… bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you don’t mind, please lie down on your back for me. I'm going to gently feel along your spine and check your range of motion. I’ll also do a few simple tests to see how your nerves are functioning. Just let me know if anything causes you pain, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. It might be a little hard to get comfortable. But I'll try. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm just feeling along your spine. Can you tell me where it hurts the most when I press here?
PATIENT: Right there. And… it feels kind of sore all around there, too. But that spot… that’s the worst. It feels… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation at that spot, and tightness noted. Okay, I'm just going to have you bend forward for me, as far as you can comfortably go. And then I’ll have you bend backward. Just let me know if you feel any pain. Okay, a little discomfort with forward bending. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs.
PATIENT: Okay… That… that hurts a little. But I can do it. It’s just… tight. And… I feel a little bit of that tingling feeling when I bend.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling with forward bending noted. Okay, I’m going to lift your leg up like this, keeping it straight. Just let me know if you feel any pain shooting down your leg. Okay, pain radiating down your right leg at 30 degrees. That’s helpful. Okay, Larin, based on the physical exam, you have tenderness in your lower back, limited range of motion, pain with forward bending, and pain radiating down your right leg with the straight leg raise test. These findings suggest possible nerve compression, potentially related to a disc issue. However, given your history of lung cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities. I want to get some imaging done – an MRI of your lower back – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: An MRI… yes, that sounds okay. If that’s what you think is best. Will it show… if the cancer has spread? That’s what I’m most worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Larin. The MRI can help us see if there's any involvement of the bones in your spine, which would give us information about potential spread. However, it's not always definitive, and we might need additional tests depending on the results. We'll also need to discuss those results with your oncologist. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain. I also recommend gentle stretching and walking, as tolerated. I'll also write you a referral to a physical therapist who can teach you exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles. Would you like me to write a work note excusing you from heavy lifting or strenuous activity?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A work note would be good. I can't do much right now, anyway. And… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for trying to figure out what’s happening. It helps to… to know someone is trying to help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Larin. I’m glad I can help, and you're right, we’ll work together to figure this out. Okay, I have here a prescription for a muscle relaxant – cyclobenzaprine – and an anti-inflammatory – ibuprofen. Take them as directed on the label. And here’s a work note excusing you from heavy lifting and strenuous activity for two weeks. I'm also sending a referral to physical therapy. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… when will I hear about the MRI? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just… I want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand. The MRI scheduling department will contact you within the next couple of business days to set up an appointment. Typically, it takes about a week to get the results back from the radiologist. Once I have them, I will contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan. I’ll also coordinate with your oncologist to ensure a comprehensive approach. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any new symptoms like weakness or numbness in your legs or bowel or bladder problems, please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. You've been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. Goodbye.
