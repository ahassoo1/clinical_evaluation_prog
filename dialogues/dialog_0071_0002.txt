DOCTOR: Hello, Zoie. Good to meet you. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…well, it’s my waterworks, you see. They’re not working so good anymore. It’s hard to… push it out. Does that make sense? It’s just… stuck, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Zoie. So, difficulty with urination. Hmm. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long has it been? Everything is a bit blurry these days. Maybe… a few months? It comes and goes. Some days it’s okay, some days I have to… really try. My husband, he says I take a long time in the bathroom now. He worries.
DOCTOR: A few months, alright. And it varies… some days better than others. It's good your husband is paying attention. Okay. And when you do manage to go, is it a full stream, or does it feel like it stops and starts?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It… stops and starts, I think. Not a strong push, you see? More like… dribbles. And I have to go a lot, even if I don't feel like I’ve gotten everything out. Does that make sense? It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Zoie. Stopping and starting, a weaker stream, and feeling like you’re not emptying completely. Okay. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, no. More like a… discomfort. A little ache sometimes, afterwards. But no burning. It’s just… tiring, you know? All that trying.
DOCTOR: Tiring, yes, I can imagine. Okay, no burning, just a discomfort afterwards. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, goodness. I don’t really look, you know? My husband usually… notices things. I don't think so, though. It looks like…water, usually. Maybe a little cloudy sometimes? But I wouldn't know for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, possibly a little cloudy sometimes. Okay. And just to get a broader picture, have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or lower back pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I know of. I don't usually get fevers. Chills… not lately. Lower back pain… oh, yes! My back always aches, but that’s just… old age, you see. It’s always a bit sore. Not anything new.
DOCTOR: Alright, the back pain is ongoing. Okay, Zoie. Now, I'm going to do a quick examination, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to make it too uncomfortable, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Zoie. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then gently press on your lower belly. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let’s listen… Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m going to gently press… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a little tender right there. Yes. Not painful, exactly, but… a little uncomfortable. Just there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness there. That’s helpful to know. And I don't feel any obvious masses or anything concerning. Now, I’m going to check your vital signs, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 85, and your pulse is 78, regular. Now, I'd like to do a quick urine test, just to check for infection or anything else that might be causing your symptoms. Can you please provide a sample?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. A urine test sounds sensible. I'll go now. Is there a bathroom nearby? And… is there a special cup or something I should use?
DOCTOR: Just down the hall to your right, Zoie. There’s a clean collection cup in the bathroom, and instructions as well. Take your time, and let me know when you're finished. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Here you are. Now, let’s get this sent to the lab… Okay. We'll have the results back within a few hours. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention and possibly a mild urinary tract infection. It's common at your age, Zoie. We need to rule out anything more serious, but it's likely we can manage this with some medication. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a medicine? Well, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m just glad we’re trying to find out what’s wrong. Is it a bad infection? Should my husband be worried?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t believe it’s a bad infection at this stage, Zoie. That’s why we’re doing the test, to confirm and get the right medication if needed. It’s good your husband is concerned, but I don’t think there’s cause for panic. We’ll get this sorted out. I'm going to prescribe a short course of antibiotics, just in case. We’ll also want to make sure you’re drinking plenty of fluids – at least six to eight glasses of water a day. And, I recommend you try to empty your bladder completely each time, even if it takes a little longer. Do you have any trouble getting to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. I can get there alright, slowly, you know. But sometimes… I just feel like I haven’t quite finished, even when I think I have. It’s just a little… lingering, if that makes sense. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Zoie. That lingering feeling is common with retention. We can talk about some techniques to help with that—something called "double voiding", where you try to go again a few minutes after you think you're finished. I'm also going to write a referral for a pelvic floor physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen those muscles and help with bladder control. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical therapist? I’ve never been to one of those before. What would they do? Will it hurt? I'm a bit wary of strangers touching me, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Zoie. It’s a very common concern. A pelvic floor physical therapist specializes in the muscles of the pelvis, and they can help with bladder control and other issues like yours. They won't be doing anything invasive or painful. It involves gentle exercises, both internal and external, to strengthen those muscles. You’ll be fully clothed for most of it. They're very gentle and respectful, and you’re in complete control. You can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. It's often very helpful, but it’s completely up to you. No pressure at all. We can also discuss medication options if you’re not comfortable with physical therapy. Would you like me to explain those now?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it sounds a bit… complicated. And strangers…well. Perhaps… perhaps let's start with the medicine, Doctor. If that doesn't work, we can talk about the… exercises later. Just the medicine for now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie, that’s perfectly fine. We’ll start with the medication. I'm going to prescribe a short course of Nitrofurantoin, it's a common antibiotic for UTIs. Take it exactly as directed, even if you start to feel better before it’s finished. Here’s your prescription. Take this to your local pharmacy. And please, if your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they get worse, give my office a call immediately. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before you take this medication?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? Hmm. I don’t think so, dear. Nothing I’ve ever noticed. My husband does all the medicine remembering for me, you see. I just… take what he gives me. He’s very good about things like that. But… no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. I’m going to give you some written instructions on how to take the medication, as well as some information on common side effects. Please read through this carefully. And remember, drink plenty of fluids, and try to empty your bladder completely each time. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time with me. My waterworks are very grateful. I suppose… I should be going then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Zoie. I’m glad I could help. And yes, you should be going now. Just take care of yourself, drink lots of water, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. I'll see you back in a week to check on your progress. Have a good day, Zoie.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
