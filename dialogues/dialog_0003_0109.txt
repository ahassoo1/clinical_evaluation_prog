DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s try to be efficient, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Brum is my name, yes. Ninety years old, can you believe it? Though I feel… mostly okay, most days. Except this headache.
DOCTOR: Ninety is… considerable. A headache, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a headache. Back of my head, mostly. It started… oh, maybe three days ago? Not a bad one at first, just… there. But yesterday it got worse. Like a… a tight band. I tried some water, but didn’t help much.
DOCTOR: Three days. And you describe it as a band… I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this headache, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don’t think. No blurry vision. I eat okay, though not as much as before. Maybe a little tired, but I am ninety, you know? Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy when I stand up fast, but that happens sometimes anyway. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are symptoms, Mr. Brum. Let's clarify: is this dizziness consistent, or only when you change positions?
PATIENT: Only when I change positions, Doctor. Like… if I been sitting a while and then stand up. Whoosh. Just for a second. Not all the time, thankfully. I don't like falling, you know. I used to work around the trains… a man needs good balance for that work!
DOCTOR: Trains, very good. And no nausea or vomiting accompanying this headache at all?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Nothing coming up. Just the headache and the little… wobble when I stand. And the tiredness, but like I said, old age. My wife, she used to say I was always a little tired. She passed, oh, ten years ago now. Good woman. This headache... it’s just new.
DOCTOR: Very well. I see. Now, Mr. Brum, have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Doctor said my blood pressure was a little high, a long time ago. I took some pills for it, for a few years. But he said it was okay after that. And my knees… they bother me in the cold weather. But that’s just old age, too, I think. Nothing serious, never needed surgery or anything. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure… and knee discomfort. Any surgeries, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not a one. I always tried to be careful, you know? Working with the trains… a man has to be. We fixed things ourselves, mostly. Not much time for doctors back then, and not much money either. This headache is the first thing that’s really… bothered me. It just won't go away.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees when it’s cold. Something my daughter gave me. Can’t remember the name, it's in a little orange bottle. And sometimes I take a little something for sleeping, when I can’t sleep. But not every night. Nothing else, I promise you. Mostly just water and trying to rest. This headache… it feels different than anything I’ve had before.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let's conduct a brief physical examination, Mr. Brum. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and neurological function. If you would please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’ll sit. Though I’m not so good at climbing up on those things anymore… maybe you could help me? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Please, Mr. Brum. Let's begin with your blood pressure. 148 over 82. Slightly elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can follow your finger. I used to have very good eyesight, working with the trains. Everything has to be very clear, you know? Not so good now, but I can still see your finger okay. I hope it’s not too shaky? I sometimes get a little tremor, when I’m tired.
DOCTOR: A slight tremor is noted, yes. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. Can you smile for me, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? It’s a little hard, my face feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s not working right. But I can smile, I think. My wife used to say I had a very nice smile. She’s gone now, ten years. This headache is just… worrying me. I never used to worry about things.
DOCTOR: Facial symmetry appears slightly diminished on the left side. Now, Mr. Brum, I'd like to perform a quick neurological assessment. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? Is that enough? My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be, working with the trains… lots of gripping and pulling. Not as strong, but still work okay. This headache is making me feel… confused sometimes. I forget things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your age and symptoms, including the headache, slight facial weakness, and reported confusion, I believe a CT scan of the head is warranted to rule out any acute intracranial process. Additionally, I will order a complete blood count and basic metabolic panel. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… a scan? And blood tests? I don't know… I don’t like scans. And needles… I don’t do well with needles. What… what are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just want to feel better. This headache… it scares me. I don’t understand… a CT scan? What does that do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, a CT scan is an imaging test that allows us to visualize the structures inside your head. It’s a standard procedure. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health. It’s a precaution. We need to rule out anything serious. Now, do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast… dye? I… I don't know about dye. Nobody ever asked me about dye. I just want to know if it will hurt? And… will it make the headache worse? I’ve never had a scan before. What if you find something bad? My wife… she always took care of these things. I don’t know what to do. Is there another way? Maybe some medicine? I don’t like the sound of dye… or scans.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, I understand your apprehension. However, given your symptoms, proceeding with the CT scan is the most responsible course of action. The dye is administered intravenously and can cause a brief warming sensation. As for alternatives… without knowing the cause of your headache, prescribing medication without imaging is not advisable. We need to determine if there is a more serious underlying cause. Now, do you have a designated emergency contact?
PATIENT: Emergency… contact? My daughter, Maria. She lives in the city. But she's busy, you know? She has a family… a job. I don’t want to bother her. But… yes, Maria. Her number is 555-123-4567. But… will this scan be very expensive? I don't have much money. And… what if you find something bad? What happens then? This headache is just… I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I've documented your emergency contact. Regarding cost, I’m unaware of the exact charges, but our billing department can assist you. As for what happens if we find something… we will discuss treatment options and refer you to the appropriate specialist. Now, I'm going to write the orders for the CT scan and blood work. A nurse will come to escort you to radiology and phlebotomy. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Scan… and blood. And a nurse will help me? That’s… good. I just hope it doesn’t hurt too much. And I hope it’s not… bad news. My wife… she always said I was a strong man. I want to be strong now, for her. But this headache… it makes me feel so weak. .
