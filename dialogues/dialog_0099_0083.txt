DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Good to see you too. Well, it's… a little thing. Not a big thing, you understand. I just... I was hoping you could write me a card.
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes. A “Get Well” card, or… one of those “Encouragement” cards. My niece, she… she’s been a little down, you see. Not sick sick, but… just low spirits. A little note from the doctor, that’s all. It would mean a lot to her. People listen to doctors, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this clinic is for medical concerns. I’m a physician, not… a motivational speaker. While I appreciate your concern for your niece, I'm not sure writing a card falls within my professional capacity. Is there anything else bothering you today?
PATIENT: Now hold on a minute, Doctor. I have Medicare! Medicare pays for all sorts of things these days. And a little encouragement, that’s… that’s preventative medicine, isn’t it? Keeping spirits up… prevents things. You see? I read it in a pamphlet somewhere. Besides, it wouldn’t take long. Just a quick note. A few words.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all respect, Medicare coverage has specific guidelines. “Preventative medicine” refers to screenings and vaccinations, not… emotional support letters. And frankly, spending clinic time on non-medical requests is not… efficient. Are you experiencing any actual health problems?
PATIENT: Health problems? Well… not right now. But… being worried about my niece, that is a problem! It gives me indigestion, you know. And… and I haven’t been sleeping as well. Worry does things to a man, Doctor. Things! A little card… it would solve everything. It really would. It’s… it’s a small thing to ask, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Indigestion and sleep disturbances… those could be related to a number of factors. Before we consider writing a card – which, I reiterate, is not a standard medical practice – let’s explore those symptoms. When did the indigestion start?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… it started around the time my niece told me she wasn’t going to… well, she wasn’t going to marry that fella. A perfectly good young man, a mechanic, but… she said he didn’t “understand her artistic vision.” Artistic vision! What does that even mean? That's when the indigestion started, I think. And the sleepless nights followed shortly after. It’s a terrible shame, a terrible shame.
DOCTOR: So, the indigestion and sleep disturbance seem to be correlated with your niece’s relationship issues. Alright. And how would you describe the indigestion?
PATIENT: It’s… a burning. A burning in my stomach, you see? Especially after dinner. And sometimes… sometimes it goes up into my chest. Like a… a fire. And I try those little antacid tablets, the pink ones, but they don’t seem to do much good anymore. They used to work, but now… now it's just a constant discomfort. A nagging feeling.
DOCTOR: A burning sensation in your stomach and chest, especially after meals, with limited relief from antacids… that sounds like possible GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease. We'll need to rule out anything more serious, of course. Have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, unintended weight loss, or vomiting?
PATIENT: GERD? What’s that? Sounds… complicated. No, no vomiting. And my weight… well, I haven’t been stepping on the scale much lately. But I’m eating regular, I can tell you that. I like my arroz con gandules, you know? Good Puerto Rican cooking. And… no trouble swallowing. Just… that burning. And the worry. Don’t forget the worry, Doctor. It's eating me alive! Still… a card would really help.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, we are addressing your health concerns, not your niece’s emotional state. While I sympathize, prescribing a “card” is not a medical intervention. GERD is a common condition, caused by stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus. We can try some lifestyle modifications – avoiding spicy foods, eating smaller meals, and staying upright after eating – and perhaps a medication if those don’t help. But focusing on writing a letter won't resolve the underlying issue. Now, are you taking any other medications currently?
PATIENT: Other medications… let me think. Just the blood pressure pills. The little white ones. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take those ibuprofen. But not every day. Only when it really hurts. The arthritis in my hands, you know. Makes it hard to hold my coffee sometimes. And… the blood pressure pills. That’s about it. But still… a little card… just a few words of encouragement… it might lower my blood pressure! See? It's preventative medicine!
DOCTOR: Alright, let me check your EHR… You’re on lisinopril for hypertension, as you said. And ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. I see no other relevant medical history. Mr. Kammer, I understand your concern for your niece, but I am not going to write a “get well” card. However, we can address your indigestion, sleeplessness, and potentially your arthritis. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes for your symptoms. We can also discuss some dietary changes and potential medication options for your GERD. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work… that sounds… invasive. And dietary changes? I like my food, Doctor! But… if it means getting to the bottom of this burning… alright. Alright, I suppose. But… you won’t consider just a tiny note? Just saying “get well soon” or something? A doctor’s signature… it carries weight! But the blood work… and the diet… alright. Fine. But if my niece gets any worse…
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, we will proceed with the blood work and discuss your diet. That is the appropriate course of action. We’ll address your concerns as best we can, medically. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to review the results. I understand you’re worried about your niece, but I can assure you focusing on your own health is the best thing you can do at this time. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not. Just… make sure they're gentle with the needle. And… thank you, Doctor. Even if you won’t write the card. But… you really should consider it. A doctor's words… they matter. Alright. Let’s get the blood work over with then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. And Mr. Kammer… please try to focus on taking care of yourself. That's the most important thing. .
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ll try. Thank you again. .
