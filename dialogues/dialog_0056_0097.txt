DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome. I’m Dr. Amussen. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. My husband suggested I come. He believes I should have… one of those documents prepared. You know, in case something were to happen. An advance directive, I believe he called it. He worries excessively, naturally. But I suppose it is best to be… prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly reasonable, Marija. It's very proactive of both of you. An advance directive, also known as a living will, is a great idea. It outlines your wishes for medical care if you're unable to speak for yourself. Before we get started on that, though, are you currently experiencing any health concerns or have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell? No, Doctor, not at all. I am perfectly healthy, thank you. It's simply a matter of… foresight. My husband, bless him, has a rather vivid imagination. It’s not me who requires medical attention, it is simply this… paperwork he insists upon. I assure you, I maintain an excellent constitution. I have never needed to bother a doctor in my life, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Even with good health, it’s still wise to consider these things. Just to be thorough, and to fulfill the requirements for the document, I do need to ask a few standard questions. It's part of the process. Would you mind if I ask about your medical history – past illnesses, surgeries, family health issues, things like that?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Must we? I find it quite… intrusive, frankly. My medical history is a private matter, and quite frankly, rather boring. I've simply had the usual childhood ailments, nothing of consequence. And family history… well, my mother lived to a ripe old age, and my father was a strong, healthy man. There are no dramatic illnesses or predispositions to worry about. It seems a complete waste of time, but if you insist, I suppose I can indulge you. Though I fail to see the relevance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Marija. You're right, it might seem unnecessary given your good health, but it’s a standard part of building a complete picture. It helps us understand any potential risks or factors that might be relevant down the line. Let’s start with past illnesses. You mentioned childhood ailments – can you recall any specific ones?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it was a very long time ago. Measles, I suppose. Mumps. Perhaps chickenpox. The usual things all children get. Nothing serious, I assure you. I recovered quickly from everything. I was always a very robust child. We didn't have the… fuss they make about things nowadays. A bit of bed rest, some orange juice, and one was right as rain. Really, I don’t believe it’s relevant. But if you must have details, I recall a rather nasty case of scarlet fever when I was seven. Though it was easily treated, even then.
DOCTOR: Okay, scarlet fever… that's helpful to know. Did it cause any lasting effects that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Lasting effects? Good heavens, no! I am standing here, aren’t I? Perfectly healthy. I have no heart murmur, no joint pain, no lingering complications whatsoever. It was a childhood illness, Doctor, not a life-altering trauma. I find your line of questioning rather… unnecessary. Are we getting anywhere with this… paperwork, or are we simply to catalogue my childhood medical history indefinitely?
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Marija. I apologize if my questions seem excessive. I am simply trying to be thorough, and I understand your frustration. Let’s move on, then. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than childhood illnesses?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have never required a hospital stay, nor have I ever undergone any surgical procedures. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I am very careful. I eat well, I exercise moderately, and I avoid unnecessary risks. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect this entire exercise is rather pointless. But very well, I will indulge your persistence. Are we approaching the actual document now? Or are there further interrogations to come?
DOCTOR: We are getting closer. Just a few more questions, and then we can focus on the advance directive itself. Let's talk about your family health history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother passed away five years ago, peacefully in her sleep, thank goodness. My father… he succumbed to a heart attack ten years prior. A sudden thing, really. He was a strong man, as I mentioned, but these things happen, I suppose. He smoked, you see. A regrettable habit, but he enjoyed it. Otherwise, his health was quite robust. No history of anything… significant. No cancers, no neurological disorders, nothing of that sort. A fairly unremarkable family history, truthfully. Are we finally progressing?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Heart attack in your father...and your mother passed peacefully. Do you know if either of your parents had any chronic health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I was a teenager when my parents passed. I was hardly concerned with their… cholesterol levels, or blood pressure. I knew they were generally healthy. My mother had arthritis, in her later years, but it was a common ailment. And my father… he was a bit overweight, perhaps, but he led a full life. I sincerely doubt that details regarding their… chronic conditions are relevant to this document. But if you insist, I believe my mother may have mentioned high blood pressure at some point, but it was never properly diagnosed or treated. She disliked doctors, you see. A trait I seem to have inherited. Are we nearing the end of this… inquisition?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the extensive questions, Marija. I understand your frustration and your dislike of dwelling on medical details. The reason I ask these questions is to build a complete picture of your overall health, and to help us understand any potential risks or factors that might be relevant should you ever become unable to communicate your wishes. It's about being prepared, as you mentioned. Let's move on to a different area. To be thorough, I need to ask about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, Doctor! Is that really necessary? I find your line of questioning increasingly… impertinent. I should think my appearance alone should answer that question. I maintain a respectable lifestyle, thank you very much. I do not smoke. I may enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but hardly enough to warrant an interrogation. And the very suggestion that I partake in… recreational drugs is frankly, appalling. I am a woman of dignity and refinement, not some… common criminal. This is becoming quite absurd, Doctor. Are we going to discuss my personal habits now? Perhaps my choice of reading material? I believe I’ve indulged your curiosity sufficiently. Let us proceed with the document, if you please. I am wasting a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. I apologize for pushing further. It appears I was being unnecessarily intrusive. I assure you, it was not my intention to offend or upset you. Let’s focus on the advance directive itself, as you requested. It outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to make decisions for yourself. Before we begin, do you have any specific wishes you'd like to document, such as preferences for life-sustaining treatments, pain management, or end-of-life care?
PATIENT: Yes. Finally. My husband and I discussed this briefly. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially. Prolonging life at all costs is not my preference. If there is no hope of recovery, I would prefer a peaceful… cessation. And I do not wish to be subjected to any… heroic measures. Keep it simple. Dignified. No prolonged suffering. And no unnecessary interventions. I trust my husband to make sensible decisions, of course, but I would prefer it to be documented. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Or will there be further… questioning?
DOCTOR: That’s very clear, Marija. We’ll document your wishes regarding no life-sustaining treatment if there's no hope of recovery and a preference for a peaceful passing. We’ll also note your trust in your husband to make decisions. I have a standard form here that outlines these choices. I’ll read through it with you section by section, and we can make any necessary adjustments. It includes sections on things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that will do. Read it through, if you must. But I assure you, my wishes are quite straightforward. I simply do not wish to be kept alive by machines. A dignified exit is all I ask. Please, let us proceed with efficiency. I have appointments to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: “This Advance Directive outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment in the event you are unable to communicate them yourself. The first section addresses resuscitation. It asks whether you wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, if your heart or breathing stops. Do you wish to be resuscitated, or do you wish to allow natural death?
PATIENT: Allow natural death, naturally. I've already stated my position quite clearly, Doctor. There is no need to prolong this unnecessarily. Please, let us move on. I find this… repetitive questioning rather distressing. Are we documenting my wishes, or simply reiterating them ad nauseam?
DOCTOR: You are right, Marija. I apologize for the repetition. I am just ensuring I document everything accurately. So, we’ve noted your wish to allow natural death. The next section concerns mechanical ventilation. It asks whether you wish to receive breathing assistance from a machine if you are unable to breathe on your own. Do you wish to receive mechanical ventilation, or do you prefer to allow natural death in that situation as well?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly! Is this some sort of test? I have repeatedly stated my wishes. If there is no hope of recovery, I wish to be allowed to pass peacefully. No machines, no interventions, no prolonged suffering. Allow natural death. Is that sufficiently clear? I fail to understand why you continue to ask the same question in different formulations. It is frankly, insulting. I have wasted enough of my afternoon on this… charade. Let us conclude this, if you please.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. I sincerely apologize. I allowed my own procedural approach to overshadow your clear wishes. It was unprofessional of me, and I deeply regret causing you frustration. I have documented your wishes regarding allowing natural death, with no life-sustaining treatment or mechanical ventilation if there's no hope of recovery. I will ensure this document is properly witnessed and stored with your medical records. I have a copy here for you to review and keep. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. This will suffice. And Doctor… perhaps in the future, you could consider listening to your patients, rather than simply following a checklist. It would save everyone a great deal of time and… aggravation. Good afternoon.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right. I will certainly strive to be a more attentive listener in the future. Thank you for your candid feedback. Have a good afternoon, Marija. And please, don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
