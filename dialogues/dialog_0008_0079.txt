DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I’m Dr. Cumper. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's... well, I'm bruising really easily lately. And I'm on one of those blood thinner meds, so it's a bit worrying, you know? I just want to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern, especially being on a blood thinner. Bruising easily is definitely something we want to look into. Let’s start with some details about this. When did you first notice you were bruising more easily than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... probably about a month ago? Maybe six weeks? It wasn't huge at first, just little bumps and things after I bumped into furniture. But it's gotten worse the last couple of weeks. Like, I'll just look at something and a bruise will pop up. It's a little ridiculous, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month to six weeks, and progressively worsening. That’s helpful. And you said it happens with minor bumps, or sometimes even without a noticeable injury?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like yesterday, I was just reaching for a can of soup in the cupboard and noticed a big purple spot on my arm. I don’t remember hitting anything. And the bruises are… bigger than they used to be, even for small bumps. They stick around longer too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned you're on a blood thinner… which one are you taking, and how long have you been on it?
PATIENT: It's... Warfarin, I think? Yeah, Warfarin. And I started it about... eight months ago? The doctor put me on it after I had a blood clot in my leg. I've been pretty good about taking it every night, same time, same dose. I think I have. I haven’t missed any, not that I remember. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important. Consistent dosing with Warfarin is key. Let's talk about that a bit later. First, besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No, not really. I've been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I work long hours, so I just figured it was that. No bleeding gums or anything, no nosebleeds, no weird aches… just the bruising and the tiredness. Nothing else that I’ve noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other signs of bleeding, just bruising and fatigue. Have you had any recent infections – like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing recent. Had a little sniffle a couple of months back, but it didn't last long, just a regular cold. Nothing major, and it's gone now. I try to stay healthy, you know? I don't want to get sick on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I had a blood clot in my leg last year, that's why I'm on the Warfarin. Before that... I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned it a few years ago, but it's usually okay with diet and exercise. I don’t really take anything for it. Nothing else that I can think of. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a blood clot leading to Warfarin use, and previously diagnosed high blood pressure. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think... Yes! I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. That was... a long time ago. And… no, that's it. Nothing else. I try to avoid the doctor if I can, honestly. Not a big fan. Is this taking long? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Not too long, Ms. Hainley. Just trying to get a clear picture. Appendix removal, good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay. My mom had… diabetes, I think? And her mom had heart problems. My dad was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. And my brother... he has asthma. Nothing else that I’m aware of. Honestly, we don’t talk about medical stuff much in my family. It’s just not something we do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, heart problems, and asthma. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh! I take a multivitamin sometimes. Just when I remember. And… I've been trying this turmeric supplement for my joints. My cousin swears by it. That's it. Just the multivitamin and the turmeric. It's not regular, though, honestly. I forget to take it half the time. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional multivitamin and turmeric. Both can potentially interact with Warfarin, so it's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, take pretty much any medicine they give me when I'm sick… no problems ever. I think I’m pretty lucky, honestly. Can we get to the actual checking now? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. That's a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to take a closer look at the bruising and check a few other things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sure. Let's get it over with. The quicker the better, right? I have a meeting at 2, and traffic's terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could sit up here for me. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'd like to examine the areas where you've been experiencing bruising. Can you point to a few of the most recent bruises?
PATIENT: Okay. Here. This one just happened yesterday, reaching for that soup. And this one… maybe two days ago? Bumping into the coffee table. They really hurt for a bit, but the pain's gone now, just the color. It's weird.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular. There's some tenderness to palpation here, but no signs of a hematoma. And here as well, some tenderness, but no swelling or warmth. I'm not seeing any other areas of significant bruising at this time. Do you notice any bruising on your legs, arms or back that I haven’t seen?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little on my hands sometimes, but I figured that was just from work. I lift boxes all day. Nothing major, like these ones. It's mostly these two that are worrying me, you know? They're just… bigger and more painful than usual. And they seem to pop up out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to need to draw some blood for a few tests. We’ll check your INR – that’s the blood test that measures how well Warfarin is working – and a complete blood count to rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Blood tests are fine. Just get it over with, right? I really need to know what’s going on. And if I am going to be late for my meeting... At least tell me how long it'll take.
DOCTOR: Okay, it will be a standard blood draw, should take just a few minutes. The lab usually gets results back within a couple of hours, and I will have my assistant call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I'm going to advise you to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and if you do get a bump or bruise, apply ice to the area. We’ll see what the blood tests show, and then we can discuss a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Avoid injury, ice… got it. Sounds good. Hopefully it's just the Warfarin and we can adjust the dose or something. Let’s just get this over with. Thanks, Doctor.
