DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's these… hiccups. They just won't stop. It's been almost two days now, and it's driving me a little crazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Two days of hiccups… alright. And is there anything specific that seemed to start them?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I was at a party on Saturday, a friend’s birthday, lots of laughing… maybe that? I had a little sparkling wine, but nothing crazy. I mean, I’ve had a bit more than that before and never had this happen. It just… started while I was driving home. Really weird.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing anything else along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. They're pretty forceful sometimes, make my chest ache a little when they happen, but it goes away right after. Nothing else feels wrong, no heartburn, no trouble breathing... just… hic… this! hic See? It’s very annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it! Holding my breath, drinking water really fast, getting someone to scare me… my niece tried that, it didn’t work, just startled her! I even tried a teaspoon of sugar. Nothing seems to touch them. It's quite frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And do you have any… other medical problems that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with… well, with diet mostly. I try to eat healthy. And, uh… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. But other than that, I’m pretty good. I'm generally healthy. Do you need to know about allergies? I don't really have any serious ones.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Gallbladder removal… noted. And no known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a small one for my blood pressure, Amlodipine, 5mg, once a day. And sometimes, if my knees are acting up, I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever, ibuprofen. But I haven’t taken any in a week or so. Definitely not related to this hiccup thing, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just Amlodipine, and occasional ibuprofen. Let’s just listen to your heart and lungs quickly, and I’ll feel your abdomen, just to be on the safe side. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead, please. Hopefully it's nothing serious. These hiccups are really wearing me out.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular… lungs are clear bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Maybe just a little sensitive when you press right there, but that's probably just normal, isn’t it? It's just where they took my gallbladder out years ago. It sometimes feels a bit… tight. But nothing painful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything feels within normal limits. It’s… unusual to have hiccups lasting this long. I’d like to check your potassium level, just to rule anything out. It’s a simple blood test. And maybe a chest x-ray, just to be absolutely sure there’s nothing else going on. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Oh, no. No insurance, unfortunately. Not since the divorce. It’s… expensive. Will those tests be very costly? I really don’t have much money at the moment. Is the potassium test the most important thing? We could maybe start with that? The x-ray sounds… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. The x-ray is mostly precautionary, to rule out anything serious in your lungs. It’s probably not necessary at this stage. The potassium test is relatively inexpensive, and it can sometimes explain prolonged hiccups. Let's start with that. I'll write you a lab order. If the potassium is normal, we can discuss other potential causes and options. It's possible it's just a stubborn case of… well, hiccups. Do you have any questions about the lab order?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. So, I just go to the lab with this paper, and they'll take some blood? And then they'll send the results to you? Do I need to fast before the test, or anything? I just want to make sure I do it right. Thank you for being so understanding about the insurance, Doctor. It's a relief.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. You just take this to the lab. No fasting required. They'll send the results to me, usually within a day or two. And you're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. We'll see what the results show. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and… I know it's easier said than done, but try to relax. Sometimes stress can make hiccups worse. If they get significantly worse – like, if you have trouble breathing, or severe chest pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have a primary care physician I can contact, or is this a new problem?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t really seen a primary care doctor in years. I usually just go to urgent care when something’s wrong. This hiccup thing is totally new, though. I've never had hiccups last this long before! I'll try my best to relax, and I'll definitely call if it gets any worse. Thank you again, Doctor Sham. I really appreciate you taking the time to see me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Redeye. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Hopefully, it's just a minor issue. If you don't hear from us within two business days, please give the office a call. I'm going to make a note to check on those results personally. Have a good day, and try not to let those hiccups get you down.
