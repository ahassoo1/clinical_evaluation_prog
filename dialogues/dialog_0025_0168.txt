DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a delicate situation, really. I’m starting to date someone, and I thought it prudent to have a check-up beforehand. One must be certain, you understand. It wouldn’t do to… surprise anyone with unforeseen complications later on.
DOCTOR: Right. Of course. Sensible. Well, "unforeseen complications" covers a lot of ground. Let's start with the basics, then. Can you tell me a bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Generally speaking, I am quite healthy. I do try to maintain a reasonable lifestyle. I wouldn’t say I’m athletic, but I’m not entirely sedentary. I prefer quiet activities, reading mostly. And I believe my Medicare covers all the necessary preventative care, doesn’t it? I do keep up with my yearly screenings, as one should. Are we going to discuss… those types of complications, specifically? Because that’s really the crux of the matter, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, we absolutely will. Though let’s not be coy, Ms. Pandolfi. We're adults. But a comprehensive assessment is best. First, let’s cover your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Nothing of the sort. My mother always said strong genes were a blessing, and thankfully, I seem to have inherited hers. No high blood pressure, no sugar issues, no… unpleasantness of that nature. I’ve always been rather particular about my diet, you see. Fresh foods, limited processed items, that sort of thing. Though I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but that was a one-time occurrence. And my vaccinations are, naturally, completely up to date. One doesn't take chances.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always been fortunate enough to avoid the need for such… invasive procedures. I've always believed a healthy lifestyle is the best preventative measure, and it seems to have served me well. I’ve only ever required routine dental work, and thankfully, nothing more serious than that. Honestly, the thought of a surgery… it’s quite unsettling. One must be very careful with one’s body, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very good. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be eighty-seven, a very respectable age, though she did suffer from arthritis in her later years. My father passed away at seventy-two from a… heart condition, I believe. Nothing terribly alarming, as far as I know. My siblings are both healthy, as well. My brother has slightly elevated cholesterol, but he’s managing it with diet and exercise, naturally. It’s all rather… ordinary, really. No genetic predispositions to anything truly dreadful, thankfully. Do you require a more detailed genealogy? I suppose I could request it from my family, but it’s rather a cumbersome process.
DOCTOR: No, that's sufficient for now. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Smoke? The very idea! It’s dreadful for one’s complexion, not to mention the health implications. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I certainly don’t intend to start. It’s a rather… uncouth habit, wouldn't you agree? And I do rather pride myself on maintaining a certain level of… decorum. What a dreadful question, Doctor. Are we finished with these… personal inquiries? I do hope we can get to the matter at hand soon.
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Ms. Pandolfi. Just a few more questions. How about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Merlot, usually. Nothing excessive, certainly not enough to… impair one’s judgment. It’s a civilized indulgence, really. And I do believe a little red wine is good for the heart, isn’t it? But I assure you, Doctor, I’m not a… drinker. I’m a woman of refined tastes, not a… social butterfly. I simply enjoy a small glass of wine with a good meal, on occasion. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I've always been very careful about what I consume, naturally. I don’t take many medications at all, thankfully. Perhaps an occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing serious. I did have a slight reaction to a mosquito bite last summer – a bit of swelling, nothing more. But a topical cream resolved the issue quickly enough. I'm generally quite resilient, you see. It’s rather… reassuring, isn’t it? Do you feel we can finally discuss the… reason for my visit? I do hope my responses have been… satisfactory. I’m starting to feel a bit… scrutinized.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, you've been... thorough. Let's address your concerns directly. You mentioned wanting to ensure there are no unforeseen complications with a new… relationship. Specifically, are you concerned about sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Well, someone had to articulate it. Yes. Precisely. One must be… prudent. It's not a matter of distrust, you understand. It’s simply… responsible. One doesn't want to… jeopardize one’s health, or anyone else’s. And at my age… one is perhaps a bit more… cautious. I would simply like to be certain. A full screening, I presume? And is it discreet? That is… paramount. I wouldn’t want this… discussed. It’s a rather… sensitive matter.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. A full STI screening is standard procedure, and everything will be kept strictly confidential. We'll also want to discuss your vaccination status regarding HPV, if you haven't already been vaccinated. Now, before we proceed with any testing, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a general check of your blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick listen to your lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. Though I do hope it will be… quick. I have a luncheon engagement shortly after this, you see. And I would prefer not to… disarrange my hair. A quick examination is perfectly fine. Though please, no… unnecessary probing. I trust you understand my… sensibilities. And do let me know if anything… unusual is detected. I prefer to be… forewarned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. We'll keep it brief and respectful. If you'll just have a seat on the table. I'll start by taking your blood pressure. Please, relax your arm. 130 over 85. Not bad, but slightly elevated. We'll want to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart rate is 78, regular. No murmurs detected. And finally, I’ll just listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please, bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table.
PATIENT: Very well. I trust everything is… satisfactory? It is rather… unnerving, having one’s body… scrutinized. Though I suppose it is… necessary. Is the blood pressure… concerning? I did have a rather stressful week, arranging the details for the luncheon. And please, do be gentle. I have a rather… delicate constitution. And do let me know if you require any… further information. I am quite meticulous about my medical history, you see.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which could be normal for your age, or it could be related to your stress levels. Nothing immediately concerning. Now, just a quick palpation of your abdomen, if you don't mind. I'm just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Though… do be gentle, Doctor. I have a rather… sensitive stomach. And please, do not… press too firmly. I am quite… particular about my comfort. And do let me know if you detect anything… unusual. I trust your expertise, of course, but I do prefer to be… forewarned. This is rather… disconcerting, you see. I had not anticipated such… physical scrutiny. Is it almost finished? I do have a luncheon engagement shortly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Everything feels normal. No masses or tenderness detected. Now, just a quick check of your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal as well. Now, to address your initial concerns, we'll need to draw some blood for STI screening. We’ll also test your Vitamin D levels, as that can impact overall health. The lab is just down the hall. Would you like me to escort you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Escorting me would be… most appreciated. I do prefer not to… wander the halls unsupervised. And do ensure the phlebotomist is… gentle. I have a rather… aversion to needles. And please, do reassure me that everything will be… discreet. I trust your staff is… professional, of course, but one can never be too careful. This has been… quite an ordeal, you see. I trust the results will be… expeditious? And do let me know if anything… alarming is detected. I prefer to be… forewarned, as I’ve mentioned.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi. I’ll personally escort you to the lab and ensure everything is handled discreetly and professionally. Our phlebotomists are highly experienced and gentle. And I assure you, all results will be kept strictly confidential. We typically have results back within 3-5 business days, and I will contact you immediately if anything alarming is detected. Let’s go. Now, I'll just inform the lab technician that you're on your way. They are expecting you. And don't hesitate to let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point during the blood draw. Just a standard blood draw, Ms. Pandolfi. Nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate your… reassurance. I trust the technician is… competent. And please, do ensure they use a… sterile needle. I am quite… particular about hygiene. And do let me know if anything… unusual is detected during the draw. I prefer to be… forewarned, as I have mentioned. This has been… quite an ordeal, you see. I trust everything will be… expeditious? I have a luncheon engagement shortly. Now, let us… proceed.
DOCTOR: Here we are. This is Sarah, our excellent lab technician. Sarah, this is Ms. Pandolfi. She’s here for a standard STI screening and Vitamin D levels. She’s a little anxious about the blood draw, so if you could be extra gentle, that would be appreciated. Everything will be quick and painless, Ms. Pandolfi. Just relax your arm, and Sarah will take it from here. I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
