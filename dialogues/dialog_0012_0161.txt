DOCTOR: Hi Helaina, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into… this PrEP thing. I’m a bit older, you see, and… well, better safe than sorry, I always say. I just want to understand it all, really. I’m not even sure where to begin.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s smart to be proactive about your health, and asking questions is the best first step. “PrEP” stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis, and you’re right to think about it even if you’re older. It's a medication that can really lower your risk of getting HIV. Before we talk specifics, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Sure. I’m… reasonably healthy, I think. I work as a parking attendant, so I’m on my feet a lot, which is good. Bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing major. Single, no kids. Medicare covers me. I don’t really… go to the doctor much unless I have to, if that makes sense? I try to eat okay, mostly. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much anymore. Is that enough for now?
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point, thank you. The arthritis is good to know. And it's great you're active and don't smoke! Just to be thorough, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A couple of times, actually. Years ago, when… well, it was becoming more of a concern, I suppose. And again maybe five years ago, just a general check-up thing. Both times came back negative. I remember distinctly because I was worried, honestly, and relieved when they said so. Do you need dates or anything? I can try to dig up paperwork if that helps.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about digging up paperwork right now. Knowing you've been tested and were negative is helpful. Now, when you say "more of a concern" – can you tell me a little bit about what was going on then, and what's brought it back to your mind now?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Well… back then, I was… dating someone. It was a bit complicated, and we weren’t always… careful, I guess. It ended badly, and I got tested afterwards, just to be sure. And now… well, a friend of mine recently… he's gay, and he’s starting PrEP. He said it gives him peace of mind, and it made me think. I haven’t been with anyone recently, but… you never know, do you? It’s just better to be prepared, especially at my age. It's not like it was a bad relationship, just… risky, maybe. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Helaina. It's very responsible of you to consider this, and your friend is right – it can give peace of mind. And it's good you're thinking about risk, even if you haven't been actively dating recently. Just so I have a complete picture, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Like I said, haven't been with anyone for a while now. It's… not really a priority, honestly. Work keeps me busy enough. But that doesn't mean I don't want to be careful, you know? I see things, being where I work, and you can never be too cautious. It’s just… things happen. It’s good to have options, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Being informed and having options is excellent. Okay, so no current sexual activity, but you're thinking about future risk and want to discuss PrEP as a preventative measure. That’s a great starting point. To determine if PrEP is right for you, we need to make sure there aren’t any underlying medical conditions that would make it unsafe. I'd like to go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get penicillin as a kid, but that was ages ago. Nothing currently, no. I’m pretty lucky in that regard, I think. Just the arthritis, but that's not a medication allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, arthritis isn’t a medication allergy. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen sometimes, for my knees. When they’re really acting up. And a multivitamin, just a general one, to try and keep healthy. That's it, really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it, honestly. So I really only take them when I have to. Is ibuprofen okay? I always worry about things interacting with other medications.
DOCTOR: That's good to know—ibuprofen and a multivitamin. Those are generally safe, but it's always good to check. Now, before we discuss PrEP further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests. The blood tests will check your kidney function, liver function, and make sure you don’t have HIV or any other infections. It’s standard procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, I suppose. If it’s standard, then I trust your judgement. I just want to make sure everything is safe. And to know if this is even an option for me. So yes, a physical exam and blood tests are fine. Do you need me to change clothes or anything?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No need to change clothes for the exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological exam. Then we'll draw some blood. Okay, everything sounds clear and your blood pressure is good. Reflexes are normal. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood now. It will be sent to the lab, and we should have the results in a few days. While we’re waiting for the results, do you have any questions for me about PrEP itself?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s… reassuring. I guess I do have a few questions. My friend said something about taking a pill every day? Is that right? And… are there side effects? I’ve heard things about pills having all sorts of awful side effects. And what if… what if I do end up taking it, and it doesn't work? That's probably a silly question, but… it’s worrying, you know? I just want to be absolutely sure before I start anything.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Helaina. It's good you're thinking through this so carefully. You're right, PrEP is taken as a daily pill. There are a couple of different medications we can use, both of which are very effective. As for side effects, they're generally mild for most people. Some people experience nausea, fatigue, or headache when they first start, but these usually go away within a few weeks. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, but we'll discuss those in detail and monitor you closely if you decide to start PrEP. And you're right to ask about it not working. PrEP is highly effective – over 99% effective when taken consistently as prescribed. However, it only works if you take it every day. It doesn’t protect against all sexually transmitted infections, so safe sex practices are still important. And it's important to get tested regularly for other STIs. We would also need to check your kidney function periodically while you're on PrEP, just to make sure everything is working okay. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes… a little more sense. Daily pill, mild side effects, high effectiveness if I take it properly, and regular check-ups. And I still need to be careful. I think I understand. It’s just… a lot to take in. My friend didn't really go into all this detail. He just said it gave him peace of mind. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. I think… I need to think about it a bit. See how I feel after the blood tests come back. And maybe do a little more research myself. Is that okay? I don’t want to rush into anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly alright. Taking the time to consider all your options and do your own research is a very smart thing to do. I encourage it! I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and answer any further questions you may have. Here’s a pamphlet with some more information about PrEP. It has links to reliable websites as well. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything comes to mind before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. You've been very helpful. I feel a little less overwhelmed now, honestly. I think I'll just go sit and wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. Take your time, and the nurse will be with you shortly. .
