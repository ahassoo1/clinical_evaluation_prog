DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Gegan, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… this business with the bladder, I suppose. Going to the little boy’s room far too often, that’s what it is. It's a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, mostly. Old age, probably. Everything goes, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does seem like things change as we get older, Mr. Segretto. But frequent urination can have a number of causes, so let’s explore it a bit to see what’s going on. You mentioned it’s mostly at night—how many times would you say you’re getting up to urinate during the night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… always with the numbers. Let me think… It's not every night, you understand. But when it happens… two, maybe three times? It could be more, honestly. I don’t really keep track. My wife, bless her heart, she’s the one who notices these things. I just know it’s too much. Interferes with my sleep, it does. Used to be able to sleep right through, you know? A good eight hours. Now… now it's a struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good your wife is observant. Two or three times a night is definitely worth looking into, even if it's not every night. And disrupted sleep is no fun at all. Besides waking up at night, have you noticed any other changes in your urination during the day?
PATIENT: Hmm. Changes… Let me see. Well, sometimes it’s a bit… urgent, you know? Like I have to go right away. Not always, but it happens. And the stream isn’t as… strong as it used to be. It kinda sputters out at the end there. It's not painful, mind you, just… weak. My boy, he always had a powerful stream, could water the whole garden with it, he could. I don’t have that anymore, that’s for sure. Is that what you wanted to know? I get lost in these details, sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, those are very helpful details, Mr. Segretto. Don't worry about getting lost, I appreciate you sharing. The urgency and the weaker stream are important pieces of the puzzle. Have you noticed any difficulty starting your urine stream, or any feeling like you’re not completely emptying your bladder when you go?
PATIENT: Now that… that's a good question. I think… I think I do have to wait a little bit sometimes to get it going. Not a long time, but a second or two. And… yes, you’re right. I don’t always feel like I’ve gotten everything out. Like there’s a little bit left in there. Not a lot, but… a little. My wife says I linger in the bathroom too long, but I told her I’m just being thorough! Does that make sense? I'm not sure I'm explaining this very well. It's all just a bit… annoying.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly, Mr. Segretto. Don't worry at all. The waiting to start and the feeling of incomplete emptying are also important clues. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Conditions… Well, the doctor told me a few years back my pressure was a little high, put me on a little pill for it. I take it every day, can’t remember the name of it now. And I had that… that prostate business a while back. They did some tests, said it was just… old man stuff. Nothing to worry about, they said. Other than that… I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I still manage the farm, you know? Keep busy. Though not as much as I used to. My wife does most of the paperwork now, thankfully. She's good with numbers.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. The high blood pressure is important, and we’ll want to make sure that's well controlled. And the previous prostate issue is definitely relevant. Do you recall what tests were done for your prostate, or roughly when that was?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh, goodness. It was… a long time ago. Maybe five, maybe ten years? They took some blood, that I remember. And… and they did something else. Not pleasant, I'll tell you that. Something with a little… finger. That’s all I remember, honestly. I didn't ask too many questions. I just wanted it over with. The doctor said everything was fine, normal for a man my age. So I didn’t push it. I don't like doctors poking around, if you know what I mean. It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. It's perfectly alright not to like medical procedures. The blood test and the digital rectal exam are common ways to check the prostate. Now, let's quickly go over your medications. You mentioned a pill for blood pressure – do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage… now you’re asking me something. It’s a little white pill, that’s all I know. I take one every morning with my breakfast. My wife handles refilling the prescriptions, so I don’t pay much attention to the details. She keeps everything organized, bless her heart. I’m not very good with remembering things like that. I just know it keeps my pressure down. I had a scare a few years back, and the doctor said I needed to take it. Something about heart attack or stroke, I think. It was a frightening time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can look up your medications on the computer here and confirm the dosage. Alright, I see here you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily. That's good. Now, have you had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was a boy, but that cleared up years ago. My wife says I’m allergic to hard work, but I don’t think that counts! Honestly, I haven't had any serious reactions to anything. I can eat anything, take anything the doctor gives me, usually. I just… don't enjoy going to the doctor, that’s all. Is that a problem? I'm starting to feel a little silly answering all these questions. It's been a long time since I've had a thorough check-up, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not silly at all, Mr. Segretto. It's good to be thorough, especially when we’re trying to figure out what’s going on. And it’s perfectly normal to not enjoy doctor visits! Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, diabetes, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Family history… well, my father, he had a weak heart. Died when he was in his seventies, I think. My mother, she lived to be ninety, but she had… well, she had all sorts of aches and pains. Old age, mostly. My brother, he had diabetes, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much… didn’t live as long as he should have. As for prostate problems… I don’t think so. Nobody ever talked about that. It wasn’t something you discussed back then. Men just… dealt with it. Is that helpful? I don't have a very good memory for these things, you understand. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Segretto. Knowing about your father’s heart condition and your brother’s diabetes is important. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief abdominal exam. Then, I'd like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. That… that’s what I was afraid of. The finger thing again? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to figure this out, I really do. But… is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I'm an old man. Everything’s going to go eventually, right? Maybe it's just old age, like I said. I don't want to cause any trouble. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just… watch it for a while? I really don't like that part. It’s just… a little undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It’s not the most comfortable exam, and I wouldn’t suggest it if I didn’t think it was important. Given your symptoms – the frequent urination, the urgency, the weak stream, the waiting to start, and the feeling of incomplete emptying – and your family history, assessing your prostate is a crucial step in determining the cause. It helps me rule out some serious possibilities, like an enlarged prostate or, less commonly, something more concerning. While "watching it for a while" might be an option, it could delay a diagnosis and potentially lead to complications. We can discuss other options, like a urine test to look for infection or abnormalities, but that won’t give us as much information about your prostate. I want to assure you I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. Would you be willing to consider it with that understanding?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But you promise to be quick. And gentle. And explain everything. I don't like surprises. And if it's too uncomfortable, I want you to stop right away. No arguing. Just stop. I just… I just want to get this over with. It's embarrassing, really. A grown man, getting poked and prodded… It's not how I pictured my retirement. But… if you think it's important, I suppose I can endure it. But hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Segretto. I appreciate your willingness to proceed, despite your discomfort. I will absolutely be as quick and gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything as I go. You can stop me at any time, no questions asked. Alright, I'm just going to have you lean forward slightly. I’ll apply some lubricant, and then gently insert a finger into your rectum. It may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m assessing the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate. Okay, all done. I didn't feel any obvious nodules or areas of concern, but your prostate does feel slightly enlarged. That could explain some of your symptoms. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, and your heart sounds are normal.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Just like always. It's the stress, probably. Worrying about all this. So, enlarged, huh? What does that mean? Is it serious? Do I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery. I'm too old for surgery. And what about this pressure? Is it from the enlargement? I just want to know… am I going to die from this? Honestly, Doctor, you’re scaring me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly natural to feel scared when you hear something like "enlarged." Let’s take things one step at a time. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia , is very common in men your age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious like cancer. It simply means your prostate gland has gotten bigger, which can put pressure on your urethra – the tube that carries urine out of your bladder. That pressure can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing – frequent urination, urgency, weak stream, and so on. As for dying from it, absolutely not. BPH itself isn’t life-threatening. However, it can lead to complications if left untreated, such as urinary retention , infections, or bladder damage. Surgery is not always necessary. There are several treatment options available, depending on the severity of your symptoms. We can start with some conservative measures, such as lifestyle changes and medication. I would like to order a urine test to rule out infection and a PSA blood test to assess your prostate-specific antigen levels. That will help me get a clearer picture of your situation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests again… honestly. Alright, fine. If it will help. But I don't want any more poking around, if you know what I mean. Just blood and… pee. And then tell me… what kind of medication are we talking about? Do they have side effects? I don’t want to be spending all my time in the bathroom, or… or worse. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to wish I hadn't come in at all. Maybe I should just deal with it, like I always have. It's just… a nuisance, right? An old man's nuisance. Why bother with all this trouble?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. It feels like a lot, I agree. And it's completely valid to wonder if it's worth the trouble. But getting a clear diagnosis and starting appropriate treatment can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent potential complications down the road. The urine test and PSA blood test are relatively simple and painless. As for medication, there are a few different types that can help relieve BPH symptoms. Alpha-blockers are one option. They relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. A common side effect is dizziness, especially when you stand up quickly. Another option is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, which shrinks the size of your prostate over time. A potential side effect is decreased libido or erectile dysfunction. However, not everyone experiences these side effects, and we can always try a different medication if one doesn’t suit you. We'll start with the tests first and discuss your options in more detail once we have the results. If you’re still hesitant about medication, we can also explore lifestyle changes, such as reducing caffeine intake and practicing timed voiding. Would that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests, then talk. I suppose I have no choice. But no promises about the medication. I’ll think about it. And the lifestyle changes… I don't drink much caffeine, honestly. Mostly just tea with my wife. And timed voiding? Sounds… ridiculous. But alright. Whatever it takes, I guess. Just… just try not to poke me anymore, please. And hurry up with the tests. I've wasted enough of my day already. Honestly, Doctor, this whole thing is just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand your exhaustion, Mr. Segretto. And I promise, no more poking. I’ll get the lab order for the urine test and PSA blood test right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, I’ll write down some information about BPH, including the lifestyle changes we discussed, for you to review. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan that’s right for you. We’ll go at your pace and make sure you’re comfortable with every step of the way. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… just get it over with. And thank you… I suppose. I still don't like all this, but… you seem to know what you’re doing. And I appreciate you explaining everything, even if I don’t understand half of it. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to sleep through the night again. That's all. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a cup of tea. .
