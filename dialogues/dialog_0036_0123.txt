DOCTOR: Good morning, Carla. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s been driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Not all over, just… here and there. Mostly my arms and back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla. Itchy skin can certainly be disruptive. “Here and there” on your arms and back… has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not brand new, no. It comes and goes, really. But it’s been worse the last couple of weeks, I’d say. I thought maybe it was the heat, you know? It is August, and it’s been a scorcher. But it doesn’t seem to be getting any better with cooler showers and all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Heat can definitely exacerbate skin issues, so it's good you considered that. And it’s helpful to know it’s not constant, but has been worsening recently. Can you describe the itch itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Well, it's not like a burn, definitely not. More like… a little prickly, and sometimes it feels really deep, almost under the skin. And scratching doesn’t really help for long, it just… makes it want to itch more, you know? It's a frustrating kind of itch. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Carla. A deep, prickly itch that doesn't respond well to scratching is a useful description. Do you notice anything that specifically triggers it, or makes it worse besides the heat?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know if anything specifically triggers it, no. I haven’t really noticed anything like that. Sometimes after I wash, maybe? But I use the same soap I always have, so I don’t think that’s it. Oh! And sometimes when I’m stressed. But who isn’t stressed these days, right?
DOCTOR: You're right, stress can certainly play a role. Okay, so it's intermittent, worse recently, doesn’t seem to have obvious triggers, sometimes after washing, and potentially linked to stress. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Have you had any other changes recently – any fever, weight loss, fatigue, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that, thankfully. No fever, no weight loss… I'm eating pretty much the same as always, maybe a little less when I'm busy, but nothing drastic. And I get tired, but who doesn’t at my age? I haven’t been feeling sick, if that makes sense. Just itchy.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Carla. No systemic symptoms like fever or weight loss is good. Let's go through some standard questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like eczema, psoriasis, or allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… allergies, definitely. Dust, mostly. And pollen, especially in the spring. But the doctor just said it was dust and pollen. Nothing serious. As for… eczema or psoriasis? No, I don't think so. I’ve never been told I had those. My mother had some skin issues when she got older, but I don't remember what they were.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and pollen allergies, no history of eczema or psoriasis. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist, but that was… oh, goodness, probably fifty years ago? Other than that, no. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Carla. So, tonsillectomy as a child, broken wrist long ago. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains. But nothing regularly. And I haven't taken anything specifically for this itch yet. I figured I'd see what a doctor thinks before I start putting all sorts of creams on it.
DOCTOR: That’s a wise approach. Okay, Carla. No regular medications. And lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor has given me, thankfully. I’m a little nervous taking new things, but I haven’t had any problems so far.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla, that’s very helpful. So, to recap: you’re a 70-year-old female with an intermittent itch on your arms and back, worse recently, potentially linked to stress, with dust and pollen allergies, no other medical conditions, no surgeries other than a tonsillectomy and a broken wrist a long time ago, no regular medications, and no known medication allergies. Now, I’d like to take a look at your skin. Would you mind rolling up your sleeves and lowering the back of your shirt so I can get a better view?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Happy to. It’s not much to look at, really. Just a little red sometimes. But please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some scattered areas of redness on your forearms and upper back. The skin doesn’t appear thickened or scaly, and there are no blisters or open sores. There is some mild excoriation – meaning some scratching – in a few areas. Overall, the skin appears relatively normal, aside from the redness and mild scratching. I don’t see any signs of a rash that immediately points to a specific cause. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you may be experiencing a form of eczema, possibly exacerbated by stress and allergies. However, to rule out other possibilities, like a fungal infection or a reaction to something you’ve been exposed to, I’d like to order a simple skin scraping and a patch test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, eczema… that sounds… uncomfortable. I've heard about that. And yes, of course, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then absolutely. A scraping and a patch test… whatever you need. I just want to stop itching! What does a patch test involve, exactly? I don’t think I’ve ever had one of those before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Carla. Eczema can be quite bothersome, but there are many effective treatments available. A patch test is fairly straightforward. We’ll apply a small amount of different potential allergens – common things like fragrances, dyes, and preservatives – to a small area of your back, usually under a bandage. You’ll need to keep the bandage on for about two days, avoiding showering or getting it wet. Then, you'll come back in a few days, and I’ll examine the area to see if any of the allergens caused a reaction. It will help us identify if something specific is triggering your itch. The skin scraping is very quick – I'll gently take a tiny sample of skin from the affected area to look for any signs of infection under a microscope. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little bit of pressure. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly manageable, Doctor. A little bandage for a couple of days, and a tiny scrape… no problem at all. Much better than being itchy! So, we do the scrape first, and then the bandage? Just so I know what to expect. And how long will it take to get the results back, roughly? I'm not trying to rush you, but… well, you know. The itch.
DOCTOR: We’ll do the skin scraping first, as that gives us a quicker answer. It’ll only take a few minutes to prepare the sample and look at it under the microscope. I can usually have the results back to you within about fifteen minutes. Then, we’ll apply the patches. It’ll take a few more minutes to set those up. You’ll need to keep them on for 48 hours, as I mentioned, and then come back in two days for me to check the results. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day to help soothe your skin. And I can prescribe a mild topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching while we wait for the patch test results. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. A cream to stop the itching now, and the tests to find out what’s causing it… perfect! And fragrance-free moisturizer, absolutely. I'll make sure to get that. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease. Let's get those scrapes done, then!
DOCTOR: Alright, Carla. If you could just sit comfortably, I’ll gently scrape a small area on your forearm. It might feel like a light scratch, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay, just a little pressure… and done. Just one moment while I take a look under the microscope… Okay, Carla. The good news is, I don’t see any signs of fungal infection or bacteria under the microscope. This makes an allergic reaction or a form of eczema more likely. Now, let's proceed with the patch test. I’ll apply the patches to your back. Are you comfortable lying face down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, that's wonderful news about the microscope, Doctor! So, no creepy crawlies, that’s good to know. And yes, I'm perfectly comfortable lying face down. Let's do the patches! I'm ready to get this figured out. Just let me know if I need to move at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Carla, I've applied the patches. You’ll need to keep these on for 48 hours, avoiding showering, swimming, or strenuous activity that might cause them to come loose. Try to avoid scratching the area as well. I’m prescribing a mild topical steroid cream, triamcinolone 0.1%, to apply to the affected areas twice daily until we have the results of the patch test. This should help reduce the itching and inflammation. You can pick that up at your local pharmacy. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds very manageable. No showers for two days, and cream twice a day… I can do that. And thank you for the printed instructions, that’s very helpful. Hmm… I think I understand everything. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when do I call to schedule the follow-up to get the patches removed? And how long after removing them do I need to come in? I just want to make sure I don't mess up the timing.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question, Carla. Call the office in exactly 48 hours from now to schedule an appointment to have the patches removed. We’ll need to see you within 24 hours of removal to check for any reactions. So, if you apply them tonight, call in two days, and schedule an appointment for the following day. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor! Apply tonight, call in two days, and schedule for the next day. I’ve got it. Well, thank you so much for everything, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been wonderful. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. I really appreciate your patience and kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this itch. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try to relax! We'll talk soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too! And I’ll try my best to relax… easier said than done with this itch, but I’ll try! .
