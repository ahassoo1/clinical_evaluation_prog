DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Stepro. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. It’s not… comfortable, and I thought it best to get it checked. I'm afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t recall exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you're having trouble pinpointing the exact start date. We'll work through it together. “Down there” is a good starting point. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. More of a… dull ache, I think. Sometimes it feels heavy, like a weight. And occasionally, it will be more noticeable, a bit more… uncomfortable. It doesn’t come and go in a regular pattern, if that makes sense. Just… appears sometimes. It’s… rather worrisome.
DOCTOR: A dull ache with occasional increased discomfort… and not a regular pattern. That’s helpful, thank you. And where exactly are you feeling this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that’s a difficult question. It’s… in the… well, in the area of my… testicles, I suppose. Though sometimes it seems to radiate a bit, into my lower abdomen. It’s hard to be precise, I apologize. I don't usually think about it so… specifically.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. It’s not always easy to describe these things. So, pain primarily in the testicles, with some radiating to the lower abdomen. Has anything specific seemed to trigger this pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. I honestly can't recall anything specific. I do a fair amount of woodworking, you see, and it’s rather physical work. Perhaps that has something to do with it? Lifting heavy things, being on my feet all day… But I’ve been doing that for years, and I haven’t noticed a connection before. I'm really not sure. It just… is sometimes.
DOCTOR: Woodworking… okay, that’s good to know. Physical activity, lifting… we’ll keep that in mind. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No fever, I don’t believe so. No nausea. I haven’t noticed any… swelling, not that I’m aware of. Oh! I have been feeling a bit more tired lately, perhaps. But I attributed that to the heat, honestly. And just… getting older. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Ms. Stepro. It’s helpful to know what you aren't experiencing as well. No fever, no nausea, no swelling, and some increased fatigue. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s another area where my memory is… unreliable. I do have Medicare, which means I must have something, but I don’t recall what, specifically. I believe I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, but that was so long ago. And I’ve had the usual things, you know—colds, the flu… Nothing major, I don’t think. I apologize for being so vague. Perhaps my primary care physician has a better record?
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Stepro. Medicare is a good clue, and we can certainly look into your records. And knowing about the gallbladder removal is helpful. I'll access your electronic health record now to see what information is available. One moment, please. Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, and you do take lisinopril for that. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, that’s right. The high blood pressure. Lisinopril… that’s the name of the pill. I take it every morning. It’s been… stable, I think. My doctor checks it regularly. It hasn't been causing me any trouble, at least, not that I'm aware of. I am glad you have access to all this information! It is much easier than trying to recall everything myself.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s reassuring. So, hypertension managed with lisinopril. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Just the lisinopril, I believe. Oh! Wait. I do take a multivitamin, every morning with my pill. It’s nothing special, just a standard one from the drugstore. And sometimes, when my joints are acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s infrequent, really. Only when I need it. I'm terribly sorry if I'm being a bother. I feel like I'm forgetting things constantly.
DOCTOR: You're not being a bother at all, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly normal to forget things, and we’re here to help piece everything together. So, lisinopril daily, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's another difficult area. My family… My mother had… heart trouble, I believe. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t recall the specifics. And my father… he had diabetes, I think. But again, it was a long time ago, and I don’t have many details. My brother is still alive, and he's relatively healthy, as far as I know. We don’t see each other very often. I wish I could be more helpful. I apologize for my poor memory.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Stepro. Knowing about the heart trouble and diabetes in your family is helpful. We can always try to obtain more detailed records if needed. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I don't have any food allergies. I eat pretty much everything. I've always been fortunate in that regard. Is that all? I feel like I'm being put through an interrogation!
DOCTOR: No interrogation, Ms. Stepro, just gathering information to ensure we provide the best possible care. And that's good to know about the allergies—none to report. Okay, one final question before the exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a very… conventional woman, Doctor. I hope that's satisfactory. Are we finished with the questions now? I am feeling a bit anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Stepro, we’re finished with the questions. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. And I apologize if I’ve made you feel anxious. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a physical exam. We’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to examine your abdomen and, of course, the testicles to assess the source of your pain. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I hope it's nothing serious. I suppose the sooner we find out, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I’ll explain everything as I go. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Now, examining your testicles... I note some mild tenderness on the left side. There doesn’t appear to be any swelling or obvious masses. The right testicle feels normal. Can you describe the pain you've been feeling as I'm touching here?
PATIENT: Ouch. Yes, that’s… that’s where it hurts. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like you said. It’s… uncomfortable. It feels… heavy, almost. And it radiates a little bit into my lower abdomen, like a pulling sensation. It’s not constant, it comes and goes, but it’s definitely more noticeable now when you’re touching it. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. Thank you for letting me know. Based on the exam, the tenderness on the left testicle and the radiating pain you’re describing, it’s possible you have epididymitis, which is inflammation of the epididymis – the tube that stores and carries sperm. It could also be a testicular torsion, although less likely given the lack of acute, severe pain. And a less common possibility is a varicocele, or enlarged veins in the scrotum. To rule out a torsion and get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. It's a painless imaging test that will allow us to visualize the testicles and surrounding structures. We'll also do a urinalysis to check for infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a… urinalysis? I suppose so. If it will help determine what’s wrong, then yes, please. I just… I don’t like the sound of any of it, honestly. What’s involved with the urinalysis? And how long will the ultrasound take? Will it be… uncomfortable? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I am rather… easily frightened.
DOCTOR: You’re not being bothersome at all, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious in situations like this, and I’m happy to answer all your questions. The urinalysis is very simple. You’ll just need to provide a urine sample in a cup. We’ll give you instructions on how to do that properly in the restroom. It’s painless and only takes a few minutes. The scrotal ultrasound is also painless. A technician will apply a gel to your scrotum and then move a small probe over the area to create images on a screen. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. You’ll lie on a table, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. I'll order these tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to provide you with instructions and collect the urine sample. While we wait for the results, I’ll also prescribe you a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Yes, please, the pain reliever would be very welcome. And thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I feel a little bit better knowing what to expect. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I have a lot of woodworking to do, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and help you get back to your woodworking as soon as possible. I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen 600mg, to be taken every 8 hours as needed for pain. And I'll let the nurse know to come in and assist you with the urinalysis. In the meantime, please avoid any strenuous activity, including heavy lifting. If your pain worsens significantly, or you develop any fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Seil, for your patience and kindness. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse now. I'm still a little anxious, but I feel better knowing we're taking steps to figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any concerns. We'll get those tests ordered and get you some answers as quickly as possible. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, take care, and try to rest.
