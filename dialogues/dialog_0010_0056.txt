DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it's… well, it’s the job. The students. They simply don't appreciate the value of a properly cataloged Dewey Decimal system anymore. It’s quite disheartening, really. I suppose you need a summary of… complaints? Is that what we’re doing here? I haven’t much time, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. So, this is… related to stress at work then?
PATIENT: Stress? A rather… pedestrian term, Doctor. It’s more a… a systemic erosion of standards! And a lack of respect. But, yes, if you must call it stress, then fine. It keeps me up at night, worrying about the future of knowledge, frankly. It's… exhausting. Are we getting somewhere with this? I have a rather important acquisition to finalize this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so trouble sleeping due to work-related anxiety. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the insomnia, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, Doctor, am I supposed to be listing every minor inconvenience? My appetite isn’t what it used to be, certainly. And I find myself… shorter with my colleagues. Though, frankly, they deserve it. It’s hardly a medical crisis, is it? Are you a specialist in… difficult people? Perhaps they need treatment, not I.
DOCTOR: Alright, decreased appetite and irritability. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, I suppose… a little. My trousers feel… looser, perhaps? But I’m a man of refinement, Doctor, not a butcher! I don’t concern myself with such vulgar measurements. Honestly, are you attempting to ascertain if I'm wasting away? It's quite insulting. I assure you, my intellectual weight remains substantial.
DOCTOR: Okay. The chart indicates a weight of 117 pounds, with a height of 176 centimeters. That’s… a notable decrease from previous recorded weights. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Good heavens! You’ve been examining my past records without my permission? This is outrageous! And no, I have not been experiencing… those sorts of ailments. I eat perfectly adequate meals – mostly soups, admittedly, but perfectly nourishing soups! I simply… lack the energy to enjoy them as much as I once did. Really, Doctor, I came here because of incompetent students, not a digestive complaint. Is this a waste of my time? Because it certainly feels like one. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I apologize if reviewing your chart caused offense. I was simply trying to get a complete picture of your health. However, the weight loss and decreased appetite are concerning, and it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes. Before we address the stress, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any fatigue, muscle weakness, or any unintentional changes in your vision?
