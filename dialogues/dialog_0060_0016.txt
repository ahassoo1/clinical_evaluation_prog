DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my bruising. It's… excessive, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner the doctor prescribed, you know, after the… incident. And I just keep getting these marks. Bumps into things, normal stuff, and I end up looking like a plum. It’s ridiculous. I haven’t been this clumsy since I was a boy, and that was mostly intentional.
DOCTOR: Excessive bruising, you say. And you attribute it to the blood thinner. Right. And how long has this been going on after starting the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. The… incident was in February, so… about six months now, give or take. At first, it wasn't so bad. A little discoloration here and there, expected, you know? But it’s gotten progressively worse. I used to be able to knock my shin on the coffee table and barely notice. Now? It looks like I went ten rounds with a heavyweight. It’s unsettling. I don’t like it one bit.
DOCTOR: Six months. And you’re saying it’s a progressive increase in bruising, even with minor trauma?
PATIENT: Exactly. Not just the amount of bruising, but how easily it happens. I barely feel a thing sometimes, and then… bam. Purple and green blossoming all over. Honestly, it's starting to worry me. I'm a pathologist, you know. I know what excessive bleeding can mean. And I’m not prone to dramatics, but this feels… off.
DOCTOR: A pathologist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I spent thirty years looking at… well, everything, really. Blood, tissues, you name it. So, I have a certain… awareness. I wouldn't be here if I thought it was nothing. And frankly, I've had a rather… difficult year. My wife, God rest her soul, passed away last spring. This bruising just feels like another thing piling on. It's… demoralizing.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, loss can certainly impact… many things. Let’s focus on the bruising for now. Besides the blood thinner, are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing else regularly. Just the blood thinner – Warfarin, I believe it is. And I take a multivitamin every now and then, but that's hardly consistent. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, though after my wife… well, cooking hasn’t been a priority, to be honest. I mostly stick to simple things. Nothing that would interact with anything, I assure you. I’m a scientist, remember? I understand the importance of a controlled environment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has your primary care doctor adjusted the Warfarin dosage at all since you started it?
PATIENT: Yes, a few times. Dr. Ramirez. A perfectly competent woman, but… busy, you know? She checks the INR regularly, and adjusts the dose as needed. I think she increased it slightly a couple of months ago. I have the paperwork somewhere at home, but I don’t recall the exact numbers. She said it was to ensure I was adequately protected, after a… slight dip in the levels. It’s all rather technical, and frankly, I leave most of it to her. I trust her, generally. But the bruising started getting worse after that adjustment. It’s a correlation, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: It’s a possible correlation, yes. We need to look at those INR values specifically. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to check for any signs of other bleeding, and assess the bruising itself. Then, we can discuss some potential causes and whether further testing is needed. Sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Perfectly reasonable. Honestly, I appreciate your methodical approach. I’ve seen too many doctors jump to conclusions without proper examination. Yes, please, do whatever you think is necessary. I'll cooperate fully. Just… try not to poke too much. It’s rather sensitive, you know? Both physically and… emotionally.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see bruising in multiple stages here, as you mentioned. Some appear relatively recent, others are resolving. Palpation reveals… tenderness, but no signs of significant hematoma formation. No petechiae or purpura visible. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, regular. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then we can talk about some possibilities.
PATIENT: Very well. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. My heart has always been strong, thankfully. I suppose what worries me most is the… unpredictability of it. One day I’m fine, the next I look like I’ve been in a brawl. And it’s not like I’m actively seeking out collisions. It’s… disconcerting. So, what are we looking at here? Is it possible the Warfarin is simply too high? Or is there something else going on? I’ve read about bleeding disorders, of course… but I assumed those manifested earlier in life.
DOCTOR: Well, your heart and lungs sound clear. The unpredictable nature of the bruising is concerning, and your concern about the Warfarin dosage is valid. It’s the most likely culprit, but we can’t rule out other possibilities without further investigation. There are several factors that can contribute to increased bleeding risk, even with a stable Warfarin dose. We'll need to consider dietary changes, other medications you may have taken recently – even over-the-counter things like aspirin or ibuprofen – and less common causes like underlying liver or kidney issues. First, I want to review your recent lab work. Do you happen to know when your last INR was checked and what the value was?
PATIENT: Let me think… Dr. Ramirez's office called me about a week ago, I believe. The nurse said it was… 2.8. Yes, that's right. 2.8. She said it was "within range," but… I always thought the ideal range was a bit lower, wasn’t it? And I haven't taken anything for pain, not even aspirin. I avoid those things like the plague. I prefer to suffer in silence, frankly. It’s more… dignified. This doesn't make sense. 2.8 should be perfectly acceptable, shouldn’t it? What other possibilities are we looking at here? You mentioned liver or kidney issues… that sounds serious.
DOCTOR: An INR of 2.8 is within the therapeutic range, generally considered to be between 2.0 and 3.0 for most indications. However, given your bruising, it’s on the higher end, and could certainly be contributing. But it doesn’t fully explain the severity of the bruising. We’re not jumping to any conclusions about liver or kidney issues just yet. Those would require specific blood tests to investigate, and we’ll discuss those if necessary. But other possibilities include vitamin deficiencies – particularly vitamin K – and, less commonly, underlying bleeding disorders. Do you have any dietary restrictions?
PATIENT: Dietary restrictions? Not really. I eat… rather blandly, as I mentioned. Mostly chicken and vegetables. I haven't had a proper salad in months. But I do drink my fair share of tea. Green tea, specifically. And I occasionally indulge in a glass of red wine with dinner. But nothing excessive. As for vitamin supplements… I take a multivitamin now and then, but it's sporadic. I wouldn't say I have a consistent regimen. Could the tea be affecting it? I’ve heard some herbal remedies can interfere with medication. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: It's possible the green tea is a contributing factor. Green tea contains vitamin K, which can counteract the effects of Warfarin. However, the amount of vitamin K in a typical cup of green tea is unlikely to cause a significant change in your INR. It's more likely a combination of factors – the slightly elevated INR, the sporadic multivitamin use, and potentially other subtle influences. Given your concerns and the persistent bruising, I recommend a few additional blood tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to check your complete blood count to rule out any underlying anemia or platelet abnormalities, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function, and a vitamin K level. Would you be willing to proceed with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I’d rather know what I’m dealing with, even if the news isn’t pleasant. A comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and vitamin K level… sounds thorough. When can we get those done? And will I need to stop taking the Warfarin for any of them? I'm a scientist, remember? I understand the importance of data. Let's collect it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I've ordered the tests now. You don’t need to stop taking the Warfarin before the tests, but please inform the lab technician that you are on Warfarin when you go. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. Once we have those, we can discuss the findings and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and being mindful of any new bruising. Also, I'd like you to keep a detailed log of any medications, supplements, or herbal remedies you take, even occasional ones. And if you experience any signs of significant bleeding – such as blood in your stool or urine, prolonged nosebleeds, or excessive bleeding from cuts – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Avoid injury, detailed log, and watch for signs of bleeding. It's… a lot to keep track of, but I will do my best. And the lab results in 24-48 hours. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. It's reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll go home and… try not to bump into anything. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Mr. Farson. We'll discuss the results when they're available. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. .
