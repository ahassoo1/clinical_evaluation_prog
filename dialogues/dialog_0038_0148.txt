DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some… pain. Down there. In… well, you can probably tell from the chart, but… testicular pain. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. I’m not quite sure when it started, exactly. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, no need to be embarrassed at all. That’s what I’m here for. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Down there” is perfectly fine, and yes, I do see the note about testicular pain. When you say it comes and goes, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It’s… not constant. Sometimes I don’t notice it at all, especially when I’m… working. I do a lot of woodworking, you see. Keeps me busy. But then, other times… it’s a dull ache. And sometimes… a sharper pain. Not terribly sharp, but noticeable. It seems worse after I’ve been… on my feet a lot. Or lifting things, perhaps? It's hard to say for certain, honestly. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it’s intermittent, a dull ache most of the time, but can be sharper, and seems to be aggravated by activity – being on your feet or lifting. And you said it’s worse after working, which involves physical activity. Can you describe the location of the pain specifically?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specifics. That’s… difficult. It’s… in the… well, in the scrotum, I suppose. But… is it one side or the other? I… I honestly couldn’t say. It feels… general. Like… all over. Sometimes it feels more on the left, perhaps? But other times, it's hard to tell. I really apologize for not being more precise. It's just… a bit sensitive, and I don't really… pay attention to those things unless it's bothering me. And even then…
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Noelani. It's perfectly understandable. You're describing pain, and it can be hard to pinpoint exactly, especially in that area. "General discomfort in the scrotum, sometimes feeling more on the left" is good enough for now. Have you noticed any swelling, redness, or changes in the size or shape of either testicle?
PATIENT: Swelling… redness… Let me see… I haven’t… I don't think so. I haven’t really looked, if I’m honest. I just know when it hurts. I suppose I could have noticed swelling, but… I don’t recall anything obvious. And no, no changes in size, as far as I can remember. I haven't been… comparing them, you see. It's not something one does, usually. I really am sorry I can't be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. You're doing fine. It's good you haven’t noticed any obvious swelling or changes in size. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No nausea or vomiting. I've been a little… tired lately, but I put that down to getting older, and working long hours. Sometimes, I feel a bit… achy all over, but that's nothing new. I don’t think anything specific with the pain, no. Just the general tiredness and aches. Oh! Wait… sometimes, a little bit of discomfort in my lower back, but I thought that was from lifting things at work too. It's hard to separate it all, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, nausea, or vomiting. General tiredness and aches, and some lower back discomfort which you attribute to work. And those aches and tiredness are not necessarily linked to the pain?
PATIENT: That’s right. The tiredness and aches… they’re just… normal for me these days, I think. I’ve always been a bit prone to them when I overdo it. They don't feel directly related to the pain, no. It's more like… the pain is something separate. It comes and goes, and the tiredness is just… always there, a little bit. I hope that makes sense. I’m afraid I’m not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Noelani. You're explaining it very well. Okay, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. I’ve been to doctors, of course, for check-ups and… little things. But no… no major diagnoses, no. I’ve always been… reasonably healthy, I suppose. A little arthritis in my hands, the doctor said, a few years back, but nothing serious. And I had the flu once, like everyone else. But no… no real medical conditions. I don’t think so. Should there be something I’ve forgotten? My memory… is not what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: No, no need to worry about forgetting anything. It's good you've generally been healthy. And a little arthritis in your hands is helpful to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a single surgery. I've been very lucky, I think. I’ve always tried to be careful and avoid accidents, and thankfully, I’ve never needed to have one. No surgeries at all. I don't particularly like the idea of them, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a bit difficult. My family is… well, we’re from Colombia, you see. And we didn't… talk much about medical things. It wasn’t really… a custom. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. She had… heart problems, I think. And my father… he had diabetes. But beyond that… I don’t really know. I don’t recall anyone having… anything specific, like cancer or… testicular problems. I apologize for not being more helpful. It's not something we discussed much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. It's common for family medical history to be limited, especially if it wasn't frequently discussed. Heart problems and diabetes in your parents is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications, as far as I remember. And no… no food allergies or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything. I haven’t had any hives or… trouble breathing or anything like that. I'm quite fortunate in that regard as well. I've always been able to enjoy a good meal!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take any medications at all. I try to avoid them if I can. Just… a little ibuprofen now and then, if I have a headache. But that’s it. Nothing regular. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothing like that. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if possible. I like to stay as healthy as I can without relying on pills, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No regular medications. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, no, I don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner now and then, on special occasions. But nothing regular. And absolutely no… recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I try to live a… a clean life, if you understand. I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Noelani. It's good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course! I’m a woodworker. I’ve been doing it for… well, for a very long time now. I make furniture, mostly. Tables, chairs, dressers… I enjoy it very much. It keeps me busy, and I like creating things with my hands. It's a bit physical, lifting wood and… using tools, of course. But I enjoy the challenge. I work mostly alone in my workshop. It's quite peaceful. It’s a good life, if you don’t mind a little sawdust.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, physically demanding work, lifting wood and using tools. Now, just one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a rather personal question. Well, I… I am single. And I haven’t… been with anyone for… quite some time. A very long time. I apologize for being… evasive. It's just… not something I'm comfortable discussing. Is it… necessary?
DOCTOR: It is a relevant question, Noelani, as we’re trying to understand all potential causes for your pain. But it's perfectly alright if you’re not comfortable discussing it in detail. Knowing you're single and haven't been sexually active recently is enough information for now. Now, if you’re comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently examine your abdomen and, of course, your scrotum. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that’s alright. I understand. I suppose… I should do whatever is necessary to figure out what’s wrong. I’ll lie down on the table, then. Just… please be gentle? It's… a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take it slow, and you can let me know if anything is uncomfortable. If you could lie on your back, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Okay, no tenderness there. Now, I'm going to examine your scrotum. Please relax as much as you can. I notice some mild tenderness on the left side. The left testicle feels slightly larger than the right, but it's not significantly so. I don’t feel any obvious masses or lumps. There’s no redness or swelling. However, I do notice a subtle thickening along the spermatic cord on the left side. It's difficult to say what it is without further investigation. Okay, Noelani. Everything seems relatively normal, but that thickening along the spermatic cord is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh… yes, that’s… a little tender. On the left side, as you said. It's… hard to explain. It doesn't hurt all the time, just… when you press on it. A thickening… is that… bad? What does that mean? Is it serious? I apologize for being… anxious. It's just… I don’t like the sound of “thickening.” What do we need to do now?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Noelani. It's understandable. "Thickening" doesn't necessarily mean something serious, but it does warrant further investigation to rule out any potential problems. It could be a number of things, including a small varicocele – which is an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum – or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a scrotal ultrasound. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the structures inside your scrotum. It will help us determine the cause of the thickening and rule out any other abnormalities. I'm also going to order a urine test to check for any signs of infection. And, just to be on the safe side, I’d like to check your PSA levels with a blood test. This is a marker that can sometimes be elevated in cases of prostate problems, but it can also be affected by other factors. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… a urine test… and a blood test… yes, that sounds… alright. If that’s what you think is necessary, then… yes. I want to know what’s going on, of course. I just… I hope it’s not anything too serious. Will it… will it be painful? The tests, I mean. And… how long will it take to get the results? I apologize for asking so many questions. I'm just… a little frightened.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Noelani. It’s good you’re speaking up about your concerns. None of these tests should be painful. The ultrasound is completely non-invasive – it just involves applying a gel to your scrotum and moving a probe over it. The urine test is just a simple sample you'll provide in a cup. And the blood test is just a quick needle prick in your arm. As for the results, the urine test usually comes back within a day or two. The blood test results typically take a few days, and the ultrasound results can take a little longer, depending on the radiologist's schedule – usually around 3-5 business days. Once we have all the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me. And for… not making me feel foolish about being worried. It’s… a relief to finally know what’s going on, even if it’s just the beginning. I’ll… I’ll schedule the tests with the receptionist, then. And I’ll contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help. And you didn't feel foolish at all – it's always better to get things checked out, and your concerns are valid. The receptionist will be happy to schedule those tests for you. If you have any trouble, please don’t hesitate to ask them to contact me. Take care, Noelani. And remember, I’m here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Goodbye.
