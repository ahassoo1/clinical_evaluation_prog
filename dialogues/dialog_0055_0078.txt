DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you're with Medicare, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. Good morning to you as well. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I do have Medicare, and I believe all my information is current.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I understand you've come in today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you here?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, it’s a little difficult to explain… I just feel… not my best, you understand? Like I need a… a fresh start, a jumpstart. I’ve been feeling sluggish and just… off, for a while now. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s going on and get me back to feeling like myself again. It’s not one specific thing, more of a general… lack of vitality, perhaps?
DOCTOR: “Lack of vitality.” Hmm. Vague symptoms are… troublesome. While I appreciate your… poetic description, Ms. Pitzel, we need to be more precise for a proper assessment. When did this “sluggishness” begin?
PATIENT: That’s fair, Doctor. Precision is good. Let me think… it’s been building for perhaps six months, maybe a little longer. It started subtly, just feeling more tired than usual. I attributed it to the change in seasons, honestly. But it hasn’t really lifted with the warmer weather. It's… more consistent now. It’s less about being tired and more about… everything feeling like it takes more effort. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… marginally more descriptive. And this increased “effort” – can you give me a specific example?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Well, for instance, I work with clay, shaping and casting… it’s physical work, but I’ve done it for years. Lately, even a small project feels… draining. My hands ache more quickly, and I find myself needing longer breaks. It’s not arthritis, I don’t think. It’s just… the energy expenditure feels higher than it should. Even things around the house, gardening, walking… they all require more conscious effort than they used to. It’s… frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: So, increased fatigue with physical exertion. And no joint pain, you say?
PATIENT: No, not joint pain exactly. A little stiffness sometimes, especially in the mornings, but not pain. More like… a lack of lubrication, if that makes any sense? It's not sharp or throbbing, just… not as smooth as it should be. And it’s not consistent. Some days are better than others, but the overall trend is… downward.
DOCTOR: “Not as smooth as it should be.” Right. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been sleeping alright, I suppose. Not the best sleep, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but nothing drastic. My appetite has been a little lower than usual, but I haven't lost any weight that I've noticed. Perhaps a little more forgetful, but I am getting older, you know? It’s hard to say what's normal aging and what’s… something else. Oh! And I’ve been a little more irritable, I think my husband would agree. He’s been very patient, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Irritability, decreased appetite, occasional insomnia… and you've noticed no actual weight loss. I see. Now, Ms. Pitzel, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that is a bit personal, isn’t it? Um… yes, actually. A little. I’ve been… less regular, I suppose. More constipation than anything. Not severe, but definitely a change from my usual routine. I just assumed it was… the change in diet, perhaps? I haven't paid much attention to it, to be honest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Pitzel. Now, before we proceed, let's review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, hypertension, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I see my primary care physician for annual check-ups, and he’s never mentioned any concerns. I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. My husband handles most of the paperwork, so I'm not always certain of the specifics. He would have a better understanding of my complete medical record, if that helps.
DOCTOR: “Relatively healthy,” you say. Let’s see what your primary care physician has documented. It appears your last full physical was approximately eight months ago. No significant findings reported. No chronic conditions listed. And no surgical history noted. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… some heart trouble later in life, I believe. She developed arrhythmia, I think it was called. And my father had diabetes, but it was diagnosed fairly late in his life as well. Other than that… my grandparents lived long lives, but I don’t recall any specific hereditary conditions. I’m not very familiar with our family medical history, to be honest. My mother wasn’t one to discuss those things. I apologize for my lack of precision. It seems I’m not much help with the details.
DOCTOR: “Not much help,” you say. It appears your primary care physician also noted a similar lack of detailed family history. Now, let’s discuss your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. Never have. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit about twenty years ago. He's very health-conscious now. We both enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but nothing excessive. And we try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. We enjoy gardening, actually, which helps with that. Is that helpful information? I’m trying to recall anything that might be relevant.
DOCTOR: “Trying to recall…” Very well. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I haven’t needed any regular medication, thankfully. Just over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for a headache, but that’s it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? That’s one of the reasons I’m here, I suppose. I’m hoping you can help me figure out what’s causing this imbalance and restore my natural vitality.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Pitzel, given your symptoms and your medical history – or lack thereof – it appears we have a somewhat… nonspecific presentation. To proceed, I'm going to need to conduct a physical examination. If you'll please step up on the table, we'll begin with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I hope I’m not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is within normal limits, although slightly elevated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no palpable masses. Slightly decreased bowel sounds. Reflexes are normal. Neurological function appears intact. Your reflexes appear normal, and I don't detect any significant neurological deficits. I'm going to check your thyroid now. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no palpable nodules.
PATIENT: Slightly enlarged? That's… new. I hadn't noticed anything. Is that concerning, Doctor? My mother had some thyroid issues later in life, I believe. Not sure what exactly, but I recall her taking some sort of medication for it. Is it possible it could be hereditary? I'm starting to feel a little anxious, if I'm honest. I just want to know what's going on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: It is possible. Thyroid enlargement, or goiter, can be hereditary, and given your mother’s history, it warrants further investigation. However, it could also be due to a number of other factors. Now, to get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a T4 level. These tests will help us assess your thyroid function and identify any underlying abnormalities. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. Blood tests are fine. Whatever you think is necessary, I’m happy to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again. Hopefully, these tests will give us some answers. When can I expect the results? And what happens after that? I’m a little worried, honestly, but I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within approximately three to five business days. Once I have them, I will review them carefully and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further testing, such as a thyroid ultrasound or a referral to an endocrinologist. For now, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and managing your stress levels. I will send the lab order to your primary care physician's office, and they will contact you to schedule the blood draw. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. That all sounds… reasonable. Thank you for your time and for listening to my concerns. I appreciate you taking me seriously, even if I wasn’t very precise with my descriptions. I’ll wait to hear from my primary care physician about the blood tests. Hopefully, it won't be too long. Thank you again.
