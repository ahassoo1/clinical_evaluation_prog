DOCTOR: Hi Odell, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um… hi. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. I… need some shots? For travel. My wife… she booked it. She always did the planning. I don't really remember where we’re going. Something… far away?
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccines. That makes sense. No worries at all about not remembering the specifics, we can figure it out. First, let’s get some basic information down. You said your wife booked the travel, do you know when you're traveling?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates. Always with the dates. I think… September? Maybe October? She told me. A few weeks from now, definitely. Not… winter time. She hated the cold. It was a surprise trip, you see. She liked surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, September or October. That gives us a little bit of a window. And where are you traveling to, if you recall even a general region?
PATIENT: Ugh… Somewhere hot. Really hot. With… monkeys? And old rocks. She showed me pictures, lots of pictures. It was… Africa, I think? Or maybe India? Both have monkeys, right? It was… a long flight. A very long flight.
DOCTOR: Okay, hot climate, monkeys, old rocks, and a very long flight… that narrows it down a bit! It sounds like it could be several places in Africa or Southeast Asia. To make sure we get the right vaccinations, do you happen to know the country you're visiting?
PATIENT: No, I… I really don’t. She just handed me a paper with the appointment time and told me to come. She did everything. I just… went with her. Is it important? Can’t you just… give me all the shots? Just in case?
DOCTOR: It is important, Odell, but not to worry. Giving the right vaccines depends on the specific region, to protect you from the diseases common there. “Just in case” isn’t really how it works, as some vaccines aren't suitable for everyone, and some have side effects we need to consider based on where you’re going. Okay, let’s take a step back then. Since we're unsure of the destination, let's go over your general medical history. Have you had any vaccinations recently, like a tetanus booster or a flu shot?
PATIENT: I don’t think so. Not that I remember. She… she always kept track of that stuff. Doctors, shots, everything. I just… showed up when she told me to. I had the usual when I was a kid, I guess. But… that was a long time ago. I haven't been sick… much. A cold now and then. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. We’ll definitely want to update your records and get you properly protected. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies. I don’t think so. She always asked me that too, before giving me anything. I… I ate everything. She liked to try new foods. Spicy things, weird fruits… Sometimes my stomach didn't like it, but… I wasn't allergic, exactly. Just… sensitive. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound like an allergy, more like a sensitive stomach! We’re looking for things like hives, difficulty breathing, or a serious reaction after taking medication. So, no known allergies then?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any. She always double-checked. She was very careful. Too careful, sometimes. But… it was good. It was always good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not really. Just… pain pills sometimes. For my back. It gets sore when it’s cold. But I don't take them often. Just when it’s really bad. She bought them at the… the store. The one with the red sign? I don't remember the name.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain pills occasionally for back pain. Do you know what’s in the pain pills, or the dosage you take?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. She just… gave me the pills. Told me how many to take. I never asked. I just… took them when I needed to. It was easier that way. She handled everything. What is a dosage? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know the dosage, Odell, just to be sure it’s safe and doesn’t interact with anything else. It’s on the bottle, usually in milligrams – like 200mg or 500mg. And the name of the medication is also printed on the label. Okay, let’s shift gears a bit. While we try to figure out the medication, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. She always said I was healthy, but… she also said a lot of things. I just want to go home. This is… stressful.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll make it as quick as possible. If you could just sit up here for me, and we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Now I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Everything sounds clear. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, a little. It always hurts there. She said it was… gas. Or something. She gave me some pills for that too. The red ones. They didn't really work, though. It still hurts sometimes. Especially when it’s cold. Or when I’m stressed. Like now.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness in your abdomen. And the red pills didn’t seem to help much. We may want to look into that further. Do you have any other symptoms with the abdominal pain, like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes. Sometimes I feel… bloated. Like I’m going to explode. And… sometimes I have trouble going to the bathroom. Mostly trouble. It’s… uncomfortable. But I don’t want to talk about it. She always made fun of me for it. Said I ate too much spicy food.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Odell, you don’t have to share anything you’re not comfortable with. It's good to know, though. We can definitely address that. I’m just going to check your lymph nodes now. These are small glands that can sometimes swell when you’re sick. Do you notice any lumps or bumps anywhere on your body?
PATIENT: Ugh, lumps and bumps. No. Not that I know of. She always checked me over too, when I complained about something. She was very thorough. Sometimes she would poke and prod for a long time. It was… annoying. But she said it was important. I just want to know what shots I need. And then go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything feels normal there. Odell, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’ve been managing a lot on your own, and relying on your wife to handle your medical care. It's understandable that you're feeling stressed and unsure of what’s going on. Right now, it’s difficult to recommend specific travel vaccines without knowing your destination. But, given your abdominal discomfort and occasional constipation, I think it would be beneficial to do some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Also, we should try and get a more accurate list of what medications you have taken, even if it is just what’s on the bottles. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Ugh… blood work? More poking and prodding? I guess so. If it means I can finally get the shots and go home. But… can’t you just give me all the shots? Just in case? Like I said before. I don't want to come back here again. It's… it's hard, being here. It reminds me… never mind. Just… give me the shots. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand how you feel, Odell. And I wish I could just give you all the shots and be done with it. But giving vaccines without knowing your travel destination and your overall health could potentially be harmful. It's my responsibility to ensure you receive the safest and most appropriate care. I'm going to order the blood work now. It will help us rule out any underlying issues causing your abdominal discomfort. And, while we wait for the results, let's see if we can locate the bottles of the medications you've been taking. Even the labels will give us some valuable information. The lab is just down the hall, and it shouldn’t take long. We can discuss your travel options further once we have the results. In the meantime, I’m going to write a note for you to take with you, just in case you remember any details about your destination while you're at home. It includes a list of questions to help jog your memory. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry. And yes, the note is fine. I probably won't remember anything, but… whatever. This is… a lot. I miss her. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Odell. It is a lot. And it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Here’s the lab order, and this note has some questions to help you remember details about your trip. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very gentle. And, again, please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or concerns. I'm very sorry for your loss, Odell. If you’d like to talk about it, I'm here to listen. But I understand if you'd prefer to focus on getting you the care you need right now. For now, let's focus on getting those lab results. Is there anything else I can do for you at this moment?
