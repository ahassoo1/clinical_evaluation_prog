DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s probably nothing, but my daughter insisted. She worries too much. It’s my… well, my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. Is that what this is about? Just tell me if it’s serious and if I need to stop the pills. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Black, tarry stools are never “probably nothing,” Ms. Hatchard. It’s good your daughter is attentive. While your pain medication could be a factor, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. First, let’s clarify a few things. How long have you noticed this change in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, I don't know exactly. A couple of weeks, maybe? I don't spend my time looking at my stool, Doctor. It's just…darker than usual. And I told you, I take pills all the time. Strong ones. Are you saying it's not the pills? Because if it's not the pills, I don't see why I'm even here. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, but dismissing this as “probably nothing” is irresponsible. “Strong pills” don’t negate the possibility of internal bleeding. Two weeks is significant. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Internal bleeding? Now you're just trying to scare me. No, I haven’t noticed anything else. I'm tired, of course, but I’m 73! What do you expect? And my stomach… sometimes it feels a bit funny, but that’s probably just the pills again. Honestly, Doctor, are you going to tell me what's wrong or are we just going to sit here and talk about my age and my pills all day?
DOCTOR: We are attempting to determine the cause of your symptoms, Ms. Hatchard. “Funny” is not a helpful description. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a dull ache, I suppose. Comes and goes. Like indigestion, but… lower down. And it’s not pain, Doctor, it’s just… uncomfortable. Really, I’ve had worse aches after gardening. Look, are you going to poke me or something? Because if you are, just get it over with. I have a pot roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: We will need to perform a physical examination, Ms. Hatchard. And given the black stools, a stool test to check for blood is essential. We’ll also need to review your medication list thoroughly. Before we proceed, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. More tests? Honestly! Well… maybe a little dizzy sometimes, but that's just getting up too fast. Old age, you know. And no, I haven’t been sick. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine, apart from this… stool issue. Just tell me if I can keep taking my pills or not. That’s all I need to know. And please, hurry it up. My pot roast is going to burn.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, continuing your current medication without investigating this further is not advisable. We need to rule out a gastrointestinal bleed. I’m going to need to palpate your abdomen, listen to your bowel sounds, and check your vital signs. Then, we'll collect a stool sample. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright! Poke and prod, whatever you have to do. Just… be quick about it. And try not to make a mess. Honestly, this is ridiculous. My pot roast is definitely going to be ruined now. And I’m still not convinced it’s not just the pills. You young doctors always jump to the worst conclusions. Just… get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll begin with your abdominal palpation. And while I appreciate your… perspective, Ms. Hatchard, it is my professional responsibility to investigate all potential causes of your symptoms. It would be negligent of me to assume anything without a thorough examination. I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Relax your abdomen.
