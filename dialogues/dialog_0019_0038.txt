DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Renzi. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I believe I am here to discuss some paperwork regarding… future care, perhaps? It’s a bit hazy, truthfully. I was advised to obtain an Advance Directive, or possibly a POLST form… something to that effect. My ex-husband mentioned it, and I believe it’s prudent to have things in order. Though, I confess, I don’t entirely understand what’s involved.
DOCTOR: Right, paperwork… advance care planning. It is very sensible to get that sorted. It’s wonderful you’re thinking ahead. Yes, an Advance Directive and a POLST form are both good options, depending on your needs and wishes. It is a bit complicated, isn't it?
PATIENT: Indeed. Complicated is… a fair assessment. I seem to have trouble retaining details these days. My ex-husband, he was always the organized one. He explained… something about making choices now, in case I am unable to later. But the specifics… they’ve unfortunately slipped my mind. Perhaps you could explain the difference between the two forms? And whether I might need both?
DOCTOR: Certainly. No need to apologize at all – memory can be tricky, and these things are a lot to take in. Let’s break it down. An Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – is a document that outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to make decisions yourself. It covers a broader range of potential scenarios. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a bit more specific. It’s a medical order, based on your wishes, that tells healthcare providers what treatments you want or don’t want if you have a serious illness or condition. Generally, a POLST form is for people with a limited life expectancy or a serious health condition. An Advance Directive is a good idea for everyone, really. Does that distinction make a little sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. The Advance Directive is… the more encompassing one, for general scenarios. And the POLST form is for… more immediate, serious situations. A medical order, you said? So, if I were to… hypothetically… become gravely ill, the POLST form would be the one healthcare professionals would consult to understand my wishes right away? While the Advance Directive… requires a bit more interpretation, perhaps? I apologize if I’m phrasing this awkwardly. It’s all rather… abstract when one is perfectly healthy, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: You're phrasing it perfectly, Evann. Not awkward at all. You’ve got the gist of it exactly right. The POLST form is a direct medical order – it’s very clear and concise for immediate use in a crisis. The Advance Directive can be a bit more nuanced; it’s more about your overall values and preferences, and sometimes requires some interpretation from your healthcare team and loved ones. It is easier to think about when you're feeling well, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. I believe… given my somewhat… unreliable memory, and the fact that I am generally healthy, perhaps the Advance Directive would be the more suitable option for me at this time? I would prefer a document that… outlines my wishes clearly, even if it requires a bit of discussion later. Would that be a reasonable approach?
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable, Evann. An Advance Directive is an excellent choice in your situation. We can go through it section by section, and I can help you articulate your wishes clearly. It’s a really good idea to think about things like what kind of medical treatments you would want, or not want, in various scenarios. Before we start that though, just to be thorough, let’s quickly run through some basics. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing significant, at least. I’ve never experienced a severe reaction to anything. I occasionally get a mild itch from certain fabrics, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? I apologize if I’m being vague. My memory… it’s a frustratingly imprecise instrument. Is there a particular medication I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Evann. It’s perfectly fine. And no, no specific medication – just checking for anything common. Mild itching from fabrics doesn’t count! Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I strive to maintain a… natural lifestyle, as much as possible. No prescription medications, no vitamins, no supplements. Just… a great deal of herbal tea. Does that count? I realize this is rather unusual, given my age, but I’ve always preferred a… holistic approach to wellness.
DOCTOR: Herbal tea doesn't count! That's wonderful, actually. It's less common, but a perfectly healthy choice. So, no medications at all. Okay, good to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… To be perfectly honest, Doctor Renzi, it’s… remarkably unremarkable. I’ve always been quite fortunate in terms of health. I had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox – but nothing serious. No hospitalizations, no major surgeries. I did experience a rather severe bout of bronchitis several years ago, while traveling in Mongolia, but that resolved with rest and… traditional remedies. Otherwise, I’ve been… consistently healthy, thankfully. Is there anything specific you’re concerned about? I apologize if I’m being… elusive. It’s simply difficult to recall details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Evann. "Consistently healthy" is a wonderful thing to hear! And no, no specific concerns, just routine questions. It's helpful to know about the bronchitis, though – was that treated with antibiotics at all, or solely with rest and traditional remedies?
PATIENT: No antibiotics, Doctor Renzi. Solely with rest and… the traditional remedies practiced by the nomadic communities in the region. Lots of herbal infusions, warm compresses, and… a great deal of silence. It was a rather isolating experience, but ultimately quite effective. It took several weeks to fully recover, but I managed to avoid a visit to a hospital, thankfully. I believe my ex-husband would have been… quite relieved. He was always concerned about my… unconventional approach to healthcare.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no antibiotics for the bronchitis. That's good to know. It sounds like you recovered well, and it's good you were able to manage it without hospital intervention. And it's perfectly fine to prefer alternative approaches, as long as they're safe and effective. Now, moving on, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… a bit more complicated. My parents both passed away several years ago. My father… he had a heart condition, I believe. It was… quite sudden. My mother… she suffered from arthritis, a rather debilitating condition. And I had an aunt… on my father’s side… who developed dementia later in life. Beyond that… I don’t have a great deal of information. My family was… not particularly forthcoming about medical details. It was considered rather… impolite to discuss such things, I believe. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I apologize if I’m being vague once again. It’s… frustrating, to be unable to recall such important information.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Evann. It's perfectly understandable that family medical history isn't always readily available. And it's also common for families to be private about those things. Heart condition, arthritis, and dementia… that's helpful to know. We'll make a note of those. Did either of your parents experience the onset of these conditions early in life – before the age of 60, perhaps?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. My father was… in his late seventies when he experienced his heart condition. And my mother… she developed arthritis later in life, in her eighties, I believe. And my aunt… she was well into her nineties when she was diagnosed with dementia. So, a later onset for all three conditions, thankfully. Is that… reassuring? I apologize if I’m asking a foolish question. I’m not entirely certain what constitutes… reassuring in this context.
DOCTOR: That is reassuring, Evann. A later onset is generally a positive sign. It doesn't eliminate the risk, of course, but it does suggest that there may not be a strong genetic predisposition in your case. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can move on to discussing your Advance Directive. Are you currently a smoker?
PATIENT: A smoker? Goodness, no. I have never smoked a cigarette in my life. I find the habit… rather distasteful, to be perfectly honest. My ex-husband, however, was a rather dedicated smoker. But I always insisted he refrain from smoking indoors, naturally. It’s… a rather unhealthy habit, as I’m sure you’ll agree.
DOCTOR: I wholeheartedly agree. A very sensible stance to take. And good for you for maintaining a smoke-free lifestyle! Now, how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol consumption… I partake in alcohol… very occasionally. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. But I wouldn’t describe myself as a drinker, certainly. I prefer herbal tea, as you may recall. My ex-husband, however, was rather fond of a good scotch. But I always limited his consumption, naturally. It’s… a rather potent beverage, as I’m sure you’ll agree.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very balanced approach to things! And yes, scotch can be rather potent! One last question, and then we can get to the Advance Directive. Do you have any current physical limitations or chronic pain?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I have no current physical limitations and experience no chronic pain. I am… remarkably agile for my age, if I may say so myself. I enjoy long walks and… tending to my garden. I do occasionally experience a slight ache in my lower back after a long day of gardening, but that’s hardly a limitation, is it?
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Evann! It sounds like you're very active and healthy. No, a slight ache after gardening doesn’t count! Okay, so we’ve covered the basics. No allergies, no current medications, unremarkable past medical history, no family history of early-onset conditions, and no current physical limitations. Now, let's talk about your Advance Directive. This document allows you to express your wishes regarding medical treatment if you become unable to make decisions for yourself. It’s really about ensuring your values and preferences are respected, even when you can’t speak for yourself. Are you ready to start discussing that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Renzi. I am ready. I may not possess a comprehensive recollection of past events, but I am quite capable of expressing my wishes for the future. I believe it’s prudent to have such a document in place, regardless of my… imperfect memory. It’s about peace of mind, isn’t it? Ensuring my wishes are honored, even when I am unable to articulate them myself. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It is about peace of mind, and ensuring your values are respected. We'll go through this section by section. It may seem a little daunting at first, but we’ll take it at your pace. First, we need to consider the types of medical treatments you would or would not want in various situations. For example, if you were seriously ill and unable to speak, would you want to be kept alive by artificial means, such as a ventilator or feeding tube?
PATIENT: That is… a rather difficult question, Doctor Renzi. I believe… in general, I would prefer to avoid prolonged life support if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. I value quality of life above all else, and I would not wish to be kept alive indefinitely in a state of… diminished capacity. However, I would appreciate a reasonable attempt to alleviate pain and suffering, even if that means utilizing artificial means for a limited period. I would not wish to be abandoned, naturally. Is that… sufficiently clear? It’s difficult to articulate such abstract concepts, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Evann. You’ve expressed your wishes beautifully. So, you would want comfort care and pain management, even if that requires temporary life support, but you wouldn't want prolonged life support without a reasonable chance of recovery. That's a very thoughtful and reasonable position to take. We’ll document that specifically. Next, let’s consider resuscitation. If your heart stopped beating, would you want us to attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… I believe… in general, I would prefer not to undergo CPR if there is no reasonable prospect of meaningful recovery. I understand it can be a traumatic procedure, and I would not wish to prolong my suffering unnecessarily. However, I would appreciate a reasonable attempt to alleviate pain and discomfort, even during the process. And I would not wish to be abandoned, naturally. Is that… sufficiently clear? It’s difficult to articulate such abstract concepts, isn’t it? It feels… rather morbid to discuss such things, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Evann, and you're articulating your wishes perfectly. It's perfectly normal to feel a little uncomfortable discussing these things. It is morbid, but it's also incredibly important. So, no CPR if there's no reasonable chance of recovery, but with continued comfort care and pain management. Now, let’s move onto a slightly different topic. Would you want us to attempt any aggressive medical interventions – such as surgery or chemotherapy – if you were seriously ill, or would you prefer a more palliative approach, focusing on comfort and symptom management?
PATIENT: Aggressive medical interventions… I believe… in general, I would prefer a more palliative approach if there is no reasonable prospect of a meaningful recovery. I value quality of life above all else, and I would not wish to undergo prolonged and potentially debilitating treatments if they are unlikely to improve my condition significantly. However, I would be open to considering less invasive treatments if they are likely to alleviate pain and discomfort. And I would not wish to be denied reasonable medical care, naturally. Is that… sufficiently clear? It’s difficult to articulate such abstract concepts, isn’t it? It feels… rather daunting to consider such possibilities, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: That is very clear, Evann, and perfectly reasonable. You've expressed your wishes beautifully. So, a preference for palliative care with comfort management, but open to considering less invasive treatments if they offer pain relief. We're getting through this nicely. Now, let's talk about who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to do so yourself. Do you have a designated healthcare proxy or power of attorney?
PATIENT: A designated healthcare proxy… That is… a difficult question, Doctor Renzi. My ex-husband, he… handled most of the legal matters during our marriage. I believe he may have been designated as my healthcare proxy at one point, but we… divorced several years ago. And we haven’t… maintained contact since. I do have a sister, however. She lives in Mongolia, and we… communicate occasionally. She is… quite level-headed and responsible. Would she be… a suitable candidate? I haven’t discussed this with her, naturally. Is that… a viable option? It feels… rather daunting to entrust such a responsibility to someone, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly viable, Evann. Your sister sounds like a good candidate. It's perfectly normal to feel a little apprehensive about entrusting someone with such a responsibility. We can document her as your potential healthcare proxy, and it would be a good idea for you to discuss this with her, if you feel comfortable doing so. We'll need her name and contact information. If she's not readily available, we can also document a secondary proxy. Do you have her full name and contact information available?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Her name is… Ariun BUURD. B-U-U-R-D. Ariun Buurd. She lives in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Her address is… Let me see… I have a handwritten note somewhere… Here we are. Her address is… Peace Avenue, Apartment 12, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. And her phone number is… +976-99123456. I believe that is correct. Is that… sufficient information? I apologize if I’m being… disorganized. It’s difficult to recall such details, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Evann. Ariun Buurd – Peace Avenue, Apartment 12, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, +976-99123456. Okay, so we have your wishes regarding life support, resuscitation, aggressive interventions, and your designated healthcare proxy. We’ve covered a lot today. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss, or are you comfortable with how things stand?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Renzi. I believe that is… sufficient for the time being. I feel… remarkably relieved to have these matters documented. It’s about peace of mind, isn’t it? Knowing that my wishes will be respected, even when I am unable to articulate them myself. I appreciate your patience and guidance throughout this process. It’s difficult to discuss such abstract concepts, isn’t it? But you have made it… remarkably manageable. I suppose… we can proceed with finalizing the document? And perhaps… I can obtain a copy for my records?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. We'll finalize the document now. I’ll print out a copy for your records, and I'll also upload it to your electronic health record. It’s perfectly normal to want a copy for yourself. Here you go. Please read it over carefully and make sure everything is accurate. If you have any questions or want to make changes, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Renzi. Everything appears to be… accurate, yes. I appreciate your attention to detail. No, that will be all for today. I believe… I am quite satisfied with how things stand. Thank you again for your patience and guidance. It has been… remarkably helpful. Have a pleasant day, Doctor Renzi.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure assisting you. I’m glad we were able to get this done. And you have a pleasant day as well. Don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions in the future.
