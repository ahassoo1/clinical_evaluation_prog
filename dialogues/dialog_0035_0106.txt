DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it's about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A long time troublesome, actually. I’ve had this sore for months now, and it just won’t go away. Honestly, I’ve seen doctors before for it, but they didn’t seem to understand. It's probably because of the sugar, you know. The diabetes. But still, it shouldn't be this bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been bothering you for months, and you’re concerned it’s related to your diabetes. I understand. It’s good you’re bringing it to my attention. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the sore itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… it's not a nice sore, Doctor. It’s on the bottom of my foot, right about here. It started small, like a little cut, but it just…opened up. Now it’s red, and sometimes it…weeps, I suppose you’d call it. And it hurts, naturally. Especially when I walk. Though, at my age, everything hurts. But this is…different. It smells a bit too, if I'm being honest. Not pleasant. I keep it bandaged, of course, but the bandages get…stained.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s on the bottom of your foot, it started as a small cut and has opened up, is red, sometimes weeps, smells, and causes pain with walking. You've been keeping it bandaged, and the bandages are getting stained. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms with your foot, like numbness, tingling, or changes in color?
PATIENT: Numbness… well, sometimes my feet feel a little…sleepy. But that happens anyway, you know? The sugar does things to your nerves. I've been told. Changes in color… I suppose it's a bit paler around the sore, but that's probably just because there isn't much…life there. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t spend all day examining my feet. I have better things to do. It hurts, that’s the main thing. And it won’t heal. That’s what worries me. I don’t want to lose my foot, you know. I've heard stories…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're not wanting to ignore this. The numbness and paleness could be related to your diabetes, as you mentioned. We definitely need to take a closer look. I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your foot. I’ll need to gently examine the sore itself and check the circulation in your foot. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. But be gentle, Doctor. I bruise easily. And don’t poke around too much. I can feel things, you know. I may be old, but I'm not senseless. Just…be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And explain what you're doing, I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. Okay, I’m just going to gently feel around the area around the sore to see how deep it is and if there's any warmth or swelling. Hmm, there is some warmth and a little bit of swelling. And it does seem quite deep. Now, I’m going to check the pulses in your foot to make sure the circulation is good. Your pulses are present, but they are a bit weak. That's something we'll need to keep an eye on. The sore itself appears to be ulcerated, and there is some surrounding redness. It does have a slightly foul odor. Based on what I’m seeing and hearing, and given your history of diabetes, this looks like a diabetic foot ulcer. It’s important that we get this properly cared for to prevent infection and potential complications.
PATIENT: Diabetic foot ulcer, you say? Well, that sounds… unpleasant. I knew it was something bad. I told the other doctors it was serious. They just kept giving me creams and telling me to keep it clean. Creams don’t fix everything, you know. What does “properly cared for” mean, exactly? Am I going to need surgery? Because I don’t want surgery. I’ve heard terrible things. And what about this…infection you mentioned? Is it bad? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions. "Properly cared for" means a few things. First, we need to keep the wound clean and protected to allow it to heal. That usually involves special dressings and offloading pressure from the area – perhaps with a special shoe or walking boot. I don’t believe surgery is necessary at this time, but we need to prevent it from becoming that serious. The risk of infection is definitely there, especially with diabetes, and that’s why we need to be proactive. Right now, I don’t see any clear signs of a severe infection – no fever, no redness spreading up your leg, no pus – but we need to rule it out with some tests. I’d like to order a wound culture to see if there are any bacteria present, and a blood test to check for signs of infection in your body. We'll also need to check your blood sugar levels to make sure they are well-controlled. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests, of course. More tests. Honestly, it's always tests with doctors. Fine. Do your tests. But I don't want any needles bigger than necessary. And tell me what the results mean. Don't just give me a bunch of medical jargon. Explain it to me like I'm a…a reasonably intelligent person. And what about this shoe you mentioned? Will it be comfortable? I can’t be walking around in something that’s going to cause me more pain. I have enough pain as it is. And how long is all this going to take? I don't want to be coming back here every week for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We will use the smallest needle possible for the blood draw, I assure you. I will explain the results in plain language, I promise. The wound culture will tell us what kind of bacteria, if any, are present in the sore, so we can choose the right antibiotic if needed. The blood test will look for signs of infection, like elevated white blood cell count. The special shoe—or walking boot—is designed to take pressure off the ulcer to allow it to heal. We’ll need to get your foot measured properly to ensure it fits comfortably. It might take some getting used to, but it's crucial for healing. As for how long this will take, it’s difficult to say definitively. Healing can vary depending on many factors, including your blood sugar control, circulation, and the severity of the ulcer. We will monitor your progress closely and adjust the treatment plan as needed. We will likely need to see you regularly – perhaps weekly at first – to assess healing and change the dressings. I'm going to have my nurse draw the blood and get a swab of the sore. Then, we'll schedule an appointment with a podiatrist to get fitted for a proper shoe. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. The sooner we get this done, the sooner I can go home. And make sure this podiatrist is… competent. I don’t want someone poking around who doesn’t know what they’re doing. And remind them to be gentle! Honestly, doctors these days… they all seem to forget you’re a person, not just a…a collection of ailments. Just… hurry up, please. I’m getting tired of sitting here. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns and that the podiatrist we refer you to is highly qualified. I’ll have her come in right away to draw the blood. And again, I apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you for your patience, Louine. We will do everything we can to get this under control. .
