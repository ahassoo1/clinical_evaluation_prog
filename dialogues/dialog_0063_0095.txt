DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, well, good morning to you. Look, I don’t usually come to doctors, but this… this is rather upsetting. I woke up yesterday and couldn’t hear a thing out of my left ear. And my face feels… droopy. It’s quite noticeable, really.
DOCTOR: Upsetting, you say. Yes, well, these things happen. Let’s get this over with. You mentioned difficulty hearing and… facial drooping. Drooping how exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s quite obvious, isn’t it? When I smile, the left side barely moves. And it feels…weak. Like I’ve had a stroke or something, though I'm quite healthy, thank you very much. I eat very well, and I exercise regularly. It’s just… alarming. I haven’t felt this off in years.
DOCTOR: "Quite healthy," you say. That is… encouraging. Though self-assessment is rarely accurate. A stroke is… a possibility, of course. We'll need to rule that out. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… no fever, no headache, nothing like that. Just the ear and the face. Oh, and maybe a little dizziness when I stand up quickly, but I always assumed that was just my age. I'm not a spring chicken anymore, you know. It's just… it came on so suddenly. It's very disruptive, especially with everything I have going on.
DOCTOR: Dizziness. Right. And this occurred…yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday morning. I woke up, and it was just… there. I initially thought maybe I’d slept on my ear funny, but it hasn’t improved at all. And honestly, it's rather frightening. It's not like I have time for this nonsense. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick examination. Please have a seat on the examination table. I need to assess the facial nerves. And try not to exaggerate your symptoms; it makes things unnecessarily difficult.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to examine me? After all this questioning? Honestly. Fine. But I assure you, I am not exaggerating. This is quite real, and quite inconvenient. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Please follow my penlight with your eyes. Do not move your head. And try to relax. Now, try to close your eyes tightly. Do both sides close equally?
PATIENT: Well, of course they don't close equally! That’s the whole problem, isn’t it? The left side feels… weaker. It doesn’t close as firmly. It’s quite obvious when you look closely. Are you even looking?
DOCTOR: Yes, I am observing. And it appears you are correct. There is some weakness on the left side. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Do you need a magnifying glass? It’s hardly subtle. Honestly, I don't understand why I even need to demonstrate these things. It's clear as day. Can we please get to what’s causing this? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now I'm going to examine your ear canal. It’s a simple procedure, just to rule out any obvious infection. Nurse, could you please assist with the otoscope?
PATIENT: An otoscope? Really? You think it's an infection? It came on so suddenly! It feels… neurological. Frankly, I doubt poking around in my ear will reveal anything useful, but fine. Just… be gentle. And don't take too long.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There's no visible infection. The ear canal appears normal. However, the tympanic membrane is slightly…bulging. And there’s a slight redness behind the eardrum. Could be early-stage inflammation, but further investigation is needed. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly, are we going through the entire medical textbook now? I just want to know what's wrong with my face and my hearing! I have appointments, you know. This is taking far too long. But fine, go ahead. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: As I suspected. Your reflexes are slightly diminished on the left side. This, coupled with the facial weakness, hearing loss, and the slight bulging of the tympanic membrane… leads me to suspect Bell’s palsy. Though, we’ll need to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke, with an MRI.
PATIENT: Bell's palsy? I've heard of it. Isn’t that…temporary? And caused by…stress? I am not stressed! I run a very organized life. And an MRI? Honestly, the thought of being stuck in that machine… It’s rather claustrophobic. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t we just…try medication first? Something to reduce the swelling, perhaps? I really don’t have time for extensive testing.
DOCTOR: Bell’s palsy is often temporary, yes. But we need to confirm the diagnosis and rule out anything more serious. And while stress can be a factor, it is not always the cause. As for medication, we can consider a short course of corticosteroids, which may reduce inflammation. However, without an MRI to rule out other issues, it would be irresponsible. I understand your concerns about the MRI, but your health is paramount. I'll write you a referral to a radiology center. They have open MRI machines, which may alleviate your claustrophobia.
PATIENT: An open MRI… marginally better, I suppose. But still a complete waste of my time. Fine. Write the referral. But I expect it to be a quick appointment, and I expect you to expedite the results. And I still think we should consider medication immediately. I don’t want this lingering any longer than it has to. Let’s just get this over with. Do I need to make a follow-up appointment, or will someone contact me? And frankly, I expect a detailed explanation of the results. I am not easily placated.
DOCTOR: Here is the referral for the MRI. I have noted your preference for an open machine. I will also prescribe a short course of corticosteroids, as you requested. Please start taking them as directed. As for follow-up, my assistant will contact you to schedule an appointment once the MRI results are available. Now, do you have any other questions, or may I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just…make sure everything is expedited. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results, not some vague medical jargon. Honestly, I’ve wasted enough time here today. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Nissenbaum. I trust you will follow the instructions carefully.
