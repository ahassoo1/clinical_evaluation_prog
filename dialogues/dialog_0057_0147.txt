DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. My name is Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Sieh. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been bothering me a little, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. And how long have you noticed this lump, Amy?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me think… maybe a couple of months now? It started small, and I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. But it seems to be… well, not growing quickly, but definitely noticeable now. It doesn’t hurt constantly, just… sometimes a dull ache.
DOCTOR: A couple of months, with a dull ache that comes and goes. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the lump to me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It feels… hard. Not like a muscle knot, more… firm. And it’s maybe the size of a plum, I’d say? Roughly. It’s located… well, right about here, a few inches below my belly button, and a little to the left.
DOCTOR: Okay, a plum-sized, firm lump a few inches below your belly button and slightly to the left. Thank you for pointing that out. And have you noticed any other changes associated with this lump?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. No changes in my bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever or anything like that. Just the lump itself and that occasional ache. I haven’t noticed any pain when I, you know… go to the bathroom either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel habits, no weight loss, no fever, and no pain with bowel movements. That's good information. Now, Amy, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Hmm… let me see. Nothing major, thankfully. I had appendicitis when I was a teenager, but that was removed years ago. Other than that… just the usual childhood illnesses, nothing serious. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager and managed hypertension. Do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for about five years now, and it seems to be doing a good job keeping things under control. My regular doctor monitors it, and I have my check-ups every six months.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension, well-controlled with regular check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, just the appendectomy. I haven’t had any other surgeries, thankfully. I try to avoid them if I can!
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart disease. His side of the family… there was some talk of colon cancer a few generations back, but I don’t have a lot of details. It was a distant relative, I believe. My mother’s side was mostly diabetes and high blood pressure. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and hypertension on your mother's side, and a family history of colon cancer on your father's side, though distant. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I used to drink occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back significantly in the last year. Now I very rarely drink – maybe once or twice a month, if that. And no, I don't use any recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication either. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just in case, but so far, so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Amy. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently feel for the lump you described. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I appreciate you taking the time to check things out thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Bowel sounds are present in all quadrants, normal in character. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting away from the lump and working my way towards it. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Okay. The lump is approximately 3x3 centimeters, firm, and slightly mobile. It's located a few inches below your belly button and to the left, as you described. There is mild tenderness to palpation directly over the mass. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No organomegaly detected. Okay, Amy, based on the exam, there is a palpable mass in your lower abdomen that is mildly tender to the touch. Given your family history of colon cancer, and the fact that this has been present for a couple of months, I recommend further investigation. I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better look at the mass. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. A CT scan seems like a good idea. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, and if that’s the best way to do it, then yes, please go ahead and order one.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. I'll order the CT scan now. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. I'll also send a referral to a general surgeon, Dr. Ramirez, for consultation after the CT scan results are available. He can discuss the findings with you and determine if a biopsy is necessary. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very thorough plan. A consultation with a surgeon seems wise. And getting the CT scan done first makes sense. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Sieh. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns and for being so… methodical.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I understand it can be concerning when you find something new, and we want to rule out anything serious. While we await the CT scan results, if you experience any new symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your clear explanations and the plan of action. I’ll be sure to contact the clinic if anything changes. And I'll wait for the radiology department to call about scheduling the CT scan. Thank you again, Dr. Sieh.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your CT scan. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please take care. .
