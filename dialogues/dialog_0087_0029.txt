DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full, see? Even after just a little bit of food. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me. Don't seem to get much enjoyment out of eating anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food, and not enjoying meals as much. How long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… three, four months now? Started off slow, just noticing it here and there. But it’s gotten more consistent lately. Especially with my wife’s cooking, and I love her cooking! It just… doesn’t feel the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months. And it's interfering with your enjoyment of meals, even ones you typically enjoy. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the feeling of fullness for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… pain, exactly. It’s more like… a pressure, high up in my belly. Like I’ve eaten a big meal when I haven’t. And it stays for a while, even if it’s just a couple of bites I’ve had. It's just… uncomfortable. Makes me not want to bother eating at all, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure high in your abdomen, feeling full quickly, and it persists even with a small intake. And it’s leading to a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I have been a little tired lately. But I’m an old man, Doctor! Who isn't tired? And maybe… a little bit of heartburn now and then. But I thought that was just the coffee. I like my coffee strong. I don’t know if that’s related, though. Nothing else really, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional heartburn. We’ll definitely consider both of those. And it's good you mention the coffee; that can certainly contribute to heartburn. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes in… my bowels? Oh, goodness. Well, now that you ask… they haven't been as regular, I suppose. A little bit… looser than usual. Not bad, just… not like they used to be. And not as often, either. I usually… well, never you mind how usual. Just not as often.
DOCTOR: Okay, less frequent and looser stools. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, years ago, the doctor said I had a touch of high blood pressure, but he put me on a little pill for it. I took it for a while, but he took me off of it eventually, said I was doing fine. Apart from that… nothing much. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And you're currently not taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a one. Stopped the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. Just coffee, and the occasional piece of my wife’s pie. Although, maybe the pie is medicine. Keeps the spirits up! But no, nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. That’s about it. Always been a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to hospitals, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And her sister, too. On my father’s side… well, he didn’t talk much about his family. But I think his mother… she had something with her heart, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention then. It’s hard to say for sure. We didn't see much of his family.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of diabetes in your mother and potentially a heart condition in your father’s mother. We’ll make a note of that. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? Well, I’m retired now. Used to be a fisherman, out on the water most days. But my bones aren’t what they used to be, so I don’t do much of that anymore. Mostly, I spend my time with my wife. We like to watch TV, read… and I do a little bit of carving now and then. Haida carving, you know. Keeps my hands busy. I don’t smoke, never did. And I drink… well, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, retired fisherman, Haida carving, no smoking, and occasional glass of wine. That's good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've been pretty lucky that way too. No bee stings, no rashes, nothing. Just an old man who likes his coffee and pie. I think I've answered all your questions, Doctor?
DOCTOR: You certainly have, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for providing such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I don't mind at all. Just try not to poke too hard, eh? My ribs are a little creaky these days. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breaths in and out, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope, not yet. Just feels… normal, I guess. A little bit soft, maybe? Been enjoying my wife’s cooking a bit too much lately. Oh… ooh. There. That’s a little tender. Not painful, but… yeah, definitely feels a bit sensitive there.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for letting me know. That’s in the epigastric region. Now, I'm just going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly hypoactive. Okay, Mr. Obarr. Based on your history and the exam findings—tenderness in the epigastric region, slightly hypoactive bowel sounds, early satiety, and loose stools—there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something as simple as gastritis, which is inflammation of the stomach lining, or it could be related to changes in your diet. However, given your age and symptoms, we also need to rule out more serious conditions. I recommend we start with some blood work to check for anemia, inflammation, and pancreatic function. I also want to order a stool sample to check for any infections or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and a… stool sample? Oh, goodness. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I suppose it’s best to be sure. It's just… not very pleasant to think about, is it? But alright, yes. Do what you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… let’s get it over with quickly, eh? How do we go about doing all this?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Obarr, and I assure you we’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in to draw the blood. It will just be a standard blood draw from your arm. As for the stool sample, I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions on how to collect it at home. It's a fairly straightforward process. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any large meals, staying well-hydrated, and if you can, temporarily reducing your coffee intake to see if that helps alleviate some of the symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Small meals, more water, less coffee. Easier said than done with my wife’s baking around, but I’ll try my best. And Sarah, you said? I’m sure she’s a nice young woman. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease a little. When should I start the small meals and try cutting back on the coffee? Right away?
DOCTOR: Yes, start as soon as you can, Mr. Obarr. It might not be an instant fix, but it’s a good first step. And I'll have Sarah come in now to draw your blood. She's excellent, very gentle. Sarah, could you please come in and assist Mr. Obarr with his blood work?
PATIENT: Wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you to Sarah, too. Let's get this over with, eh? I’m a tough old fisherman, after all. Just… try not to poke too hard.
