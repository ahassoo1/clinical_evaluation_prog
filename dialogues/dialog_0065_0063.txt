DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it really hurts. Bad. It’s been hurting more and more for, I think, maybe a week now? It’s different than the usual aches, you know? It feels… sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain… and it’s different from your usual aches. A week, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. Maybe a little longer. It started slow, just a little niggle, and then… whoosh. Now it’s hard to even bend over. And sometimes it goes down my leg, like a shooting pain. Not all the time, but it happens. I remember it started after I was helping my niece move some boxes. Heavy ones.
DOCTOR: Helping your niece move boxes… right. And the pain radiates down your leg?
PATIENT: Yes, down my leg. Mostly the left one. It’s… hard to explain. Not all the way to my foot, but… down to my knee, sometimes a little lower. It makes it hard to walk, even. And when I try to sit for too long, it gets worse. I try to get up and move, but then it hurts more to move. It’s a bit of a… catch-22, you know?
DOCTOR: A “catch-22” indeed. So, it’s exacerbated by both sitting and standing, and radiates down the left leg to the knee. Do you notice anything specific that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Laying down, mostly. Flat on my back. But I can’t always lay down, right? And sometimes… if I hold really still, like, really still, it’s not as bad. But that’s not living, you know? Just… sitting or laying like a statue. And heat… a warm bath helps a little. Just for a little while, though. It comes back pretty quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so relief with laying flat, minimal relief with heat. And it doesn't stay relieved for long. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s a good question too! I almost forgot. My toes… sometimes they feel… pins and needles. Mostly the left foot, like the leg pain. Not all the time, but when the pain is really bad, yes. And sometimes my left foot feels… cold. Even when it’s not. Is that… important? I don’t know if it’s connected.
DOCTOR: It could be connected. Numbness, tingling, and coldness – that’s helpful information. Now, have you had any issues with your bowel or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a private question, Doctor. But… no. Not really. Everything’s… normal, I guess. No problems there. But why are you asking? Is something… bad happening? I’m a little scared, to be honest. I know I have… the cancer, and now this pain… it feels different than before. Is this something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. I'm asking about bowel and bladder function to rule out any nerve compression, given the pain radiating down your leg and the reported numbness and tingling. Your history of cancer is relevant, and we will consider that. However, pain like this doesn’t automatically mean it’s related to that. Now, to clarify your history… what kind of cancer were you diagnosed with, and when?
PATIENT: It was… breast cancer. About five years ago. Stage two, I think? I had surgery, and radiation. And… pills. Lots of pills. I finished treatment about four years ago. Everything was… okay, after that. Just regular check-ups. But now… this back pain. And it’s different than the aches I had after the radiation. That was more… all over. This is… sharp, like something is pinched. Does that make sense? I'm trying to remember everything. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Stage two breast cancer, surgery, radiation, and medication… finished four years ago. And this pain is distinct from the post-radiation aches – sharper and more localized. Alright. Now, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I’m going to need you to lie down on your back on the examination table. Can you tell me if there is any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I can lie down. But… just tell me what you’re doing, okay? I get nervous when I don’t know what’s happening. And… be gentle, please. It really hurts. Where are you going to press?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will explain everything as I go, and be as gentle as possible. I’m going to start by palpating your lower back to assess for tenderness or muscle spasm. Can you tell me if you feel any pain with this pressure?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there… That’s where it hurts the most. And… a little bit to the left of that. It’s not just on the bone, it’s… in the muscle too. It feels… tight. Like a knot. And it makes me want to pull away. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: There is significant muscle spasm and tenderness in the lumbar region, particularly on the left side. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and assess your strength in your legs. Could you bend your left knee and try to push your foot against my hand?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It hurts a little when I do that, but I’m trying. Is that… enough? It feels weak, I think. Maybe it’s just the pain. I don’t know… everything feels weird. It’s harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Your strength is slightly diminished in your left leg compared to your right, and your reflexes are a bit diminished as well. Now I'm going to check your sensation. Close your eyes, and tell me when you feel me touch your left leg.
PATIENT: Okay, eyes closed. Go ahead. … Now? … I think I feel it… there. And… maybe a little bit here? It’s… not as strong as when you touch my right leg. It feels… kinda numb, like you said. Not completely, but… fainter. Like I’m feeling it through a blanket. Is that… normal? It's hard to explain. I'm trying to pay attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased sensation in your left leg, particularly in the shin and calf, compared to your right. Given your history of breast cancer, the radiating pain, muscle spasm, weakness, and diminished sensation, I suspect you may be experiencing nerve compression, likely due to a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. However, it’s crucial to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I will also order blood work to check for any inflammation or other underlying causes. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. I’m also recommending physical therapy. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: An MRI… and blood work? Okay. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Is the cancer… back? I’m scared, Doctor. What if it’s something really bad? What if I can’t walk? I need to know. And… physical therapy? What will that involve? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, it's understandable that you're scared. Ordering these tests doesn't automatically mean it's cancer, or that you won't be able to walk. It simply means we need more information to make an accurate diagnosis. The MRI will show us if there's any compression on the nerves in your spine, and the blood work will help rule out other potential causes of your pain. Regarding physical therapy, it will involve exercises designed to strengthen your back muscles, improve your flexibility, and reduce your pain. It will be supervised by a trained therapist who will tailor the exercises to your specific needs. We will start slowly and gradually increase the intensity as you get stronger. The goal is to help you regain your function and improve your quality of life. I will be as thorough as possible in investigating the cause of your pain, and I will explain everything to you every step of the way. Do you want me to write down the names of the facilities where you can get the MRI and start physical therapy?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very helpful. And… thank you. For explaining things. It still scares me, but… it’s a little bit better knowing what’s happening. What kind of pain reliever is it? And… is the muscle relaxant… habit-forming? I don't want to get… addicted to anything. My sister had problems with pills after her surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's a list of facilities that offer both MRI imaging and physical therapy. The pain reliever I'm prescribing is naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. It’s available over-the-counter, but I’m giving you a stronger prescription strength. It's generally well-tolerated, but can cause stomach upset in some people. Take it with food. The muscle relaxant is cyclobenzaprine. It’s not highly addictive, but can cause drowsiness. It's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully and not exceed the recommended amount. If you have any concerns about potential addiction, we can discuss alternative options. We'll monitor your progress closely and adjust your medication as needed. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve been very patient with me. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going on. I’ll schedule the MRI and call about physical therapy. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Like, should I be resting? Or… avoiding anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s perfectly normal to be scared, and I'm here to support you. In the meantime, avoid any activities that exacerbate your pain. Gentle walking is okay, but avoid lifting heavy objects, bending over, or twisting your back. Applying ice or heat to your lower back can also provide some relief. I'm also recommending that you follow up with me in one week, or sooner if your symptoms worsen. Here's a written summary of our discussion and the prescriptions I've ordered. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you the best of luck with the MRI and physical therapy. We'll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
