DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Voytek. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just... this fever keeps comin' back. It's been a pain, honestly. Feels like it goes away for a bit, then bam, it's back again.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with just feelin' kinda warm, y'know? Like I got a little sun too long. Then it gets hotter, chills, the whole nine yards. Usually lasts a couple of days, then breaks, and I feel alright for... maybe a week, two weeks? Then it happens again. It's been goin' on for... oh, jeez, I'd say close to two months now. I don't really keep track of dates like I used to. My wife does all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, so about two months of this on-and-off fever. And you said it feels like a typical fever – warm feeling, chills… Have you been taking your temperature when it's high?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife has a thermometer. I think the highest it got was... 101.5, maybe? She wrote it down somewhere. I mostly just feel awful, so I don't bother checkin' it every time, if that makes sense. Just when I'm really feelin' bad. It doesn't feel like a really high fever, just… uncomfortable. And tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, 101.5 is good to know. And you mentioned being really tired. Is that fatigue constant, or does it come and go with the fever?
PATIENT: It's mostly when the fever hits, yeah. Like, when I'm feelin' warm and achy, I just wanna sleep. Even gettin' outta bed is a chore. But when I'm fever-free, I'm… well, I'm 65, Doctor. I'm always a little tired, y'know? It’s hard to tell what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to pinpoint things when symptoms overlap. Besides the fever and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms – like cough, body aches, headache, any rash, changes in your appetite or weight, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Let me think... aches, yeah, definitely aches. Mostly in my back and legs, but they come and go with the fever. Appetite's been a little off, I haven't been as hungry lately, but I figured that was just gettin' older. No cough, no rash, and I don't think I've lost any weight. My wife would definitely say something if I did! Honestly, that's about it. Just the fever and feelin' tired and achy. It's a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't been outta Puerto Rico in years. And honestly, I mostly stay home. My wife and I, we mostly just go to church and the grocery store. Haven't been around anyone who was obviously sick, not that I recall. Old Man Rodriguez down the street had a bad cold last month, but I didn’t get close to him. Just waved hello from across the yard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a good picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder taken out, oh, must be 20 years ago now. And I got high blood pressure, but it's under control with medicine. That's about it, really. Nothing major. Oh! And my knees are bad. Arthritis. But that's just old age, y’know? Doesn’t really count. I take some stuff for that sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, high blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see... for the blood pressure, it's... Lisinopril, I think? Small white pill. And for the arthritis, sometimes I take Ibuprofen, when it’s really bad. Just over-the-counter stuff. Not every day, just when my knees are achin' real bad. My wife keeps track of all this, honestly. She's a saint. It's mostly just when I’ve been on my feet too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife always asks when she gets me new pills, but I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. I like food too much to worry about allergies. Nothing comes to mind, Doctor. I’m pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, just to finish up the history, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. My mom, she had diabetes. And my dad… heart problems, I think? He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. And my sister, she has high blood pressure too, like me. That’s about all I really know, honestly. My family wasn’t big on talkin’ about health stuff. We mostly just kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and high blood pressure in your sister. Thank you. Alright, Mr. Brege, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just wanna get this figured out, you know? This fever’s been draggin' me down. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Temperature is 100.8. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Pulse is 72, blood pressure is 130/80. Everything seems relatively normal so far, Mr. Brege. However, the recurring fever is concerning. I’m going to order some blood work to help us figure out what’s going on. It’ll check for infection, inflammation, and other potential causes.
PATIENT: Okay, blood work. Fine. Sounds good. Just tell me what I gotta do, Doctor. I don’t wanna be here all day, if you know what I mean. I got things to do, you know. Is it gonna take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. It shouldn't take too long. I'll write you a requisition, and you can go to the lab right across the street. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes for the results to come back. We'll have the results sent over to me, and I'll call you as soon as I've had a chance to review them. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Lab across the street, 30-45 minutes… Got it. Just call me when you know somethin’. And hopefully, it's nothin’ too serious. Do I gotta pay somethin’ now? Or at the lab? I ain’t insured, so I’m a little worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Because you are uninsured, the lab will likely have a cash price. I will give you a printout with the CPT codes for the tests, so you can ask for an estimate before they draw your blood. And we can discuss payment options if it becomes a concern. Here's the requisition and the codes. And I’ll make a note in your chart about your insurance status. I want to get this figured out for you, and we’ll work something out. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… decent. Just want to get this over with, you know? Thanks, Doctor. Alright, I’ll go do the blood work then. Call me when you have somethin’. Appreciate you workin’ with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege. You have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you develop any new or worsening symptoms. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. .
PATIENT: .
