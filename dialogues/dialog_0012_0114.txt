DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Yoshino. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. I’m here because I have trouble breathing when I try to lie flat. It’s been… well, a few weeks now, maybe longer. It’s quite bothersome, really. I prefer to sleep propped up with several pillows.
DOCTOR: Okay, several weeks of trouble breathing when lying flat, and you’ve found it’s better when propped up with pillows. That's good to know you've found something that helps, even if it's not ideal. Can you tell me a little more about how you’re having trouble breathing?
PATIENT: Well, it isn’t a pain, exactly. More like… a tightness in my chest. And I feel like I can’t get enough air. It’s not all the time, just when I’m lying down. It’s… unsettling. I don’t know if that makes sense. Is it important when it started? I can recall the exact date, if you need it. August 14th, 2024, if you must know.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Maribeth. Tightness in the chest and feeling like you can't get enough air – that's helpful to know. And yes, knowing when it started is important. August 14th, 2024, is good. So, it started around August 14th of last year and has been ongoing. Has it gotten worse over that time, stayed about the same, or improved at all?
PATIENT: It’s… gradually worsened, I believe. At first, it was just a little uncomfortable. Now, it truly prevents me from lying flat comfortably. I used to enjoy reading in bed, but now… well, it’s simply too difficult. I have to have at least three, sometimes four pillows. It’s a nuisance, to be frank. I don’t believe it has improved at any point.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening since August 2024, and now needing three to four pillows to sleep comfortably. That definitely sounds concerning enough to look into. Besides the trouble breathing when lying down, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My ankles have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but noticeable. And… I tire more easily than I used to. Small tasks seem to exhaust me. I thought it was just my age, honestly. Is swelling relevant? I apologize if I'm rambling. I just want to provide you with all the information.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Maribeth. That’s exactly what I want – all the information you can give me. The ankle swelling and increased fatigue are definitely relevant. Okay, so we have trouble breathing when lying flat, worsening since August 2024, needing 3-4 pillows, ankle swelling, and increased fatigue. Now, have you had any chest pain with this, or any cough?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And no cough. Not even a little one. Just the… tightness. It's a peculiar sensation, really. Not painful, but… unsettling. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but that was entirely separate. A proper, nasty flu. It’s resolved, of course. I received a vaccination afterward. I believe it’s important to be vaccinated, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, vaccination is very important. Good for you for staying up-to-date. Okay, so no chest pain or cough. Flu last winter, now resolved, and you received a vaccination. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well… I was diagnosed with arthritis some years ago. Rheumatoid arthritis, I believe. It flares up from time to time, but I manage it with medication. Otherwise… nothing significant, to my knowledge. My blood pressure was a little elevated at one point, but it’s been under control with a mild diuretic for quite some time. Perhaps ten years now? I take it faithfully, every morning. It’s important to be consistent, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, consistency is key. Okay, rheumatoid arthritis, managed with medication, and high blood pressure controlled with a diuretic for about ten years. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the diuretic and whatever you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me see… Just a daily multivitamin. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for my arthritis flares. When the medication isn't sufficient. It’s over-the-counter, of course. Nothing prescribed. I also take a calcium supplement, Doctor recommended it years ago to prevent osteoporosis. I believe that’s all. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. Okay, so multivitamin, ibuprofen as needed, and a calcium supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years. And I’ve taken many medications, as you know. I pride myself on being… resilient. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Are we nearing the end? I have an appointment later this afternoon, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: You’re very thorough, Maribeth, and yes, that's excellent information. And no, we’re not quite to the end yet, but we are getting there. Just a few more questions about your history, then we’ll do a quick physical exam. First, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. Perhaps thirty years now? A fairly routine procedure, as I recall. And… I had a minor knee surgery to repair a torn meniscus. That was about fifteen years ago. Beyond that… no. Nothing else. I’ve always been… fortunate, in that regard. Is it important what kind of surgery? I can provide more details, if you require it.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No, the details aren’t crucial right now. Okay, gallbladder removed thirty years ago and knee surgery fifteen years ago. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, similar to myself. And she suffered from arthritis later in life. My father… he was quite healthy, actually. Lived to be eighty-five. No major health problems, as far as I know. My brother… he has diabetes, type two, I believe. Beyond that… no significant family history of illness. We weren’t a particularly… sickly family. Is it important to know if they smoked or drank? Because I can tell you that my father enjoyed a good scotch now and then.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful to know. Knowing about smoking and alcohol use can be important. So, your mother had high blood pressure and arthritis, your father enjoyed scotch, and your brother has type two diabetes. Finally, a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never. I find it… appalling. My husband smoked for a time, but I convinced him to quit years ago. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. It’s simply dreadful for one’s health. And I rarely drink. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's the extent of it. Are we finally nearing the end? I truly apologize for taking up so much of your time.
DOCTOR: You haven’t taken up too much of my time at all, Maribeth. I appreciate you being so thorough. Okay, no smoking, very occasional wine. Alright. Based on everything you’ve told me – the trouble breathing when lying flat, the gradual worsening, ankle swelling, fatigue, arthritis, high blood pressure, and your family history – it sounds like we need to investigate a few possibilities. The most likely things I’m thinking about are heart failure, or possibly fluid retention related to your arthritis, but we need to do some tests to be sure. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs for swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please proceed. I do hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have that appointment, you see. Do I need to undress, or…?
DOCTOR: No, you don’t need to undress. Just sit comfortably. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Again… Alright. And now I’m just going to gently feel your legs to check for swelling. Okay, I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. And I hear some… subtle crackling sounds in your lungs when you take a deep breath. It's not severe, but it's worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Crackling sounds, you say? That doesn't sound… pleasant. Is it serious? I do hope it's nothing too concerning. I've never had any lung problems before. This is quite unsettling, to be frank. What sort of tests are you thinking of, Doctor? Will they be… painful? I do have a rather low tolerance for discomfort, you see.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be unsettled, Maribeth, but let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. The crackling sounds could be due to a number of things, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. And some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a something called a BNP test, which can help us assess if your heart is under strain. These tests aren't painful at all, just a little bit of blood draw for the blood work. The X-ray is just a quick image. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and blood work… That doesn't sound too dreadful, I suppose. No, I don't believe I have any questions. Where will these tests be performed? And how long will it take to get the results? I do need to know if I should reschedule my afternoon appointment. Perhaps I should just cancel it altogether. Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Avoid strenuous activity? Elevate my legs? I'm simply trying to be proactive, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's very good of you to ask, Maribeth. The tests will be performed right here in the clinic. The X-ray technician will call you back shortly, and the blood work can be done immediately afterward. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back – I’d say by Wednesday at the latest, and my office will call you with the results. In the meantime, avoiding strenuous activity is a good idea. Elevating your legs for 30 minutes a few times a day can also help with the swelling. And, if you feel more short of breath, please don't hesitate to contact the office, or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Wednesday… Very well. No strenuous activity, elevate my legs, and contact you if my breathing worsens. That seems manageable. No, I believe that answers all of my questions. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino, for your thoroughness and patience. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I do hope the results are nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Maribeth. And you didn't take up too much of my time at all. I'm happy to help. The technician will be with you shortly to start the X-ray. Please let the office staff know if you have any questions, and we’ll be in touch with the results as soon as they are available. Have a good afternoon. .
