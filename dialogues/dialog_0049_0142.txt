DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's... headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come... well, it's not fun. I get all sweaty and my heart races, feels like it’s gonna jump outta my chest. Honestly, I don’t really remember exactly when they started, just that they’ve been happening for a while now.
DOCTOR: Headaches, alright. And you said sweaty and heart racing… is that during the headache, or beforehand?
PATIENT: Um… during, I think. Definitely during. It all kinda happens at once, really. The headache builds, and then the sweating starts, and my heart… just goes fast. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I wish I could explain it better. Do you need me to be more specific? I just… don’t have a great memory for details.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Lawther. We’ll get there. “All at once” is a good starting point. Can you describe the headache itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s… a throbbing, I guess? Like, a really bad pressure, mostly behind my eyes and in my temples. Sometimes it feels like it’s all over my head, though. And light… bright light makes it worse, definitely. I usually just gotta lie down in a dark room. It’s… a really unpleasant feeling, that’s for sure. I don't know if that helps?
DOCTOR: Throbbing, pressure behind the eyes and temples, worsened by light. Alright. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… that’s a good question. Not really, I don’t think? It doesn’t seem to be linked to anything specific. I mean, sometimes it happens after a long day at work, but other times it just… comes on randomly. I’ve tried to think about it, but I can't really pinpoint anything. Stress, maybe? But I feel like everyone’s stressed these days, right? Honestly, I’m just not sure. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No clear triggers, possibly related to stress. And how often would you say these headaches occur?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… that’s tough. It comes in waves, I think. Sometimes I'll have a few really bad ones close together, then nothing for a couple of weeks. Lately, though… maybe two or three times a week? It's been pretty consistent the last month or so, I guess. It’s definitely more frequent recently. Does that make sense? I’m really bad at keeping track of this stuff.
DOCTOR: Two to three times a week for the past month. Alright. Now, do you experience any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I’m gonna be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. And… I think I get a little dizzy sometimes, but not always. Oh, and I definitely feel really tired afterwards. Just completely wiped out. It takes me a while to recover, you know? Nothing else comes to mind right now. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm forgetting something...
DOCTOR: Nausea, dizziness, fatigue after headache. Let’s move on to your medical history, Mr. Lawther. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, broken arm when I was a kid – but nothing major. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I got divorced a couple of years ago, and… well, things were a bit hectic then, and I just didn't prioritize health stuff. I don't think I have any long-term conditions, but I wouldn't know for sure. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, not a problem. Just gathering information. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgery. Like I said, I haven't really needed to go to the doctor much, thankfully. I've always just been… pretty healthy, I guess. Until these headaches started, anyway. It's just... frustrating, you know? I feel awful when they happen, and I have no idea what's causing them. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom’s side, they’ve had… high blood pressure, I think? And my dad… he had some heart problems later in life. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. My brother's fine, always been healthy. No one else… that I can think of… has headaches like these. They get the occasional migraine, but nothing like what I'm dealing with. I’m not sure if that helps? It’s just… a pretty standard family history, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… no, no, and no. Never been much of a smoker. I have a beer every now and then, like on a weekend, but that's about it. And definitely no drugs. I… I don't really like feeling out of control, so I avoid all that stuff. Does that make sense? I'm trying to be as honest as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don’t think so. I had penicillin as a kid, I think, and I didn't have any reaction. I haven't taken much in the way of medication since then, to be honest. No known allergies, as far as I'm aware. But… I wouldn’t swear to it, you know? It’s been a while. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam. It’ll just take a few minutes. If you could sit up there for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Sounds… good. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have… a bit of a busy day. Not that it’s that important, but… you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88, respiratory rate is 16, temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and cranial nerves. This will involve me asking you to follow my finger with your eyes, squeezing my hand, and testing your balance.
PATIENT: Okay… sounds… good. I’m not very good at… balancing, just so you know. I was always a bit clumsy as a kid. Just tell me if anything feels… weird, alright? I don't want to fall or anything.
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Facial symmetry appears normal. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities bilaterally. Gait is slightly unsteady, but within normal limits. Neurological exam is largely normal, mild unsteadiness noted with gait. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your headaches. The symptoms you describe – throbbing pain, nausea, sensitivity to light, and sweating – could suggest a migraine. However, the frequency and lack of clear triggers are somewhat atypical. We should rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Rule out other causes? Like… what other causes? Is it something serious? I… I was hoping it was just stress or something. This is starting to sound… worrying. I don't really like worrying, you know? What kind of tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: It’s good to be thorough, Mr. Lawther. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious. It could be tension headaches, cluster headaches, or even something as simple as dehydration. But it’s important to rule out less common causes, such as sinus infections, temporomandibular joint disorders, or, in rare cases, something more serious like a brain tumor or aneurysm. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to check for any underlying inflammation or electrolyte imbalances. I also recommend a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. We’ll also check your blood pressure regularly.
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious. Is that… is that really necessary? I mean, I just have headaches, right? I don’t have any other symptoms… like… vision problems or anything. I… I’m not really good with hospitals and stuff. It makes me… nervous. And a blood count… and a metabolic… what was it? I just… I wish it was just stress. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I don't… I don’t have insurance, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. A CT scan is the best way to definitively rule out any serious underlying causes for your headaches. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure, and we’ll take all necessary precautions to ensure your comfort. It’s also true that it can be expensive. Unfortunately, without insurance, the cost can be significant. I will write a referral to a radiologist who offers a cash discount and can discuss payment options with you. The blood tests are less expensive. In the meantime, I can prescribe a medication to help manage your symptoms while we await the results. This is a triptan, which can help alleviate migraine pain. However, it’s important to remember that this is just a temporary solution. We need to identify the underlying cause of your headaches. I will also give you a list of resources for financial assistance and affordable healthcare options in the area. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… alright. A cash discount… that’s… good, I guess. Better than nothing. And the triptan… will that make me… sleepy? I have work, you know. I can’t afford to be… out of it. I… I just wish this wasn't happening. This is a lot to deal with. I’ll… I’ll try to schedule the CT scan. And I’ll look at the resource list. Thank you… I think. It’s just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. The triptan can cause some drowsiness in some patients, but it's usually mild. Start with a lower dose and see how you feel. If it makes you too sleepy, we can adjust it. We'll monitor your response closely. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we're here to help you through this. Schedule the CT scan as soon as possible, and we’ll follow up with you once we have the results. Take care, Mr. Lawther.
