DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? Someone told me I needed to get checked out for it. My mind ain’t what it used to be, so I forget a lot of the details. My wife… she used to handle things like this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It’s perfectly alright if things aren’t clear right now. It’s common to feel overwhelmed with these things, especially when you’re dealing with changes in memory. We’ll take our time and figure things out together. So, you mentioned someone suggested you come in for a check-up related to long-term care and changes in your memory. Can you tell me a little bit more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well… things just… slip away, you know? Like I’ll start a story, and then… poof. Gone. Or I’ll go to the store for milk, and come back with… well, not milk. Not always. Sometimes I remember. It’s just… patchy. It’s been getting worse, I guess. Not sudden, just… slow. It worries me, mostly ‘cause… well, like I said, my wife always remembered everything. Now… it’s just me. And I’m… not so good at it.
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds frustrating, Mr. Rover, and it's completely understandable why it worries you. It’s good you're being proactive about this. "Patchy" is a helpful way to describe it. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me approximately how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… that’s a tough one. It feels like… a while. Maybe… a year? More than a year, definitely. It started small, little things. I’d forget where I put my keys, or a name. Now… it’s… bigger. It’s hard to say exactly when it got this bad, though. Time… it kinda blends together, you know? After… after she passed, everything got blurry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It’s completely natural for grief to affect memory and concentration. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult. And it makes perfect sense that it’s hard to pinpoint exactly when these changes started. To help me get a clearer picture, could you describe some specific examples of the memory issues you've been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Specific… uh… okay. Just last week, I was makin’ breakfast, right? Toast. Simple. I put the bread in, went to get the coffee, and… completely forgot about the toast. Burned it real bad. Smoke everywhere. Then, two days ago, I went to visit my friend, Old Man Hemlock. Got halfway there and couldn’t remember why I was going. Had to turn around and come back home. And… and yesterday I couldn’t remember what day it was. My neighbor, Sarah, had to tell me. It's… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Those are helpful examples, Mr. Rover, thank you for sharing those with me. It sounds like these episodes are becoming more frequent, which is something we need to investigate. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Real bad pain, I remember that. And… I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got it under control with pills. Oh, and I broke my wrist a few years back, fallin’ off a ladder. Other than that… nothin’ major, I don’t think. I saw Doc Petersen for check-ups every year, but he retired last year. Didn’t really tell me anything bad, as far as I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Appendix removal, controlled high blood pressure, and a broken wrist. And you were seeing Dr. Petersen for regular check-ups until he retired. Do you happen to know what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I take somethin’ for the blood pressure, I know that. Little white pills. And somethin’ for my arthritis, it makes my hands hurt sometimes. But I… I don’t remember the names. My wife… she handled all that. She kept a list. I haven’t gotten around to… well, I just haven’t.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It’s alright. We can look into getting a list from your pharmacy. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… I think I’m allergic to bee stings. Got stung when I was a boy, swelled up real bad. Had to go to the hospital. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. I eat pretty much anything. My wife used to say I had an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bee sting allergy. Good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – experienced memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia?
PATIENT: Family… uh… my mother… she was always a little forgetful, even when she was young. Lost things, couldn’t remember names. But we just thought she was… scatterbrained, you know? My father… he was sharp as a tack, right up until the end. And my sister… I haven’t seen her in years. I don’t really know what happened to her. I… I don’t think anyone had anything serious… but like I said, my memory ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rover. It sounds like your mother had some mild memory issues, but nothing definitive. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and a few simple cognitive tests, if you're comfortable with that. This will involve checking your reflexes, balance, and asking you some questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… alright. I guess so. If it helps. I just… I don’t want to make a fool of myself. I already feel pretty lost most of the time. But… if you think it’s a good idea, go ahead. I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Rover. We’re just gathering information, and there’s no judgment here. I'll walk you through everything step-by-step. First, let’s just check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll move on to a few simple tests. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart and lungs sound okay, but your breath sounds are a little quiet. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms?
PATIENT: Okay… here. Just… be gentle, alright? I’m a bit of a nervous patient, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Everything seems normal so far. Now, let’s do a quick balance test. Could you please stand up and close your eyes, and try to maintain your balance for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Woah… easy there… Okay… I… I don’t like this. I feel… wobbly. I… I think that’s enough. I’m gonna fall.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rover. Thank you for trying. You did great. A little unsteadiness is not uncommon. Now, let’s move on to a simple cognitive test. I’m going to ask you to remember three words, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me after a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Okay… three words. Alright. I can try. Hit me.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Try to remember those. I’m going to ask you some unrelated questions for a few minutes, and then I’ll ask you to recall those three words. Okay, Mr. Rover. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Uhhh… let me see… apple… something with wood… and… a coin? No… I… I can’t remember. I’m sorry. They just… slipped away. Like everything else.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rover. Don't worry about it. This is a common finding, and it doesn't necessarily mean anything definitive. Based on what you've told me, the physical exam findings, and the cognitive tests, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive decline, specifically with short-term memory. The elevated blood pressure and slightly diminished breath sounds are also things we need to address. However, it’s too early to make a diagnosis. We need to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also recommend a brain imaging scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a scan… That sounds… serious. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? Am I… am I losing my mind? I just… I don’t want to end up like… well, like I've seen folks at the home. Forgettin’ everything. I don’t really understand all that stuff you said. What will the tests do? And… how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Those are perfectly valid questions, Mr. Rover. It's understandable to feel anxious about this. Let me explain. The tests are not to confirm anything bad, but rather to rule out other possible causes for your memory issues. For example, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or infections can sometimes cause similar symptoms. The brain scan will help us look for any structural abnormalities, like small strokes or tumors, that could be affecting your memory. Think of it like detective work. We're gathering clues to figure out what's going on. The blood tests will take a few days to come back, and the brain scan will likely take a week or so to schedule and interpret. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and determine the best course of action. I want to assure you that we’re going to work through this together, step by step. We're not jumping to any conclusions, and we will address any concerns you have along the way. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes. Do you have someone who can help you with medication management and transportation to appointments?
PATIENT: Well… Sarah, my neighbor, she's been real good to me. Helps me with the groceries and stuff. She could probably take me to appointments. I don’t really have anyone else. My son… he lives out of state. Busy, you know? So… you don’t think it is somethin’ bad? Like… the worst kind of somethin’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rover, it’s important to be realistic, but it's also important to avoid jumping to conclusions. There are many possible causes for memory loss, and not all of them are serious. We need to gather more information before we can say anything definitively. I understand your concern about the “worst kind of something,” which you’re likely referring to conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. It is a possibility, but it’s just one possibility. The tests will help us determine whether that’s the case, or if there’s another explanation. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting these tests done and taking things one step at a time. I will write you a referral for the blood tests and a request for the brain scan. I’ll also give you a list of resources that can provide support and information about memory loss. Do you have any questions about the resources, or anything else we’ve discussed today?
PATIENT: Resources… that's nice of you. I'll try to look them over. It's just… a lot to take in. All this stuff. I mostly just want to remember where I put my keys. And what day it is. I think… I think that's all my questions for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rover. And you’re right, sometimes remembering simple things is the most important thing. We've covered a lot today, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns that come up. We're here to support you through this. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us once we have the test results. Take care of yourself, Mr. Rover. And remember, we’re in this together. .
