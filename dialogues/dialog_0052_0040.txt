DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Shely. It’s August 2nd. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It keeps coming back. And, honestly, I’ve been getting a lot of water infections lately as well. It’s getting a bit tiresome, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand. Recurring pain and frequent infections can certainly be tiresome. Let’s start with the pain in your side. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's… well, it’s on my right side, mostly. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. Comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little niggle, other times it’s quite bothersome. It doesn’t radiate, if that makes sense – it stays pretty much in the same spot. I’ve had it for… oh, goodness, years now, I suppose. But it's been worse lately.
DOCTOR: Years, you say. That helps to narrow things down. And you mentioned it's been worse recently. Can you describe what makes it worse, and what, if anything, makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Hmm. What makes it worse… well, if I move around too much, especially bending, it’s definitely worse. Lifting things is also bad. And if I get dehydrated, I notice it flares up. Makes sense, I suppose, with the water infections. What makes it better… honestly, not much. Resting helps a bit, but it always comes back. A warm bath sometimes takes the edge off, but it’s temporary. I haven’t really found anything that completely gets rid of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk about these frequent water infections. How often would you say you're experiencing them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It used to be every few months, but now… I'd say almost every month, maybe six weeks or so. It's hard to keep track exactly, to be honest. It's always the same – a burning sensation when I go to the toilet, needing to go all the time, and sometimes a bit of blood in the urine. The doctor back home always gave me some tablets, and they cleared it up, but they keep coming back. It's quite worrying, to be frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Espinueva. Recurring infections are concerning, and we need to get to the bottom of this. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I’m a bit tired, more tired than usual, perhaps. But I am getting on, you know? And my appetite hasn't been the best lately. Not much energy for cooking, to be honest. And sometimes, when I wake up, I feel a little bit swollen around my ankles, but it goes away after I've been up and about for a while. I haven't really thought much of it, just put it down to age, but now that you ask…
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Those details are important. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A doctor told me, years ago now, that I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. It's a bit of a mouthful. They said I have lots of little sacs on my kidneys. I don't really understand it all, to be frank. They just told me to drink plenty of water and get regular check-ups. I’ve been seeing my doctor back home, but he’s retired now. That’s why I came to see you, really. I thought you might be able to explain it better.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease, that's what you mean. Yes, that is important information. And it certainly explains some of your symptoms. Do you happen to know if anyone else in your family has kidney problems?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… my mother had something similar, I think. She was always poorly with her kidneys when she got older. And I think my brother had some trouble with them as well, but I’m not entirely sure. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about these things much back then, to be frank. Just knew they weren’t well. I suppose it’s something that runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Knowing about the family history is very helpful. Now, let's talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, just the tablets for the water infections when I get them, as I mentioned. The doctor back home used to prescribe me something called… Nitrofurantoin, I think. And I take a multivitamin every day, just a general one. Nothing else, to be frank. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, to be frank. I can eat anything, and I haven’t got any problems with pollen or dust or anything like that. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That’s a good overview. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and checking your ankles for swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm ready when you are. I understand it's all part of trying to figure out what's going on, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness in any particular spot?
PATIENT: It’s… a little tender on my right side, where the pain is. Not a sharp pain, just a bit uncomfortable when you press there. And, to be honest, a bit tender all over, now that you mention it. I suppose I’ve been a bit tense with worrying about it all.
DOCTOR: I understand. Some tenderness is to be expected. Okay. And now I'll check your ankles. Yes, I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles. There is a slight indentation when I press, which indicates some fluid retention. Alright, thank you, Mr. Espinueva. That completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, I'd like to order some blood and urine tests to get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood and urine tests… yes, I don’t mind at all. Will that tell you more about these kidneys of mine?
DOCTOR: Yes, it will. The blood tests will help us assess your kidney function and check for any signs of infection. The urine tests will confirm whether you have an infection and help identify the type of bacteria causing it. I’ll also order a test to measure your creatinine levels, which is an important indicator of kidney health. I’d also like to discuss a possible ultrasound of your kidneys to get a clearer image of their structure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds a bit more involved, but if it will help, then certainly. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I just want to get to the bottom of this pain and these water infections, to be frank. It’s just been dragging on for too long. Will someone tell me when I can expect the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Espinueva, and we will get to the bottom of this. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. The ultrasound appointment may take a little longer to schedule, but the clinic staff will contact you as soon as we have a date and time. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. I’m going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to treat the current water infection, and I recommend drinking plenty of fluids – at least eight glasses of water a day. It's also important to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions about the medication or any of the tests I've ordered?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything you've said, Doctor. Antibiotics, lots of water, avoid caffeine and alcohol… yes, that all makes sense. Eight glasses of water, that’s a good amount. I’ll try my best to stick to that. And I'll wait for the clinic to contact me about the ultrasound. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we’re finally getting somewhere.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. We’ll review the results as soon as they're available and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as a high fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Here's a printed copy of the prescription and the instructions for the tests. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your help. I appreciate you listening to me. I’ll be in touch if anything changes. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. I hope you feel better soon. And you have a good day as well.
PATIENT: .
