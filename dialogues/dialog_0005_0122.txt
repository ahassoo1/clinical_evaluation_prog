DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is…difficult to explain, but I have been…forgetting things. Small things, mostly. And my blood pressure has been…high, the nurse said. I want to be quick, if that is alright. I have many things to manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, “quick” is fine. Though, sometimes the “small” things are the most important. We’ll get through it. High blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. Let's start with the forgetting. How long has this been going on, and can you give me some examples of what you're forgetting?
PATIENT: Perhaps…six months, maybe a little longer. It is hard to say precisely. Examples…well, yesterday I went to the market, and I completely forgot the plums. I had a list, I know I did, but no plums. And last week, I scheduled a meeting with the board, and I wrote it down, but I…I couldn't recall the time. It made me very upset. It is not like me to be so…disorganized.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, forgetting things like items on a shopping list, appointments… and it’s concerning because it’s a change for you. Has this memory issue been getting worse over those six months?
PATIENT: Yes. Definitely worse. At first, it was just…misplacing keys, or not remembering a name immediately. Now…now I worry I will forget something important. Something with the properties, or the association. That is what scares me most. I am responsible for many things, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, responsible for a lot. And understandably worried. Now, you mentioned the association… could you clarify what you mean by that?
PATIENT: The community association. I manage the finances, the upkeep of the buildings, schedule repairs, organize meetings with the residents… many things. It is a large complex. And the properties…I also help people buy and sell homes in the area. It requires a great deal of…attention to detail, which I always had. Until recently. I find myself double-checking things constantly, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a lot on your plate. Stress can certainly cause these kinds of…lapses. Now, let’s talk about your blood pressure. Do you know what your readings were, or roughly what the nurse told you?
PATIENT: The nurse said…160 over 95, I believe. She said it was quite high and that I needed to see a doctor quickly. I do not understand all of the numbers, but she looked concerned. I have been feeling…a little dizzy sometimes, and a headache, especially in the back of my neck. But I attributed that to the stress, to be honest.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95 is elevated, yes. And the dizziness and headache… those could be stress-related, but they can also be related to high blood pressure. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is…new. My mother had some heart problems when she was older, but I always thought I was quite healthy. I walk every morning, I eat reasonably well… I do not drink or smoke. I was always very proud of my good health, actually. This has been very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, “reasonably well” is good, but everyone’s definition of that is different. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. Then we’ll see about getting some blood work done to rule out anything else. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to understand what is happening and, if possible, fix it. Quickly, if you do not mind. I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat. I’ll start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Sounds a little… congested, but not overly concerning. Now, let's check your reflexes. A little diminished on the left side… Nothing alarming, but we’ll note it. Now, open your mouth for me. Throat looks clear. Blood pressure is still elevated in the office, 158 over 92. Now, I’d like to draw some blood, if you’re up for it. Routine blood work, just to check your thyroid, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying issues.
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready for the blood work. Quickly, please. I… I do not enjoy needles, but I understand it is necessary. My left arm is fine, if that makes a difference. I would like to know the results as soon as possible. It is the uncertainty that is…difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse draw the blood from your left arm. It will take just a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, let's talk a little more about your social history. Do you have any family members you live with?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am widowed. My husband, Dimitri, passed away five years ago. I live alone in the apartment. I have a son, Alexei, but he lives in Moscow with his family. We speak on the telephone, of course, but he is very busy with his work. I am…independent. I manage everything myself. That is why this…forgetfulness is so concerning. Dimitri always said I had a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Right. Independent. Well, that's good. Still, it's important to have support. Now, do you drink alcohol at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Dimitri…he enjoyed a glass of vodka occasionally, but I…I never cared for it. It makes me feel unwell. I prefer tea. And water, of course. I have always been very careful with my health, as I mentioned. I do not understand what is happening. It is…frightening, to feel my mind…slipping.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. The blood work is back. Everything looks within normal limits. Thyroid is fine, kidney function is good, no signs of infection. Which rules out a lot of things. The only slightly elevated value is your cholesterol, but it’s not drastic. Frankly, based on these results, and your history, I suspect this is likely stress-related memory issues, possibly exacerbated by mild hypertension. However, to be completely thorough, I’d like to order a basic cognitive assessment. It's a simple test, just to get a baseline and see if there’s any cause for concern. And I’m going to start you on a low dose of Lisinopril for your blood pressure. We’ll monitor it closely. I also recommend you try to reduce your stress levels. Consider joining a support group, or finding a hobby to relax. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cognitive assessment…and medication. It sounds…serious. But if you think it is necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. Stress…yes, there is a great deal of stress. But I do not have time for hobbies or support groups. I have responsibilities. Very well. Do the test. And the medication. Quickly, if possible. And…how long will it take to see if the medication is working? I have a board meeting next week, and I must be…sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. The cognitive assessment is scheduled for next week. It will take about 30 minutes. As for the Lisinopril, it usually takes a few weeks to reach its full effect. Monitor your blood pressure at home, if you can. The nurse will give you instructions. I recommend taking it easy before your board meeting, and getting plenty of rest. Frankly, Ms. Alvara, if your blood pressure remains elevated despite the medication, or if your cognitive function declines, I’m going to have to refer you to a neurologist. It's better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist…that sounds…worrying. No, I do not have any other questions. Just…the test and the medication. And I will try to rest, although I do not know how successful I will be. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that is all. Perhaps we are finished? I have a great deal to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will give you the medication and schedule the cognitive assessment. I'll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any side effects. And please, try to find some time for yourself. It’s important. That’s all. Have a good day.
