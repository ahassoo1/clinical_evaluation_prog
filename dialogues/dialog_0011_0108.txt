DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain’t one for small talk. Been throwing up blood, alright? Not a little bit, either. It’s… messy. And it’s been going on for a couple days now. Not sure why you need me to tell you that when that’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being direct, Mr. Gentz. I appreciate you sharing that information. Throwing up blood – hematemesis – is certainly concerning, and you are right to seek medical attention. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Hematemesis? See, this is what I’m talking about. Just… regular blood, Doc. Bright red, dark red, I dunno. It all looks the same when it’s coming out of there. Sometimes it's got little… bits in it. Like coffee grounds, maybe? Honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time analyzing it. It’s blood. Bad news. What does the color mean, exactly? Is this a trick question?
DOCTOR: No, that wasn’t a trick question, Mr. Gentz. The color can be helpful. Bright red blood typically suggests bleeding higher up in the digestive tract, while darker blood, or blood resembling coffee grounds, often indicates bleeding from further down. The coffee grounds appearance specifically suggests the blood has been partially digested by stomach acid. You mentioned this has been happening for a couple of days. Can you tell me approximately how much blood you've been vomiting each time, and how frequently?
PATIENT: Look, I’m not measuring cups of vomit, alright? It’s… a lot. Enough to worry me, obviously, or I wouldn’t be sitting here. And it’s not like a steady drip, either. It comes in waves. Yesterday, it was… three times, maybe four. This morning, twice so far. And it’s getting… weaker, maybe? That's a good sign, right? It's probably just something I ate. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been eating much at all since my wife passed. Everything just tastes like… nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It’s important information. Losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and changes in appetite are common during times of grief. We’ll certainly keep that in mind as we consider the possibilities. The fact that it seems to be lessening is… cautiously optimistic, but hematemesis always warrants investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as ulcers, liver disease, or problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No. Kidneys? Nope. Liver… Doc, I work in a crematory. I deal with organs all day, but I don’t exactly have a personal relationship with ‘em. Never been sick a day in my life, ‘til this. Honestly. Strong as an ox, always have been. Used to haul things twice my size. My wife always said I’d work myself to death. Though, this ain't exactly hard labor. Just… depressing. Used to be a fisherman, out on the Gulf. That was a good life. Now… well, now it’s just… this. And look, no offense, but are we gonna get to the point, or are we just swapping life stories here?
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Mr. Gentz. I assure you, we are getting to the point. Understanding your overall health and recent changes helps me narrow down the potential causes. Your strong health history is helpful to know. Let's focus on potential contributing factors. Have you been taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just some aspirin, now and then, for my back. Gets a little stiff lugging… things. And that’s it. Nothing else. No fancy pills, no vitamins. I don’t believe in all that newfangled stuff. Used to just rub some tiger balm on it, worked just fine. And the tiger balm isn’t causing me to puke up blood, believe me. I haven’t touched the stuff in years, anyway.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gentz. That's helpful to know. Even occasional aspirin can contribute to bleeding, so it's good you mentioned it. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll need to gently examine your abdomen. I will also check your vital signs, like your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Don't poke too hard, alright? And try not to look so… concerned. You're making me nervous. Honestly, I've seen worse. You wouldn't believe what people bring in.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz, and I will be as gentle as possible. I'll do my best not to cause any discomfort. And I apologize if my expression is concerning; I’m simply being thorough. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out for me. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, Mr. Gentz, and I can feel some rigidity. It's not severe, but it's something we need to investigate further. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your pulse is a bit rapid. These findings, combined with the hematemesis, suggest we need to rule out several possibilities.
PATIENT: Rule out? What possibilities? Just tell me straight, Doc. Is it cancer? Is it… something bad? Don’t beat around the bush. I’ve lived a long life, I can handle it. Just… don't let me die alone in a hospital bed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concern, and I appreciate you being so direct with me. It’s important to be honest, and I won’t minimize the seriousness of your situation. The hematemesis and the findings on the physical exam could be caused by a number of things. Possibilities include ulcers, gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or bleeding from a tear in the esophagus. Less common, but we must consider them, are issues with your liver or, yes, potentially a growth in the digestive tract. It’s too early to say definitively what’s causing this. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. We will also need to perform an upper endoscopy – a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the source of the bleeding. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to determine the cause of this and provide you with the best possible care. And I understand your concern about being alone. We have excellent palliative care services available, and we will ensure you have the support you need, whatever the outcome. Do you have any questions about these tests or the procedure?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? You want to stick a camera down my throat? Seriously? That sounds… awful. And what about the blood tests? What are you looking for, exactly? Anemia? I feel fine, Doc, mostly. Tired, maybe. But that’s just… life. Look, I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding. And I definitely don't want to spend weeks in a hospital. Is there… a simpler way to figure this out? Maybe I just need some rest? A strong drink?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Gentz, and I apologize for the prospect of uncomfortable procedures. The endoscopy is the most accurate way to visualize the source of the bleeding and determine the cause of your hematemesis. While it isn’t pleasant, it’s the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. We do offer sedation to minimize any discomfort during the procedure. The blood tests will help us assess the extent of the bleeding – checking your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to determine if you’re anemic – and evaluate your overall organ function. They also help rule out other potential causes. Unfortunately, there isn't a simpler way to accurately diagnose the cause of bleeding in the digestive tract. Resting and a strong drink won't address the underlying issue, and could potentially worsen the bleeding. I realize this isn't what you want to hear, but it's important to be thorough. Given your lack of insurance, I also want to discuss options for financial assistance. We have programs available to help cover the cost of these tests and procedures. Would you like me to explain the endoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Financial assistance? You think I haven't heard that song and dance before? Look, I got by just fine on my own for a long time. I don’t need charity. And explaining the procedure… what’s to explain? You stick a tube down my throat, look around, and tell me what’s wrong. Seems pretty straightforward. But… if it’s really necessary… alright. Fine. But I want it over with quick. No unnecessary poking and prodding. And I don’t want a bunch of young residents practicing on me. You do it yourself, Doc. Understand? You. And if I start to feel like I’m choking… you pull it out. Immediately. No questions asked.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Gentz. I will personally perform the endoscopy, and I assure you, it will be done as quickly and efficiently as possible. I will also prioritize your comfort and safety throughout the procedure. If you experience any discomfort or distress, we will stop immediately. I will make a note in your chart regarding your preference for me to perform the procedure. Now, let's proceed with ordering the necessary laboratory tests. We'll also schedule the endoscopy. Given the amount of bleeding you've experienced, I'm going to recommend that we admit you to the hospital for observation and monitoring until we can perform the procedure. This will allow us to manage your condition more effectively and ensure your safety. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of before admitting you?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Just… life, Doc. I’ve lived a long one, remember? No fancy allergies. And look, admitting me… I don’t know. I ain’t one for hospitals. Feels like a… waiting room for the inevitable. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. But I’m warning you, I’m not a good patient. I ask a lot of questions. And I get bored easy. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And make sure the TV gets some decent channels. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. We'll do our best to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I’ll ensure you have access to a television with a good selection of channels, and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you may have. I’ll order the admission and the necessary tests now. A nurse will come up shortly to draw some blood and get you settled in. They will also review your medical history and prepare you for the endoscopy. In the meantime, is there anyone you would like us to contact?
PATIENT: Contact? No. Lost my wife a couple years back. No kids, no family. Just me. I’m used to being alone. Don’t bother with anyone. Seriously. Just… get the tests done, Doc. Let’s get this over with. And maybe… maybe bring me a glass of water. My mouth is kinda dry.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I’ll arrange for a glass of water right away. I understand. We will respect your privacy and ensure you have a comfortable and efficient stay. The nurse will be up shortly to begin the admission process and draw your blood. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask. I will remain your primary physician throughout this process, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. .
PATIENT: .
