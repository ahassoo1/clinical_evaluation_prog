DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's… a bit embarrassing, frankly. It's a soreness in my mouth. A white coating, you see. Not something a man my age should be dealing with. I assumed it would just…go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. Lots of things can cause soreness and a white coating in the mouth. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t recall the precise date. Perhaps… a week ago? Maybe longer. It’s not as if I meticulously document these things. It was after… well, after a particularly stressful period at work. Does that matter? I fall trees, you know. It’s demanding.
DOCTOR: It can definitely matter, stress can impact things. So, about a week or so ago, it started after a stressful time at work. Is the soreness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I eat. Certain foods… sweeter things, mostly. Though even just drinking water can be… unpleasant. It’s a nuisance, truly. I don’t have time for this. I have quotas to meet.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's triggered by eating, especially sweeter foods, and even water can be uncomfortable. Does the soreness feel like a burning, a sharp pain, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s…irritating. A general discomfort. Not a sharp pain, no. More…a rawness, perhaps? Like a mild abrasion. Really, doctor, I'm not one for describing sensations. I deal with wood, not…mouth feelings. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. "Rawness" is helpful, thank you. And no, I'll try to be as quick as possible. Let's take a look, if you don’t mind. Could you open wide for me, and stick your tongue out as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not a pretty sight, I assure you. I haven't been using those fancy mouthwashes everyone recommends. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I do see some redness and that white coating you mentioned. It looks a bit like… thrush, a fungal infection. It's not uncommon, especially with stress or if your immune system is a little lowered. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Fungal infection? Me? I work outside all day! I'm hardly prone to…fungus. And no, I don’t have any other “symptoms,” as you put it. Just this irritating soreness. Look, is this something I need a pill for? Because I really don’t have time for a lengthy treatment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. While it looks like thrush, we shouldn't assume without being certain. It could also be something else, like a mild irritation or even a vitamin deficiency. To be sure, I'd like to do a quick swab of the area. It's a simple test to identify what's causing the soreness. It shouldn't take more than a minute. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I thought you were a doctor, not… a scientist. I suppose if it gets me out of here faster… fine. But make it quick, please. I have trees to fell.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. It was quick, right?
PATIENT: Efficient, I’ll give you that. Now, when can I expect an answer? And what if it is this “thrush”? Will I have to take something awful? I have a very busy schedule, doctor.
DOCTOR: The lab should have the results back to me within a couple of days. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as I have them. If it is thrush, treatment is usually a simple antifungal mouthwash or lozenge—nothing awful, and very manageable with a busy schedule. We can discuss the best option once we have the results. In the meantime, to help with the soreness, I recommend avoiding sugary drinks and foods, and staying well-hydrated. Also, make sure you're getting enough rest – I know it’s hard with your job, but it can really help your immune system. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I'm a man who works with wood. I’m exposed to everything under the sun. No allergies. And frankly, I hope that’s all the questions you have. I’m wasting valuable time here. Just call me when you have the results, and let’s be done with this. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they're back. Thank you for coming in today, Antoine. .
