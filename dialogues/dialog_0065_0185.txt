DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ambris. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, it's my breath. It smells…bad. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I just want it fixed, quickly if possible. I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bad breath, or halitosis, as we call it. I understand it can be quite bothersome, and you'd like a quick solution. Let's try to pinpoint what might be causing it. Can you describe the smell?
PATIENT: Honestly? Like…old garbage. Not a fresh smell at all. Like something’s rotting. And it doesn’t go away, even after brushing. I brush like, twice a day. Sometimes more. It's just always there.
DOCTOR: Right. “Old garbage” is…a very descriptive term. And it persists despite diligent brushing. Twice a day is good, certainly. Let's start with some basics. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don’t get sick often, if that's what you mean. My gums… sometimes bleed a little when I brush really hard, but I thought that was normal. I don't know. This is just annoying, honestly. Is there a pill for this or something?
DOCTOR: Okay. Bleeding gums can be a sign of something, and that's helpful to know. We need to rule out some things. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Any past medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I got divorced last year. Does that count as a medical problem? Seriously, I'm pretty healthy. No asthma, no allergies...nothing major. I just want this breath thing dealt with. Do I need to list everything I’ve ever eaten?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… frankness, Ms. Ambris, a recent divorce isn't a medical condition. And no, you don’t need to list everything you've eaten. I'm just trying to get a general overview. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. Look, I work highway maintenance. It's not like I have time for elective surgery. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, maybe? A long time ago. That’s it. Honestly, this is feeling like a waste of time. Is there something you can prescribe?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy is good to know. Okay, and what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history? You're kidding, right? My grandma smoked, if that counts. My mom… she had high blood pressure, I think? Look, my dad left when I was little, so I don't really know much about his side of the family. It’s all very… distant. I just want a solution to the breath, not a genealogy project. Is this normal for doctors? Asking a million questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ambris, but these questions are important. Family history can sometimes point to underlying issues. I assure you, it’s standard procedure. Now, quickly, just to be complete – any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No! No allergies. I can take pretty much anything. Look, if you're going to spend the next hour asking about my great-aunt’s bunions, I'm leaving. Seriously. Just...give me mouthwash or something. Powerful mouthwash. That's all I need.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ambris, with all due respect, powerful mouthwash isn’t likely to resolve this. Given the description – "old garbage" smell, persistent despite brushing, and bleeding gums – we need to rule out a few possibilities. Now, I’d like to perform a quick oral exam to assess your gums and teeth. Then, I’d like to check your tonsils – yes, even though you had them removed as a child, there can sometimes be residual tissue. Would you allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But I'm telling you, it's probably just something I ate. Don’t make a big deal out of it. And hurry up. I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please open your mouth for me. Hmm. Your gums are noticeably inflamed, with some bleeding even with gentle probing. The back of your tongue appears coated, and there’s a slight redness in the oropharynx. No obvious cavities, but some tartar build-up is present. I also note a…distinct odor. I'm going to gently palpate your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. This may be slightly uncomfortable.
