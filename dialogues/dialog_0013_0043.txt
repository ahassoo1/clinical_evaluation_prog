DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I've been having this headache, right in the back of my head. It’s been going on for…oh, let me think…about a week now, I reckon. Not terrible, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about a week, concentrated in the back of your head. That’s good to know. Can you describe the headache a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm…how to describe it… It’s not a throbbing kind of pain, more like a constant pressure, you know? Like someone’s tightened a band around my head. Sometimes it feels a little…stiff there too, in my neck. It doesn’t come and go real fast, it's just…there. Mostly it’s just annoying more than anything. I can still do things, but I find myself rubbing the back of my head a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant pressure, a little neck stiffness, and it's been pretty consistent for a week. No throbbing. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse—certain activities, light, noise, anything like that?
PATIENT: Good question, Doctor. Let me think… I don't think light or noise bother it much. But… if I spend too long reading, or working on my computer, it definitely feels worse afterwards. And bending my head down, like to tie my shoes… that’s not so good either. Oh, and sometimes when I'm stressed, it feels a bit sharper. Though, at my age, what isn't worse when I'm stressed?
DOCTOR: That's fair. Okay, so it's aggravated by prolonged reading or computer use, bending forward, and stress seems to make it sharper. Have you tried anything to relieve it so far?
PATIENT: I've mostly been taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, the regular kind, you know, acetaminophen. It takes the edge off a little, but it doesn't really fix it. And my daughter, she's a nurse, told me to try a warm compress on my neck. That helps a bit for a short while, but it always comes back. I haven’t done much else, to be honest. I figured I’d better come see someone before it gets worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, acetaminophen helps a little, and a warm compress provides some temporary relief. That's good information. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think carefully. No fever, no dizziness. I haven’t had any trouble with my vision. No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And I haven't noticed any weakness in my arms or legs. Now that I think about it… I have been a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that was my age catching up with me. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Percell. No fever, dizziness, vision changes, nausea, vomiting, or weakness. Increased fatigue noted. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let's see... I had high blood pressure for a while, years ago. The doctor put me on some medication, but I got off of it a long time ago. They said I was doing well enough to manage it with diet and exercise. Aside from that…nothing major, I don't think. I’ve had the usual colds and flus over the years, but nothing that needed a hospital visit. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed when I was in my sixties. But that was a long time ago, and I recovered just fine. Does that cover it, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, so history of high blood pressure, managed with diet and exercise, and a gallbladder removal years ago. Good. Any family history of headaches, or other neurological conditions like stroke or aneurysms?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one… My mother, she always complained of headaches, but it was just something she lived with, always put it down to stress. I don't think they ever really figured out what caused them. And my older brother, he had a stroke about ten years ago, but he didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. I don't know if headaches run in the family, specifically. Nobody ever talked about it much. Does that help, Doctor? It’s hard to remember all that from so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of headaches, and a brother with a stroke, but not specifically related to headaches. That's helpful to know. And just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just a multivitamin every now and then, but I forget more often than I remember. My daughter keeps telling me I should be taking more, but… well, I just haven't gotten around to it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. And no herbal stuff, no. I stick to my coffee in the mornings, that's about it!
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally, and coffee. Great. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes and strength. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds just fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable, alright? I'm not as spry as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be gentle. "Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and your strength is good in all extremities. Your coordination seems fine. I’m also palpating your neck muscles…" "There is some tenderness in your upper back neck muscles.” She then listens to Percell’s heart and lungs. “Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. No swelling in your extremities.” “Okay, Percell. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by stress and prolonged computer use. The elevated blood pressure and neck tenderness contribute to that. However, because of the slightly elevated blood pressure, and just to be safe, I'd like to order some blood work.”
PATIENT: Okay, a tension headache…that sounds about right, I suppose. I have been spending a lot of time on that computer, catching up with my grandkids. And yes, stress... always the stress. Blood work... alright, if you think it's best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. What kind of blood work are we talking about? Is it just a routine thing, or are you looking for something specific? And… will it be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Percell. The blood work will be a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes – and a complete blood count. We'll also check your thyroid levels, just to rule out any underlying issues. It’s mostly routine, but it's important to get a baseline given your slightly elevated blood pressure. As for the cost, I understand your concern completely. I'll write the order with a request for financial assistance – the lab usually has programs for patients with limited income. Let me see what options are available and we can discuss it before proceeding. It should be reasonably affordable, but I want to make sure you’re comfortable with it. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulties with drawing blood?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds thorough, Doctor. Thank you for thinking of everything. Financial assistance…that would be a huge relief, thank you. I appreciate that. No allergies, and I'm usually okay with needles, though I don't particularly like them. My daughter always jokes that I'm a tough old bird, but I confess they make me a little nervous. I guess I'm just getting old and sensitive. But, yes, I'm alright with the blood work. Whatever you think is best. And thank you for being so considerate about the cost, Doctor. That means a lot.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, Percell. I’m going to write the lab order now and then we can schedule a time for you to go get the blood work done. After we get the results back – usually takes a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and try to take frequent breaks from the computer. Gentle neck stretches can also help. I also want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff available?
PATIENT: Hmm…a blood pressure cuff? No, I don't, Doctor. My daughter mentioned I should get one, but… well, I haven't gotten around to it yet. I suppose I should, shouldn't I? Is it hard to use? I'm not very good with all the new technology. And yes, gentle stretches…I can try that. I used to do a little yoga, years ago, but my joints aren't what they used to be. Frequent breaks from the computer…that’s a good idea. I get lost in those emails from my grandkids, time just slips away. So, let me get this straight…pain relievers, stretches, breaks, and get a blood pressure cuff. And wait for the blood work results. Is that everything for now?
DOCTOR: That’s right – pain relievers as needed, gentle stretches, frequent breaks from the computer, and getting a blood pressure cuff would be helpful. I can write you a prescription for a basic home blood pressure monitor. They are fairly easy to use, and I have a nurse who can show you how to operate it and record your readings properly. We’ll review the readings at your next appointment. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done and scheduling a follow-up. I’m going to print out the lab order and a pamphlet with some stretching exercises. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you to offer to have the nurse show me how to use it, Doctor! That would be a huge help. I appreciate that. Stretching exercises…perfect. I tend to hunch over, I think. And no, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just a little overwhelmed with everything, to be honest. But I feel better knowing you’ve got a plan. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. It’s my job, and I'm happy to help. It’s always best to be thorough. “Here’s the lab order, and the pamphlet on stretches. The nurse’s name is Mai, and she’s usually available on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I'll have her schedule a time to go over the blood pressure monitor with you. I’ll also have my assistant schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any preferences for when that should be?
PATIENT: Oh, excellent! Tuesdays or Thursdays would be fine for me. I'm fairly flexible. As for the follow-up, sometime next week would be good, if possible. I don’t want to wait too long. But whatever works best for your schedule is fine with me. Thank you again, Doctor. You've really put my mind at ease. I was worried it was something serious, but now I feel much better.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Percell. We'll get you scheduled and I'll see you next week. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
