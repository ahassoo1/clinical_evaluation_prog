DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Queener. Welcome to my practice. I’m Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer, you see? It’s in my leg, mostly. It’s been… bothering me. Not terrible pain, just… big. And uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatment is, unfortunately, not uncommon. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. When you say “after the cancer,” could you clarify what type of cancer you were treated for, and when the treatment concluded?
PATIENT: Oh… um… breast cancer. About… two years ago, I think? Everything happened so fast, you know? Chemotherapy, then the surgery… and now this leg. It was the right breast, if that matters. And the treatment… I finished in… December, maybe? Of 2023. Yes, December 2023, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Very well. And this swelling… is it in one leg specifically, or both?
PATIENT: Just the right leg. The one on the same side as… well, where the cancer was. It’s not awful all the time, but when I stand for too long, it gets really… puffy. And sometimes it feels… heavy. Like it’s full of water, almost?
DOCTOR: I see. And has this swelling been gradually worsening since December 2023, or did it appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, it didn't happen right away, no. It started… slowly, I think. A little bit after the chemo finished. I thought it was just from being tired, honestly. But it's… gotten bigger and bigger over the months. Not quickly, but… steady. Yes, steady.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain with the swelling, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like a tight feeling, you know? And sometimes a little ache. But it’s not… sharp. It's just… annoying. Especially when I try to wear shoes. They feel too tight.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any changes in the skin on your right leg?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me think. It feels… warmer, maybe? Than my other leg. And sometimes… a little red. Not a lot, but a bit. It’s not… bumpy or anything. Just… different. I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. I just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to need to examine your right leg, Ms. Queener, to assess the swelling and the skin condition more thoroughly. If you would please sit on the examination table, and I'll begin with a visual inspection. Then I’ll palpate the area and check for any tenderness. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want it to… stop bothering me. It’s a little embarrassing, honestly. But go ahead, please. I’ll sit down.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to take a look at your leg now. As you mentioned, there is some visible swelling, particularly in the lower portion of your right leg. I also note some mild redness. Now, I’m going to gently palpate the area. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm… There is some mild pitting edema present. And, as you said, it does feel warmer to the touch than your left leg. No palpable masses. Is this uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Oh… that feels… a little strange. Not painful, exactly. Just… pressure. A little bit. Like when you press on a sponge, I guess? Yes, that feels… like a sponge. And… the warmth… I do feel that, now that you mention it. I thought it was just the room, but… no, it is warmer.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this initial examination, it appears you are experiencing lymphedema, likely as a consequence of the cancer treatment and removal of lymph nodes. It's not uncommon, unfortunately, but it does require management. I'm also noting mild skin changes suggestive of possible early signs of cellulitis, though we'll need further investigation to confirm that. To rule out cellulitis and assess the extent of the lymphedema, I would like to order a complete blood count and a D-dimer test. Additionally, a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg would be beneficial to rule out deep vein thrombosis . Do you have any known allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Lymphedema… that sounds… complicated. And cellulitis? Is that… bad? I just want it to go away, you know? Tests… yes, I guess tests are okay. Allergies… hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I'm a little sensitive to… perfume, sometimes. But that's not an allergy, really. Just makes me sneeze. I haven’t had any… serious allergies, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known serious allergies is helpful. Perfume sensitivity is not a concern for these tests. We'll proceed with the CBC, D-dimer, and Doppler ultrasound. I'll have the nurse draw blood for the CBC and D-dimer right away. Then we will schedule the Doppler ultrasound, likely within the next 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your right leg as much as possible and avoiding prolonged standing. Compression stockings can also be helpful. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… like the ones old ladies wear? Oh dear. That sounds… not very fashionable. But… if it helps… yes, I guess I can try. Um… how long will it take to… get better? Is it… curable? Or will I have this swelling forever? That’s what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Queener. Lymphedema is often a chronic condition, meaning there is no outright "cure." However, it is manageable with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications. The goal is to reduce the swelling, prevent complications like skin infections, and improve your quality of life. Compression stockings are often a crucial component of this management, and while the aesthetic may not be ideal, they are very effective. The results of these tests will help us determine the severity of the lymphedema and rule out other potential issues like DVT or cellulitis. Depending on those results, we may consider referral to a physical therapist specializing in lymphedema management. They can teach you specific exercises and techniques to promote lymphatic drainage. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… yes, that sounds… better than just wearing stockings. Exercises… I can try that. I used to walk a lot, before… everything. So… it won't go away completely? But I can… make it less puffy? And less… annoying? And no… bad infections? That sounds… good. Yes, that sounds acceptable. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Queener. That is the goal, yes. To reduce the swelling, improve your comfort, and prevent complications. We will work through this systematically. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the test results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a more comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, continue elevating your leg whenever possible, avoid prolonged standing, and if you notice any fever, increased redness, or pain in your right leg, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions before I leave you to prepare for the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. I just… want to get back to normal, you know? But this… sounds like a good start.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the nurse come in shortly. Please do not hesitate to contact the office with any concerns. .
