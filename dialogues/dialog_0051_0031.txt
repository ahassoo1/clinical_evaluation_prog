DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. It’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Glazewski. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is awfully swollen. It’s been like this for a few days now, and… I have a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it not beating right. They called it… atrial fib… something? It's the reason my leg might be swollen, I think.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, yes. I see. And you're right to mention that connection. It's certainly possible. A few days, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about three or four days now. It started slowly, just feeling a bit puffy in the ankle, and it's gotten worse each day. It's not painful, exactly… just feels heavy and… uncomfortable. I haven't been able to wear my usual shoes.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and uncomfortable, not painful. And it’s preventing you from wearing your usual shoes. That gives me a bit more to work with. Have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, besides the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It doesn't feel warm, not that I’ve noticed. And… I don't think it’s red. It looks a bit… paler than my other leg, maybe? It’s hard to tell for sure, I suppose. I haven’t really been looking closely, to be honest, just trying to avoid putting weight on it.
DOCTOR: Pale, you say… interesting. And have you had any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I always feel a little tired. And… sometimes I get a bit breathless when I walk upstairs. But that’s happened before too, with the heart thing. It's hard to say what's new and what isn't. I don’t know if that helps.
DOCTOR: It does help, Nixon, it really does. It’s often tricky to pinpoint new changes. You've mentioned fatigue and breathlessness, both of which we should consider. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything else besides the atrial fibrillation?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The atrial fib was diagnosed about… oh, maybe six months ago? They did lots of tests then, and that was all they found. I take some pills for it, every day. I can tell you what they are, if you like. I have the bottle in my bag.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. Knowing what medications you’re taking is very important. Don’t worry about remembering the exact names; just tell me what you can. And if you have the bottle handy, that would be perfect.
PATIENT: Right, just a moment. Here we are. It says… “Bisoprolol” and… “Apixaban.” Those are the two. I take one of each every morning. And sometimes, if my heart feels really funny, they tell me to take an extra Apixaban.
DOCTOR: Bisoprolol and Apixaban… good. Both commonly used for atrial fibrillation. And you occasionally take an extra Apixaban as needed, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. When it feels… fluttery, like it's beating too fast or irregularly. It’s hard to explain, really. The doctors told me to listen to my body. And if it feels bad, take another pill. I haven’t needed to take one in the last few days, though. Just the regular ones.
DOCTOR: Alright. Listening to your body is good advice. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky so far. Just the usual childhood illnesses, like chickenpox. But nothing major. No operations or anything like that. I don’t do very well with hospitals, if I’m being honest. They make me quite nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. Hospitals aren’t for everyone. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother had high blood pressure, I think. She took pills for it for years. And my grandfather… on my father’s side… he had something with his heart too, but I don’t remember exactly what. He passed away when I was quite young. No one else, that I know of, has had any heart problems.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your grandfather… alright. And finally, a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t care for it. And my father smoked, but he gave it up years ago when I was little. He used to be a fisherman, but he retired now. He says it’s much healthier.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe two or three times a week. Nothing heavy, just a little. And I don’t drink spirits or beer. That’s all. I prefer a nice glass of red wine with my meal. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to examine your leg. And perhaps listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this leg sorted out. It’s making it hard to get around.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling some definite swelling in your left lower leg, Nixon. It's warmer than your right leg, though not dramatically so. And as I suspected, the circumference is larger than your right leg – about 2cm larger, to be precise. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Here we go. Do I need to take my shoes off?
DOCTOR: No, your shoes can stay on for now. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute, and there’s a slightly irregular rhythm – which we would expect given your atrial fibrillation. I'm hearing some clear breath sounds in both lungs, no crackles or wheezes at this time. Overall, everything sounds relatively normal, but the increased heart rate warrants further attention.
PATIENT: Right. Increased heart rate… is that why my leg is swollen? I thought the pills were supposed to stop that. Should I be taking more pills?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Nixon. The swelling could be related to the atrial fibrillation, as it can sometimes lead to fluid retention. The pills you're taking help manage the rhythm, but they don't always completely prevent complications like this. However, there are other potential causes we need to rule out before assuming it's solely due to the atrial fib. It's possible there's a blood clot, or another underlying issue contributing to the swelling. We’ll need to do some further testing to find out for certain. To start, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test to check for signs of a blood clot. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and a kidney function test, just to get a broader picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood clot… that sounds scary. But yes, that sounds alright. If that's what you think is best, Doctor, then please do the tests. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about a blood clot, but let’s not jump to conclusions. The D-dimer test will help us determine if further investigation is needed. The results usually come back within a few hours, so I’d expect to have them by tomorrow morning. If the D-dimer is elevated, we’ll likely need to do an ultrasound of your leg to look for a blood clot directly. If it’s normal, we can explore other potential causes. Yes, you'll need to come back, regardless of the results. I want to monitor your progress and ensure we get this sorted out. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three days from now. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Three days… yes, that should be alright. So, just come back in three days, and we’ll see what the tests say? And… in the meantime, should I do anything special? Like… keep my leg elevated, or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Come back in three days and we'll discuss the results. In the meantime, yes, elevating your leg whenever possible is a good idea. That can help reduce the swelling. Also, try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting for long periods. Gentle ankle exercises – rotating your foot and flexing your toes – can also help improve circulation. I'm going to write you a prescription for compression stockings – those can also help with the swelling. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Compression stockings… are they comfortable? I’ve never worn them before. And… what strength should I get? I don't want them to be too tight, but I want them to help, you know?
DOCTOR: Good, no allergies. Compression stockings can take a little getting used to, but they can be very helpful. I'm prescribing a mild compression strength – 15-20 mmHg. That should be comfortable enough for everyday wear and provide sufficient support. The pharmacy staff can help you with sizing and fitting. It's important to get the right size to ensure they’re effective and comfortable. You can start with those and if they don't provide enough support, we can consider a higher compression strength at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we have a plan. I'll see you in three days, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment, such as increased pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or any shortness of breath or chest pain. We’ll see you in three days. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
