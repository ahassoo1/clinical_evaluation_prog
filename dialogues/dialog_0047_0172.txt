DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here. My husband insisted. Something about… a social visit? New to the area, he said. It all feels rather unnecessary, if you ask me. I was perfectly capable of managing things where we were.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your husband clearly has your best interests at heart. A “social visit” isn’t typically how we conduct things here, but we can certainly use this time to do a general check-up, just to ensure everything is as it should be. It’s good practice when relocating. Now, let’s start with the basics. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: "Unwell?" Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly… robust. As robust as one can be at my age, naturally. Though, I have been feeling rather tired lately. But that's hardly a reason to bother a doctor, is it? It's simply… the exhaustion of settling in. And frankly, this whole process is quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Exhaustion can be a symptom of many things, Candice. Even things that aren't immediately apparent. It's my job to rule those out. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing dramatic, Doctor. Just… lacking pep, I suppose. I find myself needing a little nap in the afternoon, that's all. And I don’t have the energy to tend to my garden like I used to. Really, it’s just… old age creeping in. It's perfectly natural. I don't require a battery of tests over a bit of afternoon fatigue.
DOCTOR: With all due respect, Candice, dismissing symptoms as “old age” isn’t a particularly helpful approach. We need to understand why you're feeling fatigued, not simply accept it. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Good heavens, Doctor, what are you implying? I’m not a wilting flower! I’m still quite… capable. Though, now that you mention it… my appetite has been a little off. Not that I require a large meal these days, naturally. But even a small biscuit doesn’t seem as appealing as it once did. Honestly, I suspect it’s this dreadful weather. It’s enough to put anyone off their food.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this decreased appetite been accompanied by any unintentional weight loss, Candice?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Goodness, Doctor, I haven't stepped on a scale in ages! I haven't the slightest idea. Really, I find all this questioning quite intrusive. I came here because my husband insisted, not to be subjected to a… a personal inventory! If you must know, my clothes feel a little looser, perhaps. But that could simply be the fabric shrinking in the wash.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Let’s try a slightly different approach. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, you're treating me like a hypochondriac! I’ve lived a long and healthy life, and I assure you, I know what I’m feeling. If anything… I’ve been a little… forgetful, lately. But that’s hardly a cause for alarm, is it? It happens at my age. I simply misplace things from time to time. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: And can you describe this forgetfulness, Candice?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… little things. Where I put my spectacles, the name of that actress in the film… perfectly trivial matters. It's not as though I’m losing my mind, Doctor. I remember perfectly well my wedding anniversary, and the names of my grandchildren. It's just… details. Insignificant details. Really, I don't see what this has to do with anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a difficult question. It was so long ago. My general practitioner… Dr. Abernathy, a very good man… he handled all of that. Honestly, I can’t recall the specifics. I always trusted him to keep track of such things. Something about my… digestion, perhaps? And a touch of… nervousness, I believe. But I assure you, nothing serious. It was all perfectly manageable.
DOCTOR: Right. Do you recall ever being hospitalized for anything, Candice?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Goodness, that was a lifetime ago. I believe… yes, I had a rather nasty bout of… the flu, many years ago. And… oh dear. Was it my appendix? I think it was my appendix. It was a small procedure, nothing to write home about. I was in and out in a few days. Really, I don’t recall the details. My husband, Harold, would know more. He has a remarkably good memory for such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see if we can access your medical records from Dr. Abernathy’s office… Ah, here we are. It appears you were diagnosed with… mild hypertension and anxiety, as you mentioned. No history of appendix removal. And… a recent diagnosis of Vitamin D deficiency. Have you been taking any supplements for that?
PATIENT: Vitamin D deficiency? Goodness me. No, I haven’t the faintest idea. Doctor, are you certain this is my record? I don’t recall a thing about any of this. And anxiety? I am a perfectly composed woman! My husband may have mentioned something about me being a little… particular about things, but that’s hardly anxiety. Honestly, this is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: These are your records, Candice, pulled directly from Dr. Abernathy's office. It appears he prescribed you Vitamin D supplements six months ago. It’s not uncommon for people to forget details about their medical history, especially over time. However, it’s important we address these findings. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications…? Well, I take a small dose of… something for my water retention. Harold handles all of that. He’s very organized. And… perhaps a little something for my nerves before social gatherings. But honestly, I can't recall the names. It's all rather… bothersome, being questioned like this. I came for a simple check-up, not an interrogation!
DOCTOR: Candice, it’s essential for me to have a complete and accurate list of all medications you’re taking, including dosages. Relying on your husband isn’t sufficient. We need to ensure there are no potentially harmful interactions or contraindications. Now, can you describe the water retention medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a pharmacist! Harold keeps everything neatly organized. But… here. This is what I take for my… swelling. It’s a small white pill. He tells me to take one every morning with breakfast. He’s very particular about these things. Really, I don't understand why you need to know all these details. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s vital, Candice, to identify exactly what you are taking. Unlabeled medications pose a significant risk. I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and rule out any potential underlying issues. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam…? Goodness me. At my age? Really, Doctor, is it necessary? I assure you, I’m perfectly healthy. But… if you insist. Though I warn you, I’m rather sensitive. And I dislike being prodded and poked. Harold always said I have delicate sensibilities.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed as gently as possible. Please, if you'll just have a seat on the table. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Blood pressure is 145/85 – elevated. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, you're making me quite nervous! And my blood pressure? Is it terribly high? Harold always said I get anxious at doctors' offices. It’s probably nothing, just a temporary spike. And please, be gentle with the reflexes. I bruise easily, you know. My skin is terribly sensitive.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is elevated, Candice, but not critically high. It’s likely influenced by your anxiety, as you mentioned. And yes, we’ll be very gentle. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Balance is slightly unsteady, but within acceptable limits for her age. Alright, Candice. Based on this brief exam, and your reported symptoms and medical history, several things are concerning. Your elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, unsteady balance, and reported fatigue and forgetfulness warrant further investigation. We need to rule out several potential causes.
PATIENT: Further investigation? Goodness me. What are you implying, Doctor? Is something terribly wrong? I knew I shouldn’t have come. Harold will be furious. He always said I worry too much. Is it something serious? You’re scaring me!
DOCTOR: Please, Candice, try not to panic. I’m not saying anything is definitely wrong. However, it’s important to be thorough and rule out potential issues. Your symptoms could be due to several factors, including medication interactions, Vitamin D deficiency, or a more serious underlying condition. I recommend a few blood tests to check your Vitamin D levels, kidney function, thyroid function, and complete blood count. I also recommend an MRI of your brain to rule out any neurological issues that could be contributing to your forgetfulness and unsteady balance. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Goodness gracious, Doctor, are you serious? I’ve never had an MRI in my life! It sounds dreadful. And blood tests? So many needles… Harold always said I faint at the sight of blood. And what if something is wrong? You’re scaring me to death! Perhaps I should just go home and rest. Maybe it’s just a temporary… a temporary indisposition.
DOCTOR: Candice, I understand your anxiety. However, these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. The MRI is a non-invasive procedure, and we can provide you with medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. The blood tests are relatively quick and painless. Ignoring these symptoms won't make them go away, and it could potentially lead to more serious complications down the line. I strongly recommend that we proceed with these investigations. Now, if you're willing, I can schedule these tests for you at the clinic. We can also discuss a referral to a neurologist to provide a more specialized assessment. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… I don’t know what to do. Harold always makes all these decisions. He’s so good with… with everything. Perhaps you could just call him? He'll know what’s best. He’ll want you to run all sorts of tests, I’m sure. He's very thorough. And perhaps… perhaps a sedative for the MRI? I simply couldn't bear it otherwise. Yes, please call Harold. He’s at… at the golf club, I believe. He’ll be expecting a call.
DOCTOR: Very well, Candice. I will contact your husband, Harold, and discuss these findings with him. In the meantime, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to review the results of the tests and discuss a plan of action. Hello?
