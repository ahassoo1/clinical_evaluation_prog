DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerreroloopez. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well... it's my ear, you see. Feels blocked, like something's… stuffed in there. Not painful, just… full. Been like this for a bit, I think. Honestly, time gets away from me these days. It's probably been a few weeks, maybe? I just wanted to get it checked, before it gets worse, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A feeling of fullness in the ear, for approximately a few weeks. Not painful, simply a sensation of blockage. I see. And has this been unilateral – meaning one ear only – or are you experiencing this in both ears?
PATIENT: Both, I think. Yes, both ears. It's not… worse in one than the other, just… both feel a bit clogged. It’s hard to tell, really. I don’t really pay attention to these things unless it bothers me, and it's only now it's bothering me enough to come see someone. Sorry, I'm probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Guerreroloopez. It's quite common to not notice subtle changes. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Other symptoms… No, not really. Maybe a little bit of…ringing, sometimes? But I always assumed that was just… old age, you know? It comes and goes, so I never connected it to the ear feeling blocked. I don’t know if that's important. I'm not sure. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears, intermittent. We’ll certainly consider that. Now, have you experienced any dizziness, any changes in your hearing – difficulty understanding conversations, needing to turn up the volume on the television, for example?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. No more than usual, anyway. And the hearing… well, my wife used to complain I didn't listen to her, but that was just… a marriage thing. Seriously though, I haven’t noticed any difference in my hearing. I mean, I don't spend a lot of time listening to music, if that's what you mean. Mostly just the news. And I usually have it on pretty loud. Does that help?
DOCTOR: The volume on the news is… relevant. Mr. Guerreroloopez, have you had any recent exposure to loud noises – machinery, concerts, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Well, I work with tractors, you know, agricultural inspections. So, yes. Tractors are… loud. They're very loud. I wear earplugs sometimes, but… not always. It depends. If I'm just quickly checking something, I usually don't bother. Honestly, I forget half the time. Sorry. Is that… bad? I should probably be more careful.
DOCTOR: Intermittent use of ear protection with tractor work. Alright. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your ears in the past?
PATIENT: Ear infections… Now that you mention it, I think I had one as a kid. A really bad one. But that was… a long time ago. Besides that, no, not that I recall. My wife used to take care of all the doctor stuff. She knew all that. I just… showed up when she told me to. I’m really not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez. We will get through this together. Have you ever had any surgery, or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Surgery… yes, I had my appendix out when I was young. And… oh, I was in the hospital for a few days once, with pneumonia. A bad case of it. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? Fifteen? It all blurs together, you know? It was right before… right before my wife got sick. It was a difficult time. I’m sorry, am I rambling?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, pneumonia approximately 10-15 years ago. You are not rambling, Mr. Guerreroloopez. It's important to provide this information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I can eat anything, take anything. Well, my wife always said I shouldn't mix alcohol and certain pills, but that wasn’t really an allergy, was it? I don't really take much medication these days. Just a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. And… nothing else, I think. Unless my wife told me different, and I've forgotten. Which is… entirely possible.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you currently taking for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s a little white pill. Small one. I… I usually take it with breakfast. I can't remember the name. The bottle is at home. It’s… something with a 'P', I think. Or maybe an 'M'? It just helps with the stiffness, you know. It's not very strong. My daughter refills it for me when I run out. I really should pay more attention. Sorry, I’m terrible at this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez. We can obtain a list of your medications from your pharmacy. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have experienced hearing loss or ear problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had terrible tinnitus, always ringing in her ears. She complained about it for years. And my brother, he worked in a factory, really loud place, and he ended up needing hearing aids. Everyone said it was the noise. That’s about it, I think. My daughter's healthy as a horse, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of tinnitus, brother with noise-induced hearing loss. Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… I used to smoke, years ago. Quit about twenty years ago, when my wife… well, it was a good time to quit. I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing heavy. And… no, no drugs. Never touched them. I just like a little wine to relax. Is that… okay?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez. Thank you for your honesty. Now, if you don’t mind, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination of your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. Hurry up and get it over with, if you don't mind. Not a fan of poking and prodding, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please recline back, and I will begin with your ears. The right tympanic membrane appears slightly dull, with some cerumen present. Similar findings in the left ear – dull tympanic membrane and cerumen buildup. No tenderness to palpation. Nasal passages appear clear. Throat appears normal. I do note some mild cerumen impaction in both ears. This could be contributing to your sensation of fullness.
PATIENT: Oh. Cerumen? Is that… earwax? So it's just… blocked with earwax? That’s it? My wife always used to clean my ears, but… well, things haven’t been the same since she passed. I haven't really thought about it, to be honest. Can you just… take it out? Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: Yes, cerumen is earwax. And it appears we do have a buildup in both ears. We can remove it, but I prefer to do so gently. I can irrigate your ears with warm water, or I can use a cerumen removal tool. Given your history, I think irrigation would be the more comfortable option. However, I want to rule out anything more serious first. We’ll start with a basic hearing test to get a baseline. It’s a simple test, just responding to tones at different volumes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test? Oh. I’m not very good with these things, Doctor. I always worry I’ll get it wrong. And I don't want you to think I’m going deaf or something. Is it a long test? I have… an appointment later this afternoon. Can it wait?
DOCTOR: It’s a very quick test, Mr. Guerreroloopez. Just a few tones in each ear. It will help us determine if the wax is the sole cause of your symptoms, or if there's anything else we need to investigate. It will take less than five minutes. And if everything checks out, we can proceed with the cerumen removal immediately. If you prefer, we can reschedule, but it’s best to address this sooner rather than later to rule out any potential underlying issues.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Fine. Just get it over with then. The quicker the better. I don't like waiting around. Just… tell me what to do. And please be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. Let's just get this done.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Please have a seat here, and I’ll place these headphones over your ears. I’ll be in the next room, and I’ll ask you to respond when you hear a tone. It will be very straightforward. Just raise your hand when you hear something. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get on with it. Hurry up, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez, the test is complete. The results indicate mild hearing loss in both ears, but it's consistent with cerumen impaction and your age. It doesn't appear to be anything significant, which is encouraging. We can proceed with cerumen removal. Would you like me to do that now, or would you prefer to reschedule?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… good, isn't it? Mild. Not terrible. Yes, let’s just get it over with. Do it now. I want this done. I'm tired of feeling blocked up. Just… be quick and gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing, so I know what to expect. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. First, I’ll warm the water to body temperature. Then, I’ll use a small syringe to gently irrigate your ears with the warm water. It may feel a little strange, like a mild pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. I’m going to gently insert this speculum into your ear canal to protect the skin, and then slowly introduce the warm water. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh. Just… get it over with. Quickly now, please. I don’t like having things stuck in my ears. And be careful! I bruise easily, remember? I don’t want a punctured eardrum or anything. Just… do it. I’ll try not to flinch. But warn me before you start. Don't just spring it on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez. I’m going to gently insert the speculum now. You may feel a slight pressure. Now, I’ll slowly introduce the warm water. You may hear a slight swishing sound. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Do you feel any pain?
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… cold! And it feels like water’s going up my nose! Is that normal? It's a bit… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… strange. And it's making my head feel a little funny. Is this supposed to happen? Please hurry up! It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez, I'll stop for a moment. You’re right to tell me, that’s not ideal. The water shouldn’t be cold, and it shouldn’t be causing discomfort. It seems the water wasn't at the ideal temperature, and perhaps I was being a bit too aggressive with the flow. My apologies. We can definitely stop here if you’d prefer. Or, I can try again, with a warmer temperature and a gentler approach. But only if you’re comfortable. I don't want to cause you any further distress. Perhaps we should reschedule and consider a different method, such as manual removal, which might be more comfortable. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, no! No, don’t stop completely. I just… I don't want to have to come back again. But… warmer, please. And gentler! Much gentler. I really don't like this feeling. And please tell me exactly what you're doing. Don't just spring things on me. Just… go slow. Very slow. And warmer. Definitely warmer. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerreroloopez. I've adjusted the temperature, and I'll be much more gentle this time. I will explain each step as I go. You may feel slight pressure. I'm introducing a very small amount of water now, just to see how you feel. Do you feel any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… That’s… better. Still a bit strange, but… not cold. And it's not as forceful. I can feel something… moving, I think. Like a little… bubble. Is that good? And my head doesn’t feel quite as funny anymore. Maybe it's working. Please just… keep going slow. And tell me if you see anything. I really want this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good. I'm seeing some cerumen being released now. And there’s more… Okay, I think we’ve gotten the bulk of it out. Let’s take a look and see. Ah, yes, much clearer now. The ear canal is significantly less impacted. We've successfully removed most of the cerumen. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh! That… feels better. Definitely better. It doesn’t feel so… blocked anymore. It's still a little funny, but… lighter. Can I… can I hear better? I think… I think it's working. It was horrible, but… thank you, Doctor. Really. It's a relief. Now, can I go? I have that appointment…
DOCTOR: Yes, you should notice an improvement in your hearing, and it will likely continue to improve over the next few hours as any remaining wax loosens. Your hearing does appear improved, and you’re responding appropriately. "Yes, you can absolutely go. However, I will provide some aftercare instructions to prevent future buildup. First, avoid using cotton swabs in your ears, as they tend to push the wax further in. If you feel a buildup, I recommend using over-the-counter cerumenolytic drops, such as Debrox, a few times a week. If you experience any pain, discharge, or persistent hearing loss, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh, Debrox… I’ll try to remember that. No cotton swabs, got it. And see you if it gets worse. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You were very… patient. I’m not the easiest patient, you know. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. That appointment… Goodbye!
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Guerreroloopez. Glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a pleasant day, and be careful driving.
