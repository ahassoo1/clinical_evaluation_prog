DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Gorga, is it? Yes. Well, it’s been… a bit of a bother, really. I just haven’t been feeling quite right. Mostly with my stomach. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and… I don’t know… I just don’t feel hungry much anymore. Even a little bit of food fills me up too fast. It’s been going on for… oh, goodness, I can’t quite say how long. A while now, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach issues… feeling full quickly, and loss of appetite. Right. And you said “a while now”?
PATIENT: Yes, “a while.” It feels like… since the treatments ended, maybe? Though, honestly, time kind of blurs together these days. I had… well, I had the cancer treatments. They were… a long time ago now. I don’t remember exactly when they stopped, but it feels connected, somehow. Does that make any sense? I just… don’t feel like I can eat much before I get a bad feeling. It’s not pain, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, treatments… right. And this started after those finished. It's good you're connecting things. Sometimes those treatments can have lingering effects. And you said not pain, but discomfort… can you describe the discomfort a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s hard to describe. It’s… like a fullness, but not a good fullness, if that makes sense. Like… something is blocking things, almost. And it makes me feel sick to my stomach, like I'm gonna… well, you know. It’s not sharp, or burning, just… heavy. And it happens pretty quickly, even if I only eat a small plate of something. It's just… not nice. I try to eat something, because I know I should, but then I feel worse. It’s a bit of a vicious circle, really. I don’t want to bother you with all this, but it’s just wearing me down.
DOCTOR: No, no bother at all, Mrs. Kelder. That’s what I’m here for. Okay, fullness quickly, nausea… and it feels like something is blocking things. Has anything specific triggered it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It doesn't seem to be a certain food… I've tried eating bland things, soups, crackers… it doesn’t seem to matter much. Sometimes it’s worse in the morning, maybe? But other times it’s… just random. I’ve been trying to keep track, but my memory isn't what it used to be. I had my son visiting last week, and he asked if it was worse after I had sweets, but I don’t think so. Honestly, I just wish I knew something to make it stop. It's hard to enjoy anything when I'm worried about feeling sick all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no specific triggers, doesn't seem related to food type… and you mentioned it's sometimes worse in the morning. Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… . I’ve been… a little tired, maybe? But then, I’m always a little tired. And… well, I haven’t been… regular, if you know what I mean. . It’s not a big problem, but it’s… different than usual. It’s all just… a bit unsettling. I mostly just feel… off. Does that make sense? I feel like something isn't right, even when I can't put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mrs. Kelder. Feeling "off" is a very good way to describe it. Okay, tiredness and some changes in bowel habits. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again, if that makes any sense. I’ve been through a lot, and I just want this… discomfort… to go away. Please, do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Try to relax, and just breathe normally. …Okay. Sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. …Anything here?
PATIENT: No… not really. It doesn't hurt exactly, but… that spot there, on the left side… it feels a little… full. Not painful, just… a bit uncomfortable when you press on it. It's hard to explain. It’s the same feeling I get when I try to eat. It's not a sharp pain, just… pressure. And it feels like something is… swollen, maybe? But not hard, if that makes any sense. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, left side, feeling of fullness, not hard. Good to know. I’m not feeling any significant masses or anything concerning, but there is some mild tenderness there, as you pointed out. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to make sure everything sounds clear. …Everything sounds good there too. So, all in all, nothing immediately jumps out as a major concern, but we need to do some further testing to figure out what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Testing? What kind of testing? I… I don’t really like tests. They make me nervous. Is it something serious, Doctor? I just want to know what’s going on. I've had enough of not knowing, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Mrs. Kelder, and I'll explain everything. It’s routine, I promise. We'll start with some blood work to check your overall health and rule out anything obvious. And I’d like to order a stool test to look for any signs of infection or inflammation. And given your history and the fullness you're describing, I think it would be a good idea to get a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on internally. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s better to be thorough. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… complicated. And stool test… I suppose that’s alright. But a CT scan… will it hurt? Will it take long? And… what if it does show something bad? I… I don't want to go through all that again. I just want to feel normal. I don't know if I can handle a lot more… tests and worry. And… what about my Medicare? Will that cover it? I'm on a fixed income, you know. I don't have a lot of extra money for… things like that.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mrs. Kelder. Let me address them one by one. The CT scan is painless. You’ll lie on a table, and a machine will take images. It takes about 20-30 minutes. As for finding something… we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. If we do find something, we'll discuss all your options and come up with a plan that works for you. And yes, your Medicare should cover the CT scan and blood work. We’ll verify everything with them beforehand, of course, and there shouldn’t be any significant out-of-pocket costs. I understand your worry, and I want to assure you that we'll take things one step at a time. I'll explain everything clearly, and you can ask as many questions as you need. We’re a team in this, and we’ll get to the bottom of it together. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule those tests for you?
PATIENT: A team… yes, that sounds nice. Yes, please. Go ahead and schedule them. But… could you… could you explain everything again before each test? Just so I know what to expect? And… maybe someone could come with me? I get a little nervous on my own. Thank you, Doctor Gorga. You’re very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I just… I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Kelder. I will personally explain each test in detail before we do it, and I encourage you to bring someone with you for support. That’s perfectly fine, and I recommend it. I'll have my nurse schedule the blood work and stool test for early next week, and we can get the CT scan scheduled shortly after that. I’ll also make sure to write down clear instructions for each test, and my nurse will give you a number to call if you have any questions. Now, while we wait for the test results, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable in the meantime?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don’t know… I suppose not much. Maybe… a little something for the nausea? It just makes me feel so weak. And… maybe just a little reassurance that everything will be alright? I know you can’t promise anything, but… it would be nice to hear. I just feel so tired all the time. Thank you, Doctor. You’re a good man.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kelder. I can certainly prescribe you something for the nausea. I’ll write you a prescription for Metoclopramide. It should help with the feeling of sickness and allow you to eat a little more comfortably. And you're right to feel tired, these symptoms are draining. As for reassurance… I can’t promise anything, but I promise I’ll do everything I can to get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. We'll take things one step at a time, and we'll face this together. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. You’ve made me feel… a little bit better, just talking to you. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I should be going now. I have a bit of a walk home. Thank you again, Doctor Gorga. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Kelder. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My nurse will be in touch to schedule those tests. Take care, and walk carefully. .
