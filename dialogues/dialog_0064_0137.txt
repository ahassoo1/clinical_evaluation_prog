DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindra. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need me to come here, to make sure I am okay. For the… senior living.
DOCTOR: Ah, yes, a pre-admission assessment for the senior living facility. That’s perfectly alright. We just need to get a good picture of your overall health. So, let’s start with that. Can you tell me a little bit about why you're thinking of moving into a senior living community now?
PATIENT: Hmm. My husband… he is not so good anymore. I take care of him, but… is hard. The place… they help with that. And I… I want to meet people. Not just him all the time. Is good to talk, you know? He… he sleeps a lot now.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lindra. It sounds like you've been a wonderful caregiver for quite some time, and it's perfectly natural to want some support and companionship. It's good you’re thinking about this. So, to get a better understanding of things, let's talk a bit about your own health. Have you been feeling well generally?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. My knees… they bother me sometimes. And I get tired easy, but… who doesn't at my age? I walk a little, but not much. Mostly inside the house. The sun… is too hot now. I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain and some fatigue. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned walking mostly indoors. Do the knees bother you more with certain activities, or is it pretty constant?
PATIENT: Hmm… when I go up the stairs, is bad. And if I stand for long time, like when I am cooking. Sitting is better. But… the cooking is for my husband, so I do it anyway. He likes my food.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you. It sounds like you’re very dedicated. Alright, let's talk a little bit more about this fatigue. Has it been getting worse lately, or has it been fairly consistent?
PATIENT: I think… a little worse. Maybe because of the hot weather. Is hard to sleep when is so warm. And when I don't sleep good, I am more tired. He… my husband… he snores very loud. Is hard to sleep with the noise.
DOCTOR: I see. So the heat and difficulty sleeping seem to be playing a role. Let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: No, I eat okay. Not so much as before, but… I still like to cook, so I eat. My husband… he doesn't eat much anymore. I try to make him special things, but… he just picks at it. Is sad. I worry about him.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried about him. It’s hard to see a loved one’s appetite decrease. Now, focusing on you for a moment, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe a little. My clothes feel… looser, maybe? I don't weigh myself. Never really did. My mother… she always said I was too skinny.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, perhaps. We can check your weight here today, if you’d like. Now, have you been having any problems with your digestion – any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, no problems with that. Everything… goes okay. I take some… what you call… pills, for my stomach. But just sometimes. When I eat something bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And can you tell me what other medications you're currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have pills for my pressure. The doctor gave them to me a long time ago. And… the stomach pills, like I said. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they are really bad. But not every day. I forget the names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright. We can look up your medications in the system, if you don't mind. Do you happen to remember the name of the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Hmm… the one on Main Street. Near the… the bakery. Is a big one. I go there every month. Maria… the lady who helps me… she is very nice. She knows my name.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see your record here. Let me just pull up a list of your current medications… Alright, it looks like you’re taking Lisinopril for blood pressure, and you occasionally use Omeprazole for heartburn. And I see a prescription for Ibuprofen for your knees, though it hasn't been refilled in a few months. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! That is right. Lisinopril… for the pressure. And… Ibuprofen, yes. I ran out. And the other one… Omeprazole… is for my stomach. You are very good, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good to confirm everything. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. I like… mangoes. And my husband… he likes bananas. But he can't eat them now, because of his… problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… the doctor said my pressure was high, a long time ago. That is why I take the pills. And… my knees, like I said. The doctor said is arthritis. But… is just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hypertension and arthritis. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I have been lucky, I think. Just… the usual things. Colds, the flu. Nothing bad.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had pressure too. And… my brother, he had something with his heart, a long time ago. But… he smoked a lot. I never smoked.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And finally, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't like alcohol. Makes me sick. And… no tobacco. My husband… he used to smoke, but he stopped a long time ago. For my health, he said.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm… I just want to be sure I am strong enough to live there. I don't want to be a bother to anyone. I want to meet people, and… enjoy my life a little. My husband… he is happy if I am happy.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Lindra. That's a very reasonable goal, and we'll do our best to assess your health and make sure you're comfortable and safe. We’ll start with a quick physical exam - just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in and out, please. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur, but not concerning given your age. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 145/88. A little elevated, but consistent with your history of hypertension. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Alright, that's all for the quick exam. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but we'll need to review some lab work to get a better picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Okay, that is good. Lab work… is that just blood? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a blood sample, I’m afraid. But it’s a quick procedure, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll check your basic metabolic panel, complete blood count, and thyroid function. It will help us rule out any underlying issues and ensure you're healthy enough for the senior living facility. Would you prefer to do it today, or would you like to schedule an appointment for another day?
PATIENT: Today is better, I think. I don't like to wait. Just… be quick, please. And… tell me if it will hurt.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lindra. I'll let the phlebotomist know you're a little anxious, and they'll be extra gentle. It’s a quick pinch, and it’s over before you know it. Let me just call them now to let them know you're ready. One moment, please. Okay, they're ready for you now. I'll have them come in and explain the procedure. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I think I am okay. Just… be close by, maybe? I get nervous easy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. I'll be right here with you the whole time. I won't leave your side. Just focus on your breathing, and it will be over before you know it. Here they are now. This is Maria, our phlebotomist. She’s very skilled and gentle. Maria, this is Lindra, and she’s a little anxious about the blood draw. Could you please explain the procedure to her?
