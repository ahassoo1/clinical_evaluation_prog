DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather peculiar sensation in my back. It’s…difficult to describe. It feels like something “pops” or “clicks” whenever I move a certain way. It doesn’t necessarily hurt, but it’s definitely noticeable and a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back for a few weeks now, mostly noticeable with movement, and not particularly painful. That is unsettling, I can understand why you’d want to get it checked out. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to be most prominent when I’m twisting my torso—like, reaching for something across the car, or bending to pick something up. It's not constant, thankfully. Some days it happens more frequently than others. I work as an electrical installer, mainly on transportation equipment, so I'm often bending, reaching, and lifting things. I suppose that could be contributing. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…a feeling of something shifting. And it happens in my lower back, mostly on the right side, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back, primarily right side, with twisting and bending movements being the most common triggers. It's more of a shifting sensation than sharp pain, and it fluctuates – some days are worse than others. And you’re an electrical installer, so your job involves a lot of physical activity—bending, reaching, lifting. That’s all helpful information. Do you recall anything specific that might have started this?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Honestly, no, not really. It didn’t come on suddenly after a particular incident, as far as I can remember. It was very gradual. I just…noticed it one day, and it's been slowly getting more apparent since then. I might have strained something at work a month or so ago—lifting a rather heavy panel—but it didn’t feel like anything serious at the time. I just thought my muscles were a little sore, and it went away pretty quickly. This popping sensation didn’t start until after that, though, so I’m not sure if they’re related.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, no specific injury that you recall. You did mention a heavy lift about a month ago with some muscle soreness, but the popping sensation developed after that. That’s good to note. Now, outside of your back, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. No pain radiating down my legs, no numbness or tingling, no weakness. My legs feel perfectly normal. No fever, no chills, no changes in my bowel or bladder function…nothing like that. It truly is just this popping sensation in my back. It doesn't interfere with my sleep or anything, thankfully, but it is a bit of a worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No radiating pain, no neurological symptoms – no numbness, tingling, or weakness. No fever or changes in bowel/bladder function. So it really is isolated to this popping sensation in your back, and it’s not interfering with sleep. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I've been fairly healthy my entire life, thankfully. I have private insurance and see a general practitioner for yearly checkups, but I’ve never had any significant illnesses or injuries requiring extensive treatment. No arthritis, no scoliosis, no previous back problems, nothing like that. My wife is always telling me to be more careful, but I generally feel quite robust! I take a daily multivitamin, and that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No pre-existing medical conditions, see a general practitioner yearly, generally healthy, just a daily multivitamin. That's good to know. And no previous back problems or surgeries?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. No back surgeries, no significant back injuries in the past, nothing that required physical therapy or anything of that nature. I did pull a muscle in my shoulder a few years ago while helping a friend move, but it resolved with rest and ice. This is entirely different, though – it's not painful, just…this disconcerting popping sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior back surgeries or injuries requiring therapy. Just a shoulder strain a few years ago that resolved with conservative treatment. Let’s briefly touch on family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – with back problems, arthritis, or any other musculoskeletal issues?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had some arthritis in her knees in her later years, but nothing major. She managed it with medication and lifestyle changes. My father was very physically active his whole life, and I don’t recall him ever having any significant back problems. My siblings are both healthy as well, as far as I know—no reported back issues or anything similar. It doesn’t seem to be a particularly prevalent condition in my family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some arthritis in your mother's knees, but no significant history of back problems in the family. That’s helpful to know. Just a couple more questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't smoke. Never have. And I rarely drink alcohol—maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible, even with the demands of my work. My wife keeps me in line, you see! We eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, and I try to get regular exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. Excellent. Okay, Jamill, that gives me a good overall picture. It sounds like you’re generally healthy with no significant medical history, and this back popping sensation developed gradually without a clear injury. I’d like to do a quick physical exam now to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed when you're ready. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don’t mind, please lie down on your stomach for me. I’ll start by palpating your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'll also assess your range of motion and perform some simple neurological tests. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay, tell me if you feel any pain with this… I’m just checking for tenderness here. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: Okay. That's…not painful, exactly. Just a little bit of pressure, like you're pressing on a muscle. It’s not sharp or anything, more like…awareness of the area. No sudden discomfort, just that sensation of pressure. I can feel the clicking a little bit when I twist slightly, but it’s faint. I’m trying to relax, but it’s hard to completely switch off when someone is examining me!
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know – just a little bit of pressure, awareness of the area, and the clicking sensation with twisting. No sharp pain. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to press a little bit deeper on the right side here. Let me know if that changes anything. Does that feel any different?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, that feels…a little bit different. Not painful, but there’s definitely more resistance there. It feels like…a slight tightening of the muscle, almost like it’s a bit tense. I don’t normally notice it until you press on it, though. It's not excruciating or anything, just…different. Is that what you expected?
DOCTOR: Okay, so more resistance on the right side, a feeling of tightening, that’s good information. Yes, that’s what I was looking for - a potential area of muscle tension. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. I want you to gently bend forward, as far as is comfortable, and then slowly straighten back up. And how does that feel?
PATIENT: Okay, that feels…okay. It’s a little stiff, especially at the beginning of the movement. I can touch my toes, but it’s not as easy as it used to be. There’s a slight ache in my lower back when I bend forward, but it’s not sharp or debilitating. And I can straighten back up without any significant difficulty. It just feels…a little creaky, I suppose. I’m trying to be mindful of the popping sensation, but I don't feel it with this movement.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little stiffness, a slight ache, but you can touch your toes and straighten back up. No pain with that movement, and you didn't feel the popping sensation. Now, can you gently twist to your left, as far as is comfortable, and then slowly twist to your right?
PATIENT: Okay. Twisting to the left feels…fine. But twisting to the right is where I feel that clicking sensation. It's not painful, but it’s definitely noticeable. And there's a bit of resistance there as well. It feels like something is catching slightly. It’s the same sensation I described earlier, just more pronounced with the twisting motion. I’m trying to be as precise as possible, so you get a clear understanding. It feels like it's coming from the right side of my lower back.
DOCTOR: Okay, clicking sensation on the right with twisting, more pronounced than with the other movements. Resistance and a feeling of something “catching.” You’re being very precise, and that’s very helpful. Now, I'm going to perform a few simple neurological tests. I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your sensation in your legs. Can you tell me if you feel light touch in these areas?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Yes, I can feel that light touch. And that as well…and there. Everything feels normal on both legs, as far as I can tell. There's no numbness, tingling, or weakness. Just a normal sensation of touch. I’m trying to stay as still as possible so you can get an accurate reading. Is there anything else you need me to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is intact bilaterally, which is good. No reports of numbness or tingling. Okay, Jamill, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it appears you have some muscle tension in your right lower back. Your neurological exam is normal, which is reassuring. The clicking sensation is likely related to the muscle tension or possibly a minor facet joint issue, but it's difficult to say for sure without imaging. Given your history and exam findings, I don’t believe this is anything serious, but it’s important to address the discomfort and prevent it from worsening. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that explanation makes sense. It’s reassuring to hear it’s likely not a serious issue. So, what are my options for addressing the muscle tension? What would you recommend as a next step? I’m happy to consider whatever you think is best, as long as it’s not too invasive. I'm rather busy with work, so something that doesn't require a long recovery period would be ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Given your busy schedule and preference for less invasive options, I think we can start with a conservative approach. I recommend the following: 1. Over-the-counter pain relievers: Ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and muscle pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. 2. Heat or ice: Apply heat or ice to your lower back for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Experiment to see which one feels better for you. 3. Gentle stretching and strengthening exercises: I can provide you with a handout with some simple exercises to help stretch and strengthen your back muscles. It’s important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity. 4. Proper lifting technique: Be mindful of your posture and lifting technique when working. Bend your knees, keep your back straight, and avoid twisting. 5. Consider a physical therapy consultation: If your symptoms don't improve after a couple of weeks with these measures, I recommend a consultation with a physical therapist. They can provide you with more specific exercises and guidance. I don’t think imaging, such as an X-ray or MRI, is necessary at this time, unless your symptoms worsen or you develop new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or weakness. What are your thoughts on this plan?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to try those measures. The heat or ice, stretching, and being mindful of my lifting technique seem very manageable, and I can definitely incorporate those into my daily routine. A physical therapy consultation would be fine if needed, but let’s see if we can resolve it with these steps first. Could you please provide me with that handout with the stretching and strengthening exercises? And perhaps a brief reminder of the proper lifting technique? I want to make sure I’m doing everything correctly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. This handout details some simple stretches and strengthening exercises you can do at home. It's important to start slowly and listen to your body. Don't push yourself too hard, especially at first. As for proper lifting technique: 1. Plan your lift: Before you lift anything, make sure you have a clear path and a stable base. 2. Keep your back straight: Avoid bending at the waist. Bend your knees and keep your back straight. 3. Keep the load close to your body: Hold the object close to your chest. 4. Use your legs: Lift with your legs, not your back. 5. Avoid twisting: Keep your body facing the direction of the lift. Do you have any questions about the exercises or proper lifting technique?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's all very clear. The handout is excellent, and the explanation of the lifting technique is helpful. I think I can manage this quite well. So, to summarize: try the over-the-counter pain relievers, heat or ice, exercises, and proper lifting technique. Monitor my symptoms, and if they don’t improve or worsen, consider a physical therapy consultation. Is that correct? And there's no need for imaging at this stage unless new symptoms develop. I think I’m all set. Thank you for your time and thorough explanation, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: That's absolutely correct, Jamill. You've got it. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I'll make a note in your chart of our discussion and plan. I'll see you back in a few weeks if needed. Have a good day, and take care of your back!
PATIENT: .
