DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Bilstein. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, Doctor… Ruocco, is it? Yes. It’s my legs, dear. They just… ache something awful at night. Especially. It wakes me up, you see. It’s been going on…oh, a good while now. I can't rightly say how long, but a good while.
DOCTOR: A good while. Right. And… is this ache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not constant, no. It comes and goes. Mostly at night, like I said. During the day I don't notice it too much. Though… sometimes, if I've been standing a long time, I feel a little…tightness. But nothing like the nighttime pain. It’s a cramping, more than a pain, I suppose. Though it feels like pain when it happens. Do you follow? It’s hard to explain sometimes, getting old you know. My thoughts… they wander.
DOCTOR: Wandering thoughts. Yes, I understand. So, cramping, mostly at night. And tightness with prolonged standing. Any recent injuries?
PATIENT: Oh, bless you for understanding. No, no injuries. Not that I recall. I haven’t… tripped or fallen or anything like that. I used to walk a lot, but… well, it’s been some time since I walked anywhere much. My husband… he did all the walking when we were married. He’s… passed on now. A long time ago. Is that… important? I get confused about what matters sometimes.
DOCTOR: Past medical history… right. We’ll get to that. Let’s focus on the legs for now. Is it in both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Both legs, mostly. Though… sometimes it feels worse in the left one. It’s hard to say for certain, honestly. They both… bother me. Like a restless feeling, almost. Like they need stretching, but stretching doesn't seem to help much. And it’s not all the time, you understand. Some nights I sleep right through. It's very peculiar.
DOCTOR: Peculiar. Right. Any swelling in the legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Oh. Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. My feet… they do feel a little… wide sometimes, if I’ve been sitting for a long time. But I never thought about swelling, per se. No, I don’t think they swell. Though I suppose I haven’t looked at them very closely lately. Everything’s… a bit of a blur these days. Is swelling something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant swelling noted by the patient. Any numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no numbness. No tingling. Just… the ache. And the restlessness. It’s like… little bugs crawling under my skin sometimes, in my legs. Not actual bugs, of course! Just a…feeling. A very bothersome feeling. It makes me want to… move them around. I do a lot of wiggling, I’m afraid. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Wiggling. Right. And you said this happens mostly at night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly at night. After I’ve been lying down for a while. It doesn’t happen every night, mind you. But when it does happen… it wakes me up. I have to get up and…well, wiggle. Or just walk around a bit. It usually eases it a little, but then it comes back later. It's quite exhausting, really. I haven't been sleeping well.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. Just want to check your reflexes and circulation. Can you point your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, dear. I’ll try. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you know. Is that… alright? It feels a little stiff. I haven’t been using them much. There we are. Is that what you needed?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, as expected. Circulation feels… adequate. Capillary refill is slightly delayed, but not concerning. Alright. It sounds like this could be… restless legs syndrome. It’s common, especially with age. We can try some simple things. Try warm baths before bed, and ensure you're getting enough iron in your diet. Do you take any vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Restless legs syndrome? I've never heard of such a thing. It has a name, does it? Warm baths… yes, I used to do that. It felt nice. Iron…? Oh, dear. I don't know about iron. I don't think I take any vitamins, no. I eat… well, I eat what my daughter brings me. She’s very good to me. She makes sure I have enough… food. Do I need to be taking vitamins, Doctor? Is that important? I’m not very good at keeping track of these things, you see. My mind…it just doesn’t hold on to these details anymore.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Bilstein, it's probably nothing serious. But it’s always best to be sure. I'm going to order some blood work—just a routine check. It'll tell us if you're low on any vitamins, including iron. And I recommend speaking with your daughter about a more…consistent diet. It’s important to get enough nutrients. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work…? Well… if you think it’s best, Doctor. I don’t mind a little blood work. It’s just… needles, you know. They never did agree with me. But I trust your judgment. And yes, I’ll talk to my daughter. She always worries about me. A more consistent diet… yes, that sounds sensible. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… fuss. Is it going to be very expensive, Doctor? I’m afraid I don't have much… money.
DOCTOR: The blood work… it's standard testing. I'll have the lab check for any financial assistance programs available. Don't worry about that now. I'll send the order to the lab, and they will contact you. I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks so we can review the results. Here you are. If anything worsens before then—significant pain, swelling, or numbness—go to the emergency room immediately. Understood?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. To check about the money, I mean. Thank you. Two weeks… yes, I can manage that. I’ll ask my daughter to help me schedule it. And… emergencies? Yes, I’ll remember that. Significant pain… swelling… numbness. Right. I suppose that’s all then? I…I appreciate your help, Doctor. It's nice to know someone is… looking into it. I do get so… forgetful these days.
