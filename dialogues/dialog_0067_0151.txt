DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. My name is Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? I’m hoping you can figure out what’s going on. I don’t want it to get worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Tingling in the hands and feet can certainly be bothersome. “A little while now” – could you tell me approximately how long it’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe… three, four months now? It started off just now and then, a little prickle. But it’s been happening more often lately, and it lasts longer each time. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I’m a busy woman, delivering mail and all.
DOCTOR: I see. Three to four months, gradually getting worse. Delivering mail is quite a physical job! Okay. And is it both hands and both feet, or is it more focused on one side?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both hands and both feet. It’s not always at the same time, but… yeah, both. Sometimes my feet feel it more, sometimes my hands. It’s… unpredictable, I guess you could say. It doesn’t feel like pins and needles exactly, more like… a buzzing? A sort of… numbness, but not completely numb. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – a buzzing, or numbness that isn't complete. That helps me narrow things down. And is this tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. It’s not always there. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on my route for hours. And sometimes it’s worse in the mornings, before I get moving. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it happens, to be honest. It just… shows up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be related to activity, or perhaps inactivity, and worse at the extremes of the day. Have you noticed anything that specifically triggers it, like certain movements or positions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. You know, now that you mention it… bending over to pick up packages seems to make it worse. And if I’m standing for a long time, without moving, it gets bad too. But other than that… not really. It just… happens. It’s frustrating!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Okay, so bending or prolonged standing can exacerbate it. Have you experienced any weakness in your hands or feet along with the tingling?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I mean, I get tired, of course. Delivering mail is hard work! But I haven’t dropped anything or had trouble holding things, or anything like that. My grip feels okay. My legs get tired at the end of the day, but that’s just from walking so much, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. No noticeable weakness, just fatigue. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tingling – things like pain, changes in your skin color, or any problems with balance?
PATIENT: No pain, thankfully. And my skin looks the same as always, I think. Balance… no, I haven't had any trouble with that. I'm pretty steady on my feet, even with all the walking. Oh! Wait… sometimes my feet feel a little cold, even when it’s warm. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good information, Teretha. Cold feet can be relevant. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Ask away. No, Doctor, I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes. My mother had it, so I get checked every year, just to be safe. But everything’s always been normal.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s helpful to know. Any history of thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, no thyroid problems. I had my thyroid checked a few years ago when I was feeling tired all the time, but the doctor said it was fine. Just needed more sleep, he said!
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or major illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out when I was in my 40s, but that was a long time ago. And I had the flu pretty bad a few years back, but that’s about it. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal and a bout of the flu. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. And I haven't had any bad reactions to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms, like tingling in their hands and feet?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had some problems with his legs, later in life. He always complained about numbness and tingling. I don’t know exactly what it was, but it sounds a bit like what I’m having. He ended up using a cane, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, you can figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Teretha, squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Good. Now, push your feet against my hands like you're pressing on a gas pedal. Your strength seems good, a little fatigue expected with your job. Now, let’s check your sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton swab. Tell me when you can feel it. Okay… and how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that one. And that one… yes. Hmm… this part feels a little… different. Not as strong, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It’s not numb, exactly, but it doesn’t feel as sharp as the others. Like… a duller feeling?
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that as well – slightly decreased sensation on the top of your left foot. Your reflexes are normal, but as you said, there is some diminished sensation and you report tingling. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing peripheral neuropathy – that's nerve damage in your hands and feet. It can have many causes, including vitamin deficiencies, diabetes , and certain medications. The family history is also relevant. To get a better idea of what's causing this, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels , your blood sugar, and assess your kidney function. I’d also like to check your thyroid levels just to be thorough. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… nerve damage? That doesn’t sound good. Blood tests… yes, that’s fine. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s causing this tingling. And to make sure it doesn’t get worse. So, yes, blood tests are fine. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Teretha. It can sound frightening, but it’s good we’re looking into it. Often, peripheral neuropathy can be managed with lifestyle changes or medication. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that seem to worsen the tingling, and wear comfortable shoes with good support. Would you like a referral to a podiatrist or neurologist?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know it can be managed. 3-5 days… okay, I can wait. I’ll definitely try to take it easier and wear better shoes. A podiatrist or neurologist… hmm. I don’t know. I think… let’s wait on the blood test results first. If you think I need to see one of them after that, then yes. But let’s see what the tests say first, okay? I don't want to jump to conclusions.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Teretha. We'll wait for the blood test results and discuss the next steps then. I'll write an order for the tests now, and the nurse will give you the paperwork with instructions on where to go. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening to me and taking the time to figure out what’s going on. I’m still a little worried, but I feel better knowing we’re doing something about it. I guess… I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I understand your worry, and I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. The nurse will be in shortly with the lab paperwork. Have a good day, and try not to stress too much.
