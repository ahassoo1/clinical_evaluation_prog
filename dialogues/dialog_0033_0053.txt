DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I'm Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time. It's been going on for maybe a week now.
DOCTOR: Difficult to start… and prolonged emptying, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Prolonged emptying, that's a good way to put it. It feels like it takes forever, and I have to… push a little. Not a lot, but some. It’s not painful, just… frustrating. And I feel like I don't empty completely sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. And has there been any change in your bowel habits otherwise?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Hmm. Let me think... No, not really. Everything is pretty normal there, if you know what I mean. Regular as clockwork, always has been. It’s just the… other thing. The waterworks, I suppose. Is that what you're asking about? I don’t want to be rude, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Just clarifying. So, no changes in stool consistency, frequency… nothing like constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, no changes there at all. Solid, regular... everything as it should be. Honestly, if it wasn't for that problem, I wouldn’t even be here. It's just… inconvenient, and I worry about things, you know? Getting older, things wearing out… I don't want it to be something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain during urination?
PATIENT: No blood, no. And no pain while going, just… the effort, you know? It’s not sharp pain, not like a bladder infection or anything. It's more like… straining. Like I have to work to get it started and finished. And even then, I'm not always sure I'm completely empty. I do drink a lot of tea, maybe that has something to do with it? I've always been a tea drinker.
DOCTOR: Tea… alright. And do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I think I had one when I was quite young, maybe in my twenties. A long time ago. It was treated with pills, and I haven’t had one since, not that I recall. I have a very good memory, you see, but that was a long time ago. I’ve had the usual aches and pains of getting older, but nothing like that since. My mother had some problems with her kidneys, but I don't think this is related.
DOCTOR: Any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, it’s not too bad, just a bit stiff in the mornings. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. Losartan, I think it’s called. Other than that… no, not really. I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I walk every day, and I try to eat a good diet. Mostly Lithuanian food, of course! We eat a lot of potatoes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the Losartan for my blood pressure, and a little Vitamin D in the winter, because we don’t get much sun here. Oh! And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis when it’s really bothering me – ibuprofen, I think it is. Just when it’s bad, not every day. Nothing else, Doctor. I don’t like taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll start with your abdomen and then do a quick neurological check, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’m a bit worried, but I’m glad I came in. It's good to get things checked out. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't hurt. A little pressure, but not pain. Just a normal feeling of being poked, you know? Like when they check your tires. It's a little cold, though. This table is chilly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. And a quick assessment of sensation. Can you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. And that feels… normal. Like a little poke. My reflexes aren't what they used to be, mind you. I'm getting old! But I can feel it. Everything feels… pretty much the same, Doctor. Just a little bit of cold. Is everything alright? You're making a bit of a face.
DOCTOR: Your exam is… unremarkable. However, given your age and symptoms, I’m going to order a urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test to check how much urine remains in your bladder after you empty it. We need to rule out any underlying issues.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. That sounds… serious. What exactly does that mean? Is it something bad? I don't want to have anything… awful. A post-void residual… what does that tell you? Is it likely to be something I need pills for?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious. It just helps us determine if your bladder is emptying completely. The test involves a simple urine sample and a quick ultrasound. We'll also check for any signs of infection. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but it's standard procedure. And no, it doesn’t automatically mean you'll need medication. We’ll see what the results show. The nurse will come in shortly to collect a sample.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That makes me feel a bit better. A simple test… good. And the nurse will help me with it? That’s good, too. I’m not very good at… things like that anymore. I’m glad you’re being thorough, Doctor. So, if it is an infection, is it easily treated? I really don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Most UTIs are easily treated with a course of antibiotics. We'll know more once we have the results. For now, I recommend increasing your fluid intake, particularly water, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in a week. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just water, and no tea, huh? That’s going to be hard. But I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And thank you to the nurse, too, when she comes in. I’m a bit nervous, but I feel better knowing we’re getting things checked out. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Yadao. .
