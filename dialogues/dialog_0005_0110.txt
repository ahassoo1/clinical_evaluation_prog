DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McNabb. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you. Well, to put it plainly, I feel… a bit worn down. Like an old engine that needs a tune-up, you know? I’m hoping for a little “reset,” a bit of a jumpstart to get my health back on track. I’m 87 years young, and I’ve lived a good life, but lately things just haven’t felt… quite right.
DOCTOR: "A bit worn down," alright. I understand. Eighty-seven is a good age, indeed. A "tune-up" is a good way to put it. Can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "not quite right"?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Where to begin? It’s not one big thing, you see. Just… little things adding up. I tire more easily than I used to, even with my usual little walks. And I don't have the same energy for my garden – it’s my pride and joy, you know! It’s harder to keep up with it now. And… sometimes my memory isn’t as sharp as it once was, though I wouldn't say it’s bad bad, just… slower. Does that make sense? I don't want to be a bother listing every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: No, no, that makes perfect sense. It is helpful to hear all of it, even the "little things." We’ll get to the bottom of it. So, let’s focus on the fatigue and the memory. How long have you been feeling this tired?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s crept up on me, really. I’d say… maybe the last six months or so? It wasn’t sudden. I used to be able to do my walks every morning without a second thought. Now, I find myself needing to rest halfway through sometimes. And it’s not just the walking. Even reading, or sitting with friends, I feel… drained quicker than I used to. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest. I like to keep busy!
DOCTOR: Right, so gradually worsening fatigue over the past six months. And it's impacting your daily activities. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I’ve been a little less hungry than usual. Not that I’m not eating, just… not as much of an appetite, you know? And sometimes… just a general feeling of being a little bit “off,” if that makes sense. Not sick, exactly, but not quite myself. It's hard to describe. My daughter keeps telling me I’m just getting old, but… I feel like it’s more than that. Does that help? I hope I'm not rambling.
DOCTOR: No, you're not rambling at all, Ms. McNabb. It’s good you're telling me all of this. Loss of appetite and feeling “off”… Okay. Have you had any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, I suppose I have. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. I haven’t actually weighed myself, but my daughter, Leilani, commented on it just last week. She said I was looking… slimmer. She meant well, of course, but it did make me think. I haven't been actively trying to lose weight, that's for certain. I enjoy my food too much!
DOCTOR: Alright. Unintentional weight loss… that is something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, years ago, when I was in my sixties, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure. High blood pressure, the doctor said. But they put me on medication, and it was controlled for a long time. I haven't had any issues with it for… oh, I suppose 20 years or so. And I had a mild case of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I've been quite healthy, all things considered. I always said a good garden and a happy heart kept me going.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in the past, treated successfully. Pneumonia, recovered fully. Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, really. A long time ago, when my youngest son was just a little boy, I had my gallbladder removed. It was causing me some trouble, but the surgery went well, and I haven't had any issues with it since. That was… goodness, almost 40 years ago now. A different lifetime, it feels like.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal decades ago. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother lived to be 95, a strong woman she was. She didn't have any major health problems, just the usual aches and pains of getting older. My father passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I believe. And my brother, he had diabetes, but he took care of himself as best he could. As for my children… they're all healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses in that bunch, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of longevity, some heart trouble and diabetes. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just one. A small dose of medication for my arthritis. It helps with the aches and pains in my hands and knees. Nothing fancy, just something the doctor prescribed a few years back. And… sometimes I take a little over-the-counter pain reliever if it’s particularly bad, but not regularly. Here, let me show you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard. Never had any trouble with allergies, food or otherwise. My mother always said I had a cast iron stomach, and I think she was right. I've eaten just about everything under the sun, and never had a reaction. I don’t go looking for trouble, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McNabb. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, that sort of thing. Just a routine check, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm not a stranger to doctors, though I haven’t had to visit one much lately. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just loosen your clothing a bit, that would be helpful. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. I’m hearing a slightly diminished breath sound on the lower right lobe… and a very faint murmur… Now, let’s check your blood pressure… 140 over 85… a little elevated. Alright, let’s check your pulse… A little weak and regular… Now, could you please extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I do feel a bit weaker than I used to, you’re right about that. Not terribly, but… noticeable. I still manage my garden, but it takes me longer. My hands ache a little sometimes, especially in the mornings. Is that what you’re looking at?
DOCTOR: Yes, your reflexes are a bit diminished, and there's some tenderness in your hands. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen… … Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain there, Doctor. Just… a bit of a gurgle, I think? My stomach does make noises sometimes, especially after I eat. Nothing unusual, I wouldn’t think. I eat a good amount of fiber, you know, trying to stay regular. Old age has its… quirks, I suppose. Are you finding anything concerning? I don't want to worry my daughter unnecessarily. She worries enough as it is.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. McNabb. It’s good you're thinking of your daughter. I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds, and the abdomen is soft… but I do feel a slight fullness in the lower abdomen. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam, I suspect we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. This will help us rule out any serious underlying conditions and figure out what’s causing your fatigue, weight loss, and other symptoms. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds a bit… serious, doesn’t it? I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor, I really do. But… what are you looking for, specifically? Is it something I should be very worried about? My daughter, Leilani, always says I worry too much, but… it's hard not to, when you hear about things. I trust your judgment, of course, but… could you explain a little more about why you want to do these tests? Perhaps it’s nothing, and I’m just an old woman making a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. McNabb. It's perfectly normal to feel worried when you hear about tests, especially something like a CT scan. It sounds serious because it's a comprehensive look, but that doesn't necessarily mean is serious. It's simply the best way to get all the information we need. To be frank, based on your symptoms—fatigue, weight loss, loss of appetite, and the slight fullness I felt during the exam—I want to rule out a few possibilities. These tests will help us assess if there might be any issues with your organs—liver, kidneys, pancreas, intestines—or any signs of infection or, less likely, something more concerning. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health and rule out things like anemia or infection. The CT scan will give us detailed images of your abdomen, allowing us to look for any abnormalities. It's important to remember that these are precautionary tests. We are gathering information, and a large number of things could be causing your symptoms. I am not saying there is anything wrong, but I want to be thorough to ensure we provide the best possible care. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does make a bit more sense. Precautionary… that’s a good word. It’s good to know you're being thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s a little frightening, of course, but I suppose it's better to know, one way or another. And you said it could be… a number of things? Not necessarily anything serious? Alright. If that’s what you think is best, then let’s do the tests. When can I schedule them? And… will they be very uncomfortable? I don’t have a strong stomach for medical things, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Exactly, Ms. McNabb. It could be a number of things—a minor infection, a dietary issue, or even just the effects of aging. It’s far more likely to be something relatively straightforward than anything serious. As for discomfort, the blood tests are routine—a quick pinprick, and a little discomfort afterwards. The CT scan is painless—you’ll lie on a table, and the machine will take images. You might be asked to drink a contrast dye, which can have a slightly metallic taste, but it’s generally well-tolerated. You may need a ride home after the CT scan as the dye sometimes causes temporary grogginess. The radiology department will explain everything in detail before the procedure. I’ll have my nurse schedule the tests for you right away. She’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better, Doctor. Thank you. A little grogginess is manageable. I’m glad it’s not painful. And yes, please have your nurse schedule it as soon as possible. The sooner we know, the sooner I can stop worrying! Thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I really appreciate your kindness, Doctor. You have a very reassuring manner, you know. It makes all the difference. Alright. I’ll leave it in your capable hands, then. Just let me know if there's anything else I need to do. And please, thank your nurse for me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. I’m glad I could ease your worries a bit. My nurse, Sarah, is excellent. She'll get you scheduled right away and answer any further questions you may have. She will also go over what you should do after the test. We'll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try not to stress too much. It's far more likely to be something minor. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough and kind, and I appreciate it very much. I’m still a little anxious, of course, but I feel much better knowing you’re on top of things. And… thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. It means a lot. I’ll let your nurse, Sarah, know to expect me. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McNabb. And you have a good day as well. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll take good care of you. .
