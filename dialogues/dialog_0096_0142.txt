DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's, well, it's my head. Been getting these really bad headaches. And I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart races, feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest. It's... not fun. I don’t really know why it's happening, to be honest. They just… start.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Headaches, you say, with sweating and a racing heart. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s a good question. Not super long, I don’t think? Maybe... a few months? It’s kinda hard to keep track, honestly. They don't happen every day, thankfully. More like... every few weeks, maybe? Sometimes longer between them. I wish I could be more specific. It's just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months, intermittent. And when they do happen, how would you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not like a normal headache, you know? Like, not just a dull ache. It's… throbbing, mostly. Really bad throbbing. And it feels like it’s all over my head, not just in one spot. Sometimes it's on one side, sometimes the other, but mostly just… everywhere. It makes it hard to think, too. Everything gets kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, all over, makes it hard to concentrate. Any nausea or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: Nausea… yeah, sometimes. Not always, but when the headache's really bad, I definitely feel sick to my stomach. I haven't actually thrown up, if that makes sense. Just… really queasy. It's usually before the headache gets worse, I think. Like, a warning sign.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea before the headache intensifies. Good to know. And does anything seem to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Not that I've noticed, really. I mean, I work in a warehouse, so it’s kinda noisy and busy all the time. Maybe stress? But I don't feel particularly stressed, you know? It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m tired, maybe? But even when I get a good night's sleep, they still pop up. I wish I knew what caused ‘em. It's kinda scary when they just hit you outta nowhere.
DOCTOR: A noisy work environment... Let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Not really, I don’t think. I mean, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I haven’t really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I just… try to tough things out, usually. My ex-wife was always the one who made appointments and stuff. This whole thing is a little new to me, being here on my own like this. And, uh, I got divorced a couple years back, so that was… something. But health-wise? Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses. And you said you broke your arm as a child, any surgeries related to that?
PATIENT: Nope. Just a cast, I think. Broke it pretty bad playin’ football with some friends. They just set it and put a cast on. It healed up fine. Nothing fancy. I don't remember much about it, honestly. I was pretty young. Is this stuff important? I’m sorry, I just… I'm not used to explaining all this. It's kinda overwhelming, rememberin’ everything.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Mr. Lawther. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who suffers from headaches, migraines, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Uhm… that's a tough one. I didn’t really talk about health stuff with my family much. My mom… she used to get headaches sometimes, but just regular ones, I think. Nothing like these. My dad… he had high blood pressure, I think? But I don’t know about any serious neurological stuff. And I don’t really talk to my sister anymore, so I have no idea what’s goin’ on with her. Sorry I can’t be more helpful. I'm not good at rememberin’ things like that. It's kinda embarrassing, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits…? Like… what do you mean? Do you mean… what do I do for fun? I… mostly just work. And, uh, I watch TV sometimes. I don't really go out much. I used to go to the pub with some friends, but not anymore. I’m divorced, remember? So, uh… not much of a social life these days, really. I don't drink much, never have. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. Is that what you’re askin’? Sorry, I'm just… I don't know what's relevant.
DOCTOR: I'm trying to determine potential lifestyle factors. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Uhh… not that I know of. I haven’t really taken much medicine in my life. Maybe some painkillers for a cold, but nothing serious. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I usually just try to sleep it off if I’m sick. Honestly, I'm not good with all these questions. Is it okay if we just… skip some of them? I'm starting to feel a little overwhelmed. I just want to know what’s wrong with my head.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological assessment. Can you lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… good. I mean, anything to figure out what’s going on. Physical exam sounds fine. Just let me… uh… just let me know what you need me to do. I'm not very good with medical stuff, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, Mr. Lawther. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Now, let’s check your pulse. 88 beats per minute, regular. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Whatever you need. 140 over 90… is that bad? I don't really know what those numbers mean. Reflexes… okay. I'm tryin’ to stay as still as I can. I just want this to be over so I can get some answers. I feel kinda… helpless, layin’ here. Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves. This involves checking your eye movements, facial sensation, and strength. Eye movements are intact, facial sensation is normal, and strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Well, physically, everything appears to be normal. But given your symptoms – the headaches, sweating, racing heart – and your elevated blood pressure, it could be a number of things. It's likely tension headaches, but given the accompanying symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Tension headaches…? But… what about the sweating and my heart racin’? And the blood pressure bein’ high? What other possibilities…? Is it serious? I'm kinda worried now. You said "rule out". What are you ruling out? Should I be scared? Is it somethin' bad? I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, calm yourself. I didn’t say it is anything serious. I’m simply being thorough. It could be a migraine, or even a cluster headache. But we need to rule out secondary causes, such as… well, let’s not get into all the possibilities. What’s important is we do some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart. And, frankly, given your blood pressure, I recommend a 24-hour blood pressure monitor. I'll also order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything structural. Don't panic. These are just precautionary measures.
PATIENT: A CT scan…? And… a bunch of other tests…? That sounds… serious. What are you lookin’ for? And… how much is all this gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, remember? I just wanted to know what was wrong with my head, not… not have all these tests done! Is it gonna hurt? I don't do well with hospitals… or… or tests. And what if it is somethin’ bad? I… I'm starting to feel really dizzy. Can I just… can I just have somethin’ for the headache now? I can't deal with all this right now. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand you’re anxious, but you need to let me do my job. I cannot simply prescribe you medication without knowing the cause of your symptoms. As for the cost, I’m not a billing office. You’ll need to speak with them about payment options. And a CT scan is painless. The only discomfort is lying still for a short period. It’s essential for ruling out serious conditions. Look, I’m recommending these tests for your own good. If you’d like a second opinion, you are free to seek one. But delaying diagnosis could be detrimental. Now, let me get the orders written up for you. We'll schedule these tests as soon as possible. .
