DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's not really a visit, visit, if you know what I mean. Just need some forms filled out, that’s all. Medicare sent me over.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Medicare often requires specific forms for various things. Are these forms related to a new benefit you’re applying for, or is this for something else?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think it’s just a yearly thing? They send them out and I gotta get ‘em signed by a doctor. I don’t really understand all the paperwork, to be honest. It just said to come in and have a doctor fill ‘em out. Something about still being eligible for coverage, maybe?
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like these are likely related to your continued eligibility for Medicare benefits – a standard check-up to confirm you still meet the requirements. We can absolutely get these forms completed for you. To do that accurately, I'll need to ask a few questions about your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Ask away. I don’t mind. Just… I’m not good with all the medical talk, so if you could keep it simple, I’d appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else that a doctor has told you about?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandma had diabetes, but I haven’t been told I do. I had high blood pressure for a little while a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise. Nothing else, really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it, I guess. Just the usual aches and pains from getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Family history of diabetes is important, thank you for mentioning that. And it's positive to hear your blood pressure has improved with lifestyle changes. We'll want to check that again today just to be sure. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Not even my tonsils! Always been pretty lucky, I guess. Or maybe just avoided needing it, ha.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No prior surgeries is certainly a good thing. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take ibuprofen for my back when it’s really bothering me. That’s about it. Nothing else regularly. And the ibuprofen is just… when I need it, not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Thank you for clarifying that it's only as needed for your back. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Oh, wait… bees. I’m not a fan of bees. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable – many people aren't fans of bees! We’re looking for allergic reactions, like hives, difficulty breathing, or swelling, not just dislikes. So, no medical allergies to report then. Now, let's briefly talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, besides your grandmother’s diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… my dad had heart problems later in life, and his mother… she had arthritis really bad. She couldn't hardly walk the last few years. That's about all I can think of, off the top of my head. My mom was pretty healthy, actually. Lived a long life.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart problems in your father and arthritis in your grandmother. That’s helpful information. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never have. My parents didn't smoke, and I just… never picked up the habit. Always seemed silly to me. I do enjoy a good cup of coffee though! Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, coffee doesn't count! That’s a good habit to have. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing heavy. Definitely not a regular thing. My husband likes his beer, but I’m not much of a beer drinker myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine. That’s good to know. And do you have any current occupation or hobbies that involve physical activity or exposure to any potential hazards?
PATIENT: Well, I’m a control and valve installer and repairer. So… yeah, I do a fair bit of physical work. Mostly outdoors, sometimes in rough places. Lifting, climbing, that sort of thing. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. And I help my husband with his garden sometimes, but that’s not too strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physically demanding job as a control and valve installer and repairer, that's good to know. It's helpful to understand the demands of your daily life. Now, to get a better overall picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… uncomfortable or something.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain everything as I go and stop if anything is uncomfortable. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 132/88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I will check your pulse. Pulse is 76. Finally, I'm going to quickly examine your throat, ears and eyes. Everything looks normal. No visible abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, I guess. Is the blood pressure something I should worry about? It's been a little high before, on and off.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re aware of it being occasionally elevated. 132/88 is mildly elevated, but given your physically demanding job and the stress that can sometimes accompany it, it's not entirely unexpected. We should monitor it more closely. Given your history of it being occasionally high, and the findings today, I'd like to order some basic bloodwork. This will help us rule out any underlying causes and get a better baseline. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If it’ll help figure things out, definitely. Bloodwork is fine. Where do I go for that?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab order. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics lab location – there’s one conveniently located at 123 Main Street, here in town. The order will be sent electronically to them, so you shouldn’t need to bring anything with you other than your insurance card and a valid ID. It’s a standard blood draw, so it shouldn't take too long. While we wait for the results, let’s address the forms you came in for. They are standard Medicare eligibility forms, and I'll complete them based on the information we’ve discussed today. Do you have any questions about the forms themselves or anything we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything. Just… thank you for being patient with me. I’m not very good at this medical stuff, and I appreciate you explaining things clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. That’s my job – to help you understand your health and make informed decisions. Don't ever hesitate to ask questions, no matter how simple they may seem. We’ll get these forms completed, and we'll follow up once the lab results are back to discuss any further steps. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that’s everything. I appreciate your help, Doctor Rakosky. I should probably get going.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Fabing. I will have the lab order printed for you shortly. Take care, and don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns.
