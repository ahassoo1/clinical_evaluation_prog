DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Yes, well… I am here for this… telehealth thing. My daughter, she make the appointment for me. I think it is to just… check how I am doing. It has been some time since I see a doctor, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here it’s a comprehensive check-up, as you said, it's been a while. That's a great idea to get things checked out. And you're right, your daughter did a good job getting you scheduled. Just to get a good overall picture, could you tell me a little bit more about why she thought it was a good time for a check-up?
PATIENT: Oh, she worry. She say I been… slower, maybe? And I forget things sometimes. Nothing big, you know. Just… where I put my glasses. Or… what I was going to say. She think maybe I need… something for my memory. But I feel okay, mostly. Just… old, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your daughter is looking out for you, and it’s very common to experience some memory changes as we get older. It’s good you feel okay otherwise. "Slower" and forgetting where you put things… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well… at work, sometimes I take a little longer to… to fix the cars. Not much longer, but… I used to be faster. And I have to ask my coworkers where I put my tools sometimes. I always know how to fix the cars, my mind is still good with that! But… finding the right wrench… or remembering which car came in first… it takes a little bit more thinking now. It didn't used to be like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like the thinking part is still sharp – you know how to do the work – it's more about the speed of recalling things and keeping track of details. That's helpful information. And you still enjoy your work, it sounds like?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I love my work. Always have. Fixing cars… it is good. It keep my mind busy, you know? I have been doing it… almost thirty years now. It is good to do something. Keeps me from… well, from just sitting. My husband… he liked to sit. But not me. I need to be busy.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. It’s good to have something you enjoy and that keeps you active. Staying mentally engaged is very important. Now, just to get a more complete picture, are you experiencing any other changes – anything at all – like with your sleep, your appetite, your mood, or your energy levels?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sleep… it is okay. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but not every night. And I eat… like I always eat. Maybe a little less now, but… not much. I don't have a big appetite, never did. My mood… I am okay. Sad sometimes, I miss my husband. But… that is normal, I think. And energy… well, I get tired easier now, of course. But who doesn't when they get older? I don't know. Nothing… big.
DOCTOR: That all sounds very reasonable. It’s perfectly normal to experience some changes in sleep, appetite, and energy levels as we age, and it's understandable to miss your husband. We’ll definitely keep all of that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… many years ago, he say my blood pressure was a little high. He give me some pills. I take them for… a little while. Then he say it was okay and I don't need them anymore. And… no, nothing else. My husband, he had… problems with his heart. But not me. I have been lucky, mostly. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the blood pressure. And it's good you’ve been generally healthy. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. When I was young, I have my appendix out. And… when I break my arm, I have surgery to fix it. That was a long time ago, maybe fifty years now. Just those two, I think. I don't remember anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a fracture repair. That's helpful. Now, thinking about your family… Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… That is a good question. My mother… she had problems with her heart. She die… when I was young. And my father… he had cancer, I think. Lung cancer. My sister… she has diabetes. And… Alzheimer's… my aunt, on my husband's side, she had that. Very bad. It is… a terrible thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's in the family. That's helpful information to have, thank you. And finally, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I have never had an allergy. Not to food, not to medicine. Nothing. I am lucky that way too, I think. Always been a strong girl. Well, not so much girl anymore, but… strong. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. I don't take anything. Not even vitamins. My daughter, she tell me I should take something for my memory, but… I don’t. I don’t like to take pills, if I can help it. It is a bad habit, I think. But I just don't.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Benites. It gives me a really good understanding of your health history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears and throat. It will just take a few minutes. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72, regular. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear clear. Throat is clear, no significant redness or swelling. Now, let’s just check your reflexes...
PATIENT: Okay. That… that all sounds good, I hope. I don’t know much about those… things you said. Oh! That is… surprising. I always jump when someone do that. My daughter do that sometimes, to tease me.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to jump! It's a reflex, and everyone reacts a little differently. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, if you could just follow my finger with your eyes, keeping your head still. Good. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’m just going to check your gait and balance. If you wouldn’t mind standing up and walking a few steps for me. Your gait is steady and balanced. No significant abnormalities detected. Okay, Ms. Benites, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, to get a clearer picture of what might be going on with your memory, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help, then yes, please. Blood work is… okay. My daughter always tell me I need to be more… proactive, about my health. So… blood work is good. Will it hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It's very good that you're being proactive! And I understand your concern about needles. It’s a very common fear. It will be a small prick, and it's usually over very quickly. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. It won't take long. The blood work will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid panel. We'll also check your Vitamin B12 levels, as a deficiency can sometimes cause memory problems. While we're waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle changes that can help improve your memory and overall health. Things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and mental stimulation can make a big difference. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I… I try to walk sometimes. Not every day, but… sometimes. And I eat… mostly healthy. I like vegetables. Mental stimulation… I do crossword puzzles. When my daughter visit, we play cards. So, yes, I am open to that. What do you… suggest? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all! It’s wonderful that you’re already doing those things – walking and crossword puzzles are excellent for your brain health. Playing cards with your daughter is great too – social interaction is very important. Here are a few things we can focus on. First, let’s try to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. That could be brisk walking, swimming, or anything else you enjoy. Second, let's focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit processed foods, sugary drinks, and unhealthy fats. Third, continue to challenge your brain with activities like crossword puzzles, Sudoku, or reading. And finally, make sure you're getting enough sleep – 7-8 hours per night is ideal. I’m also going to give you a handout with some tips for improving your memory, and a list of resources you might find helpful. While we're waiting for the blood work results, if you notice any sudden changes in your memory, or if you become confused or disoriented, please contact me immediately. It's always better to be safe than sorry. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very sensible. Thirty minutes of walking… I think I can do that. I like walking in the park. And I will try to eat more vegetables. The handout… that is good. I like to have something to look at, to remind me. And I will… pay attention. If anything feels different. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel… less worried now. When will I get the results? And… will my daughter be able to see them? She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. The blood work results should be back within 3-5 business days. The results will be available through our patient portal, and my nurse will call you to discuss them. Regarding your daughter, we adhere to strict patient confidentiality guidelines. So, I can’t share your results with her directly without your explicit consent. However, you are welcome to share the results with her yourself, or you can invite her to join you for a follow-up appointment to discuss them together. Would you like me to document in your chart that she has your permission to access your results?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Document that she has my permission. She worries so much, it is better if she knows. And she is good at… remembering things. I sometimes forget what the doctor say. She can help me understand. And… she is good at asking questions. I don't always know what to ask. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I think… I think that is all. For now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. It’s wonderful that you have such a supportive daughter, and it’s perfectly alright to have someone help you with your healthcare. I’ve documented in your chart that she has your permission to access your results. We’ve covered a lot today – your medical history, a physical exam, and a plan for blood work and lifestyle changes. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s the handout I mentioned, and a list of local resources for seniors. I’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. In the meantime, take care, and remember to stay active and engage your brain! Have a wonderful day, Ms. Benites.
PATIENT: .
