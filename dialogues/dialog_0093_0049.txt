DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bakan, is it? That’s a nice name. Well now, let me think… it’s my ears, I believe. They just don’t seem to be workin’ like they used to. Everything’s a bit… muffled, you know? I have trouble hearin’ folks speakin’. It’s been goin’ on for a while now, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, though. Time just slips away, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, time certainly does have a way of doing that. So, you've noticed a gradual decrease in your hearing, with sounds becoming muffled. And this has been ongoing for some time. To help me understand things better, could you tell me if this affects one ear more than the other, or is it both ears equally?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… lemme see. I think… I think it’s both ears, yes. Hard to say for certain, though. I don’t really pay attention to which ear it is, just that it’s difficult to hear. It’s not like a sudden thing, more of a… slow fade, I suppose. Like turnin’ down the volume on the radio, bit by bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. A gradual decrease in hearing, affecting both ears equally. And you describe it as a slow fading—very helpful. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears alongside the muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing… Now that’s a thought. Hmm… sometimes, yes. Not all the time, mind you. Just now and then. It's a sort of… high-pitched whine, I think. Like a kettle boilin’, but fainter. It doesn't bother me too much, mostly just notice it when it’s quiet. Is that what you were askin' about? I get a bit confused with all these questions, sorry. It’s not easy keepin’ track!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schneer. You're doing perfectly fine. It’s very helpful to have all this information. So, occasional high-pitched ringing in your ears along with the muffled hearing. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently, or throughout your life – perhaps in a workplace, or hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must’ve been forty years or more. Lots of machines, clackin’ and whirrin’ all day long. Real noisy place it was. Never thought much about it at the time, just got used to it, I suppose. Aside from that… not really. I don’t go to concerts or anything. I like my peace and quiet. Do you think that factory work could’ve caused this?
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Mr. Schneer. Prolonged exposure to loud noises, like you experienced in the shoe factory, is a common cause of hearing loss. We call that noise-induced hearing loss. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you experienced any dizziness, balance problems, or ear pain alongside the hearing loss and ringing?
PATIENT: Dizziness… No, not really. My balance is alright, I think. I haven't fallen or anything. And no ear pain, thankfully. Sometimes my ears feel a little… full, maybe? Like when you’re flyin’ on a plane. But no actual pain. I get a bit lightheaded sometimes, but that’s probably just my age, ha! I'm 83 years old, Doctor. Things start to go a bit wonky, you know?
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Schneer. It's good to hear you haven't experienced any dizziness or ear pain. And yes, feeling a little fullness in the ears occasionally is common. To get a better understanding of the extent of your hearing loss, I'd like to perform a brief hearing test in the examination room. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? Sounds alright to me, Doctor. If you think it’ll help, go right ahead. I’m not sure what it involves, but I’m happy to give it a try. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable or anything. I don’t want to cause any trouble. Lead the way!
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Schneer. It's a very simple and painless test. We'll just be putting headphones on, and I'll play some tones at different volumes. You'll simply indicate when you can and cannot hear them. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. If you could sit here for me, please. We’ll start with the right ear.
PATIENT: Right ear it is. I always did have better hearin’ in my right ear… or maybe that’s just what I tell myself. Go ahead when you’re ready, Doctor. I’ll do my best. Just speak up if you need me to do anything special. These old ears aren’t what they used to be, you know!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I’m going to play some tones through the headphones. They’ll be at different pitches and volumes. Whenever you hear a tone, please press this button. Don’t worry if you don’t hear some of them, that's perfectly normal. Just press the button only when you actually hear the sound. We’ll start with the right ear. Here we go… Okay, now we’ll do the left ear. The procedure is the same. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Here we go… Alright, Mr. Schneer, that’s all the testing for now. Thank you for your patience. Let me take a look at the results… Based on the results, Mr. Schneer, you have a moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, affecting higher frequencies more significantly. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss and likely exacerbated by your years of working in a noisy environment. There’s no evidence of a sudden change or other concerning findings.
PATIENT: Moderate, you say? Sensorineural… that sounds complicated. So, it’s gettin’ worse with age, and the factory didn’t help, is that right? Well, I figured as much. I’ve always been a bit hard of hearin', but it's been gettin’ worse lately, makin’ it hard to follow conversations. What does this mean for me, Doctor? Are there things I can do about it? I don’t want to go around shoutin’ all the time, ha!
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good summary, Mr. Schneer. It's a common condition, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to shout. There are several options we can consider. The most effective solution for hearing loss of this degree is usually hearing aids. They amplify sounds, making them easier to hear. We can discuss the different types and styles available to find what best suits your needs and lifestyle. Alternatively, we can focus on communication strategies, such as ensuring good lighting during conversations, reducing background noise, and asking people to speak clearly and slowly. There are also assistive listening devices that can be helpful in specific situations. Before we discuss hearing aids, I want to ensure there aren’t any other contributing factors. Do you have any fluid buildup in your ears?
PATIENT: Fluid buildup… Hmm… not that I know of. My ears don’t feel blocked, and I haven’t noticed any dizziness or pain. I've never had much trouble with ear infections or anything like that. I've always been pretty lucky, all things considered. But I have noticed a bit of wax buildup sometimes. I used to try and clean them out myself with a cotton swab, but my daughter told me that wasn't a good idea. Is wax buildup somethin' to worry about? Could that be makin' things worse? I always like to get to the bottom of things, if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Schneer, and you’re right to ask. While earwax is a natural protectant, excessive buildup can sometimes contribute to hearing loss. However, based on my examination of your ears with the otoscope, there doesn’t appear to be a significant amount of wax obstructing the ear canal. It's good you stopped using the cotton swabs – they can actually push the wax further in, making the problem worse. So, given the results of the hearing test and the examination of your ears, I believe the primary cause of your hearing loss is age-related and noise-induced. Would you be interested in discussing hearing aids further?
PATIENT: Hearing aids, you say? Well, I’ve always been a bit hesitant about those. I’ve seen folks wearin’ them, and sometimes they don’t seem to work very well. And I don’t want everyone knowin’ I’m hard of hearin’. It feels… like admitin’ I’m gettin’ old, you know? But, I suppose if it could really help me hear better, it might be worth considerin’. What kind of options are there? Are they very noticeable? And, most importantly, are they difficult to use? I’m not very good with all these newfangled gadgets.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Schneer. It's perfectly natural to feel hesitant. Hearing aid technology has come a long way in recent years. They are much smaller, more discreet, and more effective than they used to be. There are several different styles available: Behind-the-ear aids: These sit behind your ear and connect to a small earmold that fits in your ear canal. They’re suitable for a wide range of hearing losses. Receiver-in-canal aids: Similar to BTE, but the receiver sits directly in your ear canal, making them even more discreet. In-the-ear aids: These are custom-made to fit inside your ear. In-the-canal and Completely-in-canal aids: These are even smaller and fit deeper in your ear canal, making them very discreet, but they may not be suitable for all hearing losses. Most modern hearing aids are also very easy to use. They have simple controls, Bluetooth connectivity for connecting to phones and other devices, and some even have automatic adjustment features. We can start with a hearing aid evaluation to determine the best style and features for your needs. We can also arrange a trial period so you can try them out and see if they improve your hearing. And, of course, I'll provide you with thorough instructions and support. Would you be open to scheduling a hearing aid evaluation?
PATIENT: A hearing aid evaluation… Well, I suppose it wouldn’t hurt to take a look, would it? I’m not makin’ any promises, mind you. But, if it could really help me hear better, I might be willin’ to give it a try. And, a trial period sounds good. I don’t want to spend a lot of money on somethin’ that doesn’t work. So, yes, let’s schedule an evaluation. When are you available, Doctor? And, will my insurance cover any of it? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what’s covered and what’s not.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad to hear that, Mr. Schneer. We can schedule the evaluation for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. That will give us plenty of time to assess your hearing and discuss your options. As for Medicare coverage, most plans do cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids, but the coverage varies depending on your specific plan. Our office has a billing specialist who can help you verify your coverage and understand your out-of-pocket costs. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. I'll have the receptionist schedule the appointment and contact you to confirm. She will also gather information about your insurance plan. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. I’m still a bit nervous about the whole thing, but I’m willin’ to give it a try. Thank you again for your time and patience. I look forward to speakin’ with the receptionist. Hopefully, these hearing aids will help me enjoy hearin’ the world a little better. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your appointment. We’ll do everything we can to help you find a solution that works for you. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. .
