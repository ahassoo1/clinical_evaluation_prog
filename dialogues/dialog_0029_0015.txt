DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… my nose, I think. It’s been bothering me. Not sure how long, exactly. Things… they all feel a little mixed up sometimes, you know? But it's my sinuses, I believe. A problem with them.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Mixed up” – can you tell me a little more about that feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s hard to explain. Like… remembering yesterday feels clearer than last week, sometimes. And I forget things easily. But the nose… the nose is now. It feels… full. And a little achy, around my eyes, too. Not always, just… when it’s bad. It makes it hard to sleep, sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. So, the nose feels full and achy, especially around the eyes, and that’s worse at night. And you've also been having some trouble with memory lately. Let's focus on the nose first. Is there any discharge – any mucus coming from your nose?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There is. It's… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little yellow, I think. Not a lot, but enough to… bother me. I use tissues, you know? A lot of them. It's not like a bad cold, just… constant. It’s been like this for… a while. I am sorry I cannot remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear or yellow discharge, constant, and you're using a lot of tissues. Any fever, headache, or facial pain besides around the eyes?
PATIENT: Hmm… a headache, yes. Sometimes. Not a bad headache, just… a dull ache. And… maybe some pain in my cheeks? It’s hard to say. It feels all mixed up, like I said. I don't feel hot, so no fever, I don't think. I haven’t taken my temperature. Does that make sense, Doctor? It's… difficult to explain. It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so dull headache and some discomfort in your cheeks along with the nasal congestion. I'm going to do a quick exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your lungs, look in your nose and ears, and feel around your sinuses. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. It is alright with me. Please, take your time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Your lungs sound clear. Your ears look normal. And when I press on your sinuses, it is a little tender on both sides, especially here… and here…. No fever present. The nasal passages are congested and slightly swollen, but no obvious polyps or masses. It sounds like you likely have sinusitis – an inflammation of your sinuses. Given the congestion and tenderness, it’s probably been going on for a little while. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not that I know of. My mother… she had some, to flowers, maybe? But I don’t think I do. I haven't noticed anything. I’ve lived in the city a long time. Everything is… dusty, you know? Everything makes me a little stuffy sometimes. But I don't think allergies. I have never been to an allergist, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're right, city living can certainly contribute to congestion. Now, regarding your memory… has this been a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It’s… not like I suddenly forgot everything. Just… things slip my mind more easily. I forget names, sometimes. And where I put things. My husband… he helps me remember things. But it’s been… slow. Not sudden. Just… getting worse, maybe. It worries me a little, Doctor. But I don't know what to do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So a gradual decline in memory, mostly forgetting names and misplacing things. Has anyone else in your family experienced similar issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had trouble remembering things towards the end. But she was very old. And… my uncle, maybe? He was a little… confused sometimes. But I don’t really know. We don’t talk much about things like that. It’s… not polite, I think. We just… helped him when he needed it. I don't remember exactly what happened, only that he needed help.
DOCTOR: Okay. A family history of memory issues, though details are limited. Given your symptoms – the sinusitis, the gradual memory loss, and the family history – I think it's important to rule out a few things. I'm going to order a complete blood count to check for any infection or inflammation. And I’d like to schedule you for a CT scan of your sinuses to get a clearer picture of what’s going on there. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. A scan… and the blood test. Yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Will the scan… will it be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I have to work, you know… I am a rotary drill operator. I need to know if I will need time off.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is painless, Ms. Boham. It's just an X-ray, so you'll be lying still for a few minutes. As for the results, it usually takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to read them and send the report over to me. We can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment, or I can call you with the findings if something urgent comes up. Regarding work, you shouldn't need extended time off just for the scan itself. However, depending on what the scan shows, we may need to discuss potential treatment options that could require some time off. For now, let's focus on getting the scan done and seeing what the results tell us. Here’s the referral for the CT scan. The imaging center is located at [Address]. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: [Address]… yes, I think I know where that is. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… what if it's something bad? The memory… it worries me, you know? And my husband… he worries, too. We don’t have much money for… for treatments. Will I have to pay a lot for the scan?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Boham. It’s understandable to be worried. Let’s address the financial aspect first. I’m going to have my staff check if there are any financial assistance programs available at that imaging center, or if we can get it done at a lower-cost facility. We'll do everything we can to minimize the cost. As for the scan itself, it’s important to remember we’re just gathering information at this point. There are many possible causes for your symptoms, and it doesn’t automatically mean something serious. We’ll discuss all the options once we have the results. I also want to assure you that we’ll work with you to create a treatment plan that fits your budget and needs. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for… being so kind. And for checking about the money. It helps… a lot. I will schedule the scan… as soon as I can. And I will call if I… if I don't understand something. Thank you again, Doctor Chora.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. My staff will be in touch regarding the scan and any potential financial assistance. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye. .
