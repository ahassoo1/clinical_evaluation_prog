DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with us today for a check-up. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Though, check-up sounds…light. It’s not just a check-up. My wife, she insisted I come. Says I’ve been…forgetful. Not me, mind you. Just little things. Dates, mostly. And I get…lost in my thoughts, I suppose. It’s unsettling, that’s what it is. A good tile man doesn't get lost in his thoughts.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. It's perfectly reasonable to want to get to the bottom of unsettling changes, especially when they affect things you pride yourself on. And it’s good your wife encouraged you to come in. “Forgetfulness” can mean many things, and we want to explore it thoroughly. Let’s start with the dates. Could you give me an example of what you mean?
PATIENT: Well, just yesterday, I was supposed to meet my son, David, to help him with some work on his bathroom. Completely slipped my mind! He was waiting for me, poor boy. Then, last week, I… I can’t recall what day it was, but I went to the hardware store for cement, and came home with… tiles. Completely the wrong thing! My wife was not pleased. It’s… frustrating. I always remember these things. I’ve been setting tile for forty years, Doctor. Forty years! You don’t forget things like that.
DOCTOR: Forty years is a long time, indeed. And a testament to your dedication. It is concerning when things start to feel off, especially when it involves details you typically have no trouble with. You mentioned slipping your mind about meeting your son and bringing home the wrong items from the hardware store. Has this been happening frequently, or are these isolated incidents?
PATIENT: Frequently, Doctor. Not every day, thankfully. But…at least twice a week, maybe three. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I ate for breakfast… things like that. Though, the David thing and the hardware store… those felt bigger. Like a…a gap in my thinking. It’s not like I’m wandering around lost, you understand? Just… moments. Like a radio losing signal. And it's getting worse, I think. My wife says so, anyway. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Lason. “Moments” and a “gap in your thinking” – those are good ways to describe it. And your wife’s observations are important. It sounds like this is gradually worsening, which is why it’s good you’re here today. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about these “moments”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I’m asleep. I’m just… not there. I’ll be in the middle of something – setting a tile, usually – and my mind just…goes blank. Then, suddenly, I’m back. Like someone flipped a switch. I don’t remember what I was thinking, or even that I was thinking. It only lasts a few seconds, maybe a minute. But it’s enough to throw me off. I've nearly cut myself a few times, Doctor, because I wasn't paying attention. That's what scares me. And then… sometimes I feel confused, even after it's over. Like I’m trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite unsettling, Mr. Lason, and the near-misses with the knife are particularly worrying. It's good you're recognizing this and seeking help. These "blanks" and the subsequent confusion are important details. Now, let's broaden our scope a bit. Aside from the memory lapses and confusion, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My wife says I’ve been… more irritable. Snapping at her over small things. Which isn't like me. I’m usually a patient man. And…I’ve been having trouble sleeping, Doctor. Not falling asleep, necessarily, but waking up in the middle of the night. Just…lying there, staring at the ceiling. And, I suppose… a little bit of trouble with my balance. Nothing major, just…feeling a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes. Though, that could just be getting old, I suppose. I am sixty-six, after all. But the irritability… that worries me. I don’t want to be snapping at my wife.
DOCTOR: The irritability and sleep disturbances are definitely relevant, Mr. Lason, and it's good you've brought those up. While the balance issues could be age-related, we need to consider everything. It's important to rule out any underlying causes. To get a more complete picture, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back. Doctor put me on some medication for it. I think it's under control now. I see him regularly for check-ups. And… I had my prostate enlarged a while back. Had a procedure for that, maybe ten years ago. Other than that… nothing major. I’ve always been a healthy man. Eat my vegetables, walk every day… mostly. I used to be a very active man. Tile work keeps you moving, you know. I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in… oh, goodness, decades.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That's helpful. Controlled hypertension and a history of prostate enlargement are important to note. And it's good to hear you generally maintain an active lifestyle. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it's called. One a day, in the morning. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for my back. Tile work isn’t kind to your back, you know. Ibuprofen, usually. But not every day. Only when it’s really bothering me. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. My mother always said, “Pills are for weak people.” I know that’s silly, but… it stuck with me.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Mr. Lason. Many people prefer to avoid medication when possible. Lisinopril and occasional Ibuprofen are good to know. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve always been lucky that way. My wife is the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust, cats… she’s always sneezing. But me? I can eat anything, touch anything… never had a reaction. I’ve eaten some questionable things in my life, traveling through Cambodia, but never a problem. My mother used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. She was a very practical woman, my mother. Always knew what was best.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. A lack of allergies simplifies things. And it sounds like your mother was a remarkable woman. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father… he had some trouble with his memory when he got older. Not like me, though. He just…forgot things. Dates, names… things like that. My wife says it was probably Alzheimer’s, but we never had him properly diagnosed. He didn’t like doctors much. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. She lost a leg because of it. Other than that… not really. We didn’t talk about medical things much in my family. It was considered…private. Mostly, we just focused on surviving. Growing up in Cambodia… health wasn’t always a priority.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s helpful information, even though it’s limited. A family history of possible Alzheimer’s is important to note, and diabetes is a relevant consideration as well. It sounds like health wasn’t openly discussed in your family, which is understandable given your background. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I set tile. It’s hard work, but I enjoy it. Keeps me moving. I work five days a week, usually eight or nine hours a day. My wife handles most of the housework. She's a good woman, very organized. I mostly relax in the evenings. Watch a little television, read the newspaper… sometimes go for a walk. We don’t go out much anymore. Too crowded, too noisy. I used to enjoy fishing, but haven’t been in years. And… I try to eat healthy. Mostly vegetables, fish… not too much meat. My wife cooks for me, she knows what’s good for me. We live a quiet life, Doctor. A simple life. I’m not one for excitement.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a fulfilling life, Mr. Lason. A simple life with routines and purpose. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, I'd like to ask a few more questions. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I used to, when I was younger. A beer with my friends after work, maybe. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, goodness, twenty years or more. My wife doesn't like it. Says it makes me grumpy. And… I don't really enjoy it anymore. It doesn't taste as good as it used to. I prefer a glass of water. Or a cup of tea. Much better for you, you know. I always tell my son, “Water is life.” He doesn’t listen, of course. He likes his beer. But me? I'm a water man.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Lason. A sensible choice. And it’s good you’re mindful of your health. Now, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never have, Doctor. Never even tried. My father smoked a little, but he died young. It smelled awful, made him cough something terrible. I always thought it was a foolish habit. Dangerous, too. My wife would never let me smoke anyway. She's very…firm. And… I've always been a bit sensitive to smells. Smoke just…irritates my lungs. No, never have, never will. A waste of money, too. Much better to spend it on a nice dinner with my wife. Or a new tool for my work.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Lason. A very healthy lifestyle. Now, finally, I’d like to ask about any recent stressful events in your life. Have you experienced any major life changes or difficulties recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say. Life is always… something. My son, David, is going through a divorce. That's been hard on him, and hard on us. We try to support him, but… it's a difficult situation. And… my wife’s sister is very ill. She’s in the hospital, and… well, it’s not good. She's a good woman, and… we're worried about her. Other than that… not really. I mean, there’s always something, isn’t there? But nothing major. Just… life. It's getting old, that’s the hardest thing. Things start to break down. You lose people you love. It's…inevitable, I suppose. But it’s still difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. Those are significant stressors, and it’s understandable that they would be weighing on you. Okay. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Get it over with. I’m not a fan of doctors, but… I understand it needs to be done. Just… be gentle, alright? My back isn’t what it used to be. And… try not to take too long. I have some tiles to cut later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll try to be efficient. First, I’ll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I'll do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming given the stress you’ve been under. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger. Good. Now, I’ll check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. A little unsteady, but you’re maintaining your balance. Finally, I’ll test your coordination. Please tap your heel on the opposite shin. Slightly slower than expected, but within acceptable limits. Overall, the neurological exam is relatively normal, but I'll document the slight unsteadiness and slower coordination.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. What does it all mean? Is it something serious? My wife is going to worry herself sick if I tell her I went to the doctor and you found something wrong. She’s a worrier, that one. Always has been. And… I have tiles to cut. I promised David I’d help him finish his bathroom this week. I need to know if I should be concerned. Is it…Alzheimer’s? My father…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be as straightforward as possible. The physical exam didn’t reveal anything acutely alarming. Your vital signs are mostly stable, and your heart and lungs sound good. The neurological exam was relatively normal, though I did note some slight unsteadiness and slower coordination. Now, regarding your concerns about Alzheimer’s, it’s too early to say definitively. The symptoms you’ve described—forgetfulness, moments of confusion—can be early signs, but they can also be caused by many other things, such as stress, anxiety, sleep deprivation, or even medication side effects. The slight unsteadiness and slower coordination could also be related to age or other factors. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also recommend a cognitive assessment – a series of simple tests to evaluate your memory, thinking skills, and language abilities. This will help us determine if further evaluation is needed. It's important to remember that a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s requires a comprehensive evaluation, and we're not at that stage yet. These tests are simply to help us gather more information and make an informed decision. Would you be comfortable with proceeding with the blood tests and cognitive assessment?
PATIENT: Blood tests… alright, I suppose. Can’t hurt, can it? Though I hate needles. And… a cognitive assessment? What does that involve? More poking and prodding? I just want to cut my tiles, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? But… if it will put my wife’s mind at ease… and if it will rule out something serious… alright. Do what you have to do. Just… try to be quick about it. And… explain everything beforehand, alright? I don’t like surprises. Especially when it involves my brain.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Lason. I understand your reluctance, and I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable and straightforward as possible. The blood tests will simply involve a small sample of blood taken from your arm. It will be a quick pinch, and then it’s over. The lab technician is very skilled, and we'll do everything we can to minimize any discomfort. As for the cognitive assessment, it’s a series of simple tasks that take about 20-30 minutes. It doesn't involve any needles or poking. I’ll ask you to remember a list of words, perform some basic calculations, identify objects, and draw a simple picture. It’s not a test of intelligence, it’s simply a way to assess your cognitive function. I’ll explain each task carefully beforehand, and you can ask questions at any time. The results of the tests will help me determine if further evaluation is needed, such as an MRI or a consultation with a neurologist. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We're simply gathering information at this stage. I’ll have my nurse schedule you for the blood tests and cognitive assessment. She’ll also explain the process in more detail. Would you like me to order a referral to a neurologist preemptively, just in case?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Don’t order anything preemptively. Let’s see what the tests say first. I don’t want to be running around to specialists for no reason. My wife will have a fit if I start going to a lot of appointments. She’ll worry herself sick. Just… schedule the tests. And… make sure the nurse is gentle. I don’t like needles, and I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… explain everything clearly. I want to know what’s going on, alright? No surprises. And… can I still cut my tiles? I promised David… it’s important. I need to know if this will affect my ability to work. That’s what worries me the most. Not…Alzheimer’s. Not yet, anyway. Just…my tiles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I completely understand. We’ll proceed cautiously, and I’ll make sure everything is explained clearly. I’ll request that the nurse be especially gentle and thorough in explaining the process. And yes, you can still cut your tiles. We haven’t determined that there’s anything that would prevent you from working. We’re simply gathering information at this stage. However, if you experience any worsening symptoms—increased confusion, difficulty with balance, or any other concerning changes—please stop working and contact me immediately. I’ll also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and the planned tests, so you have something to refer to. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your appointments. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… try not to worry my wife too much, alright? She’s a good woman, but she tends to… catastrophize. Everything is always the worst possible scenario with her. I just want to get this over with and get back to my tiles. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And… thank you for not dismissing me as just an old man losing his marbles. That’s what my son thinks, sometimes. Now… if you’ll excuse me, I have some tiles to cut. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I’m not dismissing anything. It’s important to address your symptoms and rule out any underlying causes. And I’ll certainly do my best to keep your wife’s concerns in check. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And I hope you’re able to get back to your tiles soon. Have a good day, Mr. Lason. And thank you for coming in today.
