DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Pavlovic. Ninety years young, is it?
PATIENT: Pavlovic, that's right. Though, feels older some days, you know? Ninety... feels like a long time ago sometimes. I mostly just go by Brodie these days. What was I here for again? Oh... the cough. Yes, the cough. It's been... a while, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: A cough. Yes. And how long is "a while," exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm... a while... Well, since… since my wife passed. It started around then, I think. Maybe a year? More? Time gets... blurry. It's a dry cough, mostly. Doesn't bring anything up, if you know what I mean. Just… tickles and then hack. It’s worse at night, usually. Keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Right, a year. Dry cough, worse at night. Any fever, chills, or shortness of breath with it?
PATIENT: Fever… Not that I’ve noticed. I don't usually bother with a thermometer. Chills... sometimes I feel a little cold, but that's just getting old, isn't it? Shortness of breath… not really. I get tired easily, but that's… well, I haven't been doing much lately. It’s just… harder to do things, you know? Not that I'm running marathons or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no fever, no chills that you've noticed, no shortness of breath. And fatigue… well, you’re ninety. Let’s see… any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Sometimes. Not sharp pain, more like a… tightness. Like a heavy weight sitting there. It comes and goes. Happens more when I try to do something, like… carry groceries or something. Not a big load, mind you. Just… a little bit. Does that make sense? It doesn’t last long.
DOCTOR: Tightness with exertion. And are you having any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Oh. Now that you mention it… a little. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… my old bones. They ache, you know? Everything aches. But yes, I suppose they do swell up some. Not terribly, but… noticeable. I wear loose socks now, mostly. Helps a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen to your lungs and then I’ll take a quick look at your feet. Just to be thorough. If you could sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Careful now, these old legs aren’t what they used to be. Don’t mind if I take my time. Is it cold in here? I always feel a little chilly these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lungs sound… congested, but not drastically so. Yes, some mild edema. And your pulse is a little weak. It’s likely a combination of age, a bit of congestion, and perhaps some mild heart failure. We’ll need to get an EKG and some blood work done to confirm.
PATIENT: Heart failure? Oh dear. Is that… bad? I haven't been feeling too bad, just tired and coughy. Blood work… and that EKG thing? What does that even do? I don't want to get poked and prodded too much, Doc. I'm an old man, you know. Easily bruised. Is this going to be expensive? I... I don't really have insurance.
DOCTOR: Look, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious yet. Congestion and mild edema are common at your age. But we need to rule things out. The EKG is just a quick scan of your heart’s electrical activity, nothing painful. The blood work will tell us about your kidney function and other things. As for the cost… I can’t really help you with that directly. But there might be some programs available for low-income patients. The front desk can give you some information. I’ll order the tests. Then we can schedule a follow-up to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. If you think it’s best. I don't want to cause any trouble. Just… try to be quick, okay? And thank you, Doc. For… looking after me. I just hope it's not anything too serious. My wife… she always took care of things like this. I’m not very good at all this doctor stuff. So, follow up… when? And the front desk… yes, I’ll ask them about those programs. Just… it’s a lot to take in. .
DOCTOR: We’ll schedule a follow-up for next week. The front desk will handle that. Get the tests done as soon as possible. Alright, you can go ahead and get dressed. .
