DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a paper signed, somethin' about... a procedure. A cosmetic one. My niece, she said I needed clearance from a doctor before I do it. Don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest. Just need the okay, and then I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you're short on time. Let's see if I can find the details here… cosmetic procedure… Okay, it looks like you had a consultation scheduled with a med spa for… a lipoma removal on your back. Is that correct?
PATIENT: A lipo… what now? Back? Oh, that. Yes, yes, that sounds right. A little bump. Been there a while. Honestly, I barely notice it. My niece, Bernice, she worries too much. Says it's… unsightly. But a paper is a paper. I just need you to say I'm okay to have it… taken off. Don’t need no fuss, Doctor. Just the signin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, even for a simple procedure like a lipoma removal, I do need to gather a little bit of information, just for my records and to ensure it's safe for you. It’s standard practice, Mr. Honcoop. Have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… Let me think. No, not that I recall. Maybe when I was a little boy, somethin' with my tonsils, but that was a long, long time ago. Nothin' recent. I’ve been fairly healthy, all things considered. Mostly just aches and pains from work, you know? Radio towers ain't easy on a man. But no serious operations, if that's what you're askin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent surgeries. And you mentioned aches and pains from work… what kind of work do you do, and for how long have you been doing it?
PATIENT: I install and repair radio, cellular, and tower equipment. Been doin' it… Lord, I don't even know anymore. Forty years, maybe more? Since I was a young man. Climbin' those towers, workin' with all the wires... It's honest work, but it's hard on the body, let me tell ya. Ain't as easy as it used to be. Now, are we gettin' closer to this paper I need?
DOCTOR: Okay, forty years in tower work. I'm making a note of that. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I'm aware of. I take a little somethin' for my knees, but that's it. Diabetes? High blood pressure? No, no, I don’t think so. Doctor, honestly, I’m a fairly simple man. I eat my greens, try to get a little sleep, and stay busy. I ain't one for sittin' around worryin' about things. Are you tryin’ to find a reason not to sign this paper?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, not at all. I just need to make sure it's safe for you to undergo this procedure. It’s my responsibility. Just a few more questions. Do you take any medications regularly for your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just somethin' the pharmacy gives me. A little white pill. Can’t recall the name, honestly. I just ask for a refill every month or so. It helps with the achin', mostly. Now, are we finally gettin' somewhere? This is takin' a long time. Bernice is gonna be furious if I'm gone all afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m going to need to get the name of that medication, Mr. Honcoop. It’s important to know what you’re taking, even if it's just an over-the-counter pain reliever. Can you check with the pharmacy when you get a chance?
PATIENT: The pharmacy? Doctor, I ain't got time to be runnin' back and forth to the pharmacy! I told you, I just ask for a refill. They know what I need. Look, I’m a practical man. I’ve been climbin’ towers for forty years, I can handle a little bump on my back. Just sign the paper! It’s a waste of both our time to be messin’ with all this detail.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re frustrated, but I can’t simply sign off on a procedure without knowing your medical history. It’s a liability for both of us. Given your limited recall of medications and medical conditions, and considering your work history, I'm concerned about potential risks. To be safe, I recommend a brief physical exam and perhaps a simple blood test to rule out any underlying conditions. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? A blood test? Are you serious?! Look, Doctor, I came in here for a signature, not a whole check-up! I ain’t got time for this nonsense. You know what? Forget it. I'll find another doctor. One who understands I just need a piece of paper signed. This has been a complete waste of my afternoon. .
