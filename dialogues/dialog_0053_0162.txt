DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, can we just get this over with? It's my stomach. Been… puffy. Bloated. Feels like I swallowed a balloon, alright? Not exactly a complicated problem. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. “Puffy.” Well, even simple problems deserve a little investigation, Mr. Kristofik. Helps me rule things out, you see. When did this “puffiness” start?
PATIENT: Honestly? Don't really remember. A few weeks, maybe? Look, I work long hours, okay? Pile driving isn't exactly a thinking man’s job. I eat when I can, mostly. It's… just been getting worse, I guess. Is that good enough? I don't keep a diary of my digestive system, Doc.
DOCTOR: “Mostly.” That’s… helpful. And what exactly do you mean by “mostly”?
PATIENT: Look, I eat… sandwiches, usually. Burgers. Whatever the guys get for lunch. Sometimes I skip a meal if I'm busy. Sometimes I grab a quick bite from the store, you know, chips, a soda… nothing fancy. It's fuel, alright? Not a gourmet experience. Does it matter what I eat when my stomach feels like it's going to explode?
DOCTOR: It matters, Mr. Kristofik, believe it or not. We need to establish some patterns here. Are you experiencing any other symptoms besides the bloating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Geez. Let me think… I guess… a bit of gas. Not like, embarrassing amounts, but… yeah, a bit windy. And sometimes… my stomach gurgles. Like, really loud. My wife… used to complain. She’s… gone now. So. Not a problem anymore. Look, is this going somewhere, Doc? I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Right. Gas and gurgling. And how about bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You gotta ask everything? Look, it's… normal. Sometimes regular, sometimes not. Depends on what I've been eating, alright? When I'm busy I don't really... pay attention. Is that enough detail for you? I'm not a doctor, I just live my life. It goes in, it comes out. What else do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Yeah, it comes and goes. When I'm working, I can eat a horse. When I'm… not, I don’t really feel like much. Look, it’s not like I'm losing weight or anything. I'm solid enough, alright? I need to be. This job… requires a bit of heft. Is this going somewhere? I’m starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Let's move on to your past medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, you know, measles, mumps, rubella… nothing major. Broke my arm once falling off a roof when I was a kid. That’s about it. And… my wife, she… she had some things. But I wasn’t the one with the problems. Look, I'm a pretty healthy guy, alright? Just got a sensitive stomach lately. What are you even looking for?
DOCTOR: Right. No significant past medical history. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Don't take nothing. Never have. Why would I? I'm not a sickly man. Look, if you wanna know something specific, just ask, alright? This back-and-forth is pointless. I'm wasting daylight.
DOCTOR: Alright. And allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Spicy food, peanuts, shellfish… never had a problem. Look, are we done here? I really need to get back to work. This is taking up a whole afternoon. I’ve got deadlines, alright? Deadlines.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just lie back on the examination table, please. It won’t take long. Let’s start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, alright? I’m not exactly comfortable lying around. And don't poke too hard. I've got a tough core, but I don't need it tested right now. Just… get it over with. Stop.
DOCTOR: .
PATIENT: .
