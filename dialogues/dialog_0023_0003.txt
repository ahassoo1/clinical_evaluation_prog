DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have all day, Doc. It's this…shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, and it's getting annoying. Frankly, it's embarrassing. I used to have steady hands, you know? Important in my line of work.
DOCTOR: Annoying and embarrassing, I understand. And you said “a while now”?
PATIENT: A while… jeez, how long is a while? Months, I guess. Maybe longer. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things anymore. My wife… she used to remember everything. But, well, she's gone now. It started subtly, I think. Just a little tremor when I was holding something. Now it's… noticeable. Especially when I try to eat. It’s a mess, really.
DOCTOR: Months, started subtle, now noticeable especially with eating. And it's primarily in your right hand, or both?
PATIENT: Right hand, mostly. Sometimes the left will get a little shaky too, but nothing like the right. Look, is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Important things. Not just sitting around talking about my hands.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Baide. We'll be as efficient as possible. Before we proceed, can you describe the shaking?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, act shaky? It… it’s just a tremble, alright? Like a little vibration. Gets worse when I try to do something precise. Like… signing my name. Or holding a fork. It’s not constant, though. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it's… well, a nuisance. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Is it worse at rest, or with movement?
PATIENT: Rest? Movement? What kind of question is that? I dunno! It just… happens. Sometimes it's worse when I'm trying to do something, like, reaching for a glass. Sometimes it feels worse when I'm just sitting here, doing nothing. Honestly, Doc, it doesn't follow a pattern. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the shaking?
PATIENT: Accompanying it? Like… a marching band? Look, I just feel… unsteady sometimes. A little dizzy, maybe. But I'm an old man, Doc. Old men get dizzy. Probably just low blood sugar or something. I don't need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: Fair enough. And have you experienced any stiffness in your hands or other joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Not really. They ache sometimes, like any old person’s joints. But stiff? No. I can still… mostly… do what I need to do. It’s the shaking that's the problem, not some creaky joints. Honestly, I’m surprised you're not focusing on the main issue here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick neurological exam. I'd like you to extend your arms in front of you, palms up, for a moment. Just hold them there.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. This is ridiculous. I direct movies, I don’t pose for doctor exams.
DOCTOR: I see a resting tremor in your right hand, and it’s present, though less pronounced, in your left. We’ll check your reflexes now. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap just below your kneecap.
PATIENT: Just get on with it. I’ve had doctors poke and prod me before. It's not exactly a new experience. Is this going to involve needles? Because I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Now, could you please try to tap your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's not exactly perfect, is it? I haven't done this since… well, I don't even remember. Look, is this actually going to tell you something, or are you just making me look foolish?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've described, and the initial exam, it's possible you're experiencing essential tremor. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function and vitamin levels. Also, an MRI of the brain would be prudent to ensure there are no structural issues. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: MRI? Blood work? Absolutely. That sounds like a waste of time and money. I’m an old man with a shaky hand, not a science experiment. My wife would’ve known what to do. She always knew. Look, if it's not something serious, I don't want to be poked and prodded and scanned. Just give me something for the shaking, alright? Something to stop the embarrassment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to determine the cause of your shaking before prescribing any medication. Providing a treatment without a diagnosis could be… irresponsible. The tests will give us valuable information. If it is essential tremor, medication can significantly improve your quality of life. But we need to rule out other, potentially more serious conditions first. Will you allow me to proceed with the blood work and the MRI?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, alright! Blood work, MRI, whatever. Just get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s just a shaky hand. And it's taking up my whole morning. I expect results quickly, and I expect something to do about it. Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: I will have the lab draw blood now, and we'll schedule the MRI for as soon as possible. The results typically take a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for Propranolol, a beta-blocker, which can help reduce the tremor. It's a low dose to start, and we can adjust it as needed, once we have the results of the tests. Please be aware of potential side effects, such as dizziness and fatigue. Here is a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance. I recommend you schedule an appointment with her as well, to discuss long-term management. Do you have any questions about the medication or the referral?
PATIENT: Propranolol… Right. Sounds complicated. Neurologist… More doctors. Look, just tell me what I need to do. Take the pill, see another doctor, got it. Don’t bother with the side effects, I’ll figure it out. Honestly, this is a whole production just for a shaky hand. Can I please go now? I have a meeting.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. The lab is just down the hall. Please let my office know if you experience any concerning side effects from the Propranolol. Here is a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for the next week, as a precaution. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results of your tests with you soon.
PATIENT: Fine. Goodbye. And try not to make a whole thing out of it.
