DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, really. I've noticed a change in my body odor recently, and it’s…different. It’s not worse, exactly, just different than what I usually smell like. I thought I'd get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's always best to get these things checked out, and there's absolutely no embarrassment in seeking medical advice. It's good you came in. "Different" is helpful – can you describe that difference a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually, I just smell…well, like me, you know? A little bit of soap, maybe. But now it’s…sweeter, almost? Not like perfume sweet, but…faintly fruity, I guess. And it seems to be more noticeable after I’ve been working. I lay floors for a living, so I do a lot of physical labor. It’s not always there, but when I’m hot and sweaty, it’s definitely more prominent. I can't really pinpoint exactly when it started, maybe a month or two ago?
DOCTOR: Okay, "sweeter" and "faintly fruity," especially with exertion. That’s good information. A month or two ago… alright. And it’s primarily noticeable after physical labor, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not constantly there, which is why it took me a while to realize it was actually different. Like, if I’m just relaxing, or haven’t been very active, I don’t really notice anything unusual. But after a long day laying floors… it’s definitely there. It doesn’t smell bad, just…not how I normally smell. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Kerriann. You're very observant to notice a subtle change like that. It’s good you're paying attention to your body. Let's go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, as far as I know. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor for checkups every year, and everything’s always been fine. No allergies that I’m aware of, either. I don't take any regular medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise healthy, no allergies, no current medications. That's good to know. Any family history of… unusual body odors, or metabolic conditions like diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I'm aware of. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart trouble, but nothing like… body odor problems or anything like that. We didn't really talk about things like that. I think my grandmother had diabetes, but she passed away a long time ago, before I was really old enough to pay attention to her health. So, no, not that I know of. Does that help? I’m trying to think, but my family isn't really the sharing type.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Kerriann. It’s perfectly alright if the information isn't readily available. Okay… let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I did try it once when I was a teenager, but it didn't agree with me. I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. I try to, anyway. Working on a floor all day is hard enough without adding a bad diet to it! I don't do any recreational drugs, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption, healthy diet, no recreational drugs. Good. Now, this may be a bit personal, but… have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, um… other changes? Let me think. I have been feeling a little more tired lately, now that I think about it. But that could just be the work. It's hard physical labor, you know? And I've been sweating more, probably because of the heat. No weight loss or weight gain, no changes in my bathroom habits, nothing like that. My periods are regular, as regular as they can be for someone my age. No unusual skin rashes or anything. I really haven’t noticed anything major, just the tiredness and the sweating, and of course, the change in my… scent. I hope that’s not too much information. It’s just hard to think of what’s relevant.
DOCTOR: No, that's all very relevant, Kerriann, thank you for sharing. The tiredness and increased sweating are important pieces of the puzzle. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I’m just hoping it’s nothing serious. I’ve got a floor to lay next week, and I need to be on my feet!
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions. No unusual pigmentation. Everything appears normal on physical exam, but the change in body odor combined with the fatigue is a bit unusual. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel just to rule out any underlying issues. And I want to do a urinalysis as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I understand you want to be thorough, and I appreciate that. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. No problem at all. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within a few business days, usually three to five. I'll have the nurse contact you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I want to be cautious. Given the change in odor and fatigue, I'd like you to avoid strenuous activity for now. It’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule out things like diabetes or kidney issues. It could also be a hormonal imbalance. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in to discuss them and determine the next steps. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…reasonable. Avoiding strenuous activity is going to be difficult, but I understand. Better to be safe than sorry, I guess. So, three to five business days for the results, then a follow-up appointment. And the nurse will contact me. Okay. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should be watching out for? Or any over-the-counter things I should avoid? I don’t want to accidentally mess up the test results or something.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. For now, avoid any heavily scented soaps or deodorants, as they could interfere with the results. Also, stay well-hydrated. And if you experience any new symptoms – fever, nausea, vomiting, significant weight loss, or increased weakness – please contact the clinic immediately, even before the results are back. Otherwise, just rest and allow your body to recover. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Kerriann?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. No heavily scented soaps, stay hydrated, and watch out for new symptoms. And rest. Okay. Thank you, Doctor Glazewski. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and taking this seriously. It’s… reassuring to know someone is looking into it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. It's my job, and I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the lab order and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and please, take it easy.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too.
