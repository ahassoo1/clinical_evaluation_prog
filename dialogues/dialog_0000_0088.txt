DOCTOR: Alright, Jaylyne, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor Batara. It’s… this ringing in my ears. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s starting to really bother me. It's like a high-pitched whine, most of the time.
DOCTOR: Hmm, ringing in the ears. Okay. And how long exactly is “a bit now”?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… maybe three or four weeks? It came on pretty gradually, I didn’t really notice it at first. Just thought it was the usual noises, you know? But it hasn’t gone away. It’s pretty constant now, especially when it's quiet.
DOCTOR: Constant, you say. And is it in one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly in my right ear, I think. It’s hard to tell sometimes. Like, I can definitely hear it more clearly in that one, but I feel like maybe it's a little bit in the left too? Not as bad, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… loud noises definitely make it worse, for sure. Like, if I’m around a lot of people talking, or music is playing… it gets really bad then. And… I don’t know if this matters, but I used to work pretty long hours at a nightclub, before I got divorced. It was really loud there, all the time.
DOCTOR: A nightclub, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. For about five years. Waitering mostly. It was pretty hectic, lots of shouting and music. Real busy place. I stopped working there about six months ago, right around when things started getting bad with my ex-wife. I guess a lot changed all at once.
DOCTOR: So, prolonged exposure to very loud noises… and now this. Have you had any other symptoms along with the ringing?
PATIENT: Not really… just tired, I guess? But, honestly, that could just be everything else going on. I haven’t been sleeping great. And maybe a little bit dizzy sometimes, but it’s not like… spinning dizzy, just… off balance. Is that a symptom? I don't know. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" rarely is, Mr. Dhanoa. And dizziness can be related. Now, let's get a little more detail about this dizziness. When you say “off balance,” can you describe what you mean?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. It's… hard to explain. Like, when I stand up too fast sometimes, I feel a little wobbly. Or if I turn my head quickly. It only lasts for a second or two, it’s not a big deal. But it's been happening more lately, I think. It's just… annoying, you know? Everything feels a bit unstable sometimes. I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing, though. I just want this ringing to stop.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to rule a few things out. Have you had any hearing tests done before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never really had any problems with my hearing before, so I've never thought about it. I can still hear fine, I think. It's just this ringing… it's really loud in my head. Does that make sense? Like, I can hear over it, but it’s always there. It’s just… persistent. It's driving me crazy. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that's precisely why we need to get a baseline. We'll start with a basic audiometry test to assess your hearing levels. I also want to take a look in your ears, just to make sure there's nothing obvious going on. If you'll just sit over here, we can get started. It will take about 20 minutes.
