DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion. I feel perfectly fine, just… tired, naturally. At my age, one is tired. It’s probably just the sun. Though I can’t rightly recall the last time I spent any significant time outdoors. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Right. “Complexion.” And you say you feel…tired. Very well. Let’s attempt to establish some clarity. When did you first notice this change in your…complexion, as you put it?
PATIENT: Goodness. That's...difficult. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It all blurs together, you understand. I’ve been… occupied. With things. Important things. I wouldn’t put much stock in my recollections, truthfully. My wife is usually better with dates. Ask her. Really, this is quite inefficient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's try a different approach then. Has anyone commented on your complexion recently?
PATIENT: Of course. My wife. Constantly. She has a keen eye for… imperfections, shall we say. And Mrs. Gable next door. A rather nosy woman, if you ask me. She remarked I looked… “wan.” Whatever that means. They both seem rather agitated by it, which is quite unnecessary. Is this all there is to it? A few old women noticing a bit of… color?
DOCTOR: “Color,” you say. Can you describe this…color, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor. I'm not a painter. It's… darker. A sort of… dingy hue, I suppose. Like old metal. Not particularly pleasant. I told you, I’m a reinforcing iron worker. I deal with metal all day. Perhaps it’s just… reflecting onto my skin. Is that even possible? Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea. This is all rather… pedestrian.
DOCTOR: Pedestrian or not, Mr. Drahota, it warrants investigation. Now, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, everything changes. Joints ache, memory fails… what sort of change are you referring to? If it’s not this… skin matter, frankly I’m wasting my time. I have more pressing concerns. Though I suppose… my appetite hasn't been quite what it used to be. But that's just old age, isn't it? Really, Doctor, I'm a practical man. I don’t need a list of every little ache and pain cataloged.
DOCTOR: Reduced appetite, you say. Has there been any unintentional weight loss associated with this?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Good heavens, no! I'm a robust fellow, despite my years. Though… my wife did mention my trousers feeling a bit… looser. But she’s always fussing over my appearance. Probably just the laundry shrinking them. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not wasting away. I’m a man of substance. This is becoming quite tiresome. Are we nearing a conclusion?
DOCTOR: Loose trousers... Very well. And have you experienced any fatigue beyond what you would expect with age?
PATIENT: Doctor, is this a trick question? Of course, I’m tired! I’m eighty-five years old! I work with iron all day! What did you expect, boundless energy? I feel… weary. Listless. A general… lack of pep, if you will. But it’s perfectly normal! This entire exercise feels rather… pointless. Is there anything concrete you’re trying to ascertain? Or are we simply documenting the natural decline of a senior citizen? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your… frustration. However, it’s my professional obligation to gather information. I'm going to perform a brief physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. If you insist on being uncooperative, this will only prolong the process.
