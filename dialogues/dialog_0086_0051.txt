DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my blood. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I should know my blood type. Something about… in case of emergencies? I can’t quite recall the details. It’s been a long time since I thought about these things. I just want to know, you know, what it is.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood type. Well, it can be useful information to have, though I must say, at your age, it’s not something we routinely check unless there’s a specific reason. Still, we can certainly do it. But before we order any tests, is there anything else bothering you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Nothing else, not really. Just the blood type. My bones ache a bit sometimes, like they do when the weather changes, but that’s just getting old, I suppose. It’s not a… a problem, problem. Just a little… creaky. No, truly, just the blood type, if you wouldn’t mind. It would put my daughter’s mind at ease, you see. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get your blood type checked. Just to be thorough – and please don’t be offended, it’s just my job – have you ever had any significant bleeding issues?
PATIENT: Bleeding… issues? Hmm. Let me think… Oh, goodness. I did cut myself pretty badly once, years ago, working… well, I used to be a rigger, you know? On the ships. But it stopped bleeding, eventually. Needed stitches, I think. But nothing… major. I don’t think so. Not that I recall. It was a long time ago. Everything gets a bit blurry, doesn't it? Was that what you meant?
DOCTOR: And have you ever been told you bruise easily, or had any problems with blood clots?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Clots… Bruising… Well, I do get a bump or two now and then, falling over things, mostly. But I suppose everyone does at my age, don’t they? I wouldn’t say easily bruised, no. I just… I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. No, I don't think I’ve ever been told anything about clots. Are those… serious? I hope I haven’t got clots! My daughter will be terribly worried.
DOCTOR: It's unlikely, Ms. Nini. I'm just covering all bases. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of things. It’s standard procedure. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Stand up… Just give me a moment. There we go. A little stiff, but I can manage. It's been a while since I had a proper exam, you know. What will you be… looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and just generally assess your overall condition. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of a murmur, but that's common at your age. Lungs are clear. Pulse is a little fast, but again, not terribly concerning. Blood pressure is… 145 over 90. A bit elevated. Now, let's take a look at your extremities. Any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that all sounds… alright, I suppose. A murmur? Goodness. I haven’t thought about my heart in years! And… swollen ankles? Hmm. They do feel a bit puffy, now that you mention it. Not terribly, just… a bit. I thought it was just the heat. We’ve had such warm weather lately. Is that bad, Doctor? Should I be worried about my ankles?
DOCTOR: A little pitting edema. Yes, it's likely related to the heat and possibly your blood pressure. But we need to investigate further. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. We’ll also check your thyroid levels. This will give us a better picture of what’s going on. The lab will draw blood, and the EKG technician will attach some stickers to your chest. It’s all very quick and painless.
PATIENT: Oh, my. So many tests! Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor? My daughter always worries when I have tests. She thinks every ache and pain is something terrible. I’m not good with all this medical… stuff. What is a basic metabolic panel? And what’s wrong with my… thyroid? Are those things… bad? Perhaps just the blood type would be enough?
DOCTOR: Ms. Nini, I understand your anxiety, but it's better to be thorough. A basic metabolic panel checks your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar. Thyroid levels assess your thyroid gland, which regulates your metabolism. We’re not looking for anything specific right now, but these are standard tests given your age and slightly elevated blood pressure. The blood type will be done as well, of course. It’s just… prudent to rule out other possibilities. The nurse will explain everything in more detail. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s best. Prudent, you say? Well, I suppose you know best, Doctor. I do trust your judgment. Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. Not that I recall. Maybe a bit of a rash once, years ago, from some sort of… cream? But nothing serious. No, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Definitely not penicillin, I remember my mother saying something about that. But that was a long time ago. Is that helpful? I'm terrible with remembering these things, you know. Everything gets muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I take a little something for my… creaky joints. It’s… it’s called… Oh dear, it’s on the tip of my tongue! It’s a small white pill, I think. My daughter gets it for me. And sometimes, when I can't sleep, I take a little something for that too. Just a half a tablet, you know? But I can’t remember what it’s called either. It’s… a sleeping pill, I suppose. But nothing regularly, not really. Just when I need them. Do you need the exact names? My daughter keeps them in a jar, I suppose she could tell you. I'm so sorry, I’m just… not very good with names.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nini, knowing the exact names is rather important. I'll have the nurse ask your daughter. We need to know what you're taking to avoid any potential interactions. Alright, we’ve covered most of the basics. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood and get some information from your daughter. I'll review the results as soon as they come in and we’ll discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I’m so sorry for being so… forgetful. It’s just… getting old, I suppose. Questions? Hmm… Will the blood type test hurt? And… will I be able to drive home afterwards? I live quite a way away, you see. And… will the results take long? My daughter is coming to visit next week, and she’d be terribly worried if I didn’t know something before then. But other than that… I think that’s all. I just want to know my blood type, you see. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a quick pinch, Ms. Nini, nothing to worry about. And yes, you should be perfectly safe to drive home afterwards. The results usually take 24-48 hours, but I'll ask the lab to expedite them, given your daughter's visit. I’ll have the nurse let you know when they’re available. In the meantime, try not to worry. We’re just being thorough. I’ll see you soon.
