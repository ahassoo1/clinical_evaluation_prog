DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter saying I’m able to fly. My travel insurance company requires it before they'll cover my trip. It’s for a trip I’ve already booked, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: A letter stating you’re able to fly… I see. And is there a specific medical reason why they would require such a letter?
PATIENT: No, not really. It's just… a new policy, apparently. They sent a standard form after I paid for everything. It asks if I have any conditions that might make flying unsafe. I don’t, as far as I know, but they need a doctor to say I don't. It feels a bit silly, honestly, but they won’t budge.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a form completion for travel insurance. While I understand your frustration, Ms. Sayar, simply stating you are “able to fly” isn’t a standard medical practice. It requires a review of your medical history to ensure there are no contraindications to air travel. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant conditions – heart problems, lung disease, blood clots, recent surgery… anything at all that a doctor should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I lost my husband a few years ago – he had… complications after a surgery, but that wasn’t me. Aside from that, I’ve been pretty healthy. Regular check-ups, vaccinations… the usual. I have Medicare, so they keep a good record, I suppose. I haven't had anything major, I promise.
DOCTOR: Medicare records do show consistent preventative care, as you said. No acute hospitalizations or concerning diagnoses listed. Past surgical history?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery myself. Just the usual things – wisdom teeth out when I was younger, but that was decades ago. I really haven't been sick, honestly. I’m… was a teacher for a long time, so I was always around germs, but I built up an immunity, I think. Is this helping? I just want to get the letter and go. I’ve already paid for the flights and the hotel.
DOCTOR: No surgical history noted. Family history, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some problems with his heart later in life, but it wasn't diagnosed until he was quite old. Nothing that would affect me flying, I don’t think. No history of blood clots or anything like that on either side of the family. Honestly, we were a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: And what about social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Um… I don’t drink or smoke. Never have. I used to be very active – hiking, camping – but since my husband passed… not so much. Mostly just work now, and planning this trip. It’s to visit my sister in Mongolia, actually. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Do you currently take any medications, Ms. Sayar?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I really don’t. I prefer not to, if I can avoid it. Just vitamins, occasionally, if I feel like I’m getting a cold. But nothing prescribed by a doctor, definitely. Is this a problem? I thought I made it pretty clear I’m generally healthy.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, while I appreciate your detailed responses, and I acknowledge your consistent preventative care, simply stating you are “generally healthy” is insufficient for a medical clearance for air travel. It’s a matter of liability, frankly. We need to consider potential risks, even if they seem remote. While you haven't presented with any obvious contraindications, I need to perform a brief physical exam to assess your cardiovascular and respiratory function. It's standard procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I suppose so. I really didn’t expect this for a letter saying I can fly. But fine. If you need to listen to my heart and lungs, go ahead. Just… please be quick? I have a lot to do before my trip.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, and I’ll quickly check your blood pressure and pulse. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal S1 and S2, no murmurs, rubs or gallops appreciated. Everything appears normal, Ms. Sayar.
PATIENT: Okay, good. So… can you write the letter now? I really need to get going. Is there anything I need to sign? I'm happy to fill out whatever forms you need, just as long as it’s quick.
DOCTOR: I will draft a letter stating that, based on my examination today, you appear to be in no immediate medical contraindication to air travel. However, I must include a disclaimer that this assessment is based solely on the information provided and the examination performed today, and does not cover unforeseen medical events during your trip. And, Ms. Sayar, it is your responsibility to inform the airline of any pre-existing conditions. Here you are. Please review it carefully and sign where indicated. And I strongly advise you to discuss any concerns with your sister before your departure.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it, even if it was more complicated than necessary. I really must be going now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sayar. Safe travels.
