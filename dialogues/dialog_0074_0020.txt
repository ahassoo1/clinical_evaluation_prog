DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's lovely to meet you. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… I get call for this… talk on the… computer? My friend, she say I need to… check with doctor, yes? I feel… okay, mostly. But old. Everything feels old.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, your friend is very thoughtful to encourage you to come in. It sounds like you received a notice from a screening program, perhaps?
PATIENT: A screening… program? I do not… remember. Many papers come to my house. My husband, he always sort them. Now… is just me. Maybe it was a paper. But I do not worry much about papers. Is just… routine check, yes? To make sure everything is… working?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. It often is a routine check, a way to proactively look at your overall health. And yes, to make sure everything is "working" as you put it – a very good way to describe it. To help me get a better understanding, even if you don't recall the specific reason for the notice, could you tell me a bit more about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Hmm. How I been feeling… I tire easily. Even small things… like garden. I love garden, but now… is too much. And my knees… they ache. Not all the time, but… when the weather is cold, or damp. And sometimes… I forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, or… what I was going to say. Is normal for old lady, yes?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon to experience those things with age, Ms. Benites, and it's good that you're paying attention to them. Fatigue, knee discomfort, and occasional forgetfulness can all have various causes, and it’s important to explore them a little further. Could you tell me a bit more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: It is… all the time, almost. Not like… sick tired, but… heavy tired. Like I carry stones in my pockets. I sleep… okay, I think. But I do not feel rested when I wake up. Even after eight hours. I used to have so much energy. I could work in the garden all day, and then cook a big dinner. Now… I need to sit down after just a few minutes. And sometimes, I fall asleep in my chair. Just… blink, and then I am waking up.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing that so well, Ms. Benites. That does sound quite tiring, and it’s certainly not something you should just dismiss. You mentioned it’s not like “sick tired” – meaning no fever, no cough, no other symptoms of illness?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. No fever, no cough. Nothing like that. Just… tired. Like… the battery is low. Is that how you say? My grandson, he fixes cars, he talk about batteries. Is like that. The energy is… gone too fast. And do not come back so easy. I eat… okay, I think. Not much sweets. Mostly vegetables from my garden. But maybe… I need more vitamins?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good analogy, Ms. Benites – a low battery. And it’s excellent that you’re focusing on a healthy diet with lots of vegetables. It’s good to rule out vitamin deficiencies, and we can certainly check that with some bloodwork. Let’s talk a little bit about your knees. You mentioned they ache with the cold and damp. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache. Not sharp. Like… old bones. When it rains, or when it is cold, they stiffen. And then they ache. It is better when I move them a little. But after a while… they get tired. And then ache more. I used to walk every day. Now… I walk only short distances. To the store, maybe. But not much further. It is… uncomfortable. I do not like the feeling. Is like… rusty hinges. Another car thing, yes? My grandson, he explain.
DOCTOR: You have a very descriptive way of explaining things, Ms. Benites, and it’s helpful for me to understand. “Rusty hinges” is a perfect image. And it’s good you're still able to walk to the store, even if it's limited. Now, you also mentioned some forgetfulness. Could you give me an example of what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… small things. Like… I go to the kitchen, and I forget why I am there. Or… I talk to someone, and I forget what I was saying. Or… I look for my glasses, and I find them on my head! Silly things, yes? It is not… bad. I still know who I am, and I still know my family. But it is… annoying. And sometimes… I worry it will get worse. My sister, she has… trouble remembering things now. And I do not want that.
DOCTOR: It sounds like typical age-related forgetfulness, Ms. Benites, and it’s understandable that you’re concerned about it, especially with your sister’s experience. It's good you're aware of the changes. We can do some simple tests to assess your memory, just to get a baseline. Now, let’s take a step back and talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I had… high blood pressure, many years ago. The doctor give me pills. I take them for a long time. But now… I do not take pills anymore. He said it was okay. And I had… a bad fall, about five years ago. I broke my wrist. But it heal good. And… that is all, I think. Nothing else. I go to the doctor for check-ups every year. But he never say anything… serious. Mostly, he just tell me to eat healthy and exercise. But… is hard now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Benites. That's helpful. And it's good that you've been seeing a doctor regularly. You said you were told to eat healthy and exercise, and that's becoming more difficult. We can discuss some strategies to make that a little easier. Were there any surgeries you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The wrist, of course, when I fell. And… I had my gallbladder out, many, many years ago. When I was still young. It was very painful. But I heal good from that too. I think… that is all. No other surgeries. I do not like surgeries. Too much risk. My husband, he had a surgery once… it was not good. So I try to avoid them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. I understand your concerns about surgery. We will certainly keep that in mind. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had… heart problems. She died when she was old. My father, he had… diabetes. And my sister… she has trouble remembering things now. Like I say. And… my brother, he had cancer. He died many years ago. Is not a good history, yes? Many sicknesses. I worry… that I will get something too.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Benites. It is helpful for me to understand your family’s health background. You're right, it isn't an easy history. Knowing this helps us be more vigilant. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke for many years, but he quit. And no alcohol. Not much. Sometimes, a little glass of wine with dinner. But not every day. Maybe… once a week. I do not like the feeling. Makes me… dizzy. And I do not want to be dizzy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Benites. Occasional light wine consumption is not usually a concern. Now, just to finish up with some background information, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. I think… I am allergic to penicillin. The doctor give me penicillin once, when I was young. I got a very bad rash. And… sometimes, I get a little itchy when I touch certain flowers. But not bad. Mostly, I am okay. No other allergies, I think. I eat everything. I do not have trouble with food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Ms. Benites. And thank you for being so thorough. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is alright. You are very… gentle. I am not afraid. Just… quick, yes? I have… garden to do. And dinner to make. But… I have time. Just a little time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. I'll be as quick as I can. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any unusual noises. Your lungs sound a little quiet, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 140 over 90. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. There's some mild swelling and I can feel some crepitus – a sort of grinding sensation – when you move them. You mentioned pain with range of motion, and I can see that you are a bit uncomfortable. Your gait seems a little slow, but stable. Alright, Ms. Benites, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I think it would be a good idea to run some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. We'll check your complete blood count, your kidney and liver function, your thyroid, and your vitamin levels. I also recommend an X-ray of your knees to see what's going on with the joints. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Blood work and… X-ray. To see what is wrong. I trust you, Doctor. Is just… I want to feel better. The tiredness, and the aches… it is hard. And I want to be able to garden again. And cook for my family. Is important to me. So… yes. Do whatever you think is best. When can we do the tests?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Benites. I completely understand. We'll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I have the lab technician draw your blood today and schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I want to address your blood pressure. Even though it was only slightly elevated today, it's something we need to monitor. I’d like you to check your blood pressure at home a few times a week and keep a log. I can have the nurse show you how to do that. And while we're waiting for the test results, it's important to continue to eat a healthy diet, try to get some gentle exercise, and get enough rest. If you're experiencing significant pain, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as directed on the label. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Acetaminophen… is that like… Tylenol? I have that in my house. And… ibuprofen? Is that Advil? Yes, I have that too. Okay, I can do that. The blood pressure… how often should I check it? And… what numbers am I looking for? I do not want to worry too much. And… will the tests take long? I have… appointment with my friend next week. I do not want to miss that. She is… important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, acetaminophen is the generic name for Tylenol, and ibuprofen is the generic name for Advil. You're right to recognize those. Regarding your blood pressure, I’d like you to check it twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – for the next week. Try to rest for five minutes before taking your blood pressure, and sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor. The nurse will show you how to do it properly. Ideally, your blood pressure should be below 130/80 mmHg. Anything consistently above that, and especially above 140/90, we'll want to discuss. Don’t worry too much, just keep a record and we'll go over it together. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The X-ray results are typically available within 24 hours. So, you should have everything back by early next week, well before your appointment with your friend. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: No, I think… that is all. You have been very… kind. And patient. And you explain everything so… well. I feel… better now. Knowing what is going on, and knowing what we are going to do. Thank you, Doctor. I will… check my blood pressure. And I will… take the tests. And I will see you next week. Wonderful. That's excellent to hear, Ms. Benites. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. The nurse will come by shortly to schedule your lab work and X-ray. Have a good day, and try to take it easy.
