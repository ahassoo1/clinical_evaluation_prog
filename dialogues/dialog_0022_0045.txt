DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I've been getting... flushed. A lot. My face gets very red, and sometimes my chest too. It's been happening for maybe a month now, I think. Hard to say exactly, time goes quick, you know? It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… warm. And red.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Flushing – getting red and warm – for about a month now. Not painful, just a warm sensation. That’s helpful to know. When would you say these episodes happen most often?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. Not really at a certain time. Sometimes after I eat. Sometimes just… when I'm sitting. Or walking. I don't think it's after exercise, though. I don’t do much exercise, if I'm honest. It just happens. That's the trouble, I think. No pattern.
DOCTOR: So, it seems to be fairly random, not consistently tied to activity or meals. That does make it a bit trickier to pinpoint the cause. Besides the flushing, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I have been a little tired lately. But I'm always a little tired, to be fair. And… my stomach hasn't been great. Not… bad bad, just… unsettled. Like a little bit of a rumble, you know? And maybe… a little bit of sweating sometimes, when the flushing happens. But not a lot. I’m a warm person anyway. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Mr. Withycombe. Yes, even that you generally run warm is good to know. So, let's recap: flushing episodes for about a month, sometimes with fatigue, occasional stomach upset, and some mild sweating. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger… That’s a good word, “trigger.” No, not really. I mean, sometimes spicy food. But I like spicy food, so I eat it anyway. And sometimes when I get a little… agitated. If someone says something… upsetting. But that doesn't happen often. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. So, not much upsets me now. It's mostly just the flushing. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Withycombe. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you've been through a lot. Okay, so we have flushing, potentially linked to spicy foods and sometimes agitation, with fatigue and occasional stomach upset. Before we move on, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Not much to tell, really. I've always been pretty healthy. High blood pressure, the doctor said, a few years back. But I take a pill for that, every morning. Can't remember the name. And… arthritis in my knees. That’s why I don't do much walking. Other than that… nothing major. No big surgeries, no serious illnesses. I see a counselor, you know, for… well, things. But he doesn't give me medicine. Just listens. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful. So, high blood pressure managed with medication – we can look up the name later if you’d like – and arthritis in your knees. That’s good information. And seeing a counselor is excellent. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. My wife used to worry about me eating too much, but never about allergies! No pollen, no bee stings, no nothing. I used to garden a lot, you know. Flowers and vegetables. Never had a problem. So, no, I don't think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That simplifies things. Now, just one more question about your background. Do you currently take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just the blood pressure pill. Every morning. Small, white… can’t remember the name, I told you. And… sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think. The over-the-counter kind. Not every day, though. Only when I need it. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. So, blood pressure medication daily and ibuprofen as needed for your knees. Alright, Mr. Withycombe. Thank you for providing all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just checking your heart rate, blood pressure, listening to your lungs, and feeling your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I’ve always been a pretty healthy person, like I said. A little tired, a little achy, but nothing serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. "Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It’s not drastically high, but we’ll keep an eye on it. " "Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear." "Abdomen is soft, no tenderness, and I don’t feel any masses." "I’m also going to check your pulse in your extremities and look at the skin on your chest to assess for any rash or changes in pigmentation." “Pulses are good. Skin looks normal. No rash." “Everything seems within normal limits on the physical exam, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure. But given your flushing episodes, fatigue, and stomach upset, I would like to order some blood tests to help us figure out what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Blood tests… alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just want to figure out what’s causing the flushing. It’s… unsettling, you know? So, yes. Blood tests. What kind of tests? And… will I need to fast beforehand? I like my breakfast.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good we’re getting to the bottom of this. We’ll start with a complete blood count to check your overall health, a metabolic panel to assess kidney and liver function, and thyroid stimulating hormone to rule out any thyroid issues. We'll also check your vitamin D levels and possibly some inflammatory markers. Regarding fasting – yes, for the most accurate results, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw. So, no food after midnight tonight. You can still drink water. We’ll schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that should be fine. No food after midnight, just water. Okay, I can do that. It’s a little early, but I can manage. And… when will I get the results? I hope it's not too long.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be too long. The lab typically takes 24-48 hours to process the results. We’ll have them back by Friday, and I’ll give you a call as soon as I’ve reviewed them. Here’s the requisition form. It has instructions for the lab. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance - or we can provide you with a list of nearby labs. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. No chest pain, no shortness of breath… just the flushing and the tiredness. I’ll avoid food after midnight and get the blood tests tomorrow. And you'll call me when the results are in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. You seem very thorough. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. And you are right to be proactive about your health. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good rest of your day, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. .
