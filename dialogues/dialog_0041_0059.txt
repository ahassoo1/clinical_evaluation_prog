DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it's my speech. It’s been… a bit off, lately. Slurred, I suppose is the word. I don't quite recall when it started, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit off,” and slurred speech… hmm. It's good you're getting it checked out. It's tough to pinpoint things when you're not sure when it began. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it most?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a tricky one. I… believe it’s more noticeable when I'm tired, perhaps? And when I speak for a long time. Like, if I'm giving instructions to the crew on the building site, it seems to get worse. But, honestly, it comes and goes. It's not… constant. I hope that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yeah, that does make sense. So, worse with fatigue and prolonged speaking… okay. And you mentioned a building site… do you do physical labor as part of your work?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm a Construction Manager, so I'm on site a lot. I do a bit of everything, really. Some paperwork, but also… directing the work, checking things, sometimes even helping with the heavier lifting if needed. It keeps me quite busy. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It could matter, yeah. Just trying to get a full picture. So, physically demanding work, long hours… okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the slurred speech?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. I… haven’t really noticed anything else, to be perfectly honest. Maybe a little bit of dizziness sometimes, but I always assumed that was just from being on my feet all day. Or the heat, you know? I’m not sure if it’s related. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy when I try to recall specific things. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Fuzzy recall… okay. Let's not dismiss anything. Dizziness could be connected, or it could be something else. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you describe the dizziness a little more?
PATIENT: It's not… spinning, exactly. More like a lightheadedness. Like I might… stumble, if I don’t hold onto something. It comes and goes, too. It’s not a constant thing, like the speech. And it usually happens after I’ve been working for a long time, or if I stand up too quickly. It’s difficult to explain, really. I hope I’m not being too vague.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine. It’s helpful to hear how you describe it. Lightheadedness, especially with standing and prolonged activity… okay. Let’s switch gears for a moment. Any headaches associated with this?
PATIENT: Headaches… now that you mention it, perhaps. Not severe ones, though. More of a dull ache, at the back of my head. It comes and goes, like everything else, really. I usually just take some paracetamol and it goes away. I didn't think it was related to the speech, to be honest. Is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of the head, relieved with paracetamol… we'll keep that in mind. It could be related, or it could be completely separate. Now, just to cover all bases, have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… That’s a good question. I… I haven't really noticed anything different, no. Everything seems normal, as far as I can tell. I wear glasses for reading, but my prescription hasn't changed recently. I had my eyes checked about a year ago, and everything was fine then. Should I be noticing something?
DOCTOR: No, you shouldn't be actively looking for things, but it’s good to ask. Okay, glasses for reading, no recent changes, and no visual disturbances... alright. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I'm aware of, Doctor. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have high blood pressure, I was diagnosed a few years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Other than that… nothing that I recall. My husband usually handles all the medical appointments, so I’m not always sure of the details. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it happens. High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication... good to know. What medication are you taking for that, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It's a small white pill...I believe it starts with an 'A'. Amlodipine, perhaps? Is that right? I take one every morning. And the paracetamol when I need it, of course, for the headaches. Honestly, that’s all I take regularly. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure, paracetamol as needed. Good. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always asks when I see a new doctor, and they always say I’m clear. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, really. I’m quite adventurous with food, actually. Is that helpful information, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, it’s good to know you don't have any known allergies. Okay, and finally, let's talk briefly about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a tricky one. My mother had diabetes, I believe, and my father… he had some heart problems later in life. Nothing major on my husband’s side, as far as I know. It’s difficult to recall specifics, honestly. My family isn’t the best at keeping track of these things, to be perfectly honest. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know, yes. Diabetes and heart problems… okay. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just a basic neurological exam, check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs. That should give me a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please proceed. I trust your judgement completely. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes, coordination, and strength. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that alright? I’m trying my best to keep my head still. It’s a little difficult, to be honest, but I’m following it.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that okay? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can without hurting you, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, good grip strength. Now, can you gently tap your finger to your nose with both hands, alternating?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little tricky, to be honest. My coordination isn’t the best, usually. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. There’s a slight unsteadiness, but not overly concerning. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Alright, that’s everything for the basic exam. Given your symptoms – the slurred speech, dizziness, headache, and the slight unsteadiness I observed – and your well-controlled blood pressure, I want to be thorough. I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Is that… serious, Doctor? I mean, are you thinking something is seriously wrong? I just assumed it was stress, or tiredness, or something minor. I don’t want to worry my husband unnecessarily. But, if it’s necessary, then yes, of course. I trust your judgement. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: It's good you asked. It’s a standard precaution, Adyn. It’s always better to be thorough, especially when we’re trying to pinpoint the cause of new symptoms. The CT scan will allow us to rule out anything serious, like a stroke or a tumor. I’m not necessarily thinking something is seriously wrong, but we need to rule it out. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. I’ll explain everything in detail before it happens, and you'll be able to talk to a radiologist as well. We’ll also do the blood tests, which are much simpler. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine the best course of action. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes much more sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly. It’s reassuring to know that you’re being thorough and that it’s just a precaution. Yes, let’s do the tests. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. Can you tell me a bit more about the CT scan, just so I know what to expect? And where will the blood tests be done?
DOCTOR: Alright. The CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large donut-shaped machine. It’s important to lie very still during the scan, which usually takes just a few minutes. You may be asked to drink a contrast dye to help improve the images – we'll discuss whether that's needed. The biggest risk is a slight exposure to radiation, but it’s a very small amount. As for the blood tests, we can do those right here in the clinic. We'll just need a small sample of blood from your arm. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw the blood, and then we’ll schedule the CT scan for you. We can usually get it done within the next 24-48 hours. While we wait for the results, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – especially severe headache, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what to expect. I’m ready to have the blood tests done now, if that’s convenient. And I’ll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. I appreciate your thoroughness and patience. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Great. I’ll have Sarah come in and take care of the blood tests now. Once they're done, she can get you scheduled for the CT scan. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and we’ll discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please try to get some rest and stay hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before I call Sarah in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve answered all my questions. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I really appreciate it. I’m ready whenever you are. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Excellent. I’ll just call Sarah. Sarah?
