DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Todoro­vich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Jarvis. It’s regarding a… well, a rather foolish dietary experiment, I’m afraid. I’ve always been rather curious about pushing boundaries, you see, and I recently embarked on a diet that… wasn’t terribly well thought out. I thought a review might be prudent before any further… complications arise.
DOCTOR: Right. And what exactly did this “experiment” entail, Jarvis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s a bit embarrassing, actually. A friend – a younger man, very enthusiastic about… well, everything – suggested a purely juice-based regimen. Three days, he assured me, would “completely revitalise” me. No solid food whatsoever. Just various fruit and vegetable concoctions. I believed him, naturally. One tends to listen to youthful exuberance. It seemed…efficient. And rather colourful, to be fair.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long ago did you finish this…juice cleanse?
PATIENT: Let me see… I concluded it just yesterday morning, August 1st. So, just over 24 hours ago. I felt rather… depleted afterward, to be perfectly honest. Not alarmingly so, but definitely not revitalised. More… deflated. I thought best to consult with a professional before attempting any further… self-improvement projects. It felt a bit… reckless in retrospect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any specific symptoms since finishing the cleanse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Specific symptoms. Let me ponder. Well, I’ve found myself rather…weak, generally. A touch of dizziness upon standing, though nothing alarming. And my…digestive system, for lack of a more elegant term, feels rather unsettled. Not painful, precisely, just… absent of its usual routine, if you follow me. Also, and this may be unrelated, I’ve noticed a slight tremor in my hands, but I’ve always had a bit of a shaky hand when concentrating intently. Perhaps it’s merely age.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Jarvis?
PATIENT: Good question. Yes, I am, actually. I take a small dosage of Lisinopril, for blood pressure, prescribed by my previous physician, Doctor Abernathy, some five years ago, I believe. And, occasionally, a mild pain reliever – Ibuprofen – for the arthritis in my knees, but only as needed, perhaps twice a month at most. Nothing else. I pride myself on avoiding pharmaceuticals whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not to my knowledge, no. I’ve always considered myself rather resilient, thankfully. No adverse reactions to any food, medication, or…environmental factors that I can recall. I used to spend considerable time outdoors during my career, working with various materials, and never encountered any sensitivities. Though, I do find the scent of certain artificial fragrances rather…unpleasant. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs and abdomen. Then we’ll take a look at your hands. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A thorough examination sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to comply. Proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your expertise implicitly. Though, do forgive me if I fidget slightly. Old habits, you see, from years of being meticulously positioned for special effects work.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jarvis. Everything sounds okay so far, but your abdomen is a bit firm. Now, let me just take a look at your hands. The tremor is present, as you described, and your capillary refill is a little slow. Now, can you grip my hands as firmly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. I pride myself on my grip strength, even at my age. Years of manipulating props and camera equipment, you see. Though, I confess, it may not be as robust as it once was. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. Now, I'm going to order some blood work. We need to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I also want to rule out any dehydration. Do you have any concerns about getting blood drawn?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. I've endured rather more…invasive procedures during my career. A simple blood draw presents no difficulty whatsoever. I believe I have a rather robust tolerance for needles, if you follow me. Years spent applying prosthetics and special effects makeup, you see. Although, I do appreciate your consideration. Is there anything I should do to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just try to relax. The phlebotomist will take good care of you. We’ll get the results back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I want you to start slowly reintroducing solid foods – bland foods, like crackers, toast, or rice. And drink plenty of fluids – water is best. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Excellent. Slow reintroduction of bland solids and ample hydration… perfectly sensible. Actually, yes, I do have a question. Given the…shall we say, suboptimal nature of this recent dietary experiment, and my slightly diminished physical state, do you foresee any lasting repercussions? Are we talking merely a period of recovery, or are there potential long-term effects I should be mindful of? I’m not looking for alarm, merely…informed prudence.
DOCTOR: Well, Jarvis, it’s unlikely there will be lasting damage, but a prolonged period of severely restricted intake can put stress on your system. The tremor and delayed capillary refill are concerning, suggesting some degree of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Your body is likely compensating. We need to rule out any underlying issues that may have been exacerbated by this diet. It's important to understand that at your age, recovery may take a bit longer, and it’s crucial to avoid any further extreme dietary changes without consulting a healthcare professional. We'll assess the blood work results, and then we can discuss a plan to get you back to baseline. I would also advise against attempting any further “experiments” of this nature. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Perfectly. No further experiments. I concede, Doctor, my youthful exuberance has occasionally outweighed my common sense. I understand the need for a measured approach and the importance of avoiding undue stress on my system. I shall heed your advice implicitly. And, if I may ask, what is your professional opinion regarding the likelihood of a full recovery to my previous state? A realistic assessment, if you please.
DOCTOR: Well, Jarvis, based on my initial assessment, and assuming the blood work results are within normal limits, I’m cautiously optimistic. It will likely take a few weeks of careful refeeding and hydration to restore your electrolyte balance and muscle strength. The tremor should subside once your system is replenished. However, it’s crucial to monitor your symptoms closely and report anything unusual. I can’t guarantee a complete return to your exact previous state, as aging naturally brings some changes. But I believe we can significantly improve your condition and prevent any long-term complications. I would also recommend a follow-up appointment in one week to assess your progress. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Excellent. A week sounds perfectly sensible. And I appreciate your candour, Doctor. A realistic assessment is far more valuable than empty assurances. I shall diligently monitor my symptoms and report any… deviations from the norm. And, you have my solemn promise, no further experiments. I believe that concludes our consultation for the present, then? I thank you for your time and expertise.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does conclude our consultation for now. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once you have those results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with my office. This pamphlet contains information on proper hydration and electrolyte replenishment. Please review it. And remember, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or persistent tremors, seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that is all. I am most grateful for your comprehensive assessment and practical advice. I shall peruse the pamphlet with diligence. And I reiterate, no further experiments. Thank you once again for your time and expertise. .
