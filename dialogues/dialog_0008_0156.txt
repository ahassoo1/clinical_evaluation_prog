DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's… well, it's my stomach. I’ve been having a lot of trouble with diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit now, and it's just… annoying, honestly. I feel like I can’t get very far from a bathroom, you know? I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea can definitely be disruptive. "A while" is a little vague – can you try to pinpoint roughly when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's… a good question. I think maybe… around the spring? Or was it summer? Everything feels a bit mixed up lately. It’s definitely been worse recently, though. Like, the last few weeks, it’s been pretty bad. I really don’t keep track of dates well, sorry.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it’s common to not remember exact dates. So, it's been consistently present for several months, worsening in the last few weeks. Besides the diarrhea itself, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I've been feeling really tired, I guess. More tired than usual. And… sometimes my stomach hurts, like cramping. Not all the time, but when the diarrhea is really bad. Oh! And I’ve been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser, but I haven’t actually weighed myself. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue, cramping, and unintentional weight loss are all things we need to consider. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: Blood… I don't think so. It hasn't been bright red, if that helps? I haven't really… looked closely, to be honest. It's… unpleasant. Fever… maybe? I sometimes feel a bit warm, but I just thought it was the weather. It gets pretty hot here, you know? I haven’t taken my temperature or anything. Sorry, I’m not very good at keeping on top of things.
DOCTOR: Okay. No need to apologize. It’s good you’re letting me know what you’ve been experiencing. Let's talk about your diet for a moment. Have you noticed any particular foods that seem to make it worse, or any changes to your typical eating habits recently?
PATIENT: Diet… Hmm. I haven't really noticed anything specific, not that I remember. I eat… pretty normally, I guess? My husband does most of the cooking. I try to eat healthy, but I like sweets, so… I don’t always. I haven’t changed anything drastically, though. Maybe I’ve been drinking more coffee lately? I’ve been tired, so I’ve been needing the extra boost. It's possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, so fairly consistent diet, perhaps slightly increased coffee intake. And your husband does most of the cooking - that's good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or Celiac disease?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… that’s a tough one. I think… a doctor mentioned something about my stomach a long time ago, when I was younger. Something about being sensitive? It wasn’t anything serious, I don’t think. And… I think my husband said something about Celiac disease? But that wasn't me, it was someone in his family. I'm really bad with remembering doctor stuff, I'm so sorry. I think they ran some tests, but I don't recall the results. It was years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible sensitivity mentioned in the past, and a family history of Celiac disease. We can look into that further. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And I haven't been hospitalized, thankfully. I've been pretty healthy, generally… except for this stomach thing, of course. I mean, I get colds like everyone else, but nothing serious enough for a hospital. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Does that count? It was a really long time ago.
DOCTOR: That doesn’t count as a recent surgery. Okay, and do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Let me think… just some vitamins, I guess? A multivitamin, and sometimes vitamin D. My husband gets them for me. And… occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. Nothing regular. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamins and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don't think so. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but I just thought that was the weather. My husband says I’m sensitive to dust, but I don’t think that’s an allergy. I haven’t ever had a really bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Nothing I can remember, anyway. Sorry, I’m just not very good with these kinds of things.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. We’ll get through this. Now, before we do a physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family. Well, I have my husband, obviously. We’ve been married for… five years now? I think. He’s really good to me. And I have a brother and a sister, both living in Pakistan. I don’t get to see them very often, sadly. I talk to them on the phone sometimes. They're both healthy, as far as I know. My parents are… older, but they’re doing okay too. I’m not sure about any medical history on their side, to be honest. We don’t really talk about that much.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, husband healthy, siblings and parents healthy as far as you know, no significant medical history on their side that you’re aware of. Lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don’t smoke. I don’t really like the smell of it. And I don’t drink alcohol. It makes me feel sick, even just a little bit. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. My husband doesn't either, so we don't have any of that in the house. I think that’s everything? I hope I haven't forgotten anything. I feel like my brain is just a bit… fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers the important things. Okay, Jase, I’m going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'm going to gently press on your stomach to check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just… I just want to feel better. It’s been going on for so long. Please be gentle though, my stomach's a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. Okay, I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, though they are a little… hyperactive. Now I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm noticing some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, especially on your left side. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, no masses palpable. Okay, that gives me a little bit more information. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing a few things. The diarrhea, fatigue, and weight loss, along with the tenderness I found, could indicate a possible inflammatory process in your bowel. It's not necessarily anything serious, but we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms and the fact that it’s been going on for several months, I’d like to order some tests. Specifically, a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites, and some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay. That sounds… a bit scary, but if it helps, then yes, that’s fine. I just… what if it is something serious? I get really anxious about things like this. I don’t like being sick. What kind of inflammation are you thinking? And… what do I have to do for the stool sample? I hope it’s not too unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, and it's good you're expressing your concerns. We are just gathering information at this point, and often, these things turn out to be less serious than we initially fear. The inflammation I’m thinking of could be something like Irritable Bowel Syndrome , or a mild form of inflammatory bowel disease, but we need the tests to be sure. As for the stool sample, it's not the most pleasant thing, but it's straightforward. The nurse will give you a container and instructions. You’ll collect a small sample of your stool at home and bring it in. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully, but it shouldn't be too difficult. The blood work will just involve a simple blood draw, like you would get at any doctor's office. It will help us check for things like anemia, inflammation markers, and rule out other possible causes. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, eating bland foods, and avoiding anything that seems to trigger your diarrhea. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Okay… hydration, bland foods, and avoid triggers. I can do that. My husband is good at making soup, so that should help. And… what kind of bland foods? And… what triggers should I be looking for? Is coffee a trigger? It’s the only thing that gets me through the mornings sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good, soup is a great start. Bland foods generally mean things that are easy to digest, like rice, toast, bananas, applesauce, and clear broths. Avoid anything spicy, greasy, or high in fiber for now. As for triggers, everyone is different, but common ones include dairy, caffeine, alcohol, and sugary foods. Coffee is definitely a potential trigger, especially given your symptoms. You might try reducing your intake gradually and see if it makes a difference. It’s okay if you need it in the morning, just try to be mindful of how it affects you. We can also keep a food diary to help identify any patterns. Write down everything you eat and drink, along with any symptoms you experience. That can be very helpful. I'm going to write you a referral for the lab work and stool sample collection. The nurse will go over the instructions with you. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else before we finish up?
PATIENT: A food diary… okay, I can do that. I have a notepad on my kitchen counter. And… no, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Cumper. You’ve explained everything really clearly, and you’ve made me feel a little bit better. I was really worried before, but now I feel like we have a plan. I'm still nervous about the results, but at least we're trying to figure it out.
