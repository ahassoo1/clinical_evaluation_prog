DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need a checkup for... well, a sports team tryout. Gotta make sure I'm good to go, you know? Don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical. Smart move. And how old are you, Mr. Kingan, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Sixty-two. Yeah, getting up there, but still feel pretty good, honestly. Hope that doesn’t disqualify me.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two, alright. It doesn't automatically disqualify you, no. We just need to make sure everything is functioning as it should be for you to safely participate. I'll need to go over some medical history with you, and then do a physical exam. Do you have any current medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, aches and pains, you know, for my age. But nothing a little stretching doesn’t fix. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a while, honestly. I don't really have problems.
DOCTOR: Okay. No major medical problems, and you haven't seen a doctor recently. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I eat okay, mostly. Not a big sweets guy. My mother always said I had a strong heart. I think she was right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. Just a cast. Healed up just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No surgeries or hospitalizations. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I eat everything. Tried a few spicy things that didn't agree with me, but that wasn’t an allergy, just... poor choices.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nah. Just a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. Nothing regular. I try to get everything from my food. Is this taking long? I gotta get back to training later.
DOCTOR: No, not long at all. Just getting the necessary information. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do any close family members – parents, siblings – have any serious medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother lived to be eighty-five, pretty healthy for her age. My father… he had some problems with his knees when he got older, arthritis I think. And my brother... he's okay. A little overweight, maybe, but nothing serious. That's all I can really remember, honestly. We didn't talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your father, and your mother was healthy until eighty-five. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a smoker. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not often. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. Gotta stay in shape, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, very good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your joints and muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds good. Let’s get it over with, eh? I got things to do. Just tell me if anything’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Could you please take off your jacket?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm. Your blood pressure is 145/90. That’s a little elevated. And your pulse is 78. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at the moment, but we should keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the exam table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated blood pressure… and a murmur, you say? That doesn't sound good, does it? But I feel fine, really. Just a bit out of breath sometimes after running. Go ahead. Check those reflexes. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still within normal limits. Now, can you please stand up and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oof. Getting old, you know? How's that? Not as flexible as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your flexibility is a bit limited, and I noticed some discomfort when bending forward. Now, could you please lie down on your back?
PATIENT: Okay. Laying down now. Just tell me what you're looking for, Doctor. This is making me nervous. Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, and your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to check your joints for any swelling or tenderness. Can you please point to any areas where you experience pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm...sometimes my right knee bothers me, after a long run. And my shoulders, a little stiffness in the mornings. Not bad enough to stop training, but… noticeable, you know?
DOCTOR: Your right knee has some mild tenderness and crepitus. Range of motion is slightly limited. Your shoulders also have some crepitus and tightness. Now, just to complete the exam, I'd like to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Okay. Follow your finger… Is this bad? I'm trying not to move my head, but it’s hard. My neck is a bit stiff too, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your eye movements are slightly irregular, and I did notice some stiffness in your neck. Okay, Mr. Kingan, that concludes the physical exam. Based on the exam findings, your blood pressure is elevated, you have a heart murmur, some diminished reflexes, limited range of motion in your joints, some tenderness in your right knee, and slightly irregular eye movements. It's difficult to say definitively what’s causing these findings without further investigation. I recommend we order some blood work to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, and an EKG to evaluate your heart function. Also, an MRI of your knee could provide more information about the cause of your knee pain. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: MRI, blood work… this is getting serious, isn’t it? Look, Doctor, I just need to know if I can play. Is it gonna stop me from trying out? That's all I care about. I don't want a whole bunch of tests if it’s just gonna tell me I can’t. Can you just tell me, yes or no? Can I try out?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your concern. However, I cannot, in good conscience, tell you definitively that it’s safe for you to participate in a strenuous activity like a tryout without proper evaluation. Your elevated blood pressure and heart murmur raise concerns about potential cardiovascular risks, and the issues with your knee and reflexes need to be investigated to prevent further injury. Participating without knowing the underlying cause of these issues could be dangerous. I strongly recommend we proceed with the blood work and EKG. I can also provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. As for the knee, a physical therapist could assess it and recommend a course of treatment. If you choose not to proceed with the testing, I must advise against participating in the tryout, as it could pose a significant risk to your health.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do the tests. Blood work, EKG… whatever. Just… how long is this gonna take? And what if it does say I can’t play? I've been training for this… .
DOCTOR: The blood work and EKG can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours. Here's the form for the lab. As for what happens if the results indicate a problem, we can discuss treatment options and alternative activities. I understand this isn’t what you want to hear, but my priority is your health and safety. We'll have a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results and create a plan. In the meantime, I advise against any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions?
