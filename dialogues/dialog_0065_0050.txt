DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovec. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… this cough. Been on and off for a while now. Just a dry cough, mostly. Doesn’t bring anything up, you know? Just… irritating. Feels like something’s tickling my throat, but there’s nothing there. I… honestly, I can’t remember exactly when it started. A long time ago, I think. Maybe last winter? Or the one before? Time… it all gets mixed up, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. A chronic dry cough. And you're unsure of the exact onset. That’s… not ideal for accurate assessment, Mr. Pavlovec. Still, we'll try to piece things together. You mentioned “on and off.” Can you describe when it's worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Let me think. It feels worse when the air is… cold and dry, I suppose. Like, when I’m inside with the heat on. Makes it tickle more. And… sometimes when I lie down at night. Keeps me up a bit. Not every night, mind you. Just… sometimes. I used to work in a garage, you know. Lots of dust and fumes… maybe it’s something from back then? I don’t rightly remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A history of dust and fume exposure… noted. So, exacerbated by dry heat and supine positioning. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, I get a little… short of breath sometimes. Not a lot, just when I walk up the stairs. Or if I’m doing something… strenuous. I don't do much strenuous these days, though. Mostly just sit and watch television. And… I get tired easily, I guess. But at my age… isn’t that to be expected? I don't know. Everything just feels… old, you know? I don’t know if that counts as a symptom.
DOCTOR: Right. Dyspnea on exertion and generalized fatigue. It is common with age, Mr. Pavlovec, but we still need to determine the underlying cause. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever… no, not that I recall. Chills… maybe a little when I’m cold, but that’s just being old, isn’t it? Night sweats… no, no. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. As soundly as an old man can sleep. Weight loss… that’s a good question. My wife used to keep track of things like that… she passed away a few years back. I haven’t really been keeping track of my weight since then. I think I’ve lost a little, but… honestly, I don’t know for sure. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Very well. And just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as asthma, COPD, heart disease, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The doctor… back when I was younger… he said something about my lungs… something about working in the garage. But I don’t remember the exact name of it. It wasn’t asthma, I don't think. And no, no heart problems. At least, not that I know of. I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was in the service. But that was… a lifetime ago. I've been to doctors, of course, over the years… but I forget what they told me. My memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of possible lung condition related to occupational exposure and remote pneumonia. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… No, not really. The doctor gave me some pills for my blood pressure, a while back. But I stopped taking them. Made me feel… dizzy. And I take a little… a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. But just when it’s really bad. It’s… a cream, you rub it on. I don’t think that’s important, is it? Vitamins… no, I don’t take any vitamins. My wife used to make me, but… No, nothing regularly. Just the cream for my arthritis, when I need it. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, aside from occasional topical cream for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with food. And no, no reactions to any medications that I can recall. The doctor gave me some penicillin once, a long time ago, when I had a sore throat. But that was… well, a very long time ago. I don’t remember having any problems with it. I think I’d know if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I? I've never had any bad reactions to anything. That I remember, anyway.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and examine your throat. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you know. But I’ll try my best. Go ahead, whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Pavlovec, take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. I’m hearing some scattered wheezes bilaterally, especially in the lower lobes. No crackles or rhonchi at this time. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, approximately 88 beats per minute. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Blood pressure is 140/90. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look at your throat. Open wide, please. Mild erythema of the pharynx, but no exudates or significant tonsillar enlargement. Alright, Mr. Pavlovec. Based on my examination and your history, you have several findings suggestive of chronic bronchitis, possibly exacerbated by your occupational exposure. The wheezing on auscultation is consistent with this, and your history of a chronic cough and dyspnea supports it. However, given your age and the lack of a definitive diagnosis in the past, we'll need to do some further testing to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Chronic bronchitis… That sounds… about right, I suppose. I always figured it was something from the garage. All those fumes… and dust. Further testing, you say? What kind of testing? Is it… painful? I don’t want anything too invasive, you know. At my age… I just want to breathe a little easier, that’s all.
DOCTOR: We'll start with a chest X-ray to visualize your lungs and rule out any other underlying conditions, such as pneumonia or lung masses. It’s a very simple procedure, completely painless. You'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. We’ll also perform a spirometry test, which measures your lung function. You’ll breathe into a tube for a few minutes, and it will tell us how well your lungs are working. It requires some effort, but it's not invasive. Finally, I would like to order a complete blood count to assess your overall health and rule out any signs of infection. A simple blood draw, nothing to worry about. These tests will give us a better understanding of your condition and help us determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: X-ray… spirometry… blood draw… Sounds like a lot. Will these tests… will they take long? I don’t like being away from the house for too long. And… will they cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance, you see. I just want to know… what are the chances it’s something serious? Something… bad?
DOCTOR: The X-ray and spirometry will each take approximately 30 minutes, excluding wait times. The blood draw will be even quicker. As for cost, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact estimate without knowing the specific billing rates of the facility. However, I can direct you to the financial assistance department at the hospital, and they may be able to offer some assistance. Regarding your concern about the severity of your condition, it's impossible to say definitively without the results of these tests. Chronic bronchitis, if left untreated, can lead to worsening symptoms and increased risk of respiratory infections. However, with appropriate management, it can be effectively controlled. We’ll start with these tests, and then we can discuss your options. Do you consent to proceed with the X-ray, spirometry, and blood draw?
PATIENT: I… I guess so. I don’t see any other choice, do I? If it’s going to help me breathe easier… then yes. I consent. But… could you please try to make it as quick as possible? And… is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll write the orders for the X-ray, spirometry, and blood draw. For the X-ray, no preparation is needed. For the spirometry, please avoid smoking or using any bronchodilators for at least four hours prior to the test. As for the blood draw, you’ll need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks, except for water. The lab will contact you to schedule the tests. I’ll also have my nurse give you a list of instructions before you leave. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Fast for eight hours… no smoking… instructions… Alright. I’ll try to remember everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I hope these tests… I hope they’re not too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. My nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the instructions and answer any remaining questions. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
