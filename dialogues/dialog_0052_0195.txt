DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… alright. Honestly, it’s a bit silly, really. I just… well, I was hoping you could write me a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or maybe one with a nice encouraging saying. My daughter-in-law thinks I need… cheering up. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. But she insists.
DOCTOR: I see. While I am happy to document your visit, and can certainly write a note stating you were seen today and reported feeling well, I want to ensure we’re addressing any underlying concerns. Sometimes, a desire for reassurance, or a feeling that others are worried, can stem from something we haven’t fully explored. To that end, would you mind if I asked a few questions about how you’ve been feeling generally, even if you feel perfectly fine?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It's just my daughter-in-law. She worries too much. Always has. But… fine. Ask your questions, I suppose. But don’t expect anything interesting. I’m a very… practical woman. Not one for fussing over feelings. It’s a waste of time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Practicality is a wonderful quality. We’ll keep things concise. To start, could you tell me about any changes you have noticed in your health recently, even small ones?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well… the stairs are a bit harder than they used to be, I suppose. But who doesn’t find the stairs harder? It’s gravity, Doctor! And my hands ache sometimes, after I’ve been working on my… things. Little crafts, you know? But that’s just old age creeping in. It’s not like it’s stopping me from doing anything. Honestly, I don't see what this has to do with a card. Are you trying to tell me I’m falling apart? Because I assure you, I am perfectly capable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Ms. Micucci. I am not suggesting that at all. It's good that you're still active and engaged in your crafts. It’s quite common to experience changes with age, and we simply want to rule out anything that might be contributing to these feelings. You mentioned the stairs being harder and some aching in your hands. How long have you been noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, probably… a few months now, I’d say. Maybe six? It comes and goes, really. Some days are better than others. I don’t make a fuss about it. I just… take things slower. And I use a bit more hand cream. That helps. My daughter-in-law keeps buying me these expensive creams. Honestly, it’s a bit ridiculous. But I use them, because she gets upset if I don’t. She means well, I suppose. But sometimes, it's just… a lot. Are we getting closer to the card yet? Because I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: I understand. We are getting there, Ms. Micucci. I want to make sure we address everything properly so I can accurately document your visit. You mentioned the hand pain comes and goes. Would you describe it as a dull ache, a sharp pain, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not pain, exactly. More of a… stiffness, really. And a bit of a throbbing sometimes, if I've been working for a long time. But it goes away when I rest. Honestly, it’s nothing. I used to do much harder work, you know? Before I retired. This is nothing compared to that. I used to… well, never mind. It’s not important. Can we please just get to the card? I have errands to run, and honestly, this is all a bit… unnecessary. My daughter-in-law is going to be so pleased with herself if you actually write one. It’s a whole production, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Micucci, and I apologize if this feels unnecessary. However, even seemingly minor changes can sometimes indicate something that needs attention. It’s my responsibility to explore those possibilities. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little bit about any other symptoms you've noticed, even if they seem unrelated?
PATIENT: Unrelated? Honestly, what do you expect me to say? I get tired sometimes, Doctor. Everyone gets tired! I’m sixty years old, not a spring chicken! And… well, my memory isn't what it used to be, but who remembers things perfectly? It’s just… normal aging. I assure you, there's nothing wrong with me. This is all just… a waste of time. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit… talked down to, if I'm being honest. Are you a doctor, or a detective? Just write the card, please. And then I’d like to leave.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and I apologize if I've made you feel that way. I assure you, I am not trying to imply anything is wrong. It’s simply my job to gather information to ensure the best possible care. And I appreciate you being honest with me. You mentioned some fatigue and changes in memory. Have you noticed any difficulty with balance, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. Balance? No. I walk perfectly well, thank you very much. And vision… well, I need reading glasses, of course. Everyone does at my age. It's just… the normal things. Honestly, you're asking me about everything! You'd think I was falling apart! My daughter-in-law is going to be thrilled when she hears about this. She always says I need to see a doctor more often. She thinks I'm… fragile. Which is ridiculous! Just… can we please get to the card? I really need to leave. I have things to do. And she’ll be expecting a report. A very detailed report, I imagine. This is… quite stressful, actually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds as though this visit is causing you some stress, and I apologize for that. I want to assure you I am not trying to cause any alarm. I am simply trying to gather a complete picture of your health. Before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Now you're asking about my whole life? Really. Well… I had the flu once, a long time ago. And… I broke my wrist when I was a child. Climbing a tree, if you must know. My mother was not pleased. And… I’ve had the usual things, you know? Colds, headaches… nothing serious. I’m a very healthy person, Doctor. Always have been. I eat well, I exercise… well, I walk. I walk a lot. I don’t take any medications, and I haven’t been in the hospital for… well, ever. Honestly, you’re asking me about things that happened decades ago! Just… write the card. Please. This is getting… absurd. My daughter-in-law is going to think I’m a hypochondriac. Or worse! She’ll take me to a specialist, I just know it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Micucci, and I apologize again for the thoroughness of the questions. It’s my responsibility to gather as much information as possible, even if it seems irrelevant. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can discuss the card. Have you experienced any recent weight loss, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! Now you’re asking about my weight? This is ridiculous! I’m perfectly fine, thank you very much. I haven't lost any weight, and my appetite is perfectly normal. I eat what I want, when I want. I don't restrict myself. I enjoy my food! Honestly, you’re treating me like I’m… fragile! My daughter-in-law will be thrilled. She always says I need to eat more. She thinks I’m too thin. This is… humiliating, actually. Just write the card! Please! I have errands to run, and a life to live. And a very nosy daughter-in-law who is expecting a full report. This is getting… unbearable. Honestly, I think I’m starting to feel faint. This is all very stressful. Just… the card. Please.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I apologize for upsetting you. I am not trying to make you feel uncomfortable. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, I am not questioning your health. However, given your age and the changes you’ve described, it’s my responsibility to rule out any underlying medical concerns. I can see you are becoming increasingly distressed. Before proceeding any further, would you be comfortable if I performed a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Are you serious? After all this questioning? No! Absolutely not! I came here for a card, Doctor, not a medical interrogation! I feel perfectly fine! And I do not appreciate being treated like I’m… unwell! This is… outrageous! I’m leaving! I want my time back! And I want you to forget we ever had this conversation! This is… the last time I will ever visit a doctor! And I’m telling my daughter-in-law! She needs to know what happened here! This is… absolutely preposterous! Just… forget it! I’m leaving!
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, please, don’t leave. I understand you’re upset, and I apologize for making you feel this way. I was not trying to upset you, and I certainly don't want to cause you any further distress. I will absolutely write the card, as you requested. And I will not perform any exam without your express consent. However, I am concerned about your rising stress levels, and I would like to at least take your blood pressure to ensure it hasn’t elevated significantly. Would you be comfortable with that?
