DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, welcome! I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this…feeling. I just haven’t been feeling right. Mostly it’s my stomach, I guess. I don’t stay hungry very long, and I get sick to my stomach a lot. It's been going on for a little while now, but it seems worse lately. I... honestly, I forget exactly when it started. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A bit of stomach upset and not feeling quite yourself. "Fuzzy" is a good way to put it. Let’s try to get a little more specific, if we can. When you say "sick to your stomach," is that nausea – feeling like you might vomit – or actually vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, um… mostly just the feeling like I might. I haven’t actually thrown up very often, maybe a couple of times in the last month or so. But that queasy feeling… it’s there pretty much all the time, and it comes on quick, even after just a small bite of food. It's hard to explain. It just…stops me from wanting to eat, you know? It’s like my stomach is full when it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea is the main thing, with a couple of instances of vomiting in the last month. And it seems to happen relatively quickly after eating, even small amounts. That gives us a good starting point. Do you notice anything specific that seems to trigger it, or does it happen with all types of food?
PATIENT: That's a good question. You know, I think it happens with most things. I tried having just a little bit of toast yesterday, and even that didn’t sit well. I used to love my cornbread, but I haven’t been able to keep it down. Honestly, everything just smells…off, sometimes. It’s hard to describe. Not bad, exactly, just…stronger than it used to be. It makes me not want to eat, even things I normally enjoy. I just...don't feel hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not easily tied to a specific food, and smells are bothering you, contributing to a lack of appetite. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like any weight loss, changes in your bowel movements, bloating, heartburn, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. I have lost a little weight, I reckon. My clothes are a bit looser than they used to be, but I haven’t really been weighing myself. And… yes, I feel tired a lot. More tired than usual. It's hard to say what’s usual anymore, to be honest. I sleep a lot, but I still feel worn out when I wake up. Bowel movements… I haven't really paid much attention, if I’m honest. Everything is a bit of a blur these days. I just feel… weak, sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Raymonde. Thank you for sharing all of that. Weight loss and fatigue alongside the nausea and loss of appetite are definitely things we need to investigate. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh my… let me see. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some medicine for it, and it seemed to help. I don’t think I’ve got anything else… I had my gallbladder out years and years ago, but that’s all I can really remember. I've had the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, but nothing serious. I… I'm afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. My daughter used to keep track of everything for me, but… she moved away. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Raymonde. It’s perfectly understandable. High blood pressure with medication is good to know, and the gallbladder removal is noted. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… that’s a tricky one. It’s a little white pill… I take it every morning. I think… I think it starts with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I honestly can’t remember. I just have my routine, you know? I take it with my breakfast. I get the pills from the pharmacy, and they always know what I need. I just… I don't pay attention to the names. I’m sorry. I feel so foolish not being able to remember something so simple.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Raymonde, don't worry about it at all. We can look it up in your records, or I can check with the pharmacy. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but I didn't seem to have a reaction beyond a little swelling. Nothing major. I eat all sorts of things. I... I really can't think of anything I'm allergic to. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard, I suppose. Though, my skin is a bit sensitive these days. But that's probably just from getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your general health. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit. And I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in… well, it’s been decades. Not since my husband passed, really. And I certainly don't do any of those things. Just a simple life, Doctor. I spend most of my time with my animals, or in the garden. A quiet life.
DOCTOR: That's lovely, Raymonde. Thank you for being so open with me. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My stomach has been bothering me anyway, so maybe you can figure out what’s going on. Just let me know if anything hurts. I...I'm a bit nervous, if I’m honest. It's just all a bit overwhelming. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Raymonde, just relax. I’ll be gentle. Okay, just a little bit of tenderness here on the right side. Nothing too concerning. Your reflexes are normal. I'm going to order some blood work, just to get a better picture of what's going on. It will check your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any infections or deficiencies. I also want to order a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Blood work and a…stool sample. Well, it's not very pleasant, but if it helps, then I'm happy to do it. Will the blood work tell you what's wrong with my stomach? It's just...the nausea is so constant. And I'm so tired all the time. I just want to feel like myself again. What kind of abnormalities are you looking for in the stool? I apologize for all the questions. I'm just a bit worried, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Raymonde. It's good you're speaking up about your concerns. The blood work can give us clues about your stomach, particularly looking at your liver function tests – sometimes nausea and fatigue can be related to liver issues, even if mild. We also want to rule out anemia, which can cause fatigue. As for the stool sample, we’re looking for things like blood, infections, or parasites that could be causing your symptoms. It's a routine test, and it will help us narrow down the possibilities. Based on what you’ve told me, and the tenderness I felt in your abdomen, I’m also considering the possibility of gallbladder issues, even though you had it removed years ago. Sometimes complications can arise. I’m going to write you a referral for an ultrasound of your abdomen, just to get a clearer picture. We'll look at your liver, gallbladder area, and pancreas. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Ultrasound, blood work, stool sample… I appreciate you taking everything so seriously. It's just a lot to take in, but knowing you're looking into everything makes me feel a bit better. Gallbladder issues again… I never would have thought of that. Years after having it removed… it's surprising. When will I get the results? And will someone call me to schedule the ultrasound, or do I need to do that myself? I apologize again for all the questions. I just… I don't want to forget anything.
DOCTOR: You’re not bothering me at all, Raymonde. It’s my job to answer your questions, and I’m happy to do so. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. The receptionist will call you within a day or two to schedule the ultrasound – you won't need to do it yourself. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for it, usually involving fasting for a few hours beforehand. In the meantime, if your nausea gets significantly worse, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice any changes in your bowel movements – like blood in your stool – please call the office immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. I'm also going to prescribe you a medication to help with the nausea. It’s called Metoclopramide, and it will help empty your stomach faster. It’s a low dose, and it usually has minimal side effects. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Metoclopramide for the nausea… that’s good to hear. It’s nice to have something to help in the meantime. I’ll write down everything you’ve said – the lab results timeline, the receptionist calling about the ultrasound, and to call if things get worse. I… I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Roseburrough. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I feel a little less worried now, knowing we have a plan. I really appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. I'm glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. The receptionist will be in touch soon to schedule your tests. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you again once we have the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
