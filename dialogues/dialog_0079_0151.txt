DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, Teretha Uzarski. It’s this… tingling. It started a few weeks ago, in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s not painful, exactly, just… weird. Like pins and needles, you know? It comes and goes. I just want to know what it is, if it’s something serious. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles, you say. And it’s primarily in your hands and feet. How long precisely has this been going on, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four weeks ago? It was just a little bit at first, I didn’t even pay much attention to it. Thought I was just sitting funny or something. But it's been happening more lately, and that's why I figured I should come in. It’s hard to say exactly when it started, you know how it is when you get older… things just sort of… happen.
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. “Sort of happen.” And has it been consistent, this tingling?
PATIENT: No, not really consistent. Some days it’s barely noticeable, just a little… buzz. Other days it’s more… prominent. Like this morning, when I was making my coffee, my fingers felt really numb. It comes and goes, like I said. And it seems to be worse in the evenings, maybe? I’m not sure. It’s hard to keep track. I walk a lot for my job, you know, delivering the mail. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Delivering the mail, yes. A physically demanding occupation. And do you notice anything that relieves the tingling, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Oh, well… sometimes if I shake my hands a little, it feels a bit better. Just for a minute, though. And if I sit down and rest, it doesn’t go away completely, but it’s not as bad. Honestly, just trying to ignore it usually works best. But it’s been bothering me more and more, so I thought I should get it checked out. I don’t want it to be something serious, like… nerve damage or something. Is that what it could be?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Ms. Uzarski. Let’s proceed with a basic neurological exam, shall we?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Oh. Okay. What does that involve? I hope it’s not too… complicated. I’m not very good with tests. And, um… will it take long? I have a route to finish today, you know. People are expecting their mail.
DOCTOR: It's quite straightforward, Ms. Uzarski. I'll be checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. It shouldn't take more than fifteen or twenty minutes. If it proves necessary, we can discuss further investigations. Now, if you'll just extend your arms, palms up, please. We'll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fifteen minutes, that’s… alright. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. And, um… will it hurt? I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t, Ms. Uzarski. Just relax. Now, a little tap here… and here. Good. And now, can you squeeze my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that tight enough? I try to keep my hands strong for carrying all the mail, you know. It gets heavy sometimes, especially around the holidays. Oh, and I do have a little arthritis in my hands, the doctor told me a few years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's fine. Arthritis is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. Now, can you close your eyes for me, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed. Don't poke me, though! I’m a bit jumpy when I can't see. What are you going to do now?
DOCTOR: I'm testing your sensation. Tell me when you feel this. Just say "yes" when you feel the touch. And now, this foot... yes?
PATIENT: Yes! Oh, that tickles. Is something wrong? It felt… a little numb, actually. Not a strong feeling. Does that mean something bad? I'm a little worried now, Doctor. I really don't want to have to stop working. I need the money.
DOCTOR: A diminished sensation, you say. We'll need to investigate this further, Ms. Uzarski. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying deficiencies or conditions. And, given your symptoms and the diminished sensation, I'm going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It's unlikely to be anything immediately catastrophic, but it's best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh. A neurologist? Blood work? That sounds… serious. How long will it take to get the results? And will I have to go to a different office? I really don’t like going to a lot of different places. And… how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance, you know. I just want to know what’s going on, and I’m scared it’s going to be something I can’t afford to fix. .
DOCTOR: The blood work is routine, Ms. Uzarski. We'll send you to the lab down the hall, and it should be back within a few days. As for the neurologist, yes, you would need to go to a separate office. I can provide you with a list of specialists who accept patients with limited financial resources. I understand your concerns about the cost, and my office will assist you in exploring available options. However, without a definitive diagnosis, it's difficult to provide an accurate estimate. We will start with the bloodwork and the neurology referral, and proceed from there. I'll have my assistant schedule the appointments for you now.
