DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Uzarski, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Teretha Uzarski. And please, call me Teretha. It’s a bit formal with the “Mrs.”, you know? I just want to get this sorted out, if we can. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Teretha, then. Very well. And what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my hands. They’ve been…tingling. Like pins and needles, mostly in my fingers. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not all the time, but enough to bother me when I’m sorting mail. It makes it hard to feel properly, you know? Especially small envelopes.
DOCTOR: Sorting mail…right. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe four, five weeks now? It comes and goes. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and other days… well, other days it feels like my hands aren’t my own. I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. Just hoping it’d go away on its own. I'm a mail carrier, you know, always on the go. Don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: A mail carrier. And has this interfered with your ability to perform your duties at all?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. It's getting harder to separate the letters quickly, you know? I drop things more often. Small things, mostly. And I worry about missing things, important things. I don’t want to mess up anyone’s mail. It’s a responsibility. And holding onto the bundles is getting tougher too, especially when it's cold. It feels… weaker, my grip.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any pain with this…weakness and tingling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, no. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like a buzzing, sometimes. And a bit of ache, maybe, when I’ve been holding things for a long time. It’s not a sharp pain, thankfully. Just… annoying. And worrying, to be honest. I need my hands for my job, you know? I don’t have a lot of options if I can’t do that.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed this tingling anywhere else – your arms, perhaps, or your legs?
PATIENT: No, just my hands, thankfully. It hasn’t gone up my arms or anything. It's mostly in the fingers and the palms. I get a little bit of stiffness in my wrists sometimes, especially in the mornings, but that's been happening for years, you know? Just old age, I suppose. This tingling is new though. And it's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: And any past medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was… maybe fifty? And high blood pressure, but it's managed with… well, with pills. I take them every day. That's about it, really. Nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy, you know? Until this hand thing started. And I don't have insurance, so I try to avoid doctors as much as possible, if I'm being honest. It adds up quickly.
DOCTOR: What medications exactly are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It's a little white pill. Um… I believe it's called… Lisinopril? Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, I think. I've been on it for…oh, goodness, must be ten years now? The doctor at the clinic prescribed it. It keeps the pressure down, mostly. I check it myself sometimes, and it's usually okay. Though I haven't checked it in a few weeks, to be honest. Busy with the mail, you know.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I can take most things, usually. Just don't like taking pills if I don't have to, you know? Especially with no insurance. It adds up quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a look at your hands. Please extend your arms, palms up. I’m going to check your reflexes and strength.
PATIENT: Okay. There we go. Be gentle, please. They’re how I earn my living, you know? I try to take care of them. Still, sorting mail is hard on them.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… within normal limits, though slightly diminished. Grip strength is…slightly weaker than expected for your age and occupation. I'm noting some mild thenar atrophy—that’s a thinning of the muscle at the base of your thumb. Now, squeeze my fingers as hard as you can.
PATIENT: Is that enough? It feels… harder than it used to. Like I don't have much power in there anymore. And my thumb does feel… flatter, now that you mention it. I hadn’t really noticed, to be honest. Too busy, you know? But it's worrying me now that you say that. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It’s… something we need to investigate further. It could be carpal tunnel syndrome, though your symptoms don’t perfectly align. It’s also possible it’s a mild form of neuropathy, or something else entirely. I'm going to order some nerve conduction studies and electromyography—NCV/EMG—to assess your nerve function. That will give us a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Nerve…what? And electro… something? Sounds complicated. And expensive. Will that tell us what's wrong? And can it be fixed? Because I need my hands, you know? I can't just not work. Will I need surgery? Honestly, I don't even know what any of that means. Can you just tell me plainly what's happening?
DOCTOR: It's a test to see how well the nerves in your hands are working. The "electro" part just refers to the electrical impulses we use to measure it. It's not invasive, just a bit uncomfortable. As for whether it can be fixed… it depends on the cause. Carpal tunnel, for example, can often be treated with a brace or, in more severe cases, surgery. However, we need the test results first. I'm also going to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. I realize this is a lot, and I understand your concerns about the cost. Unfortunately, without knowing the cause, it's difficult to provide a definitive treatment plan. Here are the requisitions for the blood work and the nerve conduction study. You'll need to schedule an appointment with the radiology department for the latter. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Radiology department… another appointment… more costs… So, you’re saying you don’t know what’s wrong yet? And I have to go through all this… just to find out what’s wrong? Will my insurance cover any of it? I don't even have insurance, so I’ll have to pay out of pocket… That’s going to be expensive. And how long will it take to get the results? I can’t be off work for long. I have bills to pay, you know? Is there anything else I can do in the meantime? Like, a brace or something? Or maybe a different kind of pill? Just something to help with the tingling? Because it's getting worse, and I can barely hold a cup of coffee anymore.
DOCTOR: A brace might provide some temporary relief, yes. I can write you a prescription for a wrist splint to use at night. It won't fix the underlying problem, but it might help with the discomfort. As for a pill… there isn’t a medication that specifically targets nerve tingling without knowing the cause. You're right to be concerned about the costs, and I understand your situation. Unfortunately, I can't guarantee insurance coverage. You'll need to contact the radiology department and the lab directly to inquire about their payment options. Here is the prescription for the wrist splint. The nerve conduction study and blood work are the most important steps right now. Once we have those results, we can formulate a proper treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. More appointments, more costs, and no answers yet. Fine. I’ll schedule the appointments. But if this takes too long, or if it’s going to cost a fortune, I don’t know what I’ll do. I have to keep working. I just… I just hope it's not something serious. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all? And… thank you. For trying, I mean. It's just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if your symptoms worsen significantly—severe pain, weakness, or loss of sensation—seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, follow up with me once you have the test results. Have a good day. .
