DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Fazzina. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I’ve been having some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. It's not painful, exactly, just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, uncomfortable… I understand. And how long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started, I believe, around the middle of June. So, about six weeks, give or take a few days. I remember noticing it after a particularly long road trip with my husband.
DOCTOR: Six weeks… Okay. And can you describe the pressure a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a constant feeling, like I need to go to the bathroom, even when I’ve just been. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…fullness, and a bit of urgency, if that makes sense. It doesn’t come and go, it’s just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant fullness and urgency… and has this impacted your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it has, actually. I find myself going to the bathroom much more frequently, just in case. It’s a bit disruptive, especially when we’re out running errands or trying to enjoy an outing. I also sometimes have trouble concentrating at work because I'm constantly aware of it. It’s not debilitating, but it's definitely a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to clarify, you said it started after a long road trip… were there any changes to your routine on that trip?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me see… We did stop at a lot of different rest areas, and I believe I was drinking more water than usual, trying to stay hydrated. And perhaps I wasn't emptying my bladder completely each time, because we were trying to make good time. I don’t know if that could be related. We also listened to a true crime podcast the entire drive, which might not be relevant, but it was very captivating!
DOCTOR: Okay, increased water intake and potentially not fully emptying… right. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: That I have! Now that you mention it, I have noticed it’s a bit cloudier than usual, and the color seems a bit darker sometimes, even when I'm drinking plenty of water. And… this is a little embarrassing, but there’s sometimes a slight odor. I assumed it was just from the water I was drinking.
DOCTOR: Okay, cloudier urine, darker color, and a slight odor… Alright. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower back or abdomen?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever, no chills, and no pain anywhere. Just the bladder pressure and the changes in my urine. I have felt a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the stress of work.
DOCTOR: Okay. And regarding your medical history… do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, I'm generally healthy. I do have Medicare, and I see a primary care physician regularly for check-ups. I had my last physical in February, and everything was normal then.
DOCTOR: Alright, well-controlled hypertension… Good. And are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril for my blood pressure, 10 milligrams daily. And I take a multivitamin, but that's it. I don't take any over-the-counter medications regularly, unless I have a headache, then I’ll take ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication or food. I can eat anything, thankfully! My husband jokes that I have an iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week, but I don’t drink heavily. And no, I do not use any recreational drugs. My husband and I prefer a quiet evening at home to going out.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, finally, have you been sexually active recently, and if so, have you noticed any pain or discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, I am married and we are sexually active. And no, I have not noticed any pain or discharge. Everything feels normal in that regard. It's just this bladder pressure that's concerning me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for answering all those questions, Marialena. That gives me a good starting point. Based on what you’ve described - the constant bladder pressure, increased frequency, cloudy urine, and the fact that it started after a long road trip - it sounds like you might be experiencing a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, to be sure, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A urine test and an exam seem like a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best to figure out what's going on. I’m glad we’re getting closer to an answer.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. Let’s start with a quick abdominal exam, just to feel for any tenderness. Then we'll collect a urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could lie back on the exam table, please. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any pain or tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, tell me if you feel any discomfort here… or here…
PATIENT: Okay. That’s…a little tender right here, Doctor. It's not sharp pain, just…sensitive. It feels a bit like a dull ache when you press on it. Everything else feels normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of tenderness in the lower left quadrant… Good. Nothing overly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Everything sounds normal there. Alright. Now, we just need a urine sample for testing. I’ll give you a cup, and I’ll leave you some privacy. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if you can. There are instructions on the table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A midstream sample… I remember those instructions from before. I’ll do my best to follow them. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll let you know when I’m finished.
DOCTOR: I’ll be right outside when you’re ready. Take your time.
