DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get right to it. It’s my stomach. Food keeps…coming back up. Not a pretty sight, I’ll tell ya. And it burns. Really burns. It’s been happening for…well, a while now. I figured it was just something I ate, but it keeps happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds quite unpleasant. “Coming back up” – you mean vomiting?
PATIENT: Vomiting? Is that what you call it these days? Yeah, alright, vomiting. Sometimes it’s a big mess, sometimes just a little. Doesn't matter, it's still awful. And the heartburn... it feels like fire. Honestly, I don’t understand why young doctors need to ask so many questions about everything. It’s pretty straightforward.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem tedious, Mr. Altine. It’s important for me to understand all the details to provide you with the best care. Even what seems "straightforward" can have different causes, and I want to be sure we get to the root of the problem. Let's start with how long this has been going on. You said "a while now," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics. Fine. Let me think… probably six, maybe eight months now? It comes and goes. Worse after I eat, naturally. I eat a good Polish dinner – pierogi, kielbasa, the works – and then… well, you know. It’s just… inconvenient. And painful. Look, is this going to take long? My wife made a roast, and I don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight months of intermittent vomiting and heartburn, worse after eating a larger meal like a Polish dinner. That’s helpful. And you mentioned it's painful. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It burns. Like someone poured acid in my chest. It starts low, right here , and sometimes it goes all the way up to my throat. It’s not a sharp pain, it’s just… a really uncomfortable, awful burning. And it gets worse when I lie down. Honestly, I've had it for so long I just take antacids now. They help a little, but not always. I don't see why this needs so much detail, though. It’s clearly heartburn, maybe some indigestion.
DOCTOR: You're right to mention the antacids. Do they specify which kind, and how many do you usually take in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual stuff. Tums, Rolaids, whatever’s on sale at the store. I don’t keep track, really. A couple here, a couple there, whenever it acts up. Sometimes four or five if it’s a bad night. Look, I'm a practical man. I deal with problems, I don’t catalogue them. I’m not a scientist. Is there a pill you can just give me to make it stop?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a long time and trying to manage it on your own. However, because you've been taking antacids frequently for several months, and the symptoms haven't fully resolved, I need to gather a bit more information to determine the best course of action. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the vomiting and heartburn?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think... sometimes I cough a bit, especially at night. Like something’s stuck in my throat. And I get a little hoarse after…well, after it comes back up. Is that what you mean? Besides that, no. I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age, despite all this. Honestly, I think it's just a sensitive stomach. My father had the same thing. Maybe it’s hereditary.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coughing, especially at night, and hoarseness after vomiting. That’s helpful. And you mentioned your father had something similar. Do you know what his diagnosis was, if he had one?
PATIENT: He just… had heartburn. A lot of it. He smoked too much, probably. Always a cigarette dangling from his lip. He just took a lot of those pink antacids too. He lived to be 85, so it didn't kill him. Look, I’m starting to feel a little dizzy. Is this examination room air-conditioned? It's awfully cold in here. And frankly, I've told you everything I know. Can we just get to the point?
DOCTOR: I apologize if the room is too cold, Mr. Altine. I’ll adjust the temperature. And I understand your frustration. I assure you, I'm trying to gather enough information to provide the best possible care. Before we proceed, I'd like to quickly review your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Look, I’m a pretty straightforward guy. I’m tall, I’m thin, I eat good food, and I have heartburn. What more do you need to know? I don’t have any of those fancy ailments. High blood pressure? Diabetes? Never. Heart problems? I walk a mile every day! Honestly, I think you're trying to find something that isn’t there. I just need something for the heartburn. And maybe something to stop the… regurgitation. Is that what you call it? Can we please just focus on that? I have a roast waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other medical conditions. And you walk a mile every day, that’s excellent. To clarify, you’ve been experiencing intermittent vomiting and heartburn for six to eight months, worse after large meals. You’ve been taking over-the-counter antacids with limited relief, and you also experience coughing and hoarseness after vomiting. Given the duration of your symptoms and the frequency of antacid use, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and palpate your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don't poke too hard. I have a sensitive stomach, remember? Look, is it possible you could just prescribe something strong? I’m a practical man, I know what I need. And this whole examination is just delaying my roast. Honestly, young doctors… always with the poking and prodding. My wife is going to be furious if I miss dinner.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Altine, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. Okay. Your heart is beating a bit faster than usual, and I hear a little wheezing in your lungs. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, especially in the upper area. I'm going to recommend some blood work to rule out any other causes, and I will order an endoscopy to investigate the lining of your esophagus and stomach. It's a relatively simple procedure, but it's important to get a clear picture of what’s going on. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor, which is a stronger medication to reduce stomach acid. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Endoscopy? What is that? Sounds… invasive. And blood work? I haven’t had blood work since I was 20! Look, I thought you were going to give me a pill! A simple pill! This sounds complicated and expensive. Honestly, I don’t trust all these fancy tests. My father never had any tests, and he lived to be 85! Is there anything else I can do? Another pill, maybe? A stronger antacid? I'm not so sure about this… whole plan. And frankly, I don’t have time for all this. My roast… it's getting cold. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Altine. It sounds like you're very concerned about undergoing tests. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining and check for any abnormalities. It’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms. Given your reluctance and concerns about undergoing an endoscopy right now, we can try a trial of a higher dose of a proton pump inhibitor for four weeks. If your symptoms do not improve significantly within that timeframe, I strongly recommend reconsidering the endoscopy. We can also discuss a referral to a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. To be clear, without further investigation, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms. It could be a simple case of acid reflux, but it could also be something more serious, such as a hiatal hernia, gastritis, or even, rarely, esophageal cancer. Here is a prescription for pantoprazole, which is a stronger medication to reduce stomach acid. Take one pill daily, 30 minutes before a meal, for four weeks. If your symptoms persist or worsen, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss further testing. Do you have any questions about the medication or the follow-up plan?
