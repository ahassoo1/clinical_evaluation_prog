DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. Rowbottom. Arbie Rowbottom. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But… well, I noticed something in the, uh, the toilet. Blood. Streaked through it. Not a good sign, is it? Though I’ve seen worse in my time, flying all over the world, you understand. Still… it was there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you for letting me know. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate. You mentioned you’ve traveled extensively… how long ago was your last trip, and where did you go?
PATIENT: Investigate? Goodness. Always with the fancy words. Last trip… let me see. It was… oh, must have been… 2022, I think. Maybe 2023. Went to visit my daughter in Australia. Sydney, it was. Hot place. Full of… people. And I ate things I shouldn’t have, I expect. Didn't sit right with me, some of it. But that was a while back now. What’s that got to do with anything? It's happening now, not two years ago!
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Rowbottom. The timing is important. I just want to get a full picture. And yes, things eaten while traveling can sometimes cause problems that surface later. Now, can you describe the blood you’re seeing?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint a picture? It's… red, naturally. Streaks of it, mixed in with… well, you know. Not a huge amount, mind you. Not like I'm losing a pint every time I go to the bathroom. More like… lines. And it hasn't happened every time, just a couple of times this week. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Old age catching up with me, likely. Everything falls apart eventually.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and it's good you're bringing this to my attention. While it might be something minor, we do need to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort when you have a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… pressure, maybe. But I've had worse. Flying for forty years, you get used to all sorts of discomfort. Sitting in that seat for twelve hours straight… now that’s pain. And I'm not a young man anymore, things ache. Doesn’t mean something’s wrong. Look, I’m a practical man, Dr. Glazewski. What are you going to do about it? Are you going to poke and prod? Because I’m not keen on either.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom. We don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. However, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, a physical exam would be helpful. Specifically, a rectal exam allows me to check for any abnormalities. It’s a quick procedure, and I’ll explain every step as I go. We could also consider a stool test to check for any hidden blood or infection. Would you be open to either of those options?
PATIENT: Hidden blood? Now you're just making things sound worse. Look, I’m not a fan of any of this. Poke and prod, tests… honestly. It sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. Is it absolutely necessary? Can't you just… give me something for it? Some pills, perhaps? Or tell me to drink more water? I’ve always been told water is good for everything. Look, I’ve survived this long without doctors, I'm sure I can manage another few weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I want to respect your wishes. However, blood in the stool can sometimes be a sign of more serious conditions, such as polyps or even cancer. While it's likely nothing to worry about, it’s important to rule those possibilities out. I wouldn't recommend simply treating symptoms without knowing the cause. Drinking more water is always a good idea, but it won’t address the underlying issue. Perhaps we could start with the stool test?
PATIENT: Cancer?! Now you're just trying to scare me. Honestly, Dr. Glazewski, I came here because I saw some blood, not because I’m dying. And you’re immediately jumping to cancer? That's ridiculous. Fine. A test. A test I can handle. As long as you don't start poking and prodding. But if it’s going to take forever, I'm walking out. I've got things to do, you know. Time is precious when you're my age. Tell me what I need to do with this… test. And make it quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. A stool test it is. I'll have the nurse bring you a collection kit and instructions. It's a fairly simple process - you'll just need to collect a small sample and bring it back to the lab within a few days. The lab results usually take about a week to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the stool test?
PATIENT: A week? A whole week? Honestly. Seems like a long time to wait just for a… a sample. Fine. A week it is. And no, I don’t have any questions. It’s a sample, you take it, you test it, you tell me the results. Simple. Just… make sure the nurse explains it clearly. I don't want to mess it up. And please, tell her to be quick about it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll make a note of that. I'll have the nurse come in as soon as possible. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No. That’s all. Just the test. And hopefully, it’s nothing. Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of blood… Still. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. Alright, then. You go ahead. And tell the nurse to hurry.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll let the nurse know to come in right away. Thank you for coming in today, and we’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results.
PATIENT: .
