DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been these little spells, you see. Confusion, they call it. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. Says I’m repeating myself, forgetting what I was doing mid-sentence. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good your wife is looking out for you, and it's always best to get these things checked out, just to be sure. These “spells” – can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. It’s more… a blank spot. Like a word on the tip of my tongue, but I can’t quite grab it. Or I'll start doing something – fixing a shelf, for example – and then… I look up and I can't remember why I was fixing the shelf in the first place. It doesn't happen all the time, mind you. Just… pops up now and then. It’s frustrating, more than anything. I’ve always had a good memory for details, you know? Tile work… you have to remember everything.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's more of a momentary lapse in recall, rather than a complete disorientation?
PATIENT: Exactly! Disorientation… that’s a strong word. I’m not lost. It’s just… a flicker. A pause. Like the radio losing signal for a second. Then it comes back, usually. And honestly, sometimes I just don't bother trying to remember. What’s the point? It’ll come to me later, or it won’t. But my wife… she says it’s getting worse. She worries about me driving, mostly. Which is ridiculous. I’ve been driving for fifty years without a scratch.
DOCTOR: It's understandable your wife is concerned, especially with driving. Even momentary lapses can be worrying. Fifty years is a long time, and a good record, absolutely. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly when these episodes started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. It started… maybe six months ago? No, no, probably closer to a year. It was subtle at first. Just little things. Misplacing my tools more often. Forgetting names of people I’ve met… once or twice. But it’s been more frequent lately, I suppose. Perhaps every few weeks it happens now. Sometimes more than that. It’s difficult to keep track, truthfully. I don’t go around marking down every time I forget something. Do people do that? That sounds… silly.
DOCTOR: No, people don't usually mark it down, Mr. Lason. It’s perfectly normal not to keep track. Six months to a year... okay. And has anything changed around the time these episodes started?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… let’s see. Old Man Hem, he passed away last winter. We used to play dominoes every Tuesday. That was a bit of a blow, I suppose. But other than that… not really. I retired a few years back, that’s true. But I keep busy. I do small jobs around the neighborhood, fix things for people. Keeps me active, you know? My wife has been trying to get me to slow down, but I like to keep my hands busy. Sitting around doing nothing is a quick way to… well, you know. Disappear.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing a friend is certainly a big change, and staying active is good. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmmm. Well, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. My wife keeps telling me I need to eat more. But truthfully, I just don’t feel as hungry. And I’ve been sleeping… less. Wake up a couple of times during the night, can’t get back to sleep. But I wouldn’t say it's a big deal. Old age, you know? Things start to… slow down. Everything slows down. It’s just the way it is. Not like when I was young, building houses all day. That took energy. Now… I mostly just do little repairs. A leaky faucet. A loose tile. Nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Lason. That's helpful. Now, I’d like to ask you about any medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, there’s my blood pressure. High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take pills for it. A little orange one, every morning. And my knees, they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, she said. Old work injury. Nothing serious, really. Just aches and pains. And… oh, I had that cataract surgery a couple of years back, in my left eye. They fixed it right up, though. Vision’s fine now. Except maybe a little blurry at night. But that’s probably just old age. I'm on Medicare, if that helps. They keep track of everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does keep good records. Thank you. I see your hypertension is well-controlled, and the cataract surgery was successful. Just to confirm, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that, too. "Any allergies, Colt?" she says. And I always tell her, "No, I eat everything. Except maybe snails. I never liked snails." But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… a preference. She worries about me taking new pills, she does. "What if you’re allergic?" she says. But I’ve never had a problem. Never. I’m a pretty sturdy fellow, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. And no, a preference for snails doesn’t count as an allergy. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not regularly, no. But sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take that ibuprofen. The over-the-counter kind. The blue one. It helps a little. But I try not to take it too much. Doctor told me it wasn't good for my stomach. And… oh, sometimes I take that antacid. When I eat something spicy. My wife makes a really good curry, but it gives me heartburn sometimes. But that’s it, really. Just the ibuprofen and the antacid. When I need them. Not every day, mind you. Just… occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and antacids as needed. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don’t mind. I’ve had plenty of physical exams in my life. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My knees are a bit sensitive, as you know. And maybe don't shine that little light in my eyes for too long. It bothers me a bit, even after the surgery. But other than that, go ahead. What are you looking for, exactly? Just curious.
DOCTOR: Just a routine check, Mr. Lason. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears, eyes, and throat. And I will be gentle with your knees, I promise. I'm mainly looking for any signs that might help us understand what's going on with these memory lapses, and to rule out anything else that might be contributing. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Blood pressure… always blood pressure. My wife is always checking it, too. Says I worry too much. I’ll tell you what, Doctor, if my blood pressure is high, don’t blame me. Blame the dominoes. I miss playing dominoes with Old Man Hem. That was a good game. A very good game.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92, but not drastically so. It’s understandable it fluctuates a bit with stress. Okay, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. And finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and eyes. Your ears look clear, and your eyes are… well, you mentioned some blurriness at night. I see some mild cataracts developing in your other eye, but nothing too concerning at this stage. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't so bad. A little poking and prodding, but nothing I haven't felt before. So, what do you think, Doctor? What’s wrong with me? Is it my brain? Are you going to tell me I have that… what’s it called… Alzheimer’s? My wife’s been reading about it. She scares me sometimes, she does. Always talking about what could be. I just want to know what’s going on. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it's understandable you're worried, and it's good you’re getting it checked out. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, I don’t believe it’s Alzheimer’s at this stage. The symptoms you're describing – the momentary lapses in memory, the confusion – could be due to a number of things. Your slightly elevated blood pressure is one possibility. High blood pressure can affect cognitive function. Also, the changes in sleep and appetite, along with the loss of your friend, can all contribute to a feeling of mental fogginess. However, to be thorough, I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a cognitive assessment – a series of simple questions to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It’s a standard test, and it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… that’s not so bad. I’ve had those before. And a cognitive assessment… simple questions, you say? I can handle simple questions. I’m a pretty sharp fellow, even if my memory isn't what it used to be. But what if it is something serious, Doctor? What if it’s… worse than you think? My wife will be devastated. She worries about everything. She’s a good woman, but… she panics easily.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, it’s completely understandable to feel anxious, and it’s good you’re thinking about your wife. The most likely scenarios are things that are manageable. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood tests and cognitive assessment will give us information, and then we can discuss the best course of action. If it turns out to be something more serious, we'll address it together. There are resources available to support both you and your wife, and we'll make sure you have the information and care you need. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. I'll write you a requisition for the blood work, and the nurse will schedule you for the cognitive assessment. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. It’s nothing to be worried about. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests… it is what it is. Thirty to forty-five minutes, you say? I suppose I can manage that. And you’re sure it’s nothing to worry about? Just simple questions? Okay. And my wife… will she have to come with me for the assessment? She tends to… overthink things. She asks too many questions, and then she gets upset if the answers aren't what she wants to hear.
DOCTOR: You don't need to bring your wife with you to the cognitive assessment. It's best if you do it on your own, so we can get the most accurate results. She’s welcome to come to any follow-up appointments to discuss the results with me, of course. The assessment is designed to evaluate your thinking skills, and having someone else present might make you feel more self-conscious. I’ll also give you a handout explaining what to expect during the assessment, and what the results mean. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little anxious, but it’s really just a series of simple questions and tasks. We'll take our time, and I’ll be there to guide you through it. Now, let me write you that requisition for the blood work.
PATIENT: Alright. No, you’re right. She'd probably just worry me more. Best if I do it alone. And that handout… that’s good. I like knowing what to expect. Makes me feel a little more in control, you know? Alright, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can get back to fixing things. I've got a leaky faucet down the street that needs my attention. Can't have people going without water, now can we?
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Mr. Lason. And you’re right, people can’t go without water. The nurse will come in shortly to schedule the cognitive assessment and draw your blood. In the meantime, if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out together. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for not telling me I’ve got that… that Alzheimer’s. My wife would be devastated. Alright. I’ll see you when the nurse comes in.
DOCTOR: .
