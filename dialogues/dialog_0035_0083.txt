DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kammer. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Well, it's a little…silly, maybe. But my daughter, she thinks I need a…a card. A “get well” card, she said. From you. I feel fine, you understand. Perfectly fine. But she worries too much. She says it's good for the… the spirits, to have a doctor's note, or a card. Is this something you do, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A “get well” card… I understand your daughter is concerned. While it’s not a typical part of my practice, I certainly want to address why she feels you need one. Sometimes, a perceived need like this can point to something we should investigate. To clarify, are you experiencing any symptoms at all – anything different than usual, even something small?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no symptoms. I told you, I feel…regular. Like always. Maybe a little tired, but who isn’t? I work hard, you know. Boilers don't run themselves. She just… she wants me to feel better, I guess. She says it’s for… reassurance. Honestly, I think she just likes the cards. She collects them. It’s a waste of perfectly good paper, if you ask me. But I don’t want to upset her. So, can you just…write something on a card? It would make her happy.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. While I don’t typically provide notes simply for reassurance, I’m happy to document a brief wellness check to ease your daughter’s concerns. However, just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of your health. It’s important to rule out anything underlying, even if you feel "regular." Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Normal. Weight… well, I haven’t been on the scales in a while. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. But that’s probably just the heat. It’s been awful hot this summer, doesn’t make you want to eat much. And the wife… my ex-wife, she always said I ate too much anyway. Are we getting anywhere with this card, Doctor? It shouldn’t be this complicated.
DOCTOR: It’s not about complicating things, Mr. Kammer, it’s about ensuring we address all possibilities. A slight weight loss, even if you attribute it to the heat, is worth noting. And it’s good you mentioned that. Now, have you had any trouble with sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? Well, I’m not a young man anymore, Doctor. Sleep doesn't come easy. But I sleep. Enough to get by. I wake up, I go to work, I come home. It's…a routine. My daughter, she worries if I’m not getting eight hours. Eight hours! Who has time for that? Look, is this card a problem? If it’s going to take all day, I have things to do. Boilers, you know. They need attention.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, it shouldn't be taking all day. I’m simply trying to gather a little more information so I can provide the best care for you, and address your daughter’s concerns. Let's talk about your energy levels. Have you noticed any unusual fatigue, or weakness?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Weakness? I told you, I work with boilers! It’s a hard job. It’s supposed to be tiring. I’m not running marathons here, Doctor. I feel…my age. A little stiff in the mornings, maybe. But that’s just getting old. You get aches and pains. Is this card going to happen or what? I'm starting to think my daughter sent me on a wild goose chase just to bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Aches and pains are common, certainly. And I understand your frustration. Let’s quickly review your medical history then. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor Ramirez, he put me on something for that. Little white pills, I take them every morning. Been on them for…oh, I don’t know, maybe five years now? Keeps it under control, he says. Other than that… no. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of a working man. Still, this is all about a card, isn’t it? A little piece of paper. It's getting ridiculous. Can we just get it over with? My daughter is going to think I'm ignoring her.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I see Dr. Ramirez has you on medication for hypertension. That's good to know. And I understand your frustration. To be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, just the pills for the blood pressure. Nothing else. I don't believe in all that vitamin stuff. Waste of money, if you ask me. Look, I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor, but this is…a lot for a simple card. Is it possible to just…write “Patient is doing well. Acknowledging concerns. Signed, Dr. Alzoubi?” Would that work? It's what my daughter wants, isn't it? Just a little reassurance.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I want to assure you I am listening to your concerns. However, simply writing a note stating you're "doing well" without a basic assessment isn't responsible medical practice. It wouldn't address any potential underlying issues, and it wouldn’t fulfill my duty as your physician. Before I write anything, could you tell me about any family history of significant illness?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, Lord. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. Lots of doctors, lots of hospitals. My father… he worked in the sugar cane fields. Hard life, lots of aches and pains. My sister… she has arthritis, bad hands. That's about all I remember. Honestly, Doctor, we weren’t a family that talked much about illnesses. Just… dealt with them. Is this really necessary for a card? I’m starting to feel like I’m in an interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand. It feels like a lot, I agree. But gathering this information helps me understand your overall health risk. One last question, and then we can proceed. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father, he smoked a little. Rough cough he had. But me? No. Clean living, mostly. Boilers don't mix well with smoking, you know. Too much dust and fumes already. Look, Doctor, are we finally getting somewhere with this card? My daughter is going to kill me if I come home empty-handed. Just write something, anything that says I'm okay. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I’ve documented a wellness check, noting your report of feeling well despite a slightly decreased appetite and family history of heart disease and arthritis. I’ve also noted you do not smoke. Here you go. I’ve included a brief statement about maintaining your current healthy lifestyle and encouraging regular check-ups with your primary care physician. While this addresses your daughter’s concerns, I strongly recommend we schedule a full physical exam in the next few months to proactively monitor your blood pressure and overall health. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
