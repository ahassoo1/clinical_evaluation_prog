DOCTOR: Hi Chelise, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the clinic, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. That’s why I’m here. I don’t really understand what that means, exactly, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a good reason to come in. A letter from the clinic is always a good prompt. High cholesterol… right. It's good you're getting it checked out proactively. To help me understand things better, could you tell me if you've ever been told about high cholesterol before, or is this the first time?
PATIENT: No, this is the first time. Never had anyone mention it before. I usually feel pretty good, honestly. I eat… well, I try to eat okay. Not a lot of fast food, mostly. And I walk a good bit, when the weather is nice. But high cholesterol… it’s new to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, first time hearing about it. That’s helpful to know. “Feel pretty good” is good! And walking is excellent. When you say “try to eat okay,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. I like my vegetables, usually have a salad with dinner. I eat chicken and fish a few times a week. I do enjoy my cheese, though. And sometimes… a little bit of steak. Not every week, but sometimes. And I like a cookie with my coffee in the morning. Is that too much? I don’t know what foods are bad for cholesterol, exactly.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful. It gives me a much better picture. And no, that’s not “too much” necessarily, but some foods definitely have more of an impact on cholesterol than others. We can talk about that later. Let’s back up a little bit. Besides this cholesterol letter, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. My joints ache a little sometimes, but that’s just getting old, I think! And I get tired, but who doesn’t? I wouldn’t say anything wrong, exactly. That's why I was surprised about the cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new symptoms. Joint ache and tiredness… those are common, and you're right, it doesn't sound like they're directly related to the cholesterol at this point. Alright, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I had the usual childhood things – chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. I broke my arm once when I was little, but that healed fine. And I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was all. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, if you can believe it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, a broken arm, and gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That's good to know. And yes, that does sound pretty healthy overall. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take pretty much any medicine without a problem. I used to get stung by bees when I was a kid, but I haven't been stung in years, and I didn't have a bad reaction then, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's great. And you said you haven't had any trouble with medications in the past?
PATIENT: No trouble at all. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. Been on that for maybe five years now. Otherwise, just the occasional pain reliever if I have a headache. But no allergic reactions or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication for five years, and occasional pain relievers. What’s the name of the blood pressure medication, if you remember?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s a little white pill. Oh! I think it's… Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, I believe. I’ve been taking it every morning for years. It keeps things pretty steady.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Good. And you’ve been stable on that?
PATIENT: Yes, very stable. My doctor checks it every six months or so, and it's always good. No problems at all. I don't even think about it anymore, honestly. It just… works.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! It’s good when things just work. Alright, let's move on to family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any heart problems, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And my mother had diabetes, but she got it pretty late in life, too. I have one brother, and he’s perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And no one else… I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ medical history. They didn’t talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with a heart attack and mother with late-onset diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Alright, and finally, a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My husband smoked, but he passed away a few years ago now. I always hated it. And I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. I try to stay pretty active, walking and gardening when I can. And I live alone, in a little house in town.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, very limited alcohol, and you stay active. Gardening is excellent! And I’m sorry to hear about your husband. Alright, that gives me a pretty good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I don’t mind at all. I always get nervous about the blood pressure cuff, though. It always feels so tight! But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be gentle with the blood pressure cuff, I promise. It needs to be snug, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 82, pulse is 72. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I don't feel any enlarged organs. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Now, given your family history and the letter from the clinic, I think it would be wise to run some blood tests to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels and overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood tests are fine. I don’t really like needles, but I understand it’s important. What kind of tests are you thinking? And will I have to fast beforehand? I always forget those things.
DOCTOR: I understand about the needles, it’s not fun for anyone. We’ll just need a standard lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels – that includes your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 9-12 hours beforehand. No food or drink except for water. It’s important for accurate results. I can give you a slip with instructions. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Nine to twelve hours… okay. That’s a long time. I usually have coffee in the morning… so no coffee? Even black coffee? And what exactly is LDL and HDL? I keep hearing those terms, but I don’t know what they mean.
DOCTOR: No, unfortunately no coffee during the fast, not even black coffee. Sorry about that! It can be tough, but it’s important to get an accurate reading. And that’s a great question about LDL and HDL! Think of cholesterol as needing to be carried around in your blood. LDL, or "Low-Density Lipoprotein," is sometimes called "bad" cholesterol. It can build up in your arteries and cause problems. HDL, or "High-Density Lipoprotein," is considered "good" cholesterol, because it helps remove LDL from your arteries. We want to see a lower LDL number and a higher HDL number. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… so LDL is bad, and HDL is good. Like… the good guys and the bad guys. I can remember that. And the test will tell me how much of each I have? And then you can tell me what to do about it? If it’s… bad?
DOCTOR: Exactly! LDL is the bad guy, HDL is the good guy. And yes, the test will tell us your levels. Then we can discuss what they mean and, if needed, talk about ways to improve them. This might include diet changes, exercise, or, in some cases, medication. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll see what the tests say first. Here’s the lab slip with the instructions. You can go to any lab that accepts your Medicare insurance. And I’ll give you a call with the results as soon as they come back, usually within a few days. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you not making me feel silly for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chelise. It’s my job to answer your questions, and I’m happy to help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if anything comes up before your results come back. And remember, taking care of your health is a team effort. Have a good day, and I’ll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Okay, you too. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski.
