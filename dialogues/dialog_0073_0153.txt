DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh… right. Well, it’s about… a checkup, I think? For… something to do with acting. They said I needed to be cleared for a performance. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. It's all happening so fast these days.
DOCTOR: Acting, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Small parts, mostly. Ushering, sometimes ticket taking… lobby work. You know, around the theater. It's… been a while since I’ve done much on stage, though. But they need me to get checked out before I… well, before I do anything, I suppose. It’s a requirement.
DOCTOR: A performance physical. Right. And what specifically are you concerned about, Mr. Krahn?
PATIENT: Concerned? Oh, goodness. Not much, I don't think. Just… old age creeping up, I suppose. My memory isn’t what it used to be, and I get tired easily. But that’s just… being my age, isn’t it? I don't really have any specific complaints, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Being your age can contribute to those things, certainly. But it’s still important to rule out any underlying causes. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Let me think. Oh, goodness, it’s been so long… I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago. But it wasn’t too bad, and I think it mostly went away on its own. And… maybe some arthritis in my hands? It aches sometimes, but it’s nothing I’ve ever really bothered a doctor about. Honestly, I can't recall much beyond that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, maybe? But that was… a very long time ago. Nothing significant in recent years, certainly. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one. My wife… my ex-wife, she always kept track of those things. I’m afraid I wasn’t very good at remembering. My parents… they both lived to a good age, I think. But I don’t know about any specific illnesses or conditions they had. Heart trouble, maybe? It’s all very hazy, I’m afraid. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s common for details to be forgotten over time. Let’s move on to your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my… aches and pains, sometimes. Ibuprofen, I think it is. When they get really bad. And… sometimes a little something for sleep. Just when I have trouble getting to rest, you understand? Nothing regular, though. And allergies… I don't think I have any. I haven't had any reactions to anything in years.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not anymore. I used to enjoy a little… a little glass of wine with dinner, back in the day. But that was a long time ago. And I never touched anything else. Never had the taste for it, you see. I try to keep myself healthy, as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. That sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Anything to get this over with, honestly. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, getting poked and prodded at my age. But if it’s necessary, I suppose I can handle it.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you could just have a seat here. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Not particularly concerning, but worth noting. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are normal. Throat is clear, no visible inflammation. Pulse is regular but slightly weak. Alright, Mr. Krahn, everything seems reasonably stable, but we need to investigate that elevated blood pressure and the murmur further. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. A lot of tests. Is something wrong, Doctor? You make it sound… serious.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Krahn. It’s just… standard procedure when we find something a little unusual. The elevated blood pressure could be due to a number of things – stress, diet, even just a temporary fluctuation. The murmur is also common, and often harmless, but we need to rule out any underlying heart condition. The tests will give us a clearer picture. It’s better to be cautious, you see. And we need to be sure you're healthy enough to safely participate in any physical activity, however light.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Cautious. Yes, that makes sense. It’s just… all this poking and prodding and testing… it’s a bit much for an old man, you know? But if it's necessary... alright. When do I need to do these tests, Doctor? And where?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They can draw your blood right away. The EKG technician is in room 205, and they should be able to fit you in this afternoon. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available. It should all be completed within a few hours. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A few hours... alright. No, I don't think so. Just… down the hall. And they’ll tell me what to do? I’m not very good with directions, you see. And I don't want to get lost.
DOCTOR: Here. This has the directions and the names of the technicians you’ll be seeing. If you have any trouble, just ask the nurse at the front desk; she’ll be happy to help. We’ll discuss the results as soon as I have them. And in the meantime, try to relax, Mr. Krahn. You can go ahead and get those tests done.
PATIENT: Right. Relax. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I should… get going then. It’s been… a long morning.
