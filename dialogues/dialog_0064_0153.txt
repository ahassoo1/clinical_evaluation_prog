DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Smetak, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s about… a clearance, I think? For… something to do with performing. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. They just sent me over here. Something about making sure I’m… fit enough? I mostly just show people to their seats, you know. At the theatre.
DOCTOR: Right, a clearance… for performing duties at the theatre. And you said you mostly usher people to their seats?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And sometimes sell tickets. It’s… not strenuous work, Doctor. Mostly standing, I suppose. For… hours at a time. Though, I haven’t been doing it that much lately. Things have been… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, mostly standing for extended periods. And you mentioned things have been quieter recently. Has anything changed recently that prompted this clearance?
PATIENT: Changed… hmm. Not really… not that I recall. I think… the new manager wanted to be thorough? She’s very organized, that one. Always checking things. Paperwork, mostly. I just… filled out the forms they gave me, and they sent me here. Honestly, I'm not sure what they're looking for. I feel fine, generally. A little tired, maybe. But who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. We just want to get a good understanding of your overall health. A little tiredness at your age is common, yes, but we want to rule out anything else that might be causing it. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems – in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. That’s… a long time ago, Doctor. I think… I had something with my blood pressure, years and years ago. But it wasn’t serious, I don’t think. They gave me some pills, I took them for a while, and then… I stopped. Honestly, I can’t really remember the details. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know? I’ve never been told I have anything with my heart. And no diabetes, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I think… when I was a young man, I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago, in… I think it was China. And… no, I don't recall any other hospital stays. Nothing serious, anyway. Just the appendix, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Nothing at the moment, Doctor. Like I said, I stopped taking those pills… years ago. I haven’t really needed anything since then. Just… a little something for aches and pains now and then, over the counter. But nothing regular. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of, Doctor. I've never really had any reactions to anything. Not food, not medicine… nothing. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. Though, my skin can get a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any serious medical conditions – like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult, Doctor. I haven’t been in contact with my family for a very long time. Not since… well, a very long time ago. I think… my mother had something with her heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. And my father… I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t have much information about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. We can move on. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. I always thought it was a terrible habit. My wife… she used to smoke, but I convinced her to quit. Years ago now. It’s a good thing, you know? A very good thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to drink a little, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner now and then. But not anymore. Not for many years. I just… don’t have much of an appetite for it these days. It just… doesn’t appeal to me anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, can you tell me a little bit about your daily activity level?
PATIENT: Daily activity… Well, Doctor, it's not much, I'm afraid. I mostly just… walk to the theatre and back. And stand for a few hours while I'm working. I try to take the stairs when I can, but sometimes… they're just too many. I used to be much more active, but things have slowed down a bit these days. It’s hard to keep up, you know? At my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you could. I have… things to do later. But go ahead. I’ll do my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krahn. I’ll be as quick as possible. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little faint. I also hear some mild crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. Nothing too concerning at this point, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Just relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 88. And your pulse is 78, which is normal. Let me check your reflexes now. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present.
PATIENT: Diminished? Is that… bad, Doctor? I don’t remember anything being diminished before. I just want to make sure I'm fit enough to keep doing my job, you know? Standing and showing people to their seats. It’s not much, but… it keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Not necessarily bad, Mr. Krahn. It's common for reflexes to diminish with age. We just need to rule out any underlying causes. Now, let's just take a quick look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also normal. Finally, let’s just check your feet for any swelling or numbness. Some mild swelling in your ankles, but sensation is intact. Alright, Mr. Krahn. That completes the quick physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that was… quick. So, what does it all mean, Doctor? Am I… fit enough?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which we'll want to monitor. The mild crackling in your lungs could indicate some congestion, and the diminished reflexes and swelling in your ankles could be related to reduced circulation. I wouldn’t say you’re unfit to continue your job, but it’s important to get this checked out further. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. A complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. These will help us rule out any underlying conditions. We should also do an EKG, to check your heart’s electrical activity. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. More things. I really just wanted to know if I was okay to keep going to work. I don't like hospitals or tests. Are they… expensive, Doctor? I don't have much money. And I don’t have insurance, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. Tests can be stressful, and I appreciate you being upfront about your financial situation. The cost of these tests can vary, but I can help you explore some options. There are some community clinics that offer reduced rates, and we can also look into any financial assistance programs that might be available. I wouldn't recommend proceeding without these tests, as it's important to have a clear understanding of your overall health. In the meantime, I can offer some general advice. Try to reduce your salt intake, and get regular, gentle exercise. And if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please seek medical attention immediately. Would you like me to provide you with a list of the community clinics and financial assistance programs?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful, Doctor. Anything to make things a little easier. Salt… and exercise. I suppose I can try. It’s just… everything feels so complicated these days. And thank you for understanding about the money. It's a worry, you know? A big worry.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand. Let me pull up some information for you. Here you go. This list includes contact information and details about their services. I’ll also write you a referral for the tests, and include a note about your financial concerns. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. And remember, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very kind, and very patient with me. Thank you. I’ll try to get these tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll remember to watch out for those symptoms. I think… I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Krahn. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once you’ve had the tests done, to discuss the results. Have a good day, and stay safe.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Good bye. .
