DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me in? My wife… she want… baby. We old now, you know? Maybe need… help. I forget things easy, so… maybe you help us figure out if okay?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife would like to have a baby, and you’re wondering if that’s a possibility given your ages, and you’re also concerned about some memory issues. That’s perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me a little more about how long you and your wife have been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying… hmm. Not long, I think. Maybe… six months? Seven? Time… goes fast. We not… worry much yet, but she… she get sad sometimes. I want to make her happy. We been married long time, you know? Very long. I forget how long exactly… but a good long time.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Carlotta. And it's very thoughtful of you to want to support your wife. Six to seven months is a reasonable amount of time to try, and it's good you're addressing this now. To give you the best advice, I'd like to ask a few more questions. First, has your wife seen a doctor about trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She see doctor… lady doctor. Very nice lady. She do… tests. I forget what tests… blood tests maybe? She say… everything look okay with her. That’s why she want me to come. She think maybe problem with me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know she’s already been evaluated, and that the tests came back normal. It’s helpful that she’s taken those initial steps. Now, focusing on you, Mr. Carlotta, you mentioned some forgetfulness. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Forgetfulness… it come slow. Not sudden. Just… things not stick like before. Names… sometimes I forget names. Where I put my tools… that’s bad. I make little models, you know? Metal and plastic. Need my tools. Wife help me find them lots. It worry her. She say I should see doctor… for my brain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've noticed a gradual change in your memory, and it's understandably concerning to both you and your wife. It's good you're taking this seriously. To get a better understanding, could you describe how this forgetfulness is affecting your daily life, besides misplacing tools?
PATIENT: Hmm… affect life… let me think. Sometimes… I start a model, and forget what I was doing. Have to start over. And… appointments. I forget appointments. Wife write them down for me. And… sometimes I go to the shop, and forget what I need. It’s small things, mostly. But… it’s getting more. And I worry… I worry I forget important things. Things about my wife.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Carlotta. Those are significant changes, and it's natural to worry when you notice memory lapses affecting your daily activities. It's good that you're aware of these changes and that your wife is helping you. To help me get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical history… let me see. Doctor say I have… little bit of pressure. High pressure, maybe? Take pills for it. Small white pills. And… I had some trouble with my… water works, a long time ago. Prostate, I think they called it. They fixed it with… something. Not surgery. Pills again, maybe? I forget! Old man problems, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is quite common, and it's good you're being treated for it. And prostate issues are also common as men get older. We’ll be sure to review your current medications. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think hard. I had… my teeth fixed, many times. Small things. Not big surgery. And… I think I had something on my… skin? They cut it off. Small cut. On my arm. Long time ago. Nothing big. No… I don’t think I had any big surgeries. Just teeth and the… skin thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s hard. My family… far away. Somalia. Didn’t see them much. My mother… she died young. I think… sickness. But I don’t know what sickness. My father… he lived long time. Strong man. But… he got old. Forgetful, maybe? I don’t remember. My brother… he healthy, I think. We not see each other much anymore. Sorry… I not very good with family history.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's not always easy to have detailed information about family history, especially if family members are far away. We'll work with what we have. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never smoke. Bad for you, you know? My wife… she not like smoke. Alcohol… I drink little bit. Sometimes. With dinner. Red wine, maybe. Not every day. Just… special occasions. Nothing much.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I’d like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, besides the white pills for your blood pressure. Do you take anything else, even over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… medications… let me see. The white pills, yes. And… sometimes I take something for my… joints. They hurt, you know? Old age. Small yellow pill. And… sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take something. Blue pill. But not every night. Just when I really can’t sleep. That’s all I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, before we move on, I’d like to ask about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My wife… she careful. She checks. But I not remember any allergies. I get… itchy sometimes. But that’s just the sun, you know? Somalia… very hot sun. Not allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do. You the doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Just relax for me. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions and do a few quick tests to check your memory and reflexes. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… year… let me think. Is it… 2023? No… 2024? Oh… I forget! My wife… she always knows. Is it August already? Time… goes so fast.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Carlotta. It’s easy to lose track of time. It is currently August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words…? Hmm. Okay… you say the words.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Carlotta, listen carefully. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Now, I’m going to ask you to do something else for a moment, and then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words. Can you count backwards from 100, subtracting 7 each time?
PATIENT: Counting backwards… by seven…? Hmm. That’s… difficult. 100… 93? No… 92? I’m not good at numbers, doctor. Never was. My wife… she does the numbers.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's a challenging task for many people. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… the three words… Let me think. Apple… something with wood… and a small coin? Oh… I forget! I really am bad with remembering things. I’m sorry, doctor.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Carlotta. Don't apologize. This is all very helpful information. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. That completes the brief physical exam. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of the exam, it appears you are experiencing some cognitive changes, including difficulties with memory and concentration. The challenges with recall, serial subtraction, and even recalling the current year are concerning. Given your age, it's important to investigate these changes further. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or infections. I also recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation and, potentially, a brain imaging scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a clearer picture of what's happening. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Tests… and scans…? Hmm. Sounds… serious. But if you think it’s best, doctor, then yes. I want to know what’s happening. I want to… stay with my wife as long as I can. Do what you think is best.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your concerns, and we’ll proceed carefully and methodically. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests and referral to a neurologist. The neurologist will determine if a brain scan is necessary. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to engage in activities that you enjoy and staying socially active. It’s also important to maintain a healthy diet and get regular exercise, as this can help to support cognitive function. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions…? Hmm. Will these tests… will they find something bad? Something… that will take me away?
DOCTOR: That’s a very understandable concern, Mr. Carlotta. It’s difficult to say definitively what the tests will reveal. The goal of these tests isn’t necessarily to find something "bad," but rather to understand why you’re experiencing these changes and to determine the best course of action. Many conditions can cause memory problems, and some are treatable or manageable. Even if we were to identify a more serious condition, there are often things we can do to help you maintain your quality of life and stay with your wife for as long as possible. It's important to remember that we'll be with you every step of the way. We’ll discuss the results of the tests thoroughly and develop a plan that’s tailored to your individual needs. I know this is a lot to take in. Do you have anyone who you would like to be with when you receive the test results?
PATIENT: My wife, always. She… she needs to know. She does everything for me. She… she's very strong. Yes. With my wife.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. We'll make sure your wife is included in all discussions and decisions. Alright. I’m going to print out the lab orders and the referral to the neurologist. You can take these to the lab and the neurologist’s office. The lab will schedule an appointment for your blood tests, and the neurologist’s office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Here are the orders. If you have any difficulty scheduling appointments, please don't hesitate to call the clinic, and our staff will be happy to assist you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, or anything else I can help you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, doctor. You been very kind. And… patient. I forget things easy, so… if I call again with the same questions… please don’t get mad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’m happy to help. And absolutely not. Please don't hesitate to call with any questions, no matter how many times you've asked them. That’s what I’m here for. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and ensure you and your wife receive the best possible care. Take care, Mr. Carlotta. And please give your wife my best.
