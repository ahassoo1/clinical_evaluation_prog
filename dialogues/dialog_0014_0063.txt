DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor Osterholm. Nice to meet you too. It’s my back. It’s been really hurting. Bad. I… well, you probably see it on the paper, but it’s been a long time now. It just gets worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you've been experiencing back pain for… quite a while. "Long time" is a bit vague, unfortunately. Could you tell me when it started, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… before my divorce, for sure. That was… April of last year, 2024. So… before April 2024. Maybe… November 2023? Around then. It wasn’t so bad at first, just a little ache. Now… now it’s really something else. It wakes me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, November 2023... So about nine months now. And it’s progressively worsened. You mentioned it wakes you up at night. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It's… hard to say. It's not like a sharp pain, not always. Sometimes it's a burning feeling, deep down. Other times it just feels… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my back. And it goes down my leg sometimes, the right one. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. A burning sensation and heaviness, radiating down your right leg. Not to the foot, you said. Okay. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's mostly there. Like… a background ache all the time. But then it gets worse if I move the wrong way. Or if I stand for too long. And like I said, at night it’s really bad. Really, really bad. It's hard to get comfortable. It feels like it just won’t stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what have you done about it so far?
PATIENT: Well… I tried some over-the-counter pain pills. You know, the ones you get at the store? They didn't really help much, not for long anyway. Then… I saw my regular doctor, Dr. Singh. He… he gave me some stronger pills. Those helped a little bit, but… I ran out. And he sent me to a specialist, but I couldn’t afford all the visits. That was a few months ago. That’s why I’m here now, I guess. I just… I don't know what else to do. And, um… the paper probably says this, but I do have cancer. It’s… in my lung. But Dr. Singh said this back pain is… different.
DOCTOR: Different, yes. While it's… commendable you're managing your other condition, it’s crucial we address each issue separately. You're right to seek care for this back pain. And, frankly, a more thorough assessment is needed. I see here you've had imaging done previously... Let's start there. Do you recall when you had the imaging, and what type it was?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. Dr. Singh ordered it. That was… January, I think. January 2025. It was… a scan. Like, I laid on a table and a big machine went over me. I think it was a… CAT scan? Or maybe an MRI? I’m not good with remembering those things. He showed me the pictures, but I didn't really understand them. He said something about… a spot on my spine? But he didn't say if it was causing the pain. He just said we needed to keep an eye on it. I have a copy of the report somewhere, I think.
DOCTOR: "A spot on the spine." Right. Let's see if I can pull up those images… Yes, here we are. Okay. The report does indicate some degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, with a small area of concern. It's… not conclusive. We need to determine if this is related to your pain, or something else entirely. Now, I’m going to perform a physical examination to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that’s good. Please. Anything to figure out what’s wrong. And, um… can you explain what “degenerative changes” means? Just… in plain English? Because Dr. Singh… he used a lot of words I didn’t understand. I just want to know if it's serious.
DOCTOR: "Degenerative changes"... basically, it means wear and tear. Your spine, like any part of your body, gets older. The discs between your vertebrae can break down over time, causing pain and stiffness. It's… common, especially as we age. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, but it can be a source of discomfort. Now, let's get started with the exam. Please lie down on the examination table, on your back. I’m going to feel around your spine, and check your range of motion. Tell me if anything hurts.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… a little hard to get comfortable. I’m a bit stiff today. Go ahead. Tell me if you want me to move my leg or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as you can. Now, can you point to where the pain is the worst?
PATIENT: Right here. It’s not always this spot, but it hurts the most right now. Sometimes it feels like it’s deeper, you know? Like it’s inside. And it goes down my leg when I move a certain way. Ow! That’s… that’s tender.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about this?
PATIENT: Ow! That’s… I can’t really go much further. It hurts too much. It’s really tight. And when I bend back… it’s the same thing. Just… a lot of pain. I’m sorry. I’m not very flexible.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s sufficient for now. As expected, you have limited range of motion, and significant tenderness in the lumbar region, particularly on the right side. Now, let's check your reflexes and strength in your legs... Just relax your leg and let it dangle. Now, try to push your foot against my hand.
PATIENT: It’s… a little weak. It feels harder than it should. And my right leg feels… kind of numb sometimes. Not all the time, but… it tingles. Like pins and needles. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are… diminished on the right side. And, as you mentioned, some weakness. The numbness and tingling are concerning. Based on my examination, and reviewing your imaging report, it appears you may have some nerve compression in your lower spine. However, given your underlying condition, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some additional blood work, and an MRI of your lumbar spine. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on, and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing all this pain. And… is it serious? Is it the cancer? Because if it is… what can we do? I'm just… worried.
DOCTOR: We can't determine if it's related to your cancer at this time. It could be, but it's also very possible this is a separate issue. The MRI will help us differentiate. And I assure you, we will address whatever is causing your pain. As for treatment options, it's too early to say. It depends on the findings of the MRI. I'll order the blood work and MRI now. The lab technician will draw some blood before you leave. The MRI can be scheduled at the imaging center across town. The receptionist will give you the contact information. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I… I don’t think so. Just… when will I get the results? And… can someone explain them to me? Because I always get confused with… medical talk. I just… I need to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI will take a bit longer – approximately 3-5 business days. I will review the results personally and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you in detail. I understand your concerns about medical terminology. I will do my best to explain everything in plain English. And if you’d like, you are welcome to bring a family member or friend to the appointment for support. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think that's… everything. Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen. And… for explaining everything. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. The lab is just down the hall. The receptionist will direct you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
