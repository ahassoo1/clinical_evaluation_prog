DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Piet. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise – a little getaway, you see – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. Just a standard thing, I believe, but I thought it best to get it sorted with a proper doctor.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-travel health assessment. Perfectly sensible. And you’re hoping I can just fill out the necessary forms for you, confirming you’re fit to travel?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. They sent me a form, but it asks about…well, all sorts of things, and I thought it would be better if a doctor completed it. It’s mostly just confirming I don’t have any serious conditions that would be a problem on a ship, you understand. Nothing fancy, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very common. To get started, let’s go through some general questions. It helps me understand your overall health picture. First, can you tell me a little about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, but that was decades ago and caused no trouble since. And I get a bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly in the mornings. It’s not severe, just a bit stiff and achy. Oh, and my late husband always said I had a weak constitution for colds, but I wouldn’t call that a condition, really. Just…prone to sniffles. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal many years ago, morning stiffness in your hands consistent with arthritis, and a tendency towards colds. We'll certainly note that. When you say 'morning stiffness,' can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not debilitating, not at all. But when I wake up, my fingers feel quite stiff and achey. It takes a good hour or so for them to loosen up and feel normal again. A cup of tea and a bit of moving about usually helps. It's worse in the colder months, naturally. It doesn't swell or anything, just…stiff. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. So, morning stiffness lasting about an hour, improving with activity and warmth. No swelling. And have you ever been formally diagnosed with arthritis by a doctor, or is that something you’ve self-diagnosed based on the symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I haven’t been formally diagnosed, no. I just mentioned it to my previous doctor a few times, and she said it was likely just a bit of wear and tear, nothing to worry about. She never sent me for any special tests or anything. Just advised keeping warm and taking over-the-counter pain relief if needed. I’ve managed fine with that, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so self-reported arthritis, advised as likely wear and tear by a previous doctor, managed with over-the-counter remedies. Good to know. Now, thinking about your medical history more broadly, have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than your appendix removal?
PATIENT: Let me see…no, I don't believe so. Nothing major, certainly. I had a nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but I just stayed in bed and rested. No need for a hospital visit, thankfully. And I broke my wrist as a child, climbing a tree, but that was treated at the doctor’s office and healed up just fine. Nothing serious enough to require hospitalization, no. I’m generally quite healthy, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hospitalizations other than the appendix removal. Broken wrist as a child, otherwise generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, and I take a multivitamin every morning. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. And I do enjoy a cup of herbal tea, if that counts, but it’s just for the flavour, you understand. Nothing medicinal about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional ibuprofen and a daily multivitamin. That's good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. My late husband was terribly allergic to shellfish, but I have no such problems myself. I've never had a rash, or difficulty breathing, or anything like that. I'm quite fortunate, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No known allergies is very helpful. Now, just to finish up this part of the assessment, could you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That's a bit tricky. My father had high blood pressure, I believe, and my mother…well, she lived a long life, but she wasn't one for talking about ailments. I know my grandfather on my father's side had something with his heart, but I don't recall the specifics. It was a long time ago, and nobody really discussed these things openly, you understand. Is it important to know all the details? I don't want to be misleading if I can't recall correctly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It's perfectly fine if you don't have detailed information. Knowing about high blood pressure in your father and a heart condition in your grandfather is helpful. We can note that. So, high blood pressure in your father, and a heart condition in your paternal grandfather. And are you a smoker?
PATIENT: No, never. My late husband smoked for a time, but I always detested it. I wouldn’t allow it in the house, and eventually, he gave it up. So, no, I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I’m rather proud of that, you see. I always believed fresh air and a good walk were far more beneficial.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small glass of sherry with my Christmas dinner, and perhaps a little glass of wine with a special meal. Nothing regular, nothing excessive, you understand. I’m not much of a drinker, really. A cup of tea is far more to my liking.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I just want to ask about your weight. Have you noticed any recent weight changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I've always been a fairly slender build, you see. I maintain a reasonable diet, nothing extravagant, and I enjoy a good walk most days. I might have put on a pound or two over the winter, but nothing drastic. My clothes still fit perfectly, so I haven't paid it much attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight. Good. Now, I’d just like to quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly sensible. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I've always believed in being thorough when it comes to one's health, you see. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me…and exhale…very good. Now, I’m listening to your heart. Everything sounds regular. Lungs are clear as well. And I’ll just take your blood pressure now. Blood pressure is a little on the lower side of normal, but nothing concerning given your usual activity level. Do you experience dizziness when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I've never had any trouble with dizziness. I stand up perfectly fine, no wobbling or anything like that. Perhaps it's all the walking, keeps the circulation going, you see. I always try to stay active, it's important, you know. It's good to hear everything sounds alright, though. I do appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. Everything sounds good so far. Now, just one more quick thing: could you bend forward and touch your toes, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I'm not quite as flexible as I used to be, you see. But I'll try my best. There. Not quite as graceful as I once was, but it doesn't cause any pain, thankfully. Just a bit of stiffness in my lower back, naturally. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. No pain is good. Just a bit of limited flexibility, which is common with age. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, you appear to be in good overall health. I'm happy to fill out the cruise line’s health form for you, confirming that you have no significant medical conditions that would prevent you from travelling. Are there any specific concerns the cruise line highlighted that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful news, Doctor! Thank you so much. Let me see… They specifically asked about mobility issues, and anything that might require special assistance on board. I believe that’s why they asked about the form, you see. Just making sure I can manage stairs and getting around the ship. I can manage stairs, though a bit slowly, and I don't require a wheelchair or anything like that. I just wanted a doctor to confirm I'm fit enough to travel, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'll make a note that you can manage stairs, though at a slower pace. Based on our conversation and the exam, I can confirm you are fit for travel with no significant medical limitations. Here you go. It’s all signed and dated. Hopefully, this will be all the cruise line requires. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, that's perfect, Doctor. Thank you so very much. You've been most helpful. No, I don't think I have any further questions. You’ve addressed all my concerns, and I feel much more confident now. I appreciate your thoroughness and your kind manner. It's lovely to meet a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. Enjoy your cruise! And if anything changes before you travel, or if you experience any new symptoms, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a wonderful time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I shall certainly do that. Goodbye, and thank you once again.
