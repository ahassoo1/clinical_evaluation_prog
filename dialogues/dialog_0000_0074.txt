DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Steines, good morning. I'm Dr. Batara. You're looking… remarkably tall for your age. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, I get that a lot. Folks always comment on my height. It's just how I was made, I reckon. I'm here 'cause my blood pressure's been actin' up. Been feelin' kinda lightheaded sometimes, and my daughter, bless her heart, she keeps tellin' me I need to get it checked. She worries somethin' fierce.
DOCTOR: Lightheaded, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, not all the time, mind you. More when I stand up too quick, or if I’ve been bakin’ in the kitchen for a while. It doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. But it’s enough to make me nervous. And my head feels…full, sometimes. Like there's too much in there, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. “Full” is a good way to put it. And how long has this been going on, this lightheadedness and the… fullness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been… a few months now, I suppose. Maybe since spring started? It comes and goes, so I didn’t pay it much mind at first. Thought it was just gettin’ old, you know? But it's happenin’ more often lately, and my daughter insisted I come see someone. She’s a good girl, that one. Always lookin’ out for me.
DOCTOR: Right. “A few months.” And has anything changed in those few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I've been bakin' the same as always, for the market and church socials. Still gettin' up early, same routine. Oh! Wait. Now that you mention it, I have been usin’ a bit more salt in my bakin’ lately. Folks seem to like it better, gives the pies a nice flavor. But maybe that ain't a good thing? I don't rightly know.
DOCTOR: More salt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. Just a little bit more. Old family recipe, but I started addin' a pinch extra 'cause people were sayin' they tasted better. I mostly make apple pies, pecan pies…a little bit of everything, really. And biscuits. Everybody loves my biscuits. But if the salt’s causin’ trouble, I can go back to how I was doin’ things, no problem. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take your blood pressure now, and then we'll do a quick exam. That'll give us a better idea of what's going on. Have you ever been told you had high blood pressure before today?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. I’ve been to the doctor for check-ups now and then, but they never said nothin' about my blood pressure bein' high. I usually just go in for my arthritis, you know, gettin’ old. My bones ache somethin’ fierce, but that’s just part of life, I suppose. This lightheadedness is somethin’ new though. Worryin' me a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm for me, please. We'll see what it's reading now. And after that, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Then, maybe we'll talk about a few other things, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I get nervous around medical things, always have. Not scared, exactly, just… uneasy. And please, call me Venna. Ms. Steines makes me feel ancient.
DOCTOR: Well, Venna. Your blood pressure is elevated. Quite elevated, actually. 160 over 95. That explains the lightheadedness. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Breathing seems a little labored, but not alarming. Heart sounds…regular, but a bit strong. No murmurs, thankfully.
PATIENT: Oh my. 160? That sounds…high. Is that bad, Doctor? I don’t understand numbers too well. Labored breathin'? That’s probably just from walkin’ up the hill to get here, this old body ain't what it used to be. I do get winded easier now. But strong heart? That's somethin' good, right? I've always been a strong woman, workin' hard my whole life.
DOCTOR: Yes, 160 over 95 is high, Venna. It means your heart is working too hard. And while being a "strong woman" is admirable, it doesn’t mean your heart isn't being strained. We need to get this under control, or it could lead to…complications. Now, do you take any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a one. Always been healthy as a horse, 'til lately. Just some liniment for my arthritis when it flares up. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can help it. Always figured my body knows best, and try to work with it, not against it. Is there somethin’ else I can do besides medicine? Like…change my diet, or exercise? Though walkin’ up this hill is exercise enough, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Diet and exercise are important, of course. But at your age, and with a blood pressure this high, lifestyle changes alone aren't likely to be enough. You need medication. It’s not about "working against" your body, Venna; it’s about supporting it. And frankly, you’re lucky we caught this when we did. We'll start with a low dose, see how you tolerate it. I'm prescribing Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Lisinopril…once a day. I don’t rightly know, Doctor. I never did take much to names of medicines. Will it make me feel different? Dizzy, or sleepy? And what about my bakin’? Will I have to stop usin’ salt? I don't want to disappoint folks, they love my pies. It’s more than just bakin’, it’s… a connection to my family, to my history.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril can sometimes cause dizziness, especially when you first start taking it. That’s why I’m starting you on a low dose. As for the salt…you don’t have to stop completely, but you absolutely need to reduce your intake. Significantly. It’s contributing to your high blood pressure, and it’s putting you at risk. And while I understand your…attachment to your pies, your health is far more important than pleasing a few customers. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin’. But if I cut back on the salt…will the pies still taste the same? My grandma taught me that recipe, and it's been passed down for generations. It's not just salt, it's…memories in every bite. It's hard to explain. I suppose I can try, though. For my health, and for my daughter. But please, Doctor, be patient with me. This is a lot to take in. And I'm an old woman. I set in my ways, a little bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. Here's the prescription for the Lisinopril, and this sheet explains the medication and potential side effects. It also has some dietary guidelines for reducing sodium. Start with a smaller dose, perhaps half a tablet, for a few days, and see how you feel. If you experience dizziness, lie down immediately. And please, try to follow the dietary recommendations. It's crucial. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to check your blood pressure. If it’s not under control, we may need to increase the dosage. Any questions?
PATIENT: Half a tablet… that sounds better. A little bit at a time, right? And lie down if I get dizzy. I can do that. Just... how long will I have to take this medicine, Doctor? Forever? I don't like the idea of being dependent on pills for the rest of my life. And… is there anything else I can do? Some kind of herb, or a special tea, to help lower my blood pressure naturally? My grandma always had a remedy for everything… .
DOCTOR: Most likely, yes, you will need to continue taking this medication indefinitely to manage your blood pressure. As for “herbs” and “special teas,” Venna, I strongly advise against relying on unproven remedies. They can interact with your medication and may actually be harmful. Stick to the prescribed medication and the dietary changes. And if you experience any unusual symptoms, contact my office immediately. Now, if you don’t have any other questions, I have other patients waiting.
