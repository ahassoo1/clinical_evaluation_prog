DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a little embarrassing, to be honest. I've noticed a change in how I smell... my body odor. It's not like, suddenly bad, exactly, but different. It just... doesn’t smell like me anymore, you know?
DOCTOR: Different, you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to describe. Usually, it’s just… clean. Like soap. Now, it’s a bit… sweeter? Almost… fruity? It started a couple of weeks ago, maybe three. I haven’t changed anything – same soap, same deodorant, same everything, really. It’s just… there. And it’s noticeable, I think. My daughter commented on it the other day.
DOCTOR: A sweeter, fruity odor. And your daughter has noticed it as well. That’s… noteworthy. Have you experienced any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I guess. Just the usual aches and pains from the job, you know, being on my knees all day. But nothing major. No fever, no weight loss or gain, nothing like that. Oh! Actually, now that I think about it, I have been sweating a little more, even when it’s not hot. But again, I do physical work, so that’s not completely out of the ordinary.
DOCTOR: Increased fatigue, mild aches, and slightly increased perspiration. No fever, no weight changes. And this began concurrent with the odor change. Alright. Have you noticed this odor consistently, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s pretty consistent, Doctor. Every day, pretty much. It doesn't really fade. It’s not overwhelming or anything, but I definitely notice it when I get dressed in the morning, and after I shower. It’s… always there now. It’s just… unsettling. I’ve never experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, I understand. And you're certain it's not a new lotion, detergent, or other product?
PATIENT: Positive. I haven’t changed anything in my routine for months. Same laundry detergent, same body wash, same deodorant. I double-checked just in case when I noticed it, thinking maybe I accidentally grabbed something different at the store. But no, everything’s the same. I even asked my daughter to smell my soap just to be sure! She said it smelled normal.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on to some other questions then. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years, for ear infections and such, but never anything serious. No food allergies, no reactions to bug bites… nothing. I’m pretty lucky that way, actually. I get a little sniffly during pollen season, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing else. And it’s the same one I’ve been taking for years. I have Medicare, so I'm pretty careful about what I put into my body. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. And I try to eat pretty healthy, too. Mostly just fruits and vegetables, lean protein… the usual.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination. That includes listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your lymph nodes and skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take deep breaths in and out. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck, axillae, or groin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or unusual markings. Everything appears normal, Ms. Purtee, but these odor changes are… unusual. Given your symptoms, and the fact that this hasn't responded to observation, I'm going to order some blood work. Just to rule out any underlying metabolic issues or, less likely, anything more concerning. It’s a routine panel, nothing to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Blood work sounds sensible. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? And when should I expect to hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: No specific preparation is needed; just a standard fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. The lab will provide specific instructions when you go. As for results, it usually takes 3-5 business days to come back. My office will contact you directly with the findings. It’s likely nothing serious, Ms. Purtee. These things sometimes happen. But we need to rule out anything more significant, just to be thorough. I’ll also send you a referral to a dermatologist. It’s best to have a specialist evaluate any unexplained skin or odor changes. They may want to do some further testing. Is there anything else I can address today?
PATIENT: A dermatologist, okay. That sounds… a little scary, honestly. But if you think it’s best… I guess I just hope it’s not anything too serious. No, I don't think that’s all for today, Doctor. Is there anything I should be looking for, or any changes I should report if I notice them before the results come back? Anything at all? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Preparedness is… sensible, I suppose. Report any changes in the odor – if it becomes stronger, or accompanied by any skin changes like redness, itching, or lesions. Also, report any unexplained fatigue, weight loss, fever, or night sweats. However, I must emphasize that these are unlikely scenarios. This is most likely a minor metabolic quirk, or an issue with your body's natural microbiome. Try not to fixate on worst-case scenarios, Ms. Purtee. That will only increase your anxiety. The lab order and dermatology referral will be sent electronically. My office will contact you to schedule the appointment with the dermatologist once they receive the results. Any further questions before I conclude?
PATIENT: Okay. So, watch for changes, don’t panic… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think that's everything for now. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, even if it’s probably nothing. I'll try not to worry too much. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My staff will escort you to the checkout desk. Have a good day, Ms. Purtee.
