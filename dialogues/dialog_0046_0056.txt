DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Glowka, was it? Honestly, I haven’t the foggiest idea why they sent me here. Something about… stress? Burnout? It’s all rather silly, if you ask me. I’ve been a teacher for… well, a very long time. One gets used to things. I suppose they think I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not uncommon for individuals in demanding professions, like teaching, to experience feelings of being overwhelmed, even if they’re accustomed to a high workload. It’s good that they’re taking this seriously, though. We want to make sure everything is alright. So, let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you say "they," who are we referring to – your primary care physician, perhaps?
PATIENT: My… doctor, yes. Old man Petrov. He’s been my doctor for… decades, I believe. A perfectly competent man, though a bit prone to fussing. He kept going on about my… energy levels. Said I wasn’t myself. Nonsense, I say! I’m perfectly capable. Just… tired, perhaps. It’s August, isn't it? Hot.
DOCTOR: I see. Dr. Petrov sounds like a good physician, and it’s good he’s paying attention to these changes. It's helpful that he noticed a difference in your energy levels. Could you describe what you mean by "not yourself"?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's… difficult to articulate. It’s not as if I’ve taken to composing poetry or suddenly enjoy gardening. I simply… lack the enthusiasm I once possessed. The students are… less engaging, the paperwork more tedious. It’s all rather… gray. And I find myself… irritable. Very irritable. Don't misunderstand, I haven't lost control, but it's… draining.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. A loss of enthusiasm, increased irritability, and things feeling more draining are all things we'd want to explore further. It sounds like you’re experiencing some emotional fatigue, and it’s good you’re acknowledging that. Let’s talk a little bit more about your symptoms. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over a period of time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It didn’t simply appear overnight. It’s… difficult to pinpoint, as I said. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. The last semester was particularly… challenging. A rather unruly class, a new administrative directive regarding… something about curriculum. Honestly, it’s all a blur. I simply stopped enjoying the preparation, the grading… the whole thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so, with the last semester being particularly difficult. That's helpful. It sounds like stressors at work may be contributing. Now, outside of work, have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: Sleep? Adequate, I suppose. I haven't been losing sleep, if that's what you’re asking. I’m a creature of habit, you see. Same bedtime, same wake-up time for… decades. Appetite is… normal. I don’t indulge in excessive amounts of anything, nor have I lost my taste for a good meal. As for weight… perhaps a pound or two? Nothing alarming. I assure you, I am not wasting away.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Schlatterer. No significant changes in sleep, appetite, or weight is helpful information. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now we’re getting to the unpleasant part. Let’s see… high blood pressure, yes, briefly, many years ago. Managed with… pills, I believe. A minor inconvenience, really. Otherwise… nothing of consequence. A touch of arthritis in my hands, but who doesn't have that at my age? I’ve always been a relatively healthy man. My father lived to be ninety-two, you know. Good genes, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, currently managed, and some arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. And a family history of longevity is excellent. Were you ever hospitalized for anything, or have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Yes, once. A long time ago. Appendicitis, as a young man. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… no surgeries, no. I’ve always been fortunate enough to avoid the need for such drastic measures. I believe in allowing the body to heal itself, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Schlatterer. No recent hospitalizations and no surgeries. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a small pill for my blood pressure, as I mentioned. I believe it's… Lisinopril? Yes, that’s it. And occasionally, an antacid, if I indulge in something a bit too rich. But that’s it. Nothing else. I pride myself on avoiding unnecessary pharmaceuticals. I believe in a healthy diet and… moderation.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional antacids as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I’ve always been a remarkably robust individual. A bit of a sniffle occasionally, perhaps, but nothing that warrants a trip to the apothecary. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction in my life. I suspect all this modern preoccupation with allergies is… exaggerated.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But do try to be quick about it. I have… arrangements to make this afternoon. And please, no prodding or poking unnecessarily. I assure you, I am perfectly sound. But if it must be done, I suppose I can endure a few minutes of… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a very mild murmur. It’s likely benign, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, and your balance is stable. Overall, your neurological exam is within normal limits for someone your age. Everything appears to be within normal limits for your age, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and mild murmur are worth monitoring.
PATIENT: Monitoring, you say? Good heavens. As if I haven’t been monitored enough in my eight decades on this earth. Mild murmur, diminished reflexes… it’s all perfectly natural, I assure you. I’ve always been a man of… moderation.
DOCTOR: You're right, sir, many of these findings are common with age, and I don’t want to unnecessarily alarm you. However, given your recent changes in energy and mood, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be prudent to run a few simple blood tests. These tests can help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms, such as anemia, thyroid issues, or vitamin deficiencies. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more scrutiny. Honestly, it's exhausting. But… very well. If it will appease you, and if it means I can finally put an end to this… investigation, I suppose I can endure a few vials of blood being extracted. But I expect a swift and comprehensive explanation of the results. No vague pronouncements or ambiguous jargon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I’ll ensure you receive a clear and comprehensive explanation of the results. We'll check a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin D and B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw the blood, and the results should be available within a few days. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that could help improve your energy and mood. Have you been getting regular exercise?
PATIENT: Exercise? Good heavens, no. I am a scholar, a librarian! My exercise consists of reaching for books on high shelves, and occasionally… walking to the faculty lounge. I find mental stimulation far more beneficial than… physical exertion.
DOCTOR: I understand. While intense exercise isn’t necessary, even a short daily walk could be beneficial. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet is perfectly adequate, thank you very much. I have always been a man of…moderation. I eat a balanced meal, consisting of… reasonable portions. I am not one for excessive indulgence, or… fast food. I enjoy a good steak occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner, but I assure you, I do not overdo it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It sounds like you’re maintaining a generally healthy lifestyle, which is excellent. Now, let’s talk about stress. You mentioned feeling less enthusiastic about your work. Are there any specific stressors that are contributing to this feeling?
PATIENT: Stressors? Where do I begin? The students, for one. Increasingly… entitled. They lack respect, discipline. Then there’s the administration, constantly changing policies, demanding more paperwork. And the curriculum… a never-ending revision process. Honestly, it’s a thankless job. I’ve dedicated my life to education, and now… it feels like no one appreciates it.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly frustrating, sir. It’s understandable that you’re feeling stressed and overwhelmed. Given your reported changes in mood and energy, coupled with the stressors you've described, and pending the results of your blood tests, I think it would be beneficial to explore some strategies to manage your stress. Would you be open to discussing some options, such as mindfulness exercises, relaxation techniques, or possibly consulting with a therapist?
PATIENT: Mindfulness exercises? Relaxation techniques? Therapy? Good heavens, no. I am a scholar, a librarian! I deal with ideas, with knowledge, with books! I do not have time for… frivolous distractions. And the thought of discussing my personal feelings with a complete stranger… preposterous!
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. It’s certainly your prerogative to choose the management strategies that best suit you. However, if you find your symptoms worsening, or if you’re struggling to cope, please don’t hesitate to reconsider these options. In the meantime, let's focus on monitoring your symptoms and await the results of your blood tests. I'll give you a call as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. I trust you will provide a swift and conclusive diagnosis. I have… arrangements to make. And frankly, I’m rather tired of being scrutinized.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I’ll do my best. I wish you a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before then. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Schlatterer.
