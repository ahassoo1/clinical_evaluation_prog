DOCTOR: Alright, Lindsey Bohnett, 88 years old… Good morning. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes, well, the nurse told me they found somethin' wrong with my cholesterol when I had my bloodwork done. High somethin’ or other… Hyper… something. I don’t rightly remember all the big words. It just sounded important, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. High cholesterol. It is important, you're right to get it looked at. Now, don’t worry too much about the big words. It just means you have a bit too much of a fatty substance in your blood. It can cause problems down the line if we don't manage it. Have you ever been told you have high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a peep. I’ve always been pretty healthy, you know? Ate my greens, walked every day… well, used to walk every day. The knees aren’t what they used to be. But I always thought I was doin’ alright. This came as a bit of a shock, to be honest. Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: Well, “serious” is a strong word. It can lead to heart problems, stroke, things like that, but that doesn't mean it will. We're catching it now, which is good. It just means we need to figure out why it's high, and what we can do about it. Now, you said you used to walk every day. How long have you been walking less?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… maybe a year, year and a half now? The right knee started actin’ up, and then the left one followed suit. Doc told me to take it easy, said it was just age. I mostly sit these days. Read a lot, watch a little TV… my wife, bless her heart, she did all the walkin’ for both of us when she was still around. It’s been quiet since she passed, you know? I miss havin’ someone to stroll with.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Loss of activity, grief… those things can certainly have an effect. And I see here you’re not currently on any medications, and no known allergies. Good. Now, let’s talk about your diet a bit more specifically. You said you eat your greens... what else does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal. Plain oatmeal, sometimes with a few berries if I’m feelin’ fancy. Lunch… that’s usually a sandwich. Ham and cheese, mostly. White bread, I’m afraid. I know, I know, not the best. And dinner… varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes a frozen meal. I try to have a vegetable with it, but… honestly, I don’t cook much for myself anymore. Used to make a mean Swedish meatball, but that was back when my wife was around. She did all the good cookin’. I guess I’m not a model eater, if that’s what you’re askin’.
DOCTOR: No, not a model eater. We need to get you eating a bit better, frankly. The white bread and processed foods aren't helping. And the lack of activity… well, we've established that. Now, family history. Anyone in your family – parents, siblings – have high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she had high blood pressure, but I don’t rightly know about cholesterol. They didn’t really talk about that much back in her day. My father, he was a strong man, lived to be 85, but I don’t remember him ever bein’ sick. He worked on a farm his whole life, lots of hard work, not much fancy eatin’. And I was an only child, so no siblings to worry about. I suppose nobody specifically had heart trouble, if that’s what you’re askin’. It was mostly just… old age took ‘em, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. No immediate family history of cholesterol issues. That's… helpful, I suppose. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse. Just a quick exam to get a baseline. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. Old bones ain't as cooperative as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pulse is a bit elevated, but not overly concerning given your age and lack of activity. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little on the high side, but not alarming. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the initial exam, it seems we're dealing with a typical case of age-related cholesterol elevation, likely exacerbated by dietary factors and reduced activity. We’ll need to get some blood work done to get a more detailed lipid panel and rule out any underlying causes.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Blood work, you say? Will that be painful? I don’t like needles much, if I’m bein’ honest. And what about this… lipid panel? What exactly will that tell us? I like knowin’ what’s goin’ on, if you don’t mind me askin’ a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: No, the blood work won't be painful. Just a quick prick of the needle. You might feel a little pinch, but it’s over very quickly. As for the lipid panel… it's just a detailed breakdown of the different types of fats in your blood. It will tell us your total cholesterol, your LDL – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – and your triglycerides. It helps us understand the specific problem and determine the best course of action. Right now, I’m leaning towards dietary changes and increased exercise, but we need the numbers to confirm that's enough. I’ll also want to check your thyroid, just to rule anything else out. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. It's routine. Now, do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Thyroid, you say? I hadn’t even thought about that. I suppose it’s good to check everything. So, just a pinch, you said? And the nurse will do it? That’s… reassuring. I always feel better when a nurse is doin’ it. What kind of exercise are we talkin’ about? I can’t be runnin’ marathons at my age, that’s for sure. And what about the diet? What exactly do I need to be cuttin’ out? I don't want to give up my ham and cheese sandwiches entirely, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: No, you won’t be running marathons. We’re talking about walking. Start with short walks, maybe 10-15 minutes a day, and gradually increase the duration and pace as you feel comfortable. As for the diet… we need to reduce your saturated and trans fats. That means less red meat, less processed foods, and… yes, less ham and cheese sandwiches. You can still have them, but not every day. Try switching to whole-wheat bread, lean turkey instead of ham, and reduced-fat cheese. Lots of fruits and vegetables. Think Mediterranean diet – fish, olive oil, beans, nuts. It’s not about deprivation, it’s about moderation. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more detailed plan. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Mediterranean, you say? My wife, bless her, she made a mean fish stew. Maybe I could try that again. It’s been a while. Walking and fish stew… and less sandwiches. I think I can manage that. It sounds… doable. Yes, I think that’s clear. Walking, fish stew, and less sandwiches. And the nurse will be in shortly. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Good. We’ll get you started. The nurse should be in any moment now. I'll leave you to it, then. Let me know if you have any questions for the nurse. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor. .
