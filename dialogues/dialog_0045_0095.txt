DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane Nissenbaum, 59 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day to explain things. It's… my ear. And my face feels a bit strange. It started yesterday, and it’s not getting better. I can't hear on this side. <points to left ear> And this side of my face… feels weak, you know? Like it’s drooping a little. Is that what you treat here?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you’re busy, but I need information to help you. “Feels weak” isn’t a diagnosis. And yes, we treat ears and… facial issues. But we need to figure out what’s going on. Yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. I woke up and it was just… gone. The hearing, I mean. And now this. Honestly, it’s rather alarming. I haven’t hit my head or anything. It just… happened. Is this something serious? Because I have things to do. <shifts impatiently in chair>
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get a quick look at your records… hmm. Nothing major jumping out. No recent head trauma as you said. Okay, so sudden hearing loss and facial weakness. It could be a number of things, and frankly, you're right to be concerned. It's not something we want to ignore. First, I'm going to need to do a quick exam. I'll check your ears, do a neurological assessment – that’s just to see if the nerves controlling your face are working properly. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Nerves… right. Fine, whatever. Just get on with it. And please, don’t tell me things I don't need to know. <follows Dr. Billman's finger with a slightly irritated expression> Yes, I can follow your finger. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon to attend.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you try to smile for me?
PATIENT: <performs a weak, asymmetrical smile> There. Happy now? It feels… strange. Like I can't fully control it on this side. Honestly, it’s quite unsettling. <touches left side of face> Is it something caught? A bug, maybe? I hate bugs.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't feel like a bug. It’s not a physical obstruction. Okay, now close your eyes tight. Very tight. And try to raise your eyebrows. See if they both go up evenly.
PATIENT: <closes eyes tightly and attempts to raise eyebrows, resulting in a noticeable asymmetry> It’s… difficult. This side barely moves. Honestly, it's getting worse just standing here! What is wrong with me? Is it a stroke? My brother had a stroke last year, and… <trails off, looking panicked> Is that what this is? Don't tell me it’s a stroke. I have investments to manage!
DOCTOR: Hold on. Let’s not jump to conclusions. While your symptoms could indicate something serious – and we need to rule things out – a full-blown stroke is unlikely at this stage, but we need to be certain. It could be Bell’s palsy – a temporary weakness of the facial muscles, often caused by a viral infection. But we can’t diagnose that without further testing. I'm going to order an MRI to rule out anything more serious, like a tumor or a lesion. And I'll want a blood test just to be safe. It's standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, no. I'm a very healthy woman. Mostly. But an MRI… that means being stuck in a tube, doesn't it? And blood tests? I hate needles. Is there any way to avoid all this fuss? I really don't have time for this. And, frankly, I don't appreciate being treated like… <gestures vaguely> like a common patient. I have important things going on. .
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you’re busy. But your health isn’t something you can just dismiss. I’m not “treating you like a common patient,” I’m trying to figure out what’s causing these symptoms. An MRI is the best way to do that. And blood tests provide valuable information. If you refuse testing, I can’t properly diagnose you. I can give you a referral to a neurologist, but they will want the same tests. So, it's your choice. But I strongly advise against delaying further investigation. Are you insured at all?
