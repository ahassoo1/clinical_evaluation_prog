DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor, nice to meet you too. Well, I've been having these chills lately, and it's a bit worrying. It's not like a fever chill, just… cold. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills that come and go. That’s good information to start with. Could you tell me a little more about when these chills started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It probably started about a week ago, maybe a little less. It was pretty mild at first, I didn’t really pay much attention to it. But it’s been happening more often the last couple of days.
DOCTOR: Alright, about a week ago, and increasing in frequency the past couple of days. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the chills?
PATIENT: Not really… I mean, I've been a little tired, but I figured that was just because of work. Nothing major, honestly. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… just the cold shivers and feeling a bit drained.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like cough, sore throat, or body aches. Just chills and fatigue. Are the chills constant when they happen, or do they come in waves?
PATIENT: They definitely come in waves. It’s not like I'm shivering all the time. It'll hit me suddenly, and I'll feel really cold for maybe ten or fifteen minutes, then it'll pass. Then later, it'll come back again. It’s just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent chills lasting about ten to fifteen minutes at a time. And you mentioned feeling drained. Would you describe that as more like general tiredness, or something more debilitating?
PATIENT: More just… general tiredness, I think. Like I could use a good night's sleep, you know? I'm still going to work and doing my usual stuff, but I feel like I'm putting in extra effort to do it. It's not stopping me from doing things, just making them harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any sweating with these chills, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, no sweating or anything like that. And definitely no nausea or vomiting. It’s just cold, then… not cold. It’s really strange. I'm starting to worry it's something serious, but I thought I should check with a doctor first.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sweating, no nausea, no vomiting. That helps narrow things down. Just the chills and fatigue. Now, let’s get a little bit of your medical background. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. No asthma, no diabetes, no heart problems… I'm pretty healthy, usually. Oh! I do have some mild allergies, to pollen mostly, but I manage them with over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child, otherwise generally healthy, and mild seasonal pollen allergies managed with over-the-counter medication. And are you currently taking any medications, even those over-the-counter ones for your allergies?
PATIENT: Yeah, I take a daily antihistamine during pollen season. It’s just a generic loratadine, nothing fancy. And sometimes I’ll take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, daily loratadine for pollen allergies and ibuprofen as needed for headaches. Have you had any surgeries other than your tonsils removed?
PATIENT: No, just my tonsils. Everything else has been…normal. I’ve never really been one for hospitals, thankfully. I'm hoping this won’t require anything like that!
DOCTOR: Alright. No other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family... are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had some issues with cholesterol, but other than that, not really. My grandparents lived to be pretty old, so I think we're generally a pretty healthy bunch. Nothing major like heart disease or cancer that I know of, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. That's helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a Health Education Specialist, so I spend most of my day on my feet giving presentations and workshops. I try to eat pretty healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein – but sometimes it's hard when I’m busy. I don’t drink or smoke. I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly walking, but I haven't been to the gym in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're a Health Education Specialist, active job, healthy diet with occasional difficulties, no alcohol or tobacco use. Now, one last question about your medical history before we move on to a physical exam. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a problem with any medications. I'm pretty lucky in that department, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your temperature, pulse, blood pressure, listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Now let me listen to your lungs… Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, your heart… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. And finally, let's take a look at your throat… Your throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Blood pressure is 122 over 78, and your pulse is 72 and regular. So, everything seems pretty normal on initial examination. However, the chills are concerning, and we need to figure out what's causing them. Given your symptoms and examination findings, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause right now. It could be a mild viral infection, or something else entirely. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying infections or other medical conditions. I’d like to check your complete blood count, thyroid function, and some basic metabolic panels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Blood work seems like a good idea. I just want to know what’s going on, so I can get back to feeling normal. Where do I go to get that done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send the order electronically to the lab here in the building – they're just down the hall, room 203. The lab technician will take a sample of your blood, and the results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. They'll let you know when they are available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding strenuous activity. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, cough, body aches, or any other concerning symptoms – please call the office immediately. Once we have the lab results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very reasonable. Rest and hydration… I can definitely do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out what's going on. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious. I’ll head to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. And please, get some rest. Have a good day, and I’ll see you when the lab results are back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
