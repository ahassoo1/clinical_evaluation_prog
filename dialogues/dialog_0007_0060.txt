DOCTOR: Hi Blain, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Dr. Hernandez. Thanks for seeing me. Look, it's… family history, mostly. My mom's side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble. And cancer, too. It just… feels like a ticking time bomb, you know? I want to make sure I don't end up the same way. I’d just like some reassurance, I guess. And maybe some tests, if you think it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Family history is extremely important, and being proactive is a really smart move. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. “Ticking time bomb” is a strong way to put it, but I appreciate you being honest about your anxiety. Let's get some details down. First, regarding your mom's side – what kind of heart trouble are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother… she died of a heart attack, pretty suddenly, when I was a kid. And my uncle, he had… something with the valves? He needed surgery a few years back. I honestly don't remember all the specifics. My mom always handled the medical stuff, and… well, she’s gone now too. It was… complicated. Not a heart thing, thankfully, but still. So, I’m a little fuzzy on details. I just know it was heart trouble. And then there was my aunt… she had breast cancer. Caught it early, thankfully, but… still. It’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a lot. I’m sorry to hear about your mom and aunt. It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling anxious, and it makes sense that details are fuzzy with everything you've been through. So, grandmother – heart attack. Uncle – valve issue requiring surgery. Aunt – breast cancer, early detection. That gives us a starting point. Let’s switch gears a bit. How about you – any current symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's the thing. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. That’s why I feel… silly, maybe? Coming in here when I don’t feel sick. It’s just… knowing what's happened to my family, it's hard to ignore. I exercise regularly, I eat okay, I don't smoke… I just want to know I'm not walking around with some ticking time bomb inside, you know? I guess I'm looking for a clean bill of health, or at least some idea of what I need to watch out for.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all. Preventative care is incredibly important, especially with a family history like yours. It’s smart to want to be proactive, and wanting peace of mind is a perfectly valid reason to come in. It’s much better to get checked out now than to worry about it constantly. Okay, so no current symptoms. Good. Let’s do a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Seriously. I really feel… normal. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot. I’m a teacher, postsecondary engineering. It's demanding. But it's not like… heart tired, if that makes sense. Just… regular work tired. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. No history of high blood pressure or anything like that, as far as I know. My mom always took care of the doctor’s appointments, like I said. I guess I should have been more involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. And don't beat yourself up about not being more involved in the past - you're taking care of it now. “Regular work tired” sounds perfectly normal for a postsecondary engineering teacher. Let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid – skateboarding accident – but that's it. No surgeries, no serious illnesses, no chronic conditions. I'm pretty boring, medically speaking. I take vitamins, that's about it. And I had all the usual childhood vaccinations, I think. My mom was good about that. Honestly, I feel like I'm wasting your time. You probably see people with actual problems all day.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not wasting my time. And honestly, it's refreshing to see someone who's proactively taking their health seriously. Okay, no hospitalizations, no surgeries, no chronic conditions. Vitamins only. Good. And you had your childhood vaccinations. Excellent. Let’s quickly go over allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing. I eat everything, take most medications without issue, haven't even had poison ivy. My family always joked I was immune to everything. It's another reason I feel silly being here, I guess. Everyone else is dealing with something, and I’m just… fine. But that family history… it just hangs over me, you know? I keep thinking it’s just a matter of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's great. And I understand about the family history - it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. It's not silly to want to be proactive, and it doesn't mean something will happen. It just means we need to be smart about monitoring things. Let's do a quick physical exam. It will just be a basic check – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, things like that. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. I guess. As long as it’s not anything too invasive. I’m just… not a fan of doctors, to be honest. Always felt like a waste of time, until now. But if it’ll give me some peace of mind, I’ll do it. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind? I have a lot of grading to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it quick and focused. I promise. If you could just get up on the table for me, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Okay, heart sounds are regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear on both sides. Blood pressure is 118/72, which is excellent. Pulse is 68 and steady. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now, just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. No tenderness, no masses. Everything feels normal.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. That's… good, right? Everything normal? I just... I always worry about what you’re not saying. Like, if you find something, you’ll tell me, right? I just want honesty. I’d rather know, even if it’s bad. It’s just… the unknown is what gets me.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything feels normal, which is excellent. And you’re absolutely right to ask. I will always be honest with you, even if it’s not what you want to hear. That’s my job. I understand your anxiety about the unknown – it's perfectly valid. Right now, everything I’m finding is reassuring. However, given your family history, I think it's prudent to run some baseline tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a lipid panel, and an EKG. Those tests will give us a good snapshot of your overall health and help rule out any potential issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests. Yeah, alright. I guess that makes sense. As long as it's not too expensive, honestly. My insurance… it's Medicare, but it doesn’t cover everything. I just… I don’t want a huge bill. What kind of tests are those, exactly? And what are you looking for? Just… lay it out for me, plain and simple. No medical jargon, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern about costs – that’s very responsible. Medicare should cover most of these, but we can double-check coding to be sure. Okay, so the CBC – complete blood count – that tells us about the different types of cells in your blood. It can detect things like anemia or infection. The CMP – comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. The lipid panel – that’s a cholesterol test. And the EKG – electrocardiogram – that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It can detect any irregular heartbeats. Basically, we’re looking for any red flags. We want to make sure your kidneys and liver are functioning properly, your blood sugar is stable, your cholesterol is healthy, and your heart is beating normally. These tests are just a baseline, a starting point. If everything looks good, we can reassess in a year or so. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. Blood work, cholesterol, heart… sounds thorough, I guess. And you'll explain the results to me when they come back? No rushing, no medical terms… I want to understand everything. And, if something is wrong, you’ll tell me what my options are, right? I don’t want to be left in the dark. I just want to be prepared. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, honestly. It helps. A lot. So, yeah. Let’s do the tests.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I promise, no rushing and no medical jargon. I'll explain everything in plain language. And yes, if something is wrong, we will discuss your options thoroughly. We will make a plan together, and you will be fully informed every step of the way. I’ll get the lab orders printed out for you now. They'll need a blood sample and you'll need to do the EKG in the hallway with the technician. It’s a quick and painless test – just some stickers on your chest. Once you have those done, the results should be back in a few days. I’ll have the nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Dr. Hernandez. Seriously. You've… eased my mind a little, at least. Even just knowing we're checking things, it helps. Okay. I’ll go get the blood work done. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Blain. It’s my pleasure. Remember, proactive care is always a good thing. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
