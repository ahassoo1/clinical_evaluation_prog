DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mastrantonio. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been experiencing a rather… peculiar sensation in my back. It’s a popping, or clicking, sound and feeling, especially when I twist or bend. It doesn’t necessarily hurt, but it’s unsettling, you know? It’s become more frequent lately, and my wife suggested I get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Popping and clicking… right. And it’s primarily with twisting and bending?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Twisting is the biggest trigger, I’d say. Bending over to pick things up sometimes does it too, but not as consistently. It seems to be centered around my lower back, on both sides, if that makes sense. It’s not one specific spot, really; it’s more… diffuse. I work with a lot of heavy equipment for my job, so I’m always moving and lifting. Perhaps it’s related?
DOCTOR: Heavy equipment… of course. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, not pain exactly. It's more of a… a mild discomfort afterwards, sometimes. A sort of stiffness. And occasionally, if I do a particularly awkward twist, there’s a little ache for a few minutes, but it goes away quickly. It's not a debilitating pain, Doctor, but it’s enough to make me wonder if it's something I should be concerned about. I don’t want to risk making it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, precisely?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started subtly, maybe six or seven weeks ago. At first, it was just a rare pop here and there, barely noticeable. But over the last three weeks, it's definitely become more frequent and consistent, as I mentioned. I’d say it’s been a gradual increase, rather than a sudden onset. I’m fairly certain it wasn't brought on by any specific injury or event, just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No numbness, tingling, or weakness at all. My legs and feet feel perfectly normal. I've been consciously checking, just to be sure, especially with my wife's concern, but everything feels as it should. I walk normally, I can stand for extended periods without issue, and I don't have any trouble with my balance. I suppose that's a good sign, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It’s… relevant. Have you tried any treatments yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. My wife, she’s very good at finding things online, suggested some stretches and I’ve been trying to incorporate those into my routine. Mostly just gentle back extensions and some core strengthening exercises. And I’ve been trying to be more mindful of my posture when I'm lifting things, though it’s difficult with my job. I also tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, ibuprofen, a few times, but it didn’t seem to make much of a difference with the popping or clicking, only helped with the slight ache afterwards, if at all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have you lie down on the exam table. We’ll just do a quick physical assessment.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Lie on your back, arms at your sides. I’m going to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion. Now, can you point to where you feel the clicking sensation most prominently?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s difficult to pinpoint one exact spot, as I mentioned, but if I had to choose, it's probably right here… …and here. It’s more of a general area of discomfort, rather than a sharp, localized pain. It's both sides, though, fairly symmetrical.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does this cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not a sharp pain, but it’s… noticeable. It’s a dull ache, really. More of an awareness of the area, if that makes sense. It’s not excruciating, but I can definitely feel the pressure. It’s a bit more sensitive than other parts of my back. Oh, that's a bit tender, actually. Just there, on the right side.
DOCTOR: Tenderness noted on the right side. Now, I’m going to have you lift each leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible. Let me know if you experience any pain with that.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Okay, I’ve lifted my right leg. No pain there, just a bit of a stretch. And now my left leg. No pain with that one either. A bit of effort, naturally, but no discomfort.
DOCTOR: Range of motion appears intact bilaterally. Alright, now can you bend forward and touch your toes, if you can?
PATIENT: Certainly. I can get… this far. It’s a bit tight, naturally, but no sharp pain. I don’t have the flexibility I used to, but it’s manageable. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes. And when you bend forward, do you experience any radiating pain down your legs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No radiating pain at all. The stretch is mostly in my lower back and hamstrings, as I said. No tingling, numbness, or pain shooting down my legs. I was a little worried about that, to be honest, but it seems alright. Is that a good sign?
DOCTOR: No radiculopathy noted. It appears to be a musculoskeletal issue. Likely a mild strain or some facet joint irritation. I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and continue with the stretches. If it doesn't improve in a couple of weeks, or if the pain worsens, you can follow up with a physical therapist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A strain or irritation… alright. That’s… reassuring, to hear it’s likely nothing serious. A couple of weeks, then a physical therapist if it doesn’t improve. Yes, I do have a question, if you don’t mind. With my job, I’m constantly lifting and twisting heavy equipment. Are there any specific movements I should be avoiding, or techniques I can use to minimize the strain on my back? I don’t want to make it worse, and I need to be able to continue working, if possible.
DOCTOR: Proper lifting technique is crucial. Bend at the knees, keep your back straight, and avoid twisting while lifting. Hold the object close to your body. That’s… basic ergonomics. Honestly, I can’t give you a detailed work-specific assessment. Perhaps your employer has an occupational health specialist who could provide more tailored advice. I’m documenting these recommendations. Any other questions?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. It’s just… it’s difficult to remember all of that when you’re in the middle of a job. Perhaps I will ask my employer about an occupational health specialist. I suppose that's the best course of action. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at this time. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon. Here’s a summary of our visit for your records. Stop by if it doesn’t improve. NEXT.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day. .
