DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s… alright to meet you. Honestly, it's rather inconvenient having to be here, but my legs just suddenly feel… weak. It started a few days ago, right after I got over a really nasty cold. Not that I get colds often, mind you. It just feels like they have no strength. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, weak legs… started a few days ago after a cold. That is annoying. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to clarify, when you say weak, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? Honestly, it’s… like trying to walk through molasses. Everything feels heavy and slow. It's not painful, exactly, but it's…effortful. Like I have to think about lifting each leg. And it's both legs, which is what worries me. Normally, things like this happen on one side, if they happen at all. I usually just push through, but this is… different. And frankly, I don’t have time for this. I have tours scheduled.
DOCTOR: Okay, bilateral – meaning both legs – and effortful… you have to consciously think about lifting them. And no pain, which is good. Tours, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, tours. I run historical walking tours of the city. Quite popular, actually. People enjoy my… insights. It requires a lot of walking, naturally, and standing. It’s rather difficult to explain a city’s rich past while wobbling around like an old woman. I really need to be steady on my feet. It’s just… frustrating. Have you seen anything like this before? Because I really don’t have time to be laid up.
DOCTOR: It sounds concerning, and I understand your frustration with your tours. We’ll try to figure this out quickly. Just to get a better picture, have you noticed anything else along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt dizzy, no numbness or tingling. Bowels are… regular, if you must know. Appetite is fine. I have been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? Maybe a touch of muscle soreness, but that's probably just from… well, trying to walk normally. I don’t think anything else is particularly… off. It really just seems to be the legs. It’s quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And you said this started right after a cold?
PATIENT: Yes, just a few days after. A nasty one, I might add. Runny nose, sore throat, the whole unpleasant business. It lasted about a week, I'd say. And I thought I was completely over it. I even managed a short walk with a friend the day before the weakness started. Nothing strenuous, just a leisurely stroll. So, it really came as a surprise when my legs just… gave out, essentially. It’s hardly a dignified experience.
DOCTOR: Alright. To get a better sense of things, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? I suppose it’s necessary, but honestly, I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. As long as it's quick. And please, no cold hands. I have sensitive circulation.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as quick as possible, and I always warm my hands first. I just want to check your reflexes, strength, and balance. Nothing too invasive, I promise. Let's start by having you sit on the examination table, if you’d be so kind.
PATIENT: Very well. But do try to be gentle. I have a rather… delicate constitution. And please, tell me what you're doing as you go along. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, just going to feel your legs here – nothing to worry about. Checking the muscles. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you relax your legs completely?
PATIENT: Relax? That’s easier said than done when you're anticipating being… tapped. Honestly, Doctor, I simply don’t understand why this is necessary. It feels rather… undignified. But fine. I’ll try to relax. Just… get it over with quickly. And perhaps explain what you're looking for? For my… peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, just tapping your knees here. It's checking your reflexes – how quickly your nerves are responding. It helps us see if there's any issue with the nerves themselves. I’m seeing they are a little bit slower than usual, but still present. Now, I’m going to have you push against my hands – just a gentle push – to check your strength. Can you push against my hands with your legs like you're trying to push me away?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, it's rather difficult to exert myself when I'm feeling so… unstable. It feels like I'm pushing through mud. Do you see what I mean? It's not a matter of willing myself to be stronger, it’s that I am weaker. Are we nearly finished? This is quite exhausting, you know. And frankly, a little bit humiliating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And I apologize if this is uncomfortable. I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Now, let’s check your balance. Can you stand up for me, if you feel steady enough, and just try to stand without holding onto anything for a moment?
PATIENT: See? See? I told you. It’s like trying to balance on a tightrope. I simply can't steady myself. I need something to hold onto. It’s quite alarming, really. Are you sure this isn’t just a temporary… condition? Perhaps I simply need more rest. Or a stronger cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I can see that your balance is affected. And I understand your frustration. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it seems like we’re dealing with some weakness in your legs that’s affecting your balance. Given the timing after your cold, it could be something related to a post-viral condition. However, there are other possibilities we need to rule out. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Known medical conditions? Well, I had a rather nasty bout of bronchitis years ago, but I recovered completely. And my blood pressure tends to run a little low, but nothing that requires medication. Oh, and I was briefly married… but that’s hardly a medical condition, is it? I had to have some preventative surgery years ago, a hysterectomy, but that was well over a decade ago. Honestly, Doctor, I'm generally a very healthy person. I eat a balanced diet, I walk regularly… when my legs allow, of course. I simply don’t understand what’s happening. It's rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And I appreciate you sharing that information. Given your history, and the symptoms you’re experiencing, I think it would be best to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. These tests will help us rule out any underlying causes and determine the best course of action. We’ll check your vitamin levels, your thyroid function, and do a general check of your electrolytes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? Must we go through all of this? Honestly, I’m not particularly fond of needles. But… I suppose if it’s necessary. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, use a gentle touch. I bruise easily, you know. Tell me, Doctor, are you certain this isn't just… a temporary setback? Perhaps a bit more rest and a good dose of vitamins is all I need? I have a tour scheduled next week, you see. A very important one. I’d hate to have to cancel it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you we'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I do hope it's just a temporary setback, but it's important to rule out anything more serious, especially given the importance of your tour. The tests will help us get a clearer answer. I’ll order them now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It typically takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid any strenuous activity. We'll discuss the results as soon as they’re available and create a plan to get you back on your feet. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, make sure the lab technician is… competent. I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. And I expect a thorough explanation of the results. I'm not interested in medical jargon, mind you. Just a clear, concise answer. Alright. I suppose that's all for now, then. Let's hope these tests reveal nothing too alarming. I have a city to show, you see. And I simply must be steady on my feet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll make sure you get clear, concise information. I’ll have the lab contact you shortly. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Sharifa, and I wish you a speedy recovery. .
