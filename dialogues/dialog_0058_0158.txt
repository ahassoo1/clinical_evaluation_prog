DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about a letter. A letter for my… pet. Yes, that's right. A pet ownership letter. Honestly, all this paperwork these days is just… much. It’s for my landlord, you see. He’s being difficult.
DOCTOR: A pet ownership letter… Right. And you’re hoping I can… verify your pet ownership for housing purposes?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Verify. That’s the word. I just… I don't really know what all needs to be on it, to be honest. He just said he needed something official. From a doctor. I mean, what does a doctor have to do with a dog anyway? It's just… a lot. I've had him for ages, though. A good while. A lovely dog, really. A bit spoiled, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, while it’s… unusual, I suppose I can document that you own a dog. But I need a bit more information. Just to be thorough. What kind of dog is he?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me… Honestly, I don't recall the breed. It was… a gift, you see. A lovely friend of mine, she got him for me when I was going through a rough patch. Something… fluffy, I think? Darkish colour. Not a tiny one, definitely not. Medium-sized, I suppose. He sheds a lot, if that helps. A real handful when it comes to fur, let me tell you. I just called him… Lucky. Is that enough? I really don’t remember all the fancy breed names.
DOCTOR: Right. “Lucky.” Okay. And how long have you had Lucky?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a long time. Years, definitely. Hmm… let me think. Before the divorce, certainly. Yes, definitely before. Maybe… five years? Six? It all blurs together, you know? Things were… hectic then. But a good while. Long enough for him to become quite attached to me, and vice versa, naturally. He’s a good companion, Lucky is. A very good companion. Does a specific number really matter? I mean, I have had him for years.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Wrye. A general “years” isn’t sufficient documentation. Was it five years ago?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You’re making this very difficult. Five… maybe six. I honestly can’t be certain. It was around the time… well, around the time I moved into this current apartment. Does that help? I moved in… 2019, maybe? Yes, 2019, I think. So… six years, then? Look, I’m telling you, I’ve had him for a long time! He’s a good dog, and I'm a responsible owner. I clean up after him, he's vaccinated… What more do you need?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on. Has Lucky ever bitten anyone?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. Lucky is a sweetheart. A bit boisterous, perhaps, when he gets excited, but he’s never, ever bitten anyone. He loves children, he loves people… he just gets a bit… enthusiastic with his greetings, that’s all. He’s a playful dog, you see. A very playful dog. No biting, absolutely not. I would never allow that. He’s a member of the family.
DOCTOR: And you said he’s vaccinated?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Of course. I keep him up to date with everything. Rabies, distemper… all the usual things. I take him to the vet regularly. A very good vet, down on Elm Street. Dr. … hmm, I’m blanking on his name at the moment, but he’s excellent. He gives Lucky little treats, you see. He’s very good with animals. Yes, fully vaccinated. I wouldn’t let him run around unvaccinated, goodness no! That's irresponsible.
DOCTOR: Do you have any documentation of those vaccinations?
PATIENT: Documentation? Oh, goodness… I… I think so. Somewhere. I have a whole file of paperwork, you see, but it’s all in boxes. I just moved, and everything is still… disorganized. I'm sure it's there somewhere. I'll have to dig it out. Honestly, it's just a lot. Can’t you just… take my word for it? I’m a responsible pet owner! I do keep him vaccinated. I wouldn’t be bringing him to a landlord if I wasn’t. It's just… paperwork. A mountain of paperwork.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need verifiable information to write this letter. "Taking your word for it" isn't sufficient medical documentation. I can document that you state you own a dog and that you state he is vaccinated, but without proof, it’s not particularly helpful. Do you have any records – even a receipt from the vet – that we can look at now?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're making this so difficult. A receipt… hmm. Let me think. I might have something in my purse. Just a moment. Ah, here we are! Is this it? It’s… a bill, I think. From the vet. Yes, Elm Street Animal Clinic. It's… dated 2022. Is that recent enough? It says… Rabies booster and… a check-up. Does that help? It's a bit crumpled, I apologize. I had it in my purse for ages. It was a very busy year, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. This is… something. It confirms a vaccination in 2022. However, rabies boosters are typically given annually. Do you have any record of a more recent booster?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking me again… Honestly, I really can’t recall. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. Things have been… hectic. I think I took him last year, maybe? But I don’t remember getting a receipt. I usually just pay with cash. And I honestly haven't thought about it much. He seemed fine, you see. Healthy and happy. A very happy dog. Perhaps it’s time for another booster, actually. But honestly, I'm not certain. This paperwork is just… exhausting. Can we just… write the letter based on what we have? I do keep him vaccinated, I assure you. It's just... the details are fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I can document that you state you own a dog named Lucky and that you state he was vaccinated in 2022. However, without recent proof of a rabies booster, I am ethically obligated to advise you to obtain one, as it is legally required for pet ownership. I will write the letter stating what I’ve documented, but I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with your vet to update Lucky’s vaccinations. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Yes, yes, I understand. Legally required, you say? Fine, fine. I’ll schedule an appointment. Elm Street, you said? I’ll call them tomorrow. Honestly, all this fuss… It’s just a dog! A lovely dog, but still. Yes, I’ll call. And you'll write the letter with what we have? That’s… acceptable. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose that’s… that’s all then? It’s been… an ordeal.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Wrye. I will document what we discussed. And I strongly advise you to schedule that appointment as soon as possible. Here's a copy of my notes, and I'll have the letter ready for you before you leave. It’s been… a visit. Have a good day.
