DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it plainly, I’ve been smoking far too long, and I’d like to… stop. It’s become a bit of a… habit, you see. A very long habit.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to address a habit like that, and I commend you for taking this step. “Long habit” is a good way to put it. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me how long you've been smoking, and approximately how much you smoke each day?
PATIENT: Ah, well, let me think… it began when I was quite young, really. Seventeen, I believe. That would make… sixty-something years now. Sixty-two, to be precise. As for how much… it varies, naturally. But on an average day, I’d say… fifteen to twenty cigarettes. Perhaps a bit more when the weather is poor. I do enjoy a cigarette with my coffee, you see. And another after lunch. It’s… interwoven with my routine, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Sixty-two years is a significant length of time, Mr. Knoch. And fifteen to twenty cigarettes a day represents a substantial smoking history. Thank you for being so precise with your recollection. Have you attempted to quit before, and if so, what methods have you tried?
PATIENT: Indeed, it is a significant length of time, Doctor. Sometimes I feel as though the cigarettes are a part of me! As for attempting to quit… yes, several times. Mostly on my own, I confess. I’ve tried cutting back, switching to lighter cigarettes… even those pipe tobaccos for a while. Nothing seemed to… stick, you see. A friend once suggested those patches, but I didn’t care for them. Made me feel quite unwell. I suppose I lack the… willpower, perhaps. Though I hate to admit it.
DOCTOR: It’s not a matter of willpower, Mr. Knoch. Nicotine is a highly addictive substance, and quitting can be incredibly challenging, even with the best intentions. It sounds like you've already demonstrated considerable effort in trying different approaches. The patches don't work for everyone, and that's perfectly normal. To get a clearer picture of your overall health and determine the best course of action, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully nothing of the sort. I’ve been… reasonably healthy, all things considered. A touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s to be expected at my age, I suppose. My doctor back in Lithuania – he was a very good man – always said I had a strong constitution. I’ve never been a patient man, though. Long waits in waiting rooms… they do not agree with me. I trust you understand. Do you foresee a long examination?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Knoch. A strong constitution is certainly beneficial. And I do understand your aversion to long waits; I assure you, I’ll do my best to be efficient. The examination itself won't be extensive. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perhaps take a look at your throat. We may also want to consider a simple spirometry test to assess your lung function, if you’re agreeable. It involves breathing into a tube, and it takes only a few minutes. Before we proceed, are you currently experiencing any symptoms like coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not currently. A little… breathless sometimes when climbing the stairs, but I attribute that to the arthritis, and, well, my age. Nothing alarming, certainly. The stairs in my building are rather steep, you see. As for coughing… occasionally in the mornings, a slight tickle in my throat, but nothing persistent. And definitely no chest pain. I pride myself on being able to tell when something is truly wrong. Is this spirometry test… unpleasant? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Knoch. It's excellent that you are attuned to your body. The spirometry test is not unpleasant at all. It requires a bit of effort, as you’ll be asked to breathe deeply in and out of a mouthpiece, but it's generally well-tolerated. We'll explain everything thoroughly before we begin, and you can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Just to complete the picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I take a small tablet for my arthritis, naproxen, I believe it’s called. Just one a day. And occasionally, if my knees are particularly troublesome, I use a topical cream, diclofenac, I think it’s called. That’s it, really. I’m not one for taking many pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer a cup of strong tea for my ailments, if possible. And a little bit of sunshine. Do you think sunshine helps with quitting, Doctor? Perhaps it has a calming effect.
DOCTOR: Naproxen and diclofenac, noted. And a preference for natural remedies—that’s perfectly understandable, Mr. Knoch. As for sunshine and quitting, there's certainly no harm in it! Vitamin D is important for overall health, and fresh air and a change of scenery can be beneficial for reducing stress, which is often a trigger for smoking. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your social history. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. My wife passed away… many years ago now. Twenty years, to be precise. A lovely woman, she was. I have a nephew who lives in the city, but he’s very busy with his work. He calls occasionally, checks in on me. And a few acquaintances at the local… tavern. We play dominoes on Tuesdays. A bit of friendly competition, you see. Do you play dominoes, Doctor? It’s a very… strategic game. And it helps pass the time. A solitary life, perhaps, but I manage.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knoch. It sounds like you have a good support system, even if it’s not extensive. And dominoes—that’s a wonderful pastime! Social interaction is very important, and it’s good that you have that outlet. Finally, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I am aware of. I’ve always been… remarkably resilient, I suppose. I can eat almost anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I recall my mother saying I had a stomach like an iron pot! She was a very practical woman, my mother. She always said a little bit of everything is good for you. Perhaps that’s why I’ve lived so long. Unless, of course, it’s the dominoes. Or the sunshine. Do you think we should include the sunshine on my chart, Doctor? For medicinal purposes, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Knoch. A resilient constitution is a definite advantage. And I wholeheartedly agree—we will absolutely include “sunshine” on your chart, documented for its medicinal benefits! Now, if you’re agreeable, I’d like to proceed with a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline assessment of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Proceed as you see fit. I’ve always been a man who trusts his doctor. And I do appreciate your willingness to acknowledge the benefits of sunshine. It’s a small thing, perhaps, but it shows… thoughtfulness, you see. Lead the way, then. Though perhaps open a window? For optimal sunshine exposure, of course.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thoughtfulness is certainly important. And I’m happy to open the window; a little fresh air and sunshine never hurt anyone. If you could just have a seat here, I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure. Afterward, we can discuss the spirometry test and potential options for quitting smoking.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed at your leisure. I haven’t had a proper examination in… quite some time, I confess. I hope I’m not too rusty. A little like an old machine, perhaps. But I’m still functioning, you see. Still functioning.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, Mr. Knoch, and I’m not detecting any murmurs or irregularities at this time. Your breath sounds are slightly diminished, but that could be related to your age and smoking history. I do hear some slight wheezing in the lower lobes, which is not uncommon in smokers. We’ll want to monitor that. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated, and something we should discuss further. Alright, Mr. Knoch, everything appears within reasonable limits, considering your age and smoking history. Now, would you be comfortable with a spirometry test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe I would be. Despite the slight wheezing, my lungs have seen worse, I assure you. I’ve always been a rather… robust individual. I used to chop wood, you see. For years. Kept me very fit. Perhaps we should add “wood chopping” to my chart as well? For medicinal purposes, naturally. Though I’m afraid my wood chopping days are long behind me. Proceed then. Explain the process to me, if you would be so kind. I like to know what I’m getting myself into, you see. A cautious man, I am.
DOCTOR: “Wood chopping” is duly noted, Mr. Knoch—an excellent addition to your medical history. Robust indeed! Now, the spirometry test is quite simple. You’ll be seated comfortably, and I’ll ask you to take a deep breath in through a mouthpiece, and then exhale as forcefully and completely as you can for about six seconds. We'll repeat this several times to get an accurate reading. It doesn’t require any special effort, but it’s important to exhale fully. There's a clip to hold on your nose to ensure you’re breathing through the mouthpiece only. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds perfectly straightforward. A deep breath in, a forceful exhale… I believe I can manage that. I used to blow out candles on my wife’s birthday cake, you see. With considerable force, I might add. Though my lungs aren't what they used to be, naturally. And the candles weren't quite as demanding as a… spirometry test. Lead the way, then. Let’s see what these old lungs can do. And please, don’t hesitate to stop me if I turn blue. Just a precaution, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Knoch. I assure you, turning blue is not part of the procedure. I’ll be monitoring you closely throughout the test. Alright, now take a deep breath in… that's it… and exhale forcefully and completely. Good! That was a good effort. Very good, Mr. Knoch. And again… that’s excellent. And one more time… perfect. Alright, the results are in. Your FEV1 – that’s the amount of air you can forcibly exhale in one second – is 60% of predicted. Your FVC – that’s your total lung capacity – is 65% of predicted. These results indicate mild obstructive lung disease, consistent with your smoking history. It doesn’t require immediate intervention, but it emphasizes the importance of quitting smoking.
PATIENT: Mild obstructive lung disease… not entirely unexpected, I confess. Sixty-two years of smoking will do that to a man, you see. Though I’ve always felt… remarkably well, all things considered. Still, it’s good to have confirmation, I suppose. And it reinforces your earlier advice about quitting. So, what are my options, Doctor? What can be done? I’ve tried patches, as we discussed, with little success. Are there any… medications? Or therapies? I’m willing to explore all possibilities, you see. Though I’m not keen on anything too drastic. A cautious man, I am. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help? A strong brew. With a biscuit.
DOCTOR: You're right to be proactive, Mr. Knoch. There are several options available, and we can tailor a plan to your specific needs and preferences. Patches aren't the only option, and it sounds like they weren't a good fit for you. Medications like varenicline and bupropion can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. However, they do have potential side effects, and we’d need to discuss those carefully. Another option is nicotine replacement therapy, but in different forms—lozenge, gum, nasal spray or inhaler. We also have behavioral therapies and counseling, which can be very effective in helping you develop coping strategies and stay motivated. There are support groups available as well. Given your preference for a cautious approach, I would recommend starting with behavioral counseling and possibly nicotine replacement therapy in the form of lozenges or gum. We can monitor your progress and adjust the plan as needed. What are your thoughts on that?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Behavioral counseling and lozenges… less drastic, as you say. I’ve always been a man who appreciates a… methodical approach. And lozenges… I can manage lozenges. They won’t require a visit from the paramedics, I presume? And counseling… I suppose that could be beneficial. Talking to someone might help… though I’m not entirely comfortable sharing my… inner thoughts with a stranger. Still, I’m willing to try. Very well, Doctor. Let’s proceed with the behavioral counseling and the lozenges. Perhaps you could recommend a… reputable counselor? Someone who understands the plight of a man who’s been smoking for sixty-two years? And what strength of lozenge do you recommend? I wouldn’t want to overdo it. A cautious man, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Knoch. I’m glad we’ve found a plan you’re comfortable with. I have a list of several reputable counselors in the area who specialize in smoking cessation. I’ll print out a list with their contact information and a brief summary of their approach. As for the lozenges, I recommend starting with 2mg lozenges. You can use one every 1-2 hours when you experience a craving. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully and not exceed the recommended dosage. I’m also going to write you a prescription for the lozenges, and I’ll provide you with some informational pamphlets about smoking cessation. It’s important to remember that quitting smoking is a process, and it’s okay to have setbacks. Don’t get discouraged, and reach out if you need support. Now, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything admirably. The list of counselors, the prescription, the pamphlets… you’ve been most thorough. I appreciate your… methodical approach. And your willingness to acknowledge the plight of a man who’s been smoking for sixty-two years. I suppose there is one small question. Will the lozenges affect my dominoes game? I wouldn’t want to lose my edge. It’s a very competitive game, you see. And I’ve always prided myself on my strategic thinking. A small question, perhaps, but an important one.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Knoch! I appreciate your foresight. The lozenges may cause some mild side effects, such as hiccups, nausea, or a sore throat. However, they shouldn’t affect your cognitive function or strategic thinking. Your dominoes game should be perfectly safe. In fact, I suspect quitting smoking may improve your strategic thinking. Nicotine can impair cognitive function, so eliminating it could give you an edge. Now, if there’s nothing else, I wish you the best of luck on your journey to quit smoking. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Knoch.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. And thank you for acknowledging the importance of my dominoes game. A strategic mind is a valuable asset, you see. I shall follow your instructions carefully, and I shall endeavor to remain optimistic. And I shall reach out if my dominoes game suffers. A most important consideration, naturally. Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you once again for your… methodical approach.
