DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too, I guess. Look, I just… I want to get tested for HIV. I decided it’s probably a good idea, you know? Better safe than sorry and all that. It’s not like I expect anything, but my wife thought it was worth checking.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Belan. That's a very responsible decision. It’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health, and your wife sounds very thoughtful. Just to be clear, you're requesting an HIV test today – is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Just the test. Look, I don’t really need a whole… thing about it, alright? I'm a pretty careful person. I just want the results. Is that possible? No lectures, please. I’m a Compliance Officer, I deal with rules and regulations all day. I know how this stuff works.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Belan. No lectures, I assure you. My goal is simply to ensure you receive the appropriate care. We'll absolutely proceed with the test. Before we do, though, I do need to ask a few questions—standard procedure, you understand—to get a better understanding of your risk factors and to make sure the test is accurate. It helps me provide the best possible care, even if you feel you're at low risk. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Risk factors. Honestly. Fine, ask your questions. But I'm telling you now, I'm a pretty boring guy. Married, work all the time, don't go around… you know. Just get it over with. And don’t look at me like that, it’s irritating.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Belan. It’s just routine. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. Blood pressure's usually okay, a little high sometimes with the stress, but nothing a doctor hasn't seen before, I’m sure. No diabetes, no heart problems. I eat reasonably well, mostly. Look, I'm a pretty healthy guy, alright? Can we just get to the actual test? This is taking ages.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. And do you take any medications currently – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes ibuprofen if my back’s playing up from sitting at a desk all day. Honestly, that’s it. I don’t believe in loading up on pills unless I absolutely have to. I'm a very… natural person. Does that count as a risk factor? Being sensible?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Belan, being sensible is definitely not a risk factor. Good for you. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I'm remarkably… intact. Broken a bone as a kid, wrist I think, playing football. But that was… decades ago. They put a cast on it, it healed. No big deal. Look, I’m telling you, I'm a very low-maintenance patient. Can we please move on? This is ridiculous. I could be doing work right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, great. My dad had high cholesterol, I think. And my grandmother… well, she had something. I don’t really remember what. Something old people get. Arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago. Look, we didn't really talk about medical stuff much. It’s not exactly a lively topic, is it? Honestly, this is… intrusive. Is it really necessary? I’m starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. It is a lot of questions, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. The reason I ask about family history is to identify any potential predispositions, even if it’s just to be aware. But if you’re uncomfortable, we can move on. One final, perhaps sensitive question: have you ever shared needles, or had any unprotected sexual contact with someone whose HIV status you didn’t know?
PATIENT: Are you serious? Look at me! Do I look like the kind of person who… Really? I'm married! I have a responsible job! This is… frankly, offensive. I told you, I'm a Compliance Officer. I understand risk! I'm not some reckless… I can't believe you even asked me that. This is a complete waste of my time. Just give me the test, or I’m leaving. Right now. And I’ll be reporting this. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I sincerely apologize. That was inappropriate, and I truly didn't mean to offend you. It’s standard protocol to ask those questions, but it was insensitive of me to do so without establishing a better rapport. I understand your frustration, and I will proceed with the test immediately. We can absolutely stop asking questions. I’m going to step out to prepare the test. It will just involve a small blood sample. It takes about 20 minutes to get the preliminary results. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Twenty minutes. And no more questions. I'm watching the clock. Don't make me wait any longer. And I expect a full apology later, Doctor. A proper one. This whole experience has been… appalling. Honestly. Appalling.
