DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. EADDY. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Well, Doctor, it’s about this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And frankly, it’s embarrassing to even talk about, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just…crave it. It’s ridiculous. I haven’t felt right in weeks, and I figured it was time to get it checked out before it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt, you say?
PATIENT: Yes! Clay, mostly. Sometimes just…earth from the garden. Don't look at me like that, I know it’s weird! It’s just…it feels good going down, if you can believe that. And it started small, a little pinch here and there, now…well, now it's more than a little. It’s not like I’m shoveling it down, but still. It's a habit, I guess, a bad one. And it's making me feel awful.
DOCTOR: Right. A craving for…earth. And you say this has been progressing over several weeks, accompanied by increasing fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Weeks. Maybe a month or so? It's all blurring together, to be honest. The tiredness is the worst part. I used to be so active, always gardening, walking…now I can barely get out of my chair. And it’s not just tired, it's…empty. Like something's missing. And the dirt…it doesn't even help, really. It’s just…compelling. Do you think I’m crazy? Because that’s what my niece said. She thinks I’m losing it.
DOCTOR: “Losing it” is rather…unprofessional terminology. Let's not jump to conclusions. This craving – this pica, as it’s medically termed – is not necessarily indicative of anything drastic. However, it is unusual, and we need to investigate the underlying cause. Fatigue and pica together could point to several possibilities, most of which are easily addressed. Now, Ms. Hardenburgh, have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: “Pica?” Honestly. You doctors and your fancy words. Look, I just want to feel better, not pass a quiz. Other changes? Hmm…well, my stomach's been a bit off, I suppose. Not sick, exactly, but… unsettled. And I’ve been a little weaker than usual, even for my age. But that could just be the tiredness, right? I don’t know… I really haven't paid much attention, to be honest. I just try to get through the day. Is this going to take long? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: “Getting through the day” is, unfortunately, not a diagnosis, Ms. Hardenburgh. Unsettled stomach and weakness alongside the fatigue and pica...yes, it does warrant further investigation. I understand your time is valuable, but a proper assessment is crucial. To begin, let's review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, history. Honestly, it’s been a long life, Doctor. Nothing major. A bit of arthritis, the usual aches and pains of getting old. I never really bothered with doctors much. They always just told me to rest and take a pill. No, nothing serious. And I certainly haven't been keeping a detailed medical record, if that's what you're asking. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. Lots of vegetables from my garden, when I have the energy. Are we going to get to the bottom of this, or just sit here listing off ailments I haven't even thought of?
DOCTOR: "Getting to the bottom of this" requires information, Ms. Hardenburgh. "Lots of vegetables" is, again, not a diagnosis. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t bother with doctors much! Mostly just some ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing regular. And I certainly don't go running to the pharmacy for every little ache and pain. I prefer to deal with things myself. Honestly, all these questions…are you trying to find something wrong with me? Because I’m perfectly fine, just…tired and a bit odd. Can we just give me something for the tiredness? That’s all I really want.
DOCTOR: “Something for the tiredness” is precisely what I am attempting to ascertain the cause of, Ms. Hardenburgh. We cannot simply prescribe medication without understanding the underlying problem. Now, have you had any surgical procedures in the past?
PATIENT: No! Never had surgery, thank goodness. I’ve always been careful, avoided anything risky. And I certainly don’t go poking around in hospitals. I’m a strong woman, I take care of myself. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just want to feel better, not relive my entire life story! Is this going to involve blood tests? Because I hate needles. And I don't have insurance, so...
DOCTOR: “Reliving your life story” – as you put it – is essential to a proper medical evaluation. And yes, blood tests are likely necessary. We need to assess your iron levels, complete blood count, and several other factors. As for the cost… we can discuss options. But frankly, Ms. Hardenburgh, ignoring these symptoms and simply requesting a “fix” is not a responsible approach to your health. Now, let’s move on. What about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Fine. My mother had…well, she was always a bit frail, to be honest. Lots of aches and pains. And my father…he was strong, a farmer. But he died young, heart attack. That’s about it. No one else particularly remarkable. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with me eating dirt! It’s probably just a vitamin deficiency or something. Can we just check for that? And then maybe give me something to boost my energy? I really don't have time for all this probing. .
DOCTOR: “Just a vitamin deficiency” is a remarkably simplistic assessment, Ms. Hardenburgh. A family history of heart disease is relevant, as is the unexplained pica. Now, do you use tobacco or alcohol, or any recreational substances?
