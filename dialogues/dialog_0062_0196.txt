DOCTOR: Hi Janie, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s…nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, I don't even remember how I scheduled this appointment. Something about being…tired all the time? It’s just…everything feels like a big blur these days. I just want to get this sorted, if that makes sense. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Janie. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed and a bit foggy sometimes, especially when you're dealing with fatigue. And don't worry about not remembering the specifics of the appointment – it happens! We'll figure things out. Okay, I see here you mentioned feeling tired. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, "tired" doesn't even begin to cover it. It’s…not like needing a nap tired. It’s like…everything is heavy. Moving is heavy. Talking is heavy. Even thinking feels heavy. It's been going on for…well, a long time. Months, I think? Maybe longer. It's hard to say. I just…don’t have the energy to keep track anymore. Does that make any sense? It’s just…constant.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Janie. That sounds incredibly draining. “Heavy” is a good way to describe it. Constant fatigue that impacts everything you do is definitely something we need to look into. Months, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, months. Honestly, I wish I could be more precise. My husband…he always kept track of everything. Dates, appointments, what I ate…everything. But…he’s gone now. And I…I’m just not good at that sort of thing. It feels like it’s all just…one long stretch of exhaustion. Maybe six months? It could be eight. I really don’t know. I just know it hasn't gotten any better.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Janie. That’s a huge loss, and it's completely understandable that keeping track of things has become more difficult. Please don’t worry about being precise – we'll work with what you can remember. Okay. So, this constant fatigue has been going on for around six to eight months, perhaps longer. Has anything specific seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Specific…? Hmm. Nothing really jumps out. I try to…do what I always did. Go to the shops, a bit of gardening…but it all just…takes so much effort now. And I sleep, you know? Plenty of sleep. But it doesn't help. If anything, waking up is worse. I feel even more…drained. No, nothing specific. It’s just…always there, a background hum of…weariness. I don't drink or smoke, if that matters. And I try to eat…okay. My husband always made sure I ate well. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the sleep and the lack of smoking or drinking – those are important things. It sounds incredibly frustrating to be getting plenty of sleep and still feel exhausted. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind. It's just a standard review of systems to rule things out. We’ll start with…have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Questions are fine, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. Appetite…hmm. I eat, like I said. But I don't really…enjoy it anymore. It's just…fuel. No real taste. And weight… I probably lost a little, but honestly, I haven’t weighed myself in ages. My scales broke. Yes, that’s it. They just…stopped working. Everything feels…effortful. I don't have the energy to bother with things like weighing myself. Does that answer your question? I don't really keep track of those details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Janie. It sounds like you’ve experienced a decrease in appetite and enjoyment of food, with some weight loss, though you haven’t been actively tracking it. Okay. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Um. Well. Look, Doctor, I’m not really one for… discussing those sorts of things. Is it… necessary? Everything feels… off, yes. But I don't really want to go into details. It’s all just… unpleasant. Can we maybe skip that question? It’s really none of your business. I came here about being tired, not… that. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be rude. It’s just…personal.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not being rude, Janie. I completely understand. It's perfectly okay to skip any question you’re not comfortable answering. My apologies for asking – I sometimes forget that these questions can be very personal. Let's move on then. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats lately?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Yes, that's much better. Fever…no. No fever. Chills…maybe a little sometimes, but it’s cold in the house. Old house, drafty windows. Night sweats…no, not really. I get a bit warm sometimes, but that’s just…being under the blankets. No, no fever, chills, or sweats. Just…tired. Really, really tired. Is this going to take much longer? I have… things to do. It feels important, even if I can’t remember what they are.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills or night sweats. That’s good to know. And don’t worry, we are getting close to finishing up the initial questions. Last few questions, I promise. Have you noticed any changes in your mood recently – feeling unusually sad, anxious, or irritable?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor. Honestly? What isn’t changed? Everything is…grey. Not sad, not happy, just…empty. And yes, irritable. My neighbour asked me about my gardening, and I…I just snapped at her. I felt terrible afterwards, but I just…didn’t have the energy to be polite. I’m just…on edge all the time. I don’t enjoy anything anymore. Is this what it’s like getting old? Everything just…fading away? It’s all very… upsetting. Is there a test for this? A pill, perhaps? Just something to make it stop?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been experiencing a significant shift in your mood, feeling emotionally empty, and more easily irritated. And it’s completely understandable that you’re looking for a way to make it stop. It’s very brave of you to share that, Janie. It doesn't sound like getting old, Janie. What you're describing are definitely things we need to explore further. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. I suppose it doesn’t matter. Nothing seems to make a difference anyway. I’ll just sit here, I guess. But don't take too long. And please, no poking and prodding if you can avoid it. I'm not very good with…that sort of thing. It tires me out.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janie. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Okay, just relax your arm for me… Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… Breathing sounds are clear, but a little diminished. Now, let's just take a look at your ears… Ears look normal. And just open your mouth for me, please… Throat looks clear as well. Everything seems okay so far. Now, can you squeeze my hand as hard as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It’s…harder than it looks. Everything just feels… flimsy. Like I haven't got any strength left. I used to be so strong, you know? Gardening, housework…I could do it all. Now… Now I just want to lie down. Is that all? Can I go now? I feel…drained. Just even talking is exhausting. I need a nap, I think. A very long nap. And maybe a cup of tea. But even that sounds like too much effort. .
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Janie. Your grip strength is a little reduced, but that could be due to several things. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing significant fatigue, a decrease in appetite and weight, some emotional changes, and reduced strength. I want to order some blood tests to check for things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and inflammation. We'll also check your kidney and liver function. While we wait for the results, I'd also like to discuss a referral to a therapist. It sounds like you're going through a lot emotionally, and talking to someone could be very helpful. Would you like me to go over the blood test details with you?
