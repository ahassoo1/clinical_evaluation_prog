DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… maybe three days now. Not real bad, but… always there. Like a… a weight.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant ache in the back of your head for about three days now. You describe it as feeling like a weight. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's not… sharp. Not a pounding. Just… dull. Like someone is squeezing. And it's… worse when I stand for too long. I used to work on the trains, you know? Rail yard. Lots of standing. Maybe that's it? I don't know. It’s just… old man things, probably.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Brum. It’s good you’re bringing this to my attention, regardless of what it may be. The fact that it’s worse with standing is certainly relevant information. To get a better understanding, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well… mostly just around the house now. My wife… she passed last year. So… I cook. And I try to keep the yard tidy. Small yard, thankfully. I walk a little, but not much. Used to be… very active. Lots of lifting, fixing things… on the rails. Now… mostly just sitting. Watching the birds.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. That must be very difficult. It's good you're staying active as you are, even with the change in routines. Now, focusing on the headache, would you say anything specifically makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… laying down, maybe? Yes. When I lay down, it… eases up. Not gone, but… not so bad. And… sometimes, a cool cloth on my forehead. My wife… she always used to do that for me when I had a bad day working.
DOCTOR: Laying down and a cool cloth offer some relief. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. No blurry vision. No… dizziness. Not sick to my stomach. Maybe… a little tired, but… I'm an old man, Doctor. Always a little tired. I don't know if that counts.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll consider everything. No visual disturbances, no dizziness or nausea. Just a general feeling of fatigue, which, as you say, is understandable. Now, Mr. Brum, can you tell me about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with, or any major illnesses you've had?
PATIENT: Hmm… let's see. I had the flu, bad, when I was a boy. And… when I was working on the rails, I broke my arm once. Fell off a… a flatcar. Needed a cast. And… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. Years ago. Gave me some pills. Didn’t like taking them, so… I stopped. Bad idea, probably.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information with me, Mr. Brum. It’s important for me to have a complete picture. So, to clarify, you’ve had the flu in the past, a broken arm, and were diagnosed with high blood pressure but stopped taking medication for it. Do you remember what medication you were prescribed for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: I don’t… remember the name, Doctor. Small white pill. I think… it started with an 'H'? Or maybe a 'B'? Something like that. My wife… she always handled the pills. I just took them. I didn’t pay much attention.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Brum. We can often look that up in your records if available. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had any problems with that. I can eat anything. Take any medicine. Never caused me trouble. Except maybe… worry. That gives me a headache. But that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Brum, worry isn't an allergy! Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had… stomach trouble. For a long time. Doctor said it was… ulcers, maybe? And my father… he died young. Heart, I think. Sudden. But… that was a long time ago. We didn’t have good doctors back then. And… that's about all I remember, Doctor. My brother… he was healthy as a horse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Brum. That’s helpful. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked. My wife… she hated it. Said it smelled terrible. I didn’t want to upset her. And I never had the urge, either. Never liked the idea.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Brum. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little sometimes, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner. Maybe… two, on a special occasion. Nothing much. Not like some of those young fellows. I mostly drink water. Keeps me healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Mr. Brum, thank you for answering all of my questions. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me if it’s going to hurt. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Please extend your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 152/88. That’s a little elevated. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but you have diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Reflexes are normal and strength is good bilaterally. No apparent focal neurological deficits. Now, I’m going to gently palpate the back of your head and neck to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasms. There is some tenderness to palpation at the base of the occipital bone and mild muscle spasm in the neck muscles. No signs of any obvious masses.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds… complicated. That's where it hurts the most. Feels… tight. Like a knot. What do you think it is? Is it… serious? I'm not wanting any… bad news.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're letting me know about the tenderness, Mr. Brum. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, it seems like you may be experiencing a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by muscle tension in your neck. The elevated blood pressure could also be contributing. However, given your age and the persistence of the headache, I want to be thorough and rule out any other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health and inflammatory markers. I'm also considering an imaging study, like an MRI of the brain, to get a clearer picture of the structures in your head and neck. This is just a precaution, to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… MRI… Sounds expensive, Doctor. I don’t have insurance, you know. And I don't want to be a bother. Maybe it is just old age. Maybe I just need to rest more. Is there… anything else I can do? Like… some medicine to take for the pain? Something cheap?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost, Mr. Brum, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. We can certainly discuss options to minimize costs, and I will work with you to find the most affordable path forward. There may be programs available to assist with the cost of testing. In the meantime, we can address the pain. For now, I can prescribe an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen, as long as you don’t have any kidney problems or stomach ulcers. We can also try a muscle relaxant, but I would need to assess your overall health more carefully before prescribing that. To help manage the pain at home, I recommend applying heat or ice to your neck, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing exercises, and ensuring you stay well-hydrated. Would you like me to write you a prescription for an over-the-counter pain reliever and provide you with some information on relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be… very helpful. Just something for the pain. I don't want to bother with the expensive tests right now. Maybe… maybe it will go away on its own. And… the information on relaxation… that sounds good too. I used to… garden a lot. That was relaxing. Thank you, Doctor. You've been… very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help. I’m writing you a prescription for ibuprofen. Take two tablets every 6-8 hours as needed for pain, but do not exceed six tablets in a 24-hour period. Here is the prescription and some information on relaxation techniques. I’m also including a list of local resources for senior care and support. I want to emphasize that if the headache worsens, if you experience any new symptoms such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, or if you become concerned at any point, please seek immediate medical attention. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to reassess your condition. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfect. A few weeks. I'll try the medicine and… relax. Thank you again. You've put my mind at ease. I guess I’ll be seeing you then. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I will see you in a few weeks. Have a good day as well, Mr. Brum.
