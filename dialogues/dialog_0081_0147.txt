DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a lump in your lower abdomen. And how long exactly is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… maybe three or four months now? It didn’t bother me at first, really. It just… felt like something was there. It hasn’t gotten significantly bigger, but it hasn’t gone away either.
DOCTOR: Right, so three to four months. And you say it hasn’t grown significantly. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…firm, I think. Not really soft, but not rock hard either. About the size of a plum, maybe a little smaller? It’s located… kind of in the center, just below my belly button. It doesn't really hurt to touch, unless I press quite hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, a plum-sized firm lump, centrally located below the umbilicus, and tender only with deep palpation. Has anything else changed?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think... No, not really. My bowel movements have been regular, no change in appetite, and I haven’t noticed any weight loss. No fever or anything like that either. Just the lump.
DOCTOR: No changes in bowel habits, appetite, or weight, no systemic symptoms. And you've had this for three to four months… Now, let's get a bit more detailed. Have you noticed any pain associated with it at all – even if it’s not constant?
PATIENT: Hmm, now that you mention it… sometimes, after I’ve been doing a lot of physical work – I’m a choreographer, so I’m on my feet and moving a lot – I get a bit of a dull ache in that area. But it’s not severe, and it usually goes away after I rest. It’s hard to say if it’s from the lump, or just muscle soreness, honestly.
DOCTOR: A dull ache with exertion… interesting. And you are a choreographer, so physical activity is a regular part of your life. Now, let's move on. Any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all with urination. Everything seems normal there. No pain, no difficulty, no frequency changes, nothing. I haven’t noticed anything different at all in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, do you have any significant medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic conditions like diabetes or heart problems, nothing like that. My wife says I’m generally quite healthy. I have Medicare, so I get my regular check-ups, and those have always been fine.
DOCTOR: "Generally quite healthy," you say. And no past surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Not at all. I was very careful as a young man, always tried to avoid things that might need one! My wife likes to exaggerate, I think. She just worries about me. But truly, no surgeries. I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of abdominal issues, cancers, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That's a tough one... My mother had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don’t know what exactly. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about medical things much. No one that I know of had any kind of cancer, no. My wife's side of the family is all very healthy too, as far as I know. I'm not sure about further back, though - our families weren't very good at keeping records. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Not particularly. Now, do you take any medications, regularly or occasionally?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. I try to stay away from them if I can. Just a cup of tea in the morning, that's it. Nothing prescribed, nothing over-the-counter. I really pride myself on being healthy enough to not need anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to need to examine your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. I will start with auscultation, then palpation. Please let me know if anything is tender or uncomfortable. And, please, try to relax your muscles. It makes it easier for me to get an accurate assessment.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I’ll lie down on the table. I’ll try to relax, but as you know, choreographers are always tense! I'll let you know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Breathing appears normal, bowel sounds are…present, but somewhat diminished. Hmm. And where is this lump you described?
PATIENT: It's right here. See? It’s not very prominent when I’m lying down, I think. But it’s definitely there. I can feel it, at least. Please let me know if you need me to adjust my position. It's a little cool in here, too, if that might make things tense.
DOCTOR: Yes, I feel a firm, approximately plum-sized mass. It is relatively subtle. It appears to be fixed, not freely mobile. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Hmm. And does this feel the same as you remember?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. That’s how it feels. It hasn’t changed in size or consistency that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t feel painful when you press on it, just…firm. I’m not sure what else to tell you, honestly. I’ve been trying not to poke at it too much, I didn’t want to irritate it. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Fixed, non-tender mass… size approximately 3 x 4 centimeters. Given the fixation and your description, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. I need to order some imaging. We'll start with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. That will give us a better look at the mass and help determine its nature. It could be a number of things, and it's too early to jump to conclusions. But it’s important to investigate further.
PATIENT: A CT scan… okay. That sounds…serious. Is it something I should be very worried about? I just…I’ve never had a scan before. What exactly does it involve, and will it be painful?
DOCTOR: Mr. Raghunathan, while the finding is concerning enough to warrant investigation, it doesn’t automatically equate to a dire diagnosis. It simply means we need more information. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdominal organs. You will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You will be asked to hold your breath for short periods. You will receive intravenous contrast dye to enhance the images. As for pain, most people experience minimal discomfort. You may feel a slight warmth during the dye injection. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the contrast, which is why we'll ask about allergies beforehand, and have medication available if needed. Now, do you have any known allergies, particularly to iodine or shellfish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies. Not to iodine, not to shellfish, nothing at all. My wife is the one with the allergies, always carrying an EpiPen… I’m generally quite robust, as I said. So, if I understand correctly, it's not necessarily bad news, just… information gathering?
DOCTOR: "Robust" is not a medical term, Mr. Raghunathan. And yes, you are correct. It is, at this stage, information gathering. We need to determine the exact nature of this mass. I will write the order for the CT scan now. You’ll need to schedule it at the radiology department. The report will be sent to me, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with my…robustness. I'll schedule the scan as soon as I can. And I will contact you if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect you to follow up promptly. I'll see you then. .
