DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. Welcome. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's...my nails. They just...look funny. Not good funny. They changed. I don’t know what changed, exactly. Just…different. I noticed it a few weeks ago, maybe? It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: “Changed” how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. Like…the color, I think? And they feel…thicker? Not smooth. I don’t paint ‘em or anything. Never have. It's just…weird. I don’t know what else to tell ya. It’s not like I’m a fancy lady who does all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a change in color and texture… and this has been going on for a few weeks. Do you notice any pain or discomfort with them?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Not pain. Just…annoying. They catch on things sometimes, like my clothes. And I keep looking at them, which is… distracting. It’s just…not right. I don’t get fancy pedicures or anything, so I don’t know what would cause this. Is it something I caught? From…somewhere?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely you “caught” something, Ms. Thut. Though it's good you thought to ask. Changes in nails can be due to many things – sometimes it's nothing, sometimes it needs looking into. Have you noticed any changes anywhere else?
PATIENT: Changes…elsewhere? Like…where? On my skin? I dunno. I mostly just look at my nails, honestly. Everything else is…fine, I guess. I mean, I’m not spring chicken anymore, ya know? Things change. But my nails…that’s what’s bothering me. Is it, like, a fungus or something? Because that sounds awful. I don’t do gyms or public pools or nothin’. I mostly stay home.
DOCTOR: A fungus is one possibility, Ms. Thut, but let’s not jump to conclusions. Now, tell me, have you had any recent illnesses, even a simple cold?
PATIENT: Hmm…a cold? Let me think… It was…last winter, I think. A bad one. Kept me in bed for a week. But that was ages ago. And I haven’t been sick since. Just…tired. Regular tired. Old lady tired, ya know? Does that matter? I just figured it was my age. And the weather, it's been hot, makes ya sluggish. Is that what you're askin’?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… Oh, just the pills for my water. You know, for the swelling. My feet swell up somethin’ fierce if I don’t take ‘em. And…sometimes I take something for my tummy. When it acts up. But that’s not every day. It’s… a little pink pill. I don't really pay attention to the names, my daughter fills it for me. Is that important? It's been years, I think.
DOCTOR: It’s always important, Ms. Thut. Do you happen to know the name of the pill for your water, or the one for your tummy?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? No. Like I said, my daughter handles all that. She’s very good with…medicine stuff. I just take ‘em when she tells me to. One’s a little white one, and the other one is…pink, like I said. And round. Look, I came in about my nails. Are you gonna look at them or keep askin' about pills I don’t even know the names of? It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Let's have a look then. Please extend your hands, palms up. I’ll need to examine your nails more closely. Now, don't worry, it won't hurt. But I need you to be patient.
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up, will ya? I’ve got things to do. And don’t make a mess. I just had a manicure, and I don’t want you to ruin it. Oh wait…nevermind. I don’t get manicures. It’s just… the quicker you do it, the better.
DOCTOR: Hmm… Yes, I see. There is some discoloration, a yellowish tinge… and the texture is indeed thicker than normal. I also notice some slight pitting on a few nails. No active inflammation, thankfully. It could be a fungal infection, as we discussed, but the pitting is a bit concerning. It can also be indicative of…other things. Do you have any family history of nail problems, skin conditions, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Auto…what now? Look, my mother had bad feet. Always complainin’ about ‘em. Bunions, and…calluses, I think. And my sister, she had some kinda rash once, but it went away. She said it was from…poison ivy. But that was years ago. We don't talk much anymore. And…my grandfather? He had some kinda…problem with his skin. I don’t know what kind. It was a long time ago, before I was born. Look, are my nails gonna fall off or something? I don't want my nails to fall off. I need my nails. Is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: Your nails are not going to fall off, Ms. Thut. Now, this is why it’s important to have a thorough history. The pitting and discoloration, combined with your family history, suggests we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to order some lab tests – a fungal culture, and a complete blood count. It’s just to be thorough. I will also need you to see a dermatologist, just to confirm everything. I can give you a referral. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests? A…dermatologist? Ugh. More doctors. And more waitin’. My daughter’s gonna be so mad. She always tells me to just go to one doctor, not run around to a bunch of ‘em. Is this gonna cost a lot of money? My Medicare only covers so much, ya know? I don't wanna have a big bill. And…what if they find somethin’ bad? Like, really bad? I just want my nails to look normal again. Can't you just give me a cream or somethin’?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I understand your concerns, but we need to get to the bottom of this. A cream won’t address the underlying cause. The lab tests are relatively simple, and your Medicare should cover most of the cost, but I can’t guarantee it. As for “something bad,” let's not borrow trouble. Most likely, it's a fungal infection, and it’s treatable. However, given your family history, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to refer you to Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s an excellent dermatologist. Here’s the referral information. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, keep your nails clean and dry, and avoid any harsh chemicals or trauma to the area. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. I guess not. I mean, I don't want any more tests, but… alright. Just…tell my daughter I said hi. And that I did what you told me to. She’s gonna be so mad about the dermatologist. Can I just…go now? My feet are killin’ me, and I wanna go home and sit down. And maybe paint my nails a pretty color, just to forget about all this. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Thut, you may go. And it’s perfectly acceptable to paint your nails. Perhaps a cheerful shade will lift your spirits. Just remember to follow up with Dr. Sharma promptly. Have a good day. .
