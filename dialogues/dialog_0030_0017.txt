DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Laquanta Quicksey, and I’m a family medicine physician. It’s August 2nd. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... the… the papers said somethin’ ‘bout a tryout. For… sports. I think. My niece, she filled out a lot of things. I mostly just… show up where I’m told. It’s for… bein’ on a team, right? I ain't been on a team in… a long time. A long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you’re here for a sports physical, as part of a team tryout. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll get you checked out to make sure you're fit to participate. To start, can you tell me a little bit about which team you're trying out for, and what kind of activities the tryout will involve?
PATIENT: The… team? Oh, boy. See, that's where things get blurry. My niece, bless her heart, she signed me up for… somethin’ with a ball. I think. And runnin’. Definitely runnin’. It’s… older folks, I think. Not… the young ones. She said it was good exercise. The name… it was… somethin’ with… eagles? Or… lions? I really don’t remember. They got balls, and we run. That’s all I really know. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bartok. Don't worry about the specifics. We can still proceed with a general sports physical to assess your overall health. It's good you're taking this step, regardless! Before we move on to the physical exam, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… well, my back gets a little achy sometimes, from liftin’ things at the job. And my knees, they creak a bit when it's cold. But that's just gettin' old, right? The doctor before… he gave me somethin’ for the knees, a long time ago. Pills, I think. I don’t really remember what for. And… I had a bad cold last winter, but I got over it. Other than that… nothin’ much. I think. I ain’t one for doctors, usually. Only go when somethin’ really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like some typical age-related aches and pains, and a cold last winter. We’ll definitely check your knees and back during the exam. You mentioned you took some pills for your knees in the past – do you remember who prescribed them, or what they were for?
PATIENT: Pills… now, that's a hard one. Old Doctor Henderson, maybe? He retired years ago. Small office… down by the bakery. As for what they were for… honestly, Doc, my memory ain't what it used to be. He just said somethin’ ‘bout the joints. Little white pills, I think. I took ‘em for a while, then… stopped. They didn’t seem to do much, if I’m bein’ honest. I just used some liniment my mother used to make, that worked better. Smelled terrible, but it did the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. We’ll make a note to try and obtain those records if possible, though it sounds like they were quite some time ago. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I don’t like takin' pills if I can help it. I take some… Tylenol maybe, if my back’s really botherin' me, but not every day. Just when I need it. And sometimes, a little somethin’ for heartburn, after a spicy meal. But that’s it. Just the basics. I try to eat healthy, mostly. My niece keeps me on the straight and narrow, you know? She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. Not that I know of. I ate peanuts all my life, never had a problem. Shellfish, too. Bees stung me a couple of times as a kid, and I got a little swollen, but nothin’ serious. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that’s usually from the soap. No, I don’t think I got any real allergies. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. My mother always said I was a strong boy. Good constitution, she called it. So I reckon I don't got much to be allergic to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Bartok. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Not that I remember. When I was a little boy… maybe somethin’ with my tonsils? But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. And… I got a bad cut on my hand at the job, years ago, they stitched it up, but that ain't really a surgery, is it? Other than that… no. I always tried to stay out of the hospital if I could. Too much bother. No, I don’t think I’ve ever had a proper surgery. Just a few stitches here and there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh, boy. That's a long story. My father… he was a strong man, worked hard all his life. He had… somethin’ with his heart, I think. Died when I was young. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, bad in her hands. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. Lots of folks in my family had… problems with their stomachs, too. But other than that… nothin’ much I can recall. It's a big family, Doc. Hard to keep track of everybody’s ailments. Mostly just folks gettin’ old, you know? It’s just the way of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Heart issues in your father, arthritis in your mother, and stomach problems in the family. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother, she always said they were terrible for you. And I seen enough folks sufferin’ with coughin’ and wheezin’ to stay away from ‘em. No, sir. Never had the urge. Clean livin’, mostly. Except for the occasional sweet treat, but my niece keeps me in line with that. She’s got a good head on her shoulders, that one.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. On special occasions. A beer with the boys now and then, at the ball game. Or a glass of wine with dinner, if my niece is makin’ somethin’ fancy. But nothin’ much. I don't go out drinkin' every night, if that's what you're askin'. Just enough to relax a little. Not a big drinker, never have been. Always preferred a good cup of coffee, myself. A nice strong cup of coffee. That’s what keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, one last question before we move on to the physical exam. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I work construction, mostly. Been doin' it for years. Buildin' things. Houses, mostly. Sometimes roads, sometimes fixin' things. It's hard work, but it keeps me movin'. Good honest work. Keeps the body strong, you know? Liftin', hammerin', climbin’… It ain’t easy on the back sometimes, but what can you do? Gotta earn a livin'. And I like seein’ somethin’ I built standin’ tall. That’s a good feelin’. A very good feelin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok, that's a lot of helpful information. It sounds like you lead an active life, despite the demands of your job. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to proceed with a physical exam. We’ll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your joints. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Whatever you need. I ain’t afraid of a little pokin’ and proddin’. Just try not to take too long, alright? I got things to do. But take your time. I’m patient. Mostly. Just let me know if anything hurts. And be gentle with the knees, alright? They ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll go at your pace. First, let’s just step on the scale here. Okay, you're 160 pounds. And your height is… 5 foot 8 inches. Now, if you wouldn’t mind removing your shirt and shoes, we can proceed with the rest of the exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… don't stare too much. Been workin’ in the sun for years, you know? Skin ain’t what it used to be. And don’t mind the little marks and scratches. Comes with the job. It’s honest work, like I said. Honest, hard work. But yeah, go ahead. Do your listenin’. Just try not to be too cold with that thing. Gets chilly sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths are good. Your heart sounds regular, good and strong. No murmurs or unusual sounds. Your lungs are clear, good breath sounds on both sides. No wheezing or crackling. Now, let’s check your reflexes. I’m going to lightly tap on your knees and elbows with this little hammer. This won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is fairly common with age, but still within normal limits. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. Can you bend your knees and elbows for me?
PATIENT: Ugh… there we go. Creaky as an old ship, that’s what they are. I told you. Years of climbin’ ladders and liftin’ heavy stuff. My elbows are a little better, but the knees… not so much. There's a little… somethin’ in there. Not too bad, but you can feel it. Like… gravel, maybe? I ain’t been doin’ too much runnin’ lately, that’s for sure. Feels better when I get up and move around, though. Keeps ‘em from gettin’ too stiff. You feel anythin’ strange, Doctor? You gotta tell me. I ain't afraid of a little ache, but I don't want nothin' broken.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some crepitus in both knees, which you described, and a little mild tenderness with movement. No significant swelling or warmth. It sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis, which is very common with age and activity level. Your elbows and wrists have full range of motion and no tenderness. Now, I’m just going to quickly listen to your abdomen, and then we’ll be all done with the physical exam. Your abdomen sounds normal. No tenderness or masses. Everything sounds good. Okay, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright, good. Glad that’s over. Not too painful, all in all. Just creaky, as I said. So, what’s the verdict, Doc? Can I go runnin’ with them young folks, or am I too old for all that? Just tell me straight. I ain’t one for sugar-coatin’. Is it somethin’ serious? Do I need pills? Gotta know. My niece is gonna be askin', you know. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. It’s good you asked. From the physical exam, you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which is very common with age and activity. It's not serious, but it is something we need to manage to prevent it from getting worse. Running full-out with a team might be a little risky right now, especially without proper conditioning. It could aggravate your knees. However, I don't think it's out of the question, with some precautions. I recommend starting with a low-impact exercise program to strengthen the muscles around your knees and improve your flexibility. Things like walking, swimming, or cycling would be good. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options, like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you experience any discomfort. And physical therapy could be very beneficial to help you build strength and improve your technique. I’m not recommending pills right away, but we can discuss that if the over-the-counter options aren’t enough. The goal is to keep you active and comfortable. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… so, no runnin’ right away. That's what I figured. Low-impact… that sounds boring. I like a little challenge, you know? Walkin' ain't exactly gonna get my heart pumpin’. And pills… I still ain’t keen on the pills. Physical therapy… what's that even involve? Is it gonna be a lot of bendin’ and stretchin’? And how much is all this gonna cost? Gotta think about my budget, you know? My niece helps, but I gotta be responsible. Is it somethin’ I can do at home? Or do I gotta go to some fancy clinic? Just lay it on me straight, Doc. I ain't lookin' for miracles, just wanna know what my options are.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Bartok. Let's tackle them one by one. Physical therapy involves exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knees, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper techniques to reduce stress on your joints. It's not just bending and stretching, although that will be part of it. The therapist will also work with you to develop a personalized exercise program that you can do at home. Initially, you would go to a clinic for a few sessions to learn the exercises and get guidance from a professional. Then, you would continue the program at home with their instructions. The cost of physical therapy varies depending on your insurance coverage and the clinic. Since you have Medicare, it should cover a significant portion of the cost. We can also discuss options for more affordable clinics if you're concerned about the cost. I can provide you with a referral to a few highly-rated physical therapy clinics in the area and their contact information, so you can check their rates and coverage. Before you commit to anything, I also recommend starting slowly with the low-impact exercises and seeing how your knees respond. If you experience any pain or discomfort, stop immediately and consult with me. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. That don't sound too bad. Checkin' around, slow start… I can do that. Don't wanna rush into nothin'. Medicare coverin’ it… that’s good. That's a big help. Referrals… yeah, gimme those referrals. I’ll look ‘em up, see what they got to offer. And gimme a heads-up on what kinda exercises I should be doin’ in the meantime, just to get started. Light walkin’ alright? Maybe some stretchin’? Gotta keep the body movin’, you know? Can't just sit around and let it get rusty. So, what kinda walkin’ we talkin’? Fast? Slow? Gotta be specific, Doc. I ain’t one for guessin’. And what about them stretches? Gimme a list. A simple list. Don’t need no fancy yoga moves or nothin’. Just… simple. Understand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. Simple is best. For walking, start with 20-30 minutes of moderate-paced walking most days of the week. Moderate means you should be able to talk comfortably, but your heart rate should be slightly elevated. If you can sing while you’re walking, it’s too slow. If you're too out of breath to talk, it’s too fast. For stretches, let’s focus on your hamstrings, quads, and calves. Hamstring stretch: Sit on the floor with your legs extended and reach for your toes. Hold for 30 seconds. Quad stretch: Stand and hold your foot behind you, gently pulling it towards your buttock. Hold for 30 seconds. Calf stretch: Lean against a wall with one leg extended behind you and your heel on the ground. Hold for 30 seconds. Do each stretch three times, holding for 30 seconds each time. Make sure to warm up your muscles before stretching, with a few minutes of light walking. I'm also going to give you a handout with some additional information on osteoarthritis and exercises to strengthen your knees. Is that helpful?
PATIENT: Alright. That ain't too bad. Hamstrings… quads… calves… I think I can remember that. Thirty seconds each… good. Not too complicated. And a handout, eh? Good. Gotta have somethin’ to refer to, my memory ain’t what it used to be. So, that's it? Walkin’ and stretchin’, check around for physical therapy… and don't break anything? You think… you think I can still try out for that team? If I do all this, and I don’t feel too bad? I ain’t lookin’ for a gold medal or nothin’, just wanna give it a shot. My niece signed me up, I gotta at least try, right? But I don’t wanna hurt myself. Gotta be realistic. You think… you think it's worth tryin’? Honestly. Don't sugarcoat it, Doc. Tell me straight.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Bartok, and one that’s important to address. Given your age and your history of working in construction, there's always a risk of injury. However, if you follow the exercise program, listen to your body, and gradually increase your activity level, I think it's worth trying. But you need to be realistic. Don’t push yourself too hard, and stop immediately if you experience any pain. Start with light drills and slowly increase the intensity over time. It's okay to modify the exercises to suit your abilities. And remember, I’m here to support you. If you experience any discomfort or have any concerns, don’t hesitate to contact me. It’s important to prioritize your safety and listen to your body. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up for today?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. No pushin’ it… listen to the body… I can do that. I ain’t lookin’ for trouble, just wanna give it a shot. I think… I think that's all. You covered everything. Walkin’, stretchin’, check around for physical therapy, listen to the body, don't break anything… I appreciate it, Doc. You been very helpful. A lot more helpful than I expected, to be honest. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I gotta go walkin’. And stretchin’. Don’t wanna waste no time. Thanks again, Doc. And… I’ll let you know how it goes. Maybe. If I don't pull a muscle or somethin'. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. It was my pleasure. Remember, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Good luck with your tryout, and have a good day! .
