DOCTOR: Hi Jaxston, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too, I think. Right, well, I've been getting these… headaches. Pretty bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they happen, and my heart feels like it's racing. It's been going on for a bit now, on and off. Honestly, I can't really pinpoint when it started, just… sometime ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, sweating, and a racing heart. That definitely sounds concerning. “Sometime ago” is a little vague – can you try to remember if anything specific was happening around the time you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, that’s the thing. I'm really bad with dates. And remembering things, generally. It wasn't… recent, I don't think. Maybe… last year? Or the year before? I got divorced a while back, so maybe around then? Everything was a bit of a blur, to be honest. I was pretty stressed. It’s hard to say if the headaches started then, or if I just noticed them because I was stressed. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jaxston. Big life changes like a divorce are incredibly stressful, and stress can absolutely trigger headaches. It's also common to not remember exact timelines when you've been under a lot of pressure. So, these headaches have been happening on and off since around the time of your divorce, about a year or so ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. On and off. They're not constant, thankfully. But when they hit, they hit hard. Like… really bad pressure in my head, and then the sweating and the heart racing. It usually lasts… I don’t know, an hour or two maybe? And then it just… fades. I haven’t really done anything about it, to be honest. Just tried to sleep it off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intense pressure headaches lasting an hour or two, accompanied by sweating and a racing heart. Have you noticed anything that triggers these headaches?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… I haven’t really kept track, to be honest. I mean, nothing specific that I’ve noticed. Sometimes it happens when I'm tired, I think? And maybe if I haven't eaten in a while? But I get tired and hungry a lot, so that doesn't really narrow it down, does it? I wish I could be more helpful. I'm just trying to remember what happened during the headache, never really what happened before it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jaxston. It’s common to focus on how you feel during an episode, not necessarily what led up to it. So, tiredness and hunger seem like possible triggers, but not consistently. Are there any other symptoms you experience with the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, like I might be sick, but I haven’t actually been sick. And… sometimes things look a bit blurry when I’m having one, but that could just be from the pressure, right? Oh, and I get really sensitive to light. Bright lights are awful when I’ve got a headache. I usually just have to lie down in a dark room.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea, blurry vision, and sensitivity to light – that's helpful information. And lying down in a dark room helps, which makes sense. Have you noticed any weakness, numbness, or tingling in your arms or legs during these headaches?
PATIENT: No, no weakness or anything like that. Just the headache, the sweating, the racing heart, the nausea… and the blurry vision. Everything feels pretty normal otherwise, I think. Actually… now that you mention it, sometimes I feel a bit confused when I'm having one. Like I can't quite think straight. But it goes away when the headache does. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, confusion during the headache is important to note. Jaxston, I’m going to ask a few questions about your past medical history, just to get a better overall picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much in the last… well, in a long time. I was healthy enough, I thought. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but nothing serious. No high blood pressure, no diabetes… nothing like that. I think my ex-wife took care of all that stuff when we were together, and I just… never really asked. Does that sound bad?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Jaxston. It's more important to focus on getting things sorted now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Just the usual bumps and scrapes when I was a kid. Oh, wait… I broke my arm once when I was about ten, playing football. But that was ages ago, and it healed fine. Does that count? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: That does count, thank you for mentioning it. And it sounds like it healed well without any lasting issues. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… my mum's still alive, she's okay. Bit of a worrier, that's all. My dad… he passed away a few years back. He had… heart problems, I think? Something to do with his blood pressure being too high. And my sister… she's healthy as a horse, always has been. She's a nurse, actually. I don’t really know much about anyone else’s medical history, to be honest. We weren't very close. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It does help, thank you. Your father's history of heart problems and high blood pressure is relevant. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. My ex-wife used to smoke, but I always made her go outside. It always bothered me. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh, I drink… sometimes. Not a lot, though. A couple of beers on a Friday night, maybe? Or a glass of wine with dinner. Nothing serious. It’s been… less since the divorce, to be honest. I didn't really feel like it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jaxston. And finally, do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. Maybe the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but just whatever you get at the pharmacy. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. That’s about it, I think. I’ve told you everything I can remember, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jaxston, thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I’m a bit nervous, but… I’m glad you’re looking into this. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 140/90 on both arms. That's something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a normal heart rhythm. Lungs are clear. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. No obvious abnormalities. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll gently palpate your neck. No tenderness, no enlarged nodes. Everything feels… normal. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Can you do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can do that. Is that okay? Everything seems… fine, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect. Your eye movements are normal. Okay, Jaxston, based on what you've told me and the quick exam, your symptoms – the headaches, sweating, racing heart, nausea, sensitivity to light, and occasional confusion – combined with your slightly elevated blood pressure, could point to a few possibilities. One thing we need to rule out is migraine. However, the fact that your blood pressure is elevated is concerning, and the symptoms could also be related to that. It's also possible – given your father's history – that you're experiencing some anxiety-related symptoms that are exacerbating the situation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your overall health, including your blood sugar, kidney function, thyroid levels, and electrolytes. We should also do an EKG – that's a quick test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. Finally, I think it would be helpful to get a basic metabolic panel, to check on your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… alright. Blood tests, EKG… whatever you think is best. It all sounds a bit scary, to be honest. But… I want to know what’s going on. Will the tests tell me what’s wrong? And… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel a little scared, Jaxston, but these tests are routine and will give us valuable information. They will help us narrow down the possibilities and figure out the best course of action. The tests themselves shouldn't take long – the blood draw will be quick, and the EKG is non-invasive. The results usually take a few days to come back – typically 2-3 business days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can. You can get a relatively inexpensive home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Take it twice a day – morning and evening – and write down the readings. Also, try to manage your stress levels – practice deep breathing exercises, get enough sleep, and stay hydrated. And if your symptoms worsen – if you experience severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or any new neurological symptoms – go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, monitor my blood pressure, manage stress, and go to the emergency room if things get worse. I can do that. I’ll get a blood pressure monitor today. And… I’ll try to relax more. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a bit better just knowing we’re doing something. So… what do I need to do now? Where do I go for the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. I'm glad you feel a bit better. I'll give you a lab requisition form for the blood tests. The closest lab is at 123 Main Street, right here in town. You don’t need an appointment, just bring the form with you and they’ll take care of it. As for the EKG, we can do that right here in the clinic, I'll schedule that for you before you leave. I’m also going to print out some information about managing stress and blood pressure for you to take home. Finally, since you are uninsured, I’ll also give you some information on local resources for affordable healthcare options. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: 123 Main Street for the blood tests, EKG here, stress info… that’s a lot to remember. No, I don't think so. Not right now. Maybe I'll think of something later. Thank you for all of your help, Doctor Maskal. I really appreciate it. Okay, let's get this done. I want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaxston. I'm here to help. Let's get the EKG scheduled and then I'll give you everything else you need. Okay, I've scheduled the EKG for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. And here are the lab requisition forms, the stress management information, and the resources for affordable healthcare. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I'll see you tomorrow.
PATIENT: Okay, 9:00 AM tomorrow. Got it. Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
