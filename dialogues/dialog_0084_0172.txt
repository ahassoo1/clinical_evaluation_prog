DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not entirely sure why I’m here. My husband insisted. Something about… settling in? We just moved, you see. A dreadful experience, the whole thing. Really dreadful. I suppose I should get this over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Settling in after a move can be stressful, and it’s good to get things checked out. So, your husband wanted you to have a general check-up to make sure everything’s alright now that you’ve relocated?
PATIENT: Relocated is… a polite way of putting it. It was more of an upheaval, really. And yes, he fusses. Always fusses. I suppose a “check-up” is what he called it. Are you going to poke and prod? Because I really don't have time for… theatrics.
DOCTOR: No theatrics, I promise. A standard check-up involves some questions about your health history, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, maybe take a look in your ears, and feel your abdomen. It’s fairly quick. Before we get to the physical part, let's talk about why you’re feeling unwell, if you are feeling unwell. Are you having any specific symptoms – any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Symptoms. Well, I’m seventy-nine years old, Doctor. What doesn’t ache? Honestly. I feel…old. Is that a symptom? I get tired easily, of course. But that’s just…life. I can’t recall anything specific to report. Honestly, my husband probably imagined all of this. He always does. It’s probably just the change of scenery. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, feeling “old” is perfectly valid, and fatigue at 79 is common. We’ll try to figure out if it’s more than just that. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medical history. A long and tedious affair, I assure you. Let me think… I had something, years ago. A…a flutter. In my chest. They gave me pills. Blue pills, I believe. And…arthritis, yes. That's definitely one. My hands ache terribly in the cold. Honestly, it’s just…old age, as I said. I've seen so many doctors in my life, Doctor. It all blurs together. Is there a point to all of this?
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll try to keep it concise. The “flutter” in your chest sounds like it could have been an arrhythmia – an irregular heartbeat. Did they ever tell you the specific name of that condition?
PATIENT: Arrhythmia? Goodness, no. Doctors never use language I understand. Just…pills. Lots of pills. And stern warnings about salt. I think it was something about my heart, though. And my mother had something similar, I believe. Though she was a terribly dramatic woman, so one can never be sure. Really, Doctor, I’m not certain. It was…a long time ago. Before the move, certainly. This is all so stressful. Are you sure this is necessary?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. A history of an arrhythmia and your mother’s similar issues is good to know. We’ll note that down. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any pills, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… oh, dear. Let me see. There’s this one. For my…water retention, I think. And this one, a blue one, like the one I mentioned before. Though I’m not certain what it's for. My husband handles all of that. He's very particular about my regimen. Honestly, I just take what he gives me. And a multivitamin, I suppose. Though I can’t recall the brand. Really, Doctor, I’m not good with these things. It all feels so… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s just focus on what you can recall. You’re taking something for water retention and a blue pill that you’ve been on for a while. We’ll need to get the specific names of these medications to make sure everything is safe. I can ask your husband if it’s alright, or perhaps you have a list somewhere?
PATIENT: Ask my husband. Of course. He'll launch into a fifteen-minute explanation of dosages and interactions. Honestly, it’s exhausting. No, I don’t have a list. He keeps it all meticulously organized. He's a retired accountant, you see. Numbers are his passion, not…pill bottles. Just…water retention and the blue pill, Doctor. That's all I know. Are we almost finished? I have a luncheon to attend. It’s rather important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Well, I've always had a slight reaction to…dust, I suppose. Makes me sneeze. And I once had a rather unpleasant experience with shellfish. Turned quite red, I recall. But allergies…serious allergies? No. Not that I'm aware of. Honestly, I’m not a delicate flower. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. One develops a certain…tolerance. Are you certain this is necessary? This is all so very tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known serious allergies. Just a sensitivity to dust and a past reaction to shellfish. That’s good to know. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. My mother smoked, you see. A dreadful habit. It ruined her complexion. I've always been very careful about my health. Well, relatively careful. I do enjoy a glass of sherry now and then. Is that going to be a problem? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite an interrogation.
DOCTOR: No, a glass of sherry is unlikely to be a problem. Good to know. And how about alcohol consumption generally?
PATIENT: As I said, a glass of sherry. Perhaps two, on special occasions. My husband and I enjoy a quiet evening now and then. It’s a civilized habit. We don’t indulge excessively, I assure you. We're not…bohemians. Is this finally nearing an end? I really must be going. My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions and then we can do a quick physical exam. Have you had any recent changes in your weight or appetite?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… hmm. Perhaps a pound or two. It’s difficult to say. I do enjoy my food, you see. A good roast chicken is a particular weakness. And my appetite is… normal, I suppose. Though I haven’t been feeling terribly hungry lately. Honestly, it's probably just the stress of the move. Everything is so… unsettling. Are we truly nearing the end of this? This is terribly inconvenient. My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We’ll finish quickly. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, dear. A rather morbid topic, isn't it? My mother, as I mentioned, had that…flutter. And my uncle, I believe, had something with his…stomach. But honestly, it was all so long ago, and one can never be certain. They weren't terribly forthcoming with details. And frankly, I prefer not to dwell on such unpleasantness. I've always tried to focus on the positive. Really, Doctor, this is becoming rather exhausting. Is the physical exam absolutely necessary? My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand you're anxious to get to your luncheon. Just a brief exam to get a baseline. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Honestly, I do hope this won’t take long. My luncheon… it’s with the garden club. We’re discussing hydrangeas. A far more stimulating topic than…vital signs. Do be gentle, Doctor. My skin is rather sensitive. And please, no sudden movements.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 148 over 85, and your pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning. Your heart sounds…regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs sound clear. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. Reflexes are a little diminished. I notice some swelling and stiffness in your hands. Okay, Candice, that’s all for the physical exam. It confirms some of what you’ve mentioned, and a few things we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate further? Oh, dear. Must we? Honestly, Doctor, I do hope this won’t involve needles. Or unpleasant liquids. My luncheon… it’s starting soon, you know. What exactly do you propose to “investigate”? And will it take long? I really must be going. This is all terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. No needles right away. I'd like to order some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The murmur I heard suggests we should also do an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And given the tenderness in your abdomen, I'd recommend an ultrasound of your liver and gallbladder. These are just precautionary measures, Candice. To rule things out. It will give us a better understanding of what’s going on. The lab work shouldn’t take long, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for next week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Next week? Oh, dear. This is becoming quite an ordeal. Honestly, Doctor, I do hope this won’t disrupt my schedule. The garden club meeting… and then the tea party. And then there’s the charity auction. It’s simply… inconvenient. Very well. Next week, I suppose. But please, no early morning appointments. And do be quick about it. My luncheon… I really must be going now. Can I at least get a written request for these… tests? For my husband, you see. He handles all of these things. He'll be terribly upset if I can't provide him with the details. And please, no needles. Absolutely no needles.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I’ll write out a request for the blood work and ultrasound, and I’ll make a note to schedule the ultrasound for an afternoon appointment. And I assure you, no needles are required for these tests. Here is the request for the tests. You can give this to your husband. And I will have my nurse, Martha, call you tomorrow to schedule the ultrasound. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Candice?
PATIENT: Very well. Afternoon appointments are acceptable, I suppose. Hmm. All these medical terms… it’s quite daunting. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. I really must be going now. My luncheon… And please tell Martha to be brief. My time is rather valuable, you know. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you… for your time. .
