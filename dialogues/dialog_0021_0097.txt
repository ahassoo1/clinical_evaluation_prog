DOCTOR: Alright, Marija, welcome. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Havird. It’s… well, my husband, Omar, suggested I come. He’s been rather insistent. He feels I should have some… papers in order. Something about what happens if… well, if I am unable to make decisions. I confess, I don’t entirely understand it myself. He mentioned something called an Advance Directive… or perhaps a POLST form? Is that correct? I just want to be prepared, I suppose, though frankly, I find the whole thing rather morbid.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, husbands worry. It’s… endearing, I suppose. An Advance Directive and a POLST form – yes, he’s on the right track. It’s about planning for the future, outlining your wishes if you were, shall we say, incapacitated. It's… practical. Most people don't want to think about it, but it saves a lot of trouble later on. Before we delve into that, though, are you experiencing any current health issues?
PATIENT: Health issues? No, nothing of any significance. A little stiffness in my knees, perhaps, but that’s just age. And the occasional headache – everyone gets headaches. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. It's just Omar's… anxiety. He reads too many articles online, I suspect. He worries about everything. Really, I feel perfectly capable of managing my own affairs, should the need arise. This seems rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even perfectly healthy people benefit from a little foresight. It’s less about your capabilities now, and more about ensuring things are clear-cut if something were to change. A little stiffness and headaches, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Precisely. Normal aches and pains for a woman of my age. I maintain a very active social life, you see. Lots of travel. I was in Marrakech just last month, visiting family. It was quite exhausting, all the festivities, but very enjoyable. I keep busy. I certainly don’t have time to be ill. And frankly, I’m not comfortable discussing my… potential incapacitation at length. My husband is the worrier, he can explain all the details. I simply agreed to come to appease him. Perhaps we can get this over with quickly?
DOCTOR: Very well. But even active social lives don't preclude the possibility of unforeseen events. Just to be thorough – and I do need to document this – have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Not particularly. Everything seems… as it always has. Perhaps a little blurry when I first wake up, but that’s easily remedied with my glasses, as you can see. I’ve had glasses since I was a young girl, it's hardly a new development. Honestly, Doctor, is this truly necessary? We are discussing papers to say what happens if I am… unable to think, and you are asking about my eyesight? It feels rather… irrelevant.
DOCTOR: It's all relevant, Marija. Blurred vision can be a symptom of many things, some quite serious. It's part of a comprehensive assessment. And before we get further into this, let's clarify – you said "as you can see," implying you are wearing your glasses now. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, of course I am wearing my glasses. I wouldn’t be able to see a thing without them! Goodness, Doctor, are you suggesting I came here… unprepared? I assure you, I take care of myself. I may not understand the need for these… forms, but I am not negligent. This is becoming rather… condescending.
DOCTOR: It's not about suggesting anything, Marija. It’s about accurate documentation. And you mentioned Marrakech. Was there any illness while you were travelling?
PATIENT: Illness? No, none at all. A little jet lag, naturally, and the food was… rather spicy, but that’s hardly an illness. I have a very strong constitution. I’ve travelled extensively throughout North Africa, the Middle East… I’ve built up a considerable resistance to… unpleasantries. Omar, of course, insisted I take all sorts of precautions, hand sanitizer, bottled water… Honestly, it was excessive. But no, no illness. Perfectly healthy, as I’ve repeatedly stated. Are we going to discuss these papers now, or are you going to continue questioning my travel habits? It’s rather… tiresome.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s move on then. You said your husband is the one who brought up the Advance Directive and POLST form. Has he already started filling anything out, or explained the details to you?
PATIENT: He's… researched them, extensively. He showed me some documents online, legal jargon mostly, I didn't understand a word of it. He kept talking about “end-of-life care” and “medical proxies” and… frankly, it frightened me a little. He wanted me to choose someone to make decisions for me, should I become… unable to do so myself. It all felt so… final. I told him I needed to think about it, and that’s why I agreed to come here. I hoped you could explain it in a way I could comprehend, without all the… panic. He has a very vivid imagination, my husband. Always anticipating the worst possible outcome. He means well, of course, but… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: So, he's presented you with information, but you haven’t actively participated in the decision-making process. And it caused you some anxiety. That’s perfectly understandable. Essentially, these documents allow you to outline your wishes regarding medical treatment, should you become unable to communicate them yourself. The "medical proxy" is the person you designate to make those decisions on your behalf. It’s about ensuring your voice is heard, even when you can’t speak for yourself. Do you have any specific concerns about who you would designate as your proxy?
PATIENT: Well... Omar, naturally. He's my husband. But... he can be rather... overbearing. He has very strong opinions, you see, and he doesn't always listen to others. I worry he would impose his wishes, not necessarily mine. He means well, as I said, but... he can be very insistent. He's the practical one in the relationship, always making lists and organizing things. I'm more... spontaneous. I worry he would choose the most… aggressive treatment option, even if I wouldn't want it. He’s a doctor, you see. He always wants to do something, to fix everything. Sometimes, I just want to be left alone. It’s a difficult situation. He’ll be furious if I don’t choose him. It's all very… complicated. Perhaps we should stop this conversation. I'm becoming quite distressed.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have legitimate concerns about your husband's potential role as your proxy. That's perfectly valid, and something we need to address. It’s crucial that your wishes are respected, and that the designated proxy will genuinely advocate for your best interests. Choosing a proxy is not simply about obligation or convenience. Before we proceed, let's briefly discuss your general health preferences. If you were faced with a serious illness, and there were limited treatment options, would you prioritize extending your life at all costs, even if it meant a diminished quality of life?
PATIENT: Goodness. That’s… a rather morbid question, Doctor. I’ve never really thought about it. I suppose… quality of life is important. What good is a long life if you are… miserable? But… it's difficult to say. I don’t want to just… give up. But I also don't want to be… a burden. I’ve seen my aunt… the end wasn’t pleasant. Tubes and machines… I wouldn’t want that. But… if there was a chance, a small chance… I suppose I would want to try. It’s all so… frightening. I truly don’t know. Omar would want me to fight, to exhaust every option. He’s a doctor, you see. He’s very dedicated to his profession. I… I honestly haven’t given it enough thought. Perhaps I need some time. Perhaps… this whole thing is a mistake. I feel quite overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed, Marija. These are difficult conversations, and it’s not something anyone has to rush into. It sounds like you have some conflicted feelings about your preferences, and that’s entirely understandable. Given your concerns about your husband’s potential influence, and your uncertainty about your own wishes, I recommend we postpone any formal documentation for now. Perhaps, before proceeding, it would be beneficial for you to discuss this with a neutral third party – a therapist, or a patient advocate – to help you clarify your thoughts and feelings. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A referral… yes. That might be… helpful. Someone neutral, someone who doesn’t have a vested interest. Omar would undoubtedly try to steer me in a particular direction. A neutral party… yes. That sounds… sensible. Perhaps it would be best to postpone everything for now. And… thank you, Doctor. For not… pushing me. It’s been… a difficult conversation. I appreciate your… understanding. I think… I think that’s all I can manage for today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. It’s my priority to ensure your comfort and autonomy. I’ll write a referral for a patient advocate, and the nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss this further when you’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, there’s no rush. Take your time, and prioritize your own well-being. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… everything. Thank you again. I think I just need some… fresh air. It’s been a rather… taxing morning.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Take care, Marija. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you change your mind about anything. Have a pleasant day. .
