DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Courtnye, by the way. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse, even though I’m on the blood thinner. Like, way worse than it should be, you know? It worries me.
DOCTOR: “Worse than it should be,” you say. Alright. And you’re currently taking a blood thinner… which one, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s… Warfarin. Yes, Warfarin. The doctor prescribed it about six months ago, after the… well, after the thing with my knee. I take one tablet every night, like they told me.
DOCTOR: Six months on Warfarin. And you've noticed increased bruising despite consistent adherence to the medication?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Consistent. Every single night. No misses. But I bumped my arm yesterday – just a little bump against the doorframe – and it’s already the size of my hand. And it’s purple. Really purple. Normally it’s just a little bit of colour, but this is… different. It’s just not right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A significant bruise from a minor impact, despite consistent Warfarin use. We need to get a better understanding of this. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, aside from what required the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Oh, um… Not really. Just the usual, you know? High blood pressure, but it’s managed with pills. And… I had a bit of a problem with my stomach a few years back, but that cleared up. Nothing serious. I don’t think so, anyway. Is that important?
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication. And a past history of stomach issues. It could be relevant. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, if you recall the name?
PATIENT: Let me see… Here it is. Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on that for… oh, I don’t know, five or six years now? It keeps it pretty steady. Doc checks it every time I go in.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. Alright. And you said you had a stomach problem a few years ago?
PATIENT: Yes. It was… ulcers, I think? They gave me something for it, and it went away. I don’t remember the name of the medicine, sorry. It was a while ago and I just… take what they give me, you know? I don’t usually worry about the names. It doesn’t bother me anymore. Unless it's something like this bruising… then I get worried.
DOCTOR: Ulcers in the past, treated successfully. I understand you prefer not to focus on medication names, but it's helpful information. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any bleeding disorders in your family – easy bruising, prolonged bleeding from cuts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. Not that I know of. My mum… she always bruised easily, but she just said she was clumsy. And my dad… he was pretty tough, never seemed to get hurt much. No one ever talked about bleeding problems, if that makes sense. It wasn’t something we discussed. I have lots of cousins, but I haven't seen them in years. So I honestly don't know. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No known family history of bleeding disorders. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, um… what do you mean by that? Like, do I drink? Not really. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I live alone, and I’m pretty careful. I don’t do anything… dangerous. I mostly just watch TV and go to church. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: No significant alcohol or tobacco use. And you live alone and describe a relatively sedentary lifestyle. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve tried lots of different foods and medicines over the years, and nothing’s ever bothered me. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky. Except for this bruising thing, of course. It’s just worrying me sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. Given your history of consistent Warfarin use, the recent increase in bruising, and your unremarkable medical and family history, we need to investigate this further. I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, starting with a look at the bruise on your arm, and then I will need to order some blood work to assess your clotting factors and rule out any underlying causes for this increased bleeding tendency. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, as long as it finds out what’s going on. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just… please hurry, if you can? It’s really starting to worry me. And I have church on Sunday, and I don’t want to be all black and blue.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll proceed as efficiently as possible. Please, have a seat on the examination table. First, let's take a look at the bruise itself. Can you point to where you bumped your arm yesterday?
PATIENT: Yes, right here. It was just a little scrape against the doorframe, honestly. Nothing major. But look at it! It's getting bigger by the minute, I swear. It’s really sore too, now. Not just a little ache, but proper sore.
DOCTOR: Alright. It is quite extensive for a minor impact, you’re right. There is significant tenderness to palpation, and the area is warm to the touch. No obvious signs of fracture, but the swelling is concerning. Capillary refill is normal, which is a good sign. Now, I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen, just to rule out any other possibilities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I just… I don’t understand why this is happening. I take my pills, I’m careful, and now this. It's really freaking me out, Doctor. I'm not usually one to complain.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Okay. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Given your report of increased bruising despite consistent Warfarin therapy and the absence of any other obvious findings on examination, I think it’s prudent to order some blood work. We need to check your INR level to ensure your Warfarin dosage is appropriate, as well as perform a complete blood count and coagulation studies to evaluate your clotting factors and rule out any underlying bleeding disorders. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever it takes to figure it out. I just want to get back to normal. When will I get the results? And… will it hurt? Will I need lots of needles? I really hate needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension regarding needles, Ms. Hainley. We’ll minimize discomfort as much as possible. The blood draw will involve a few vials of blood; the discomfort is typically brief and mild. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have those results, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and formulate a plan of action. I will also include a D-dimer to rule out blood clots. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, swelling, or bleeding, please seek immediate medical attention. I'll write you a request for the bloodwork now, and you can have it done at the clinic's lab.
PATIENT: Okay. 24 to 48 hours… that’s not too bad. And I’ll come straight back if anything gets worse. Thank you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. That makes me feel a little better. I just really hope it’s nothing serious. I have a quilting group next week, and I promised to bring cookies…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hainley. I assure you, we'll investigate this thoroughly and determine the cause of your increased bruising. It's often a simple adjustment to medication or a minor underlying issue. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could lead to further injury. And don’t worry about the cookies. We'll address this medical issue first. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Paulino. I appreciate you listening. I'll go get the blood work done now. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long. And… thank you for being patient with me. I get nervous easily. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hainley. We’re here to help. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and please come back and see me once you have the results.
