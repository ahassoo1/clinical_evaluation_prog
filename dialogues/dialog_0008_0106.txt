DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my foot. It’s been giving me trouble, a nasty sore that just won’t heal. And frankly, I don’t understand why it’s taking so long. I usually take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. A sore on your foot that isn’t healing… I see. And how long has this sore been bothering you, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it must be… at least three months now. Maybe four. Time does fly when you're in discomfort, you know. It started small, just a little cut, and I thought nothing of it. But it just… got worse. And worse. I’ve been putting ointment on it, of course. The kind they sell at the store. Doesn’t seem to be doing much good, does it?
DOCTOR: Right. Three or four months… and you’ve been using over-the-counter ointment. Okay. And where on your foot exactly is this sore located?
PATIENT: It's on the bottom of my foot, Doctor. Right near my heel. It’s… well, it’s a bit painful to put weight on it, so I've been walking differently. Not that I go many places anymore, but still. It's quite bothersome when I do have to go out, and it's getting redder, I think. And… well, it smells a little, if I’m being honest. I've always had good hygiene, but this is… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, bottom of the foot near the heel, painful with weight-bearing, getting redder, and you've noticed some odor. That gives me a bit more information. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes. A little. It’s not… a flood, mind you. Just… a dampness sometimes, especially after I’ve been resting. It’s not… pretty, I assure you. It’s a yellowish color, I think. Honestly, I try not to look at it too closely. It’s… unpleasant. I’ve been wrapping it in clean bandages, of course. I wasn't raised in a barn.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage. That's helpful to know. Ms. Cannington, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or anything that affects your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, Doctor, I do have the sugar. Diabetes, they call it. I’ve had it for years, since… well, a long time. I try to keep it under control, but it's not always easy. And my legs… they get a little numb sometimes, especially in the evenings. Not always, but often enough to be a bother. And I had a bit of trouble with circulation a while back, but they gave me some pills for that. I’m taking those regularly. Do you need to know the names of the pills? It’s a long list, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and some circulation issues. Yes, knowing the medication names would be helpful, if you're able to recall them. But if not, we can look it up in your records. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I think I’m allergic to penicillin. I had a bad reaction to it when I was young, a rash and… well, it wasn't pleasant. My mother always warned me to stay away from it. And… hmm. I don’t recall anything else, honestly. I haven’t had much trouble with allergies. I’m a fairly… robust woman, generally. Though this foot is causing me quite the distress. As for the pills... Let me see. There's Metformin, I think that's one. And... Lisinopril, for the blood pressure, I believe. Oh, and something for the cholesterol... Atorvastatin, is it? It’s a mouthful, isn't it? I apologize, Doctor. I’m getting older, and the names just don't stick like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Metformin, Lisinopril, and Atorvastatin. Penicillin allergy. Thank you, that’s very helpful. Now, Ms. Cannington, would you mind if I took a look at your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. I’m not particularly fond of looking at it myself, so I’m relieved you offered. Be gentle, now. It’s quite tender. And try not to take too long. I have a luncheon planned later, though I doubt I’ll be able to attend in this condition. It's a garden club meeting. Very important, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit back and lift your foot onto the examination table, that would be great. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I see the sore here near your heel. There’s some redness and swelling, as you mentioned, and a small area of open skin. It is warm to the touch, and you're right, it's tender when I press on it. I also note some yellowish drainage. Do you have a fever, or have you been feeling unwell in any other way?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. Not that I’ve noticed. And I’ve been feeling… well, just my usual aches and pains. Being eighty-nine years old isn't exactly a walk in the park, you know. But no chills, no cough, no dizziness. Just this persistent, bothersome foot. It's ruining my shoe options, that's for sure. I had a lovely pair of sandals I was hoping to wear. Honestly, it's more than just the pain. It's the inconvenience of it all. Is it… serious, Doctor? You're frowning. That doesn't bode well.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, given your diabetes, circulation issues, and the appearance of the sore, I’m concerned about a possible infection. It's important to rule that out. Also, because of the diabetes, even a small infection can become serious very quickly. I'm going to order some lab work to check for infection, and I think an x-ray of your foot would be wise to see if there's any underlying bone infection. We need to be proactive to prevent this from getting worse. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. An infection? That doesn’t sound good at all. X-rays, lab work… it's all rather frightening. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then please do what you must. I suppose I have no choice. I trust your judgment, of course. Though I do wish it weren't so complicated. This is such a nuisance. Will it be painful? The x-ray, I mean. And how long will it take? I really mustn't miss my garden club meeting, if possible. Although, if it's a serious infection, I suppose that's rather low on the priority list. Just… please be quick about it. And tell me honestly, Doctor. How bad is it?
DOCTOR: The x-ray itself shouldn't be painful at all, Ms. Cannington. You'll just need to stand still for a few moments while the technician takes the pictures. The lab work will involve a small blood draw. As for how bad it is… it’s too early to say definitively. The lab work and x-ray will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. However, given your diabetes, we need to take this seriously. It's better to be cautious and thorough. I'll have the technician come in shortly to take the x-rays and draw the blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and discuss a treatment plan with you. In the meantime, please try to keep weight off your foot as much as possible and keep it clean and dry. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Cannington. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Well... that's… reassuring, I suppose. Keeping weight off it is easier said than done, you know. I still have to manage around the house. But I'll try my best. Will the results be back quickly? I hate waiting. And what kind of treatment are we talking about? Antibiotics? Surgery? Please don’t say surgery. I’ve always been a bit squeamish. And… will I have to be hospitalized? Oh, dear. I haven’t been in a hospital in years. This is all rather unsettling. Perhaps I should call my daughter… She always worries so. What if it's… serious? Do you think it might be serious, Doctor? You're not telling me everything, are you?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Cannington. It's perfectly natural to be worried. The lab results should be back within a few hours, and the x-ray results shortly after that. As for treatment, it's too early to say definitively. It could be antibiotics if it's an infection. We will assess that. Surgery is unlikely at this point, but we can't rule anything out until we have the results. I am not withholding information; I simply don’t have a definitive answer yet. I want to avoid causing unnecessary panic before we know exactly what we’re dealing with. As for hospitalization, that would depend on the severity of the infection and how well you respond to treatment. I don’t believe that’s likely at this stage, but it’s always a possibility. Right now, let’s focus on getting these tests done and then we can discuss everything in more detail. It’s best to have all the facts before making any decisions. Would you like me to call your daughter for you, or would you prefer to do it yourself?
PATIENT: Oh... well, alright. Tests first, then. That's sensible, I suppose. I still think you're not telling me everything, but I’ll try to remain calm. It's just… this foot has always been a bit troublesome, you know. Even before the sugar. I suppose it's not surprising it’s finally causing problems. No, thank you. I'll call my daughter myself. I prefer to have control of the situation, if you don't mind. She tends to… fuss. And she'll want to come down here immediately, and I don't need that right now. Just… get the tests done as quickly as possible, please. And call me as soon as you have the results. Every minute counts, you understand. And try not to be too alarmist, if you can help it. I'm a bit of a worrier, myself, as you've probably gathered. Now, where do I go for these tests? And will it take long? I have a luncheon… or, had a luncheon planned. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cannington. I understand. I’ll do my best to get these tests done quickly and I will certainly call you as soon as the results are available. I won’t be alarmist, I promise. The technician is just down the hall, in Room 3. They’ll take some x-rays and draw a small sample of blood. It shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes, total. You can sit in the waiting room afterwards, or if you prefer, I can have one of the nurses call you when we have the results. As for the luncheon, I completely understand your disappointment. We’ll do everything we can to get you back on your feet as soon as possible. Try to relax, Ms. Cannington. You're in good hands. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I'll be right here. Now, let's get those tests done.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. It's not easy dealing with old women, I imagine. Room 3, you said? I suppose I should be going, then. And please, do try not to keep me waiting too long. I have a garden club to consider, you know. Though it's likely ruined now, anyway. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. I do hope it's nothing serious.
