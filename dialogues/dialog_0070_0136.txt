DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my… belching. It’s been happening a lot. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite bothersome when these things happen, and I assure you, it’s nothing to be embarrassed about. Many people experience this. “Belching,” or what we medically term “eructation,” is very common. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me more about it?
PATIENT: Eructation? Oh. Okay. Well, it just… happens. Mostly after I eat, I think. Not every time, but a lot of the times. Sometimes it’s a little burp, sometimes it’s… bigger. And loud. Like, I have to excuse myself if people are around. It doesn’t hurt, but it feels… uncomfortable. Like too much air inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it's primarily after eating, and the severity varies. You mentioned it doesn't cause pain, but more of a feeling of fullness or discomfort. Could you describe what you typically eat in a regular day?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I work in a factory, so sometimes it’s… hard to eat good. Usually breakfast is just coffee and maybe a little toast. Lunch is often a sandwich, like ham and cheese, or leftovers from dinner. Dinner… depends. Sometimes I cook, like rice and beans and chicken. Sometimes it’s faster food if I’m tired. I drink a lot of soda, too. I like soda.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly typical diet, with some reliance on faster foods and soda. And you mention you drink a lot of soda - roughly how many cans or bottles would you say you consume in a day?
PATIENT: Oh… maybe three? Sometimes four. I know it’s bad for me, but I like the bubbles. And it helps me stay awake at work. It’s a habit, I guess.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Fogelstrom. Habits can be difficult to break. The soda consumption is certainly something we can discuss. Now, let's go back to the belching. Do you notice if certain foods trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… maybe beans? Definitely beans. And spicy food. If I eat something really spicy, I’m belching all night. And sometimes… onions. Onions make it worse too. But it’s hard to tell, you know? Because I eat so many different things.
DOCTOR: That's good information. Beans, spicy foods, and onions – those are all known to contribute to increased gas production. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the belching, such as bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bloating, yes. Sometimes my tummy feels… puffy. Especially after I eat a big meal. Not pain, exactly, just uncomfortable. And… sometimes I feel a little sick to my stomach, but I don’t usually throw up. And no… no changes in… how I go to the bathroom. Sorry! That’s… personal.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Fogelstrom. It’s all very important information, and I appreciate you being so open with me. We need to cover all aspects to understand what's happening. So, bloating and occasional nausea, but no changes in bowel habits. Have you noticed any correlation between the belching and stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Stress… maybe? I work long hours at the factory, and sometimes the boss is… difficult. I get nervous when he’s around. And when I’m nervous, I think I drink more soda. So… maybe? It's hard to say for sure. I just feel… tense sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a link between stress, increased soda consumption, and the belching. That gives us several factors to consider. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I haven't been to the doctor in a long time. I’m usually healthy. I’ve had a cold a few times, and I broke my arm when I was little, but nothing serious. I don't take any medicine, either. I just try to ignore things until they go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known medical conditions and no regular medications. And you haven’t had any surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. Just the broken arm when I was a kid. They put a cast on it, but that’s it. I’m pretty sure that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mom… she has high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa had… something with his stomach, a long time ago. But I don’t really know what. He’s passed away now. No one else that I know of has problems with their stomach. Mostly everyone is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother and some vague stomach issues in your grandfather. Thank you. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop. The belching, I mean. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Fogelstrom. We'll do our best to figure this out. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I’ll gently palpate, or feel, your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m listening now. Take some deep breaths for me. Sounds are normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. I’ll start here, on your right side…
PATIENT: Okay. That’s okay… no pain… a little… gassy, maybe? But not pain. It just feels… full. Like after I eat a big meal. Here… is okay too. And here… Ooh… that’s a little uncomfortable. Not bad, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Some mild tenderness on your left side, which could indicate some gas or bloating in that area. The rest feels relatively normal. No masses or significant abnormalities. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to your diet and stress levels. The soda consumption and certain foods—beans, onions, spicy foods—can contribute to increased gas production. Stress can also affect digestion and lead to bloating and belching. To rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. These will help us check for any underlying conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? I… I don’t like needles. But… if it will help, then okay. I guess. Will it be a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles. It's very common. It will only be a small amount of blood—a couple of vials. It's a routine test, and we'll be quick and gentle. It will help us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. While we are waiting for the results, I recommend making a few dietary changes. Try to reduce your soda intake gradually, and avoid foods that trigger your belching—beans, onions, and spicy foods—for a week or two to see if it helps. Also, try to manage your stress levels. Perhaps some relaxation techniques, like deep breathing exercises or yoga, could be beneficial. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Relaxation techniques… I don’t really have time for yoga. I work long hours, and when I get home, I’m tired. Maybe… maybe I can try to take some deep breaths. It sounds… hard. And I guess I can try to drink less soda. It’s just… I like it so much. What if the tests show something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand that making changes can be difficult, and you're right to be concerned about the test results. It’s good that you're thinking about these things. It's important to remember that the blood tests are simply to rule out any other potential causes, and the vast majority of the time, they come back normal. If the tests do show something unusual, we'll discuss the results thoroughly and create a plan together. We won't rush into anything. For now, let’s focus on the dietary changes and stress management. If you're unable to find time for formal relaxation techniques, even just taking a few deep breaths throughout the day can make a difference. Would you like me to provide you with a list of foods to avoid and some simple breathing exercises to try?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A list of foods would be good. And… maybe the breathing exercises too. Just… simple ones. I don't want anything too complicated. This is a lot. But… I want to feel better. I really do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is a list of foods that commonly cause gas and bloating. It's not exhaustive, but it's a good starting point. And here are a few simple breathing exercises you can try throughout the day. They're easy to learn and can be done anywhere. I’ve also written down my contact information. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get the blood tests done today, and I'll call you with the results as soon as they're available—usually within a week. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening. And… for not making fun of me for belching. I guess I’ll go get the blood tests done now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fogelstrom. And please, there’s absolutely no need to apologize or feel embarrassed. It’s my job to listen and help you feel better. The nurse will escort you to the lab now to get the blood tests done. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
