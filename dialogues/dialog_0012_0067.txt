DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Ruocco, it’s good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just... this pain. When I breathe deep. It’s been… a little while now. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. My memory isn't what it used to be. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “uncomfortable” with deep breaths. That’s a good starting point. It sounds like it’s been going on for a bit. Do you feel the pain more on one side than the other?
PATIENT: One side… hmm. Maybe… a little bit on the right? It’s hard to say for sure. Sometimes it feels like it's all over, and sometimes just… there. Honestly, it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, comes and goes, and generally on the right side, but can be all over. Does anything specifically make it worse – like coughing, or moving a certain way, or lying down?
PATIENT: Coughing… yes, definitely coughing. Makes it sharp. Lying down… not really. Moving… sometimes. When I bend over, maybe. But mostly just breathing, you know? Deep breaths are the problem. Not doing much else makes it worse, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths and coughing are the main triggers. And bending over sometimes bothers it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think… No, not really. I get tired easy, but I’m eighty years old! That's just getting old. I haven’t coughed up anything, no fever… nothing like that. Just this pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no cough, fever, or shortness of breath. Just the pain with deep breaths. Have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Before… Not like this, no. I’ve had aches and pains, of course. Old construction work, you know? But not this… sharp feeling when I breathe. It’s new. I’m pretty sure it’s new.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is a new pain, not related to your previous construction work aches. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of – like heart trouble, lung problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh boy. Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember much. I went to the doctor sometimes, years ago. But I don't recall anything specific. No… no heart trouble that I know of. Nothing they ever told me about, anyway. I never smoked, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about not smoking. Okay, so no known heart trouble. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… I think… maybe once, a long time ago. When I was younger. Something with my appendix, I think? But it was so long ago, I barely remember. No other surgeries, I don’t think. Not that I recall, anyway. It was a long time ago… everything is a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible appendectomy a long time ago. And no other surgeries you recall. Now, thinking about your family, are there any health problems that run in your family – like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… That's a tough one, Doctor. My family… we didn’t talk much about health. My parents are gone now, and I don't have a lot of close relatives. I know my mother was sick when she was old, but I don't know what she had. Lung problems… maybe? She coughed a lot. But other than that… I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, some coughing in your mother, but nothing specific. That's alright, we can work with that. Just trying to get a full picture. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Just this. Used to take something for my knees. But I ran out a while ago and haven’t gotten around to refilling it. Doctor said it was for the aches, but it didn't do much good, anyway. I stopped taking it.
DOCTOR: Okay, used to take something for your knees but stopped because it wasn’t helping. And nothing else currently. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll gently feel your chest. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don't think it will bother me. Just… be gentle, okay? My ribs get sore easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be gentle. Okay, I’m listening now. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the right side, and I can hear some subtle crackling sounds when you take a deep breath. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. And it does feel a bit tender when I press gently on your right chest wall. I'm also noting your weight is 138 pounds, and your height is approximately 5’2”. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m hearing, it sounds like we should get a chest X-ray to take a closer look at your lungs. It will help us rule out things like pneumonia or any other issues that could be causing the pain and diminished breath sounds. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… Okay, if you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if it will help… yes. Go ahead with the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-ray won’t take long – just a few minutes. And it doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine while a technician takes a picture of your chest. They will need to take a few pictures from different angles. I'm going to order that for you now. While we're waiting for the results, I’m also going to order some blood work. It will help us check for any signs of infection and get a better overall picture of your health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work too? Oh, alright. Doctor, you're really thorough, aren’t you? Yes, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. Just… let me know when it will be done, okay? I have some errands to run. And I’m not good at sitting around for long.
DOCTOR: I understand, and I apologize for the multiple tests. I just want to make sure we get a clear understanding of what's going on. The blood work and X-ray should both be done within the hour. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and send you over to radiology for the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to write down some initial instructions. We’ll hold off on any specific treatment until we have the results back, but for now, try to avoid any strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. If the pain gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, or start coughing up anything, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Questions… Hmm… no, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty well, Doctor. Just… when will I get the results? Is it today? I don’t want to have to come back too many times. And… can the nurse help me get a ride home if I need it? I don’t drive anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question about getting the results. I anticipate the X-ray results will be available within a few hours, and the blood work results usually take a day or two. I will have the nurse call you tomorrow with an update on the blood work, and I'll review the X-ray results with you as soon as they're available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then if needed. Regarding transportation, let me check with the nurse. I believe we do have some resources available to help patients with transportation, but it depends on availability. I will ask her to look into that for you. Is there anything else I can help you with right now before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I'm going to close my eyes for a minute. Hopefully, these tests will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. It’s my job to help. Please don’t hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you need anything at all. Get some rest. .
