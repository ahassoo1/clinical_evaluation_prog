DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been treated for sleep apnea for a while now – with the machine, you know, the CPAP – but I still feel awfully tired during the day. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use. That’s… concerning, yes. It’s good you’re already being treated for sleep apnea. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m falling asleep standing up or anything, Doctor. It’s more… a constant drag. Like I’m wading through mud all day. It makes it hard to concentrate, you know? I used to love reading, but now I find myself rereading the same paragraphs over and over. And I just don’t have the energy to do the things I enjoy. It’s… frustrating, to put it mildly. I taught for years, you know, and keeping up with students takes a lot of… pep. I don't have much of that these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant drag, difficulty concentrating… and a loss of energy. It sounds… debilitating, yes. And you mentioned teaching – so this is affecting your daily life and cognitive function. Just to get a clearer picture, how long has this been going on, despite using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It’s been… probably about six months, maybe a little longer. I started noticing it around Christmas, I think. I was hoping it would just go away, you know? Sometimes you have a few bad nights, but this… this hasn’t let up. I’ve been very diligent with the machine, too. I wear it every night, clean it regularly… I really do try. I just figured… it should be working, shouldn't it? I’ve had it for… oh, goodness… almost ten years now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, ten years is quite a while. And it’s good you’re being so diligent with the machine. We need to figure out why it’s not providing adequate relief. Now, besides the tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to complain I snored a lot, even with the machine on sometimes. It's not as bad now, thankfully, but she pointed it out a couple of times recently when she was visiting. And I’ve been a bit… forgetful, I suppose. Not like major memory loss, but little things. Where I put my keys, what I was just saying… things like that. It’s probably just old age creeping in, but… maybe it’s connected? I do wake up a few times during the night, but I always get back to sleep. It's just not restful sleep, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Snoring, despite the machine, is… concerning. And the forgetfulness… it's good you're aware of it. It could be age-related, but we need to rule out other possibilities. You said you wake up a few times during the night - can you describe how you wake up?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a jolt awake, you know? It’s more… a gradual awareness. I’ll just… realize I’m awake. Sometimes I have to adjust the mask, it feels a little loose. And sometimes I just… feel restless. I don’t usually look at the clock, but I think it’s usually just for a few minutes. I roll over, get comfortable again, and usually fall back asleep pretty quickly. But I don’t feel completely refreshed in the morning. It's hard to explain. Like I didn't quite get enough oxygen while I was sleeping, even with the machine on. Does that make sense? I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Paske. You're describing it very well. Gradual awakenings, mask adjustments, restless sleep, non-restorative sleep… And the feeling of not getting enough oxygen despite the machine. To get a better understanding, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I have a bit of high blood pressure, controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Oh, and I had a knee replacement five years ago. That was a bit rough, but it’s doing alright now. Nothing else major, I don’t think. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every six months or so. He’s a good man, Dr. Ramirez. He’s the one who initially diagnosed the sleep apnea, actually. He suggested I come see you to look into why the CPAP isn't working as well as it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Controlled hypertension, past gallbladder removal, and a knee replacement. It's good to know he's under the care of Dr. Ramirez. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a baby aspirin every day, just as a preventative measure. That’s it, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? I’m not a fan of all those side effects. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, but that’s over-the-counter. Nothing else. I used to take something for my cholesterol, but Dr. Ramirez took me off of it a few years ago. He said my numbers were looking good.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg, aspirin, and Vitamin D. That’s good to know. And you said Dr. Ramirez took you off the cholesterol medication – excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to be a bit sensitive to pollen in the spring, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. I used to be a little itchy after eating shellfish, but I haven’t had any in years, so I don’t know if I’m still allergic. I mostly just avoid it to be on the safe side, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, pollen allergy, possible shellfish sensitivity. Good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother smoked, and I saw what it did to her, so I stayed far away from it. Always hated the smell, too. And I don't drink very much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then, but that’s about it. Mostly just water, really. I try to stay healthy, you know? I used to walk a lot more, but my knee doesn't allow for that these days. I try to do some light exercises at home, but it's not the same.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No smoking, minimal alcohol… and you try to stay active despite your knee. Excellent. Now, before we proceed, I would like to ask about family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. My father had heart disease, that was his downfall, unfortunately. And my mother had diabetes, type 2, I believe. My brother also has diabetes, so it seems to be a family thing. I've been keeping a close eye on my blood sugar, thankfully it's been normal so far. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… I think it was Alzheimer’s. It's a bit hazy, it was a long time ago. But those are the main ones, I suppose. Nothing else that I can think of right now. Do you need me to be more specific? I'm not very good at remembering these things, you know.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Paske. Heart disease, diabetes, and a possible history of Alzheimer’s. It’s good you’re aware of these things. Okay, before we move on to a physical exam, let me just summarize what we've discussed so far. You’ve been experiencing persistent daytime sleepiness despite consistent CPAP use for six months. You also report snoring despite the machine, forgetfulness, and non-restorative sleep. You have a history of controlled hypertension, past gallbladder removal, and a knee replacement. You take Lisinopril 20mg, aspirin, and Vitamin D, and have no known allergies. Your family history includes heart disease, diabetes, and a possible history of Alzheimer’s. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly accurate, Doctor. You've listened very carefully, I appreciate that. It's… frustrating, you know? I’ve always been a healthy person, and this just doesn’t make sense. It’s like… my body isn’t cooperating. But yes, that's a very good summary. You’ve got it all down.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Paske. It's good we've covered everything. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a neurological assessment to check your reflexes and cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… strange. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, I’m hearing a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 145 over 90. We may need to adjust your medication if this persists. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you a few questions, and then check your reflexes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready, Doctor. Ask away. It’s all a bit much, I suppose, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure this out. Just let me know if I'm doing anything wrong. I hope I don't mess it up.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Mr. Paske. Don't worry about messing anything up. It's just a routine assessment. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I try to keep track of the days, you know? It helps keep my mind sharp.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: We're in… let me think… Oh! I remember now. We're in… Shandell Bombaras clinic, in the city. I think it's a big city, but I don't remember the name. Oh dear... I should know this. I used to be so good with geography.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Paske. It happens. No need to worry about it. Sometimes it’s hard to remember those things. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them slowly, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. Go ahead. I’ll try my best. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but I'll give it a shot.
DOCTOR: Okay, the words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat those back to me when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… oh dear… I know I heard it… It was something shiny… a coin? Was it… nickel? No… penny! Yes, penny. Apple, table, penny. I hope I got it right. It feels like it’s right on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Mr. Paske. You got it! Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go. Just let me know if it's going to be… unpleasant. I'm a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but still present. Now, could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Is that tight enough, Doctor? I don’t want to hurt you. I’m a bit stronger than I look. I used to work with my hands a lot, you know. Carpenter, back in the old days.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Mr. Paske. A little weaker than expected, but still present. Alright, that completes the brief neurological assessment. Overall, your cognitive function appears slightly impaired, with some difficulty recalling recent information and diminished reflexes. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms, suggest a few possible causes for your fatigue. Do you have any questions about the exam so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Slightly impaired… That doesn’t sound very good, does it? No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… what does it mean? Is it something serious? I’ve always prided myself on my mental sharpness, you know. It's worrying to hear it's… diminished. What are the possible causes you mentioned? I suppose I should know, shouldn’t I? But my mind is a bit foggy, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mr. Paske. “Impaired” is a clinical term – it doesn't necessarily mean something serious. It simply means there are some subtle changes we need to investigate further. Possible causes for your fatigue and these findings could include several things. It could be related to your sleep apnea being poorly controlled, even with the CPAP. It could be a medication side effect, or even early stages of cognitive decline. There's also the possibility of vitamin deficiencies, or underlying thyroid issues. And, given your family history, we should also consider the possibility of early dementia, though that's less likely at this stage. To rule out some of these possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work and a sleep study to assess the effectiveness of your CPAP machine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s… a lot to take in. Dementia… That’s a scary word. But I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? Blood work and another sleep study… Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Anything to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I want to be able to read, to think clearly, to enjoy my life. Yes, please, order the tests. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Will these tests be… unpleasant? I don't do well with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Mr. Paske. We'll take things one step at a time. And I'll do everything I can to make the tests as comfortable as possible. The blood work will involve a standard venipuncture – a needle stick to draw blood. It’s usually quick, but can be a little uncomfortable. We'll try to minimize any discomfort. The sleep study will involve monitoring your brain waves, breathing, and other vital signs while you sleep. It's usually done overnight in a sleep lab. It's non-invasive, but can be a little disruptive. I’ll write up the orders now and we can schedule the tests for next week. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, please continue using your CPAP machine as prescribed. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. It's… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously. The tests sound… manageable, I suppose. I’ll try my best. Just… please let me know the results as soon as you have them. I’m anxious to get to the bottom of this. And thank you again, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease, at least a little. I'll schedule the tests with the receptionist on my way out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll make sure you receive the results as soon as they’re available. We’ll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
