DOCTOR: Right. Well, Janeth Micucci, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. And you are… Doctor… Burlington, isn’t it? I read the name on the door. It’s a bit of a walk from where I live, you know. Not many doctors around these parts understand… well, things.
DOCTOR: Burlingham, dear. Burlingham. And yes, I suppose I am a bit… further afield for you. But I have a reputation for getting to the bottom of things, don't I?
PATIENT: Well, that’s what I heard. Honestly, I’m not here about anything serious. It’s just… my daughter, she keeps fussing. Says I need a little… boost. A “get well” card, can you believe it? From you? She thinks it’ll… encourage me. Honestly, the things young people come up with.
DOCTOR: A “boost,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! She says I’ve been… low. Not sick, mind you. Perfectly healthy, as you can see. <gestures to herself with a slight sway> But she worries. Always has. Thinks a card from a real doctor will make me feel better. It's ridiculous, really. But to keep the peace… here I am. Do you actually do that, Doctor? Write little cards?
DOCTOR: Good heavens, no. I'm a physician, not a… social worker. Though, I suppose some patients require a bit more… convincing than others. But let's not get sidetracked. You say you’re feeling perfectly healthy?
PATIENT: Perfectly! Well… mostly. My hands ache a bit after I’ve been working, you know? I do a lot of small assembly, intricate things. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? And my daughter keeps going on about my energy levels. Says I’m not as… sparkly as I used to be. Honestly, sparkly! As if I'm supposed to be a Christmas tree. But truly, I feel fine. I just want her to stop worrying and leave me to my work. Can you just write the card and we'll be done? It would mean the world to her, and peace and quiet for me.
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I don’t just write cards on demand. I’m here to assess your health, not facilitate your daughter’s… whims. Hand aches and fatigue, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yes. But it’s not serious fatigue, Doctor. Just… tired after a long day. And the aches are just… well, aches. Like when it rains and your joints feel it, you know? Everyone gets aches! And honestly, I’ve always been able to push through. I’ve never needed anyone fussing over me. It’s just… she's very insistent. And she's been reading all sorts of things online… about arthritis and… and all sorts of dreadful things! That's why she dragged me here. Is it so hard to just say I'm fine and write a card so she'll stop?
DOCTOR: “Fine” is a very subjective term, dear. And reading things online rarely leads to accurate self-diagnosis. Tell me, these aches in your hands… are they worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely worse in the evenings. After I’ve been working for hours, assembling the little… pieces. It’s very fiddly work, you see. Tiny screws and… well, you wouldn’t understand. It’s not a job for someone young, that’s for sure. But I’m good at it! I have steady hands, usually. But towards the end of the day… they just feel… worn out. And a little stiff. That’s all. Really. Nothing a good cup of tea can't fix. Is the card going to happen or are we going to discuss the intricacies of my hand stiffness for the next hour?
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a look at your hands then. Just spread them out for me, palms up. And please, try to relax. This isn't a competition. I need to see what we're dealing with, not hear a story about tea and fiddly work.
PATIENT: Oh. Fine, fine. But don't expect much. They’re just… hands. And I told you, they ache after work. It’s hardly a medical mystery. Honestly, I don’t understand why you need to examine them. A card would have been so much simpler.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some slight swelling at the base of your index and middle fingers on both hands. And a little tenderness when I press here… and here. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in your joints?
PATIENT: Warmth? No. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes they feel a little… cool, actually. Especially in the evenings. But that’s just the house, you know? It gets a bit drafty. And redness? No. Nothing obvious. I wash my hands a lot, with strong soap. It’s a messy job, all those tiny pieces. Are you… finding something serious, Doctor? My daughter will be thrilled, I’m sure. Although I still think it's all a fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: The range of motion seems slightly limited, particularly in your index fingers. Not dramatically, but noticeable. And you mentioned washing your hands frequently with strong soap?
PATIENT: Yes, constantly! It’s a requirement of the job. And it’s strong soap, the industrial kind. Gets everything clean, you know? Tiny screws, little bits of metal… you wouldn't believe the mess. Honestly, I sometimes wonder if the soap isn’t the problem. It dries my skin out something awful. But it's a necessary evil. Can't assemble delicate things with dirty hands, now can you? Are you saying this soap is doing something… bad? Because if that's it, I can try a different brand. Though I doubt they’ll be as effective. And will I finally get my card?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I'm not saying the soap is solely to blame. But frequent exposure to harsh chemicals can exacerbate existing issues. And that limited range of motion, combined with the swelling and tenderness… it’s pointing towards something more than just “tired hands.” I need to pull up your medical history. Do you have any existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh. Well… nothing much. I had a bad flu when I was a child, a very bad one. And I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. A long time ago. But nothing… serious. No arthritis, no… anything like that. My mother had a bit of trouble with her hips when she got old, but that was just… old age. I’m perfectly healthy, truly. Are you going to ask about my blood pressure next? Because that’s probably fine too. Honestly, this is all very unnecessary. All I wanted was a card.
DOCTOR: According to the clinic records… you haven’t had a check-up in over ten years. And there's no mention of a bicycle accident or a severe case of the flu. Are you certain about this history?
PATIENT: Well… it was a long time ago. And my mother always said it was best not to bother the doctors unless absolutely necessary. A waste of their time, she said. And honestly, I've always been able to look after myself. A bit of tea, a good rest… that’s always been enough. Perhaps the records are… outdated? It was a long time ago. I just don’t like going to doctors. All the poking and prodding… and the questions. It makes me nervous. Can we just… skip the history and get to the card? Please?
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll skip the detailed history for now. But I need to ask you some specific questions, and I expect honest answers. Have you experienced any other symptoms besides hand aches and fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think… Well, sometimes my fingers feel a bit… numb. Especially in the mornings. And I've been feeling a bit… forgetful lately. Though, to be fair, I’m not as young as I used to be. It’s probably just old age. And my daughter keeps saying I'm more… irritable. But she says that about everyone. Really, those are the only things. Nothing serious, truly. Is that going to stop me from getting the card? It would mean a lot to her, you know. And honestly, it would be nice to finally put this whole thing behind us.
DOCTOR: Numbness in the fingers, forgetfulness, increased irritability… and the hand aches, swelling, and limited range of motion. Right. It’s starting to paint a slightly more concerning picture, dear. I'm going to order some blood tests, just to rule out a few possibilities. And I'd like to refer you to a rheumatologist for a proper evaluation. As for the card… we'll discuss that after we have some results. A card won't solve this, dear. And frankly, pretending everything is fine when it isn’t isn’t doing anyone any favors.
PATIENT: A rheumatologist? Blood tests? Oh, dear. Honestly, this is exactly what I was afraid of. All this fuss over… nothing. And you're saying a card isn't going to help? But she was so hopeful… she even picked out the design. It has little flowers on it. Fine. Blood tests. Rheumatologist. Whatever it takes to keep the peace. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect you to write the card. It’s the least you can do. And honestly, I’m starting to feel rather faint. Is there any chance I can have a cup of tea before all this poking and prodding begins?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Tea first. Then we’ll get the blood tests ordered. I’ll have the nurse draw them before you leave. And yes, I’ll write the card… if the tests come back normal and the rheumatologist confirms there's nothing serious going on. But you need to understand, dear, I'm a physician, not a miracle worker. And sometimes, the best course of action is to face the problem head-on, rather than sweeping it under the rug with a floral card. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to be a bit sensitive to dust, but that was when I was a child. And sometimes my skin gets itchy in the winter, but that’s just the cold. Nothing serious, truly. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed. Blood tests, rheumatologists… it’s all a bit much. And I keep forgetting things! I can’t even remember if I’ve told you about my daughter’s cat… she’s very fluffy. Fine. No allergies. Just… fluffy cats and a very worried daughter. And a growing sense of dread. Is there any chance you can explain all this to her? She’s going to be terribly upset.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. I will explain everything to your daughter, in a calm and rational manner. But you need to trust me when I say that ignoring these symptoms isn’t an option. And frankly, your forgetfulness is precisely why we need to investigate this further. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. In the meantime, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything, even over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Medications? Oh… well, just some ibuprofen for my hands, when they’re really aching. And sometimes a bit of paracetamol for a headache. Nothing regular, truly. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. My mother always said they do more harm than good. And… and sometimes I take a herbal tea, with ginger and lemon. It helps with the digestion, you know? Honestly, I just want this whole thing to be over. I just wanted a card. And now… now it’s blood tests and rheumatologists and… and who knows what else. Is there any chance this is just… stress? My daughter has been very insistent lately. Perhaps I’m just overwrought. Is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand this is overwhelming. And yes, stress can certainly exacerbate symptoms. But the numbness, the forgetfulness, the limited range of motion… those aren’t typically caused by stress alone. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before we jump to conclusions. I’m adding a vitamin D level to the blood tests. And I’m writing a referral to Dr. Sharma, a highly respected rheumatologist. She'll be able to assess your condition more thoroughly. Now, I’m going to be honest with you. If these tests reveal anything concerning, we’ll need to discuss treatment options. And that might involve medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. But for now, let’s just focus on getting these tests done. And then, we’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: Treatment options? Medication? Oh, dear. I… I don’t think I can handle any more bad news. And honestly, the thought of physical therapy… I’m not a very athletic person, you know? I prefer quiet activities, like knitting. Honestly, I just want to go home. And forget all about this whole thing. But my daughter… she’ll be terribly upset if I refuse. Is there any chance this is just… a temporary setback? Perhaps I just need a good rest and a bit of sunshine. And… and will Dr. Sharma be very… intimidating? I’m not a fan of strong personalities, you know. I prefer gentle people, who listen to your concerns. Is she… gentle? Please tell me she’s gentle. And… and will the tests hurt? I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat, you know. Honestly, I just want to go home. And maybe have a cup of tea. And forget all about this whole thing. .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Deep breaths. The tests won't hurt much. Just a small prick, like a mosquito bite. And Dr. Sharma is a very respected physician, and while she is thorough, she is also known for being compassionate and understanding. She’ll listen to your concerns, I assure you. Look, I understand this is overwhelming. And I’m not going to promise you everything will be alright. But I will promise you that we’ll take care of you, every step of the way. We’ll get these tests done, we’ll see Dr. Sharma, and we’ll figure out what’s going on. Nurse Patel?
