DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's good to meet you as well. Well, it’s about getting some shots, I reckon. My daughter… she’s trying to get her husband’s family over here from overseas. I understand there’s requirements for vaccinations and such, and I offered to help her sort it all out. I’m a bit lost on where to even begin, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very thoughtful of you. It can be a bit confusing navigating those requirements, absolutely. So, to clarify, you’re looking for vaccinations needed for international travel…specifically to help your daughter’s husband's family immigrate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Immigrate, not just a visit. They’ll be coming to live here, if everything goes through. And I want to make sure we do it right, you know? No delays because we missed something. Where do I even start finding out what they need? Is it different for each country? I don't even know what countries they're coming from, exactly. My daughter’s handling most of the paperwork, but she thought I should be the one to talk to a doctor about the shots.
DOCTOR: That’s a very responsible approach, Mr. Skarbek. It is different for each country, and it depends on their prior vaccination history, as well. Let's start with this: do you happen to know generally where they are coming from – even a continent would be helpful?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My daughter said something about…most of them are from Southeast Asia. Vietnam, I think for sure. And maybe…Cambodia? She mentioned something about a few others, but I wasn't really listening closely then. It's a bit of a jumble, honestly. I mostly just want to be sure they're healthy and can come here without trouble. Is there a list somewhere that says what shots folks from those countries usually need?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is. The CDC – that’s the Centers for Disease Control – has excellent information. Let's take a look at the recommendations for Vietnam and Cambodia. It looks like standard vaccinations are recommended – things like measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis… but for those regions, hepatitis A and typhoid are frequently suggested, and we'd want to discuss potential risks for Japanese encephalitis, depending on their travel plans within those countries. Do you know if they have any existing vaccination records?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds…complicated. Japanese encephalitis? I hadn't even heard of that! And no, I don’t think they have any records. They didn’t have much access to doctors where they were living, my daughter explained. Everything was…different. That's why she thought it was best if I handle this part, since I'm good at figuring things out. So, do we just…start over and get them all vaccinated for everything? Is that what you’re saying? And how do you even prove they got the shots, for the immigration people?
DOCTOR: It does sound a bit overwhelming, and you’re right to ask those questions. We won’t necessarily need to start completely over, but we will need to determine what vaccinations they’ve likely already received, and what they need to complete. Since records are unavailable, we'll likely have to assume they haven’t had certain vaccinations and proceed accordingly. The immigration process requires documented proof of vaccination. We can provide official records from this clinic for everything we administer here. To get a clearer picture, and help me decide the best course of action, could you tell me a little about their ages and general health?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a little more sense. At least we can get records here. Ages…let me see. There’s her husband, he’s…maybe 45? And their mother, she’s probably in her 60s, maybe early 70s. And their son, he’s around 20, I think. As for health…well, my daughter said they all seem okay, but they haven’t had regular checkups, like I said. They mostly just try to stay out of trouble and work hard. Nothing serious that I know of. They’re pretty resilient folks, if you ask me. But I worry about the older one, especially. Travel is hard on an old body.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better understanding. So, we have a 45-year-old male, a female in her 60s/70s, and a 20-year-old male, all generally healthy but with unknown vaccination histories. Given the age of the older gentleman's mother, we'll want to be particularly careful about live vaccines. Before we begin any vaccinations, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam on each of them – just to get a baseline assessment of their overall health and ensure they're suitable candidates for vaccination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A checkup is a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to make sure they're safe and healthy. When can we start? Are they going to need appointments? My daughter is very busy, so we’ll need to figure out a schedule that works for everyone. I don’t want to put too much on her plate.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can certainly work around your daughter’s schedule. We’ll need individual appointments for each of them – it’ll take about 30-45 minutes per person. I can schedule them consecutively on the same day, if that's easiest. Would a weekday morning or afternoon work better for you all?
PATIENT: Hmm… weekday mornings are probably best. My daughter has evenings pretty tied up with work. Let's see… maybe next week? What days are available? And… how much is each appointment going to cost? I have private insurance, but I want to know what to expect. I'm on a fixed income, you understand.
DOCTOR: Let me see… we have availability next Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday mornings. As for cost, the exam fee is $125 per person. The cost of each vaccine will depend on which ones are needed, but they typically range from $80-$150 per dose. Your insurance should cover a significant portion of these costs, but it’s difficult for me to give you a precise estimate without knowing your specific plan details. We do have a billing department that can verify your coverage and provide a more accurate cost breakdown before the appointments. Would you like me to have them contact your daughter?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be wonderful, Doctor. Having them contact my daughter would be a big help. She’s much better at dealing with insurance stuff than I am. And… Tuesday morning sounds good, if that works. So, Tuesday it is, then. I appreciate your help with all this. It's a lot to keep track of, and I'm getting a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But I want to make sure her husband’s family gets here safely, and I'm glad I came to you for advice. Is there anything else I need to know or bring with me on Tuesday? Any forms or paperwork I should fill out beforehand?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It is a lot to manage, and you’re doing the right thing by getting them checked out. For Tuesday, could you please bring your daughter's insurance cards?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’ll make sure she brings those with her. Is that all? Alright then, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. I believe so. We'll see you and your daughter on Tuesday. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions before then.
