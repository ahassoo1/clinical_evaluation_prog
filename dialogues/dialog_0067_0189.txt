DOCTOR: Good morning, Arbie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning to you. Don't bother with the niceties, Doctor. I'm here because… well, let's just say things aren't coming out right. There was blood. In the stool. Not a good sign, is it? I've seen a thing or two in my years, you understand. Flew planes all over, and a body knows when something's amiss.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. And it’s good you came in to get it checked. Blood in the stool is definitely something we want to investigate. You mentioned seeing a thing or two in your years… about how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Investigate, investigate… always investigate. Seems like everyone wants to investigate these days. Now, how long… let me think. It wasn't yesterday, that's for certain. Maybe… a week? No, more like ten days. It wasn't a lot of blood, mind you. Just… streaks. Enough to worry a sensible man, though. A sensible man who's seen a few things, I might add. Don't you doctors keep up with these things? It’s not exactly new.
DOCTOR: Sensible men do worry when they see blood in their stool, and you are right to be concerned. And yes, we do keep up with these things. Ten days ago… okay. And has this been happening with every bowel movement since then, or has it been intermittent?
PATIENT: Inter… what now? You use a lot of fancy words, Doctor. Every time? No, not every time. Some days it's fine, completely normal. Other days… well, you know. Streaks. Like someone dropped a little bit of raspberry jam in there. Not a pleasant sight, I assure you. And don’t tell me about fiber, I eat enough vegetables.
DOCTOR: Intermittent – meaning it comes and goes. Yes, that’s helpful to know. And no, I won’t lecture you about fiber, especially if you're already eating plenty of vegetables. So, other than the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… well, they seem a bit… thinner, perhaps? Not drastically, mind you. But not as… substantial as they used to be. I used to have… a good solid movement, you understand? A proper one. Now it's… fragmented. And a bit harder to… pass, if you catch my meaning. Old age, probably. Though I still think a good pilot can handle anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, thinner, fragmented, and harder to pass. That’s helpful information. And yes, those can be related to age, but it's still important to figure out what's causing it. Have you experienced any abdominal pain or cramping with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not pain, exactly. More like… discomfort. A bit of a rumbling. And maybe a bit of a… ache, down low. Not enough to stop me from my morning coffee, mind you. I've taken worse landings than this discomfort, let me tell you. But it's there, a nagging sort of feeling. It comes and goes, like everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort, rumbling, and a nagging ache that comes and goes. I want to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be, if that counts. And I had a bit of trouble with my ticker a few years back, but they patched it up. Nothing major. I’m a tough old bird, you understand. Been through a lot. Mostly just the usual aches and pains that come with… well, with living this long. I don’t go to doctors much, if I can help it. They usually just tell you to slow down. And that's not an option.
DOCTOR: I understand. Knee trouble and a history of heart issues – good to know. And I appreciate you telling me you don’t like to come to the doctor unless you have to. Let's see… are you currently taking any medications for your knees or your heart, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. A little something for the knees, now and then. The usual ibuprofen, when they're acting up. And a small dose of something… a water pill, I think, for the ticker. Nothing fancy. Just enough to keep things… regular. And a multi-vitamin, because my daughter insists. She worries too much. Honestly, I've lived this long without needing a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen for your knees as needed, a water pill for your heart, and a multivitamin. And that's it?
PATIENT: That’s it. Unless you count the occasional glass of scotch. Does that count as medication? Helps me sleep, you know. A pilot's gotta rest somehow. Though I haven't been flying for… well, a long time. Still, old habits, you understand. And it doesn't give me any trouble.
DOCTOR: I won’t put that in your chart, Arbie. Okay, last few questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. I eat most things, though I don’t particularly care for beets. My mother used to make me eat them when I was a boy. Awful things. Other than that, no. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been a pretty robust constitution. Though my skin gets a bit itchy in the winter. But that’s just the dry air, I reckon. Not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Arbie, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A what now? A rectal… Oh, no. Absolutely not. Look, Doctor, I've flown planes through thunderstorms, navigated by the stars, and survived a crash landing in the jungle. I’ve had my share of… examinations. But this? This is going too far. I came here because of a little bit of blood, not for… poking and prodding. I’ll just take my chances, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Arbie. It’s not the most comfortable exam, I'll admit. However, given your symptoms – the blood in your stool, the changes in your bowel movements, and the discomfort – it’s a crucial part of trying to figure out what’s going on. It helps us rule out more serious conditions, like polyps or other issues that need attention. I wouldn’t recommend it if it wasn't important. Would you be willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Hmph. "Important," you say? Sounds like you're already expecting the worst. I don’t appreciate that, Doctor. I’ve always prided myself on my good health. And frankly, I don’t like being treated like some… delicate flower. I've lived a long life, and I'd like to keep it that way. But I still don’t like the sound of this… poking and prodding. What exactly are you looking for, anyway? Maybe if you explain it properly, I'll… consider it. But no promises.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I want to be completely transparent. The exam allows me to check for any masses or tenderness in the rectum, and to look for any signs of blood or other abnormalities. It's a quick exam, and I’ll do everything I can to make you as comfortable as possible. The most common things we’re looking for are hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or polyps. Polyps are small growths that can sometimes cause bleeding and, in some cases, can become cancerous over time. Finding them early is key to successful treatment. I understand your concerns about being treated like a delicate flower, and I assure you that’s not my intention. I simply want to ensure we’re thorough and rule out anything serious. Would you be more comfortable if I explain the procedure step-by-step before we proceed?
PATIENT: Step-by-step… Hmph. Very well. Explain it. But make it quick, and don't use any fancy medical jargon. I don’t need a lecture, just the facts. And I still think this is a bit… undignified. A pilot of my experience… Still. If it’s really necessary, I suppose I can endure a little… discomfort. But I expect a full explanation of what you're looking at, afterwards. And no surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. You’ll lie on your side, with your knees bent. I’ll use a lubricant to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may feel some pressure, but shouldn’t be painful. I’ll be feeling for any lumps, bumps, or tenderness. I’ll also check for any signs of blood. The entire exam takes less than a minute. I will explain everything I’m feeling as I go, and I will answer any questions you have. Afterwards, I'll discuss my findings with you in detail. Does that sound… less daunting?
PATIENT: Less… less daunting, perhaps. Though I still maintain it’s a rather… unpleasant prospect. A minute, you say? A minute of indignity. Fine. Just… promise me you'll be gentle. And explain what you're doing before you do it. I don't like surprises. And if I feel any real pain, you stop immediately. Understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely understood, Arbie. Gentle is my top priority. I will explain every step before I do it, and I will stop immediately if you experience any pain. I will also let you know exactly what I am feeling as I go. You are in control, and I will respect your wishes at all times. Would you like me to prepare the room now?
PATIENT: Very well. Prepare the room. But quickly, please. I haven’t got all day, you know. And… try to be discreet. A pilot of my stature doesn’t appreciate being… exposed. Let’s just get this over with. And please, remind me again why I agreed to this… indignity.
DOCTOR: Of course, Arbie. I understand. We’re doing this to get to the bottom of the blood in your stool, the changes in your bowel movements, and the discomfort you’ve been experiencing. It’s a crucial step in ruling out anything serious and ensuring you stay healthy for many years to come. It’s a quick exam, and I’ll do everything I can to make you comfortable. Please lie on your side on the examination table, with your knees bent towards your chest. I'll be right back.
