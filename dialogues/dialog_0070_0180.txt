DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's this... tiredness. Just always tired. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I keep wanting to eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. Makes me feel sick even thinking about it. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me. It’s not always easy to talk about these things, and it’s good you came in. “Always tired” is a very broad symptom, of course, and the craving for dirt… that’s quite unusual. Let’s try to get a better understanding of both of those. When you say “always tired,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? I'm tired. All the time. Wake up tired, go to bed tired. Doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, doesn't matter if I only get four. It just… is. It's been going on for… a while now. Months, I guess? Longer? Honestly, I lose track. It's just… life. I work, I come home, I sleep, I repeat. Is that helpful? Because I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds quite debilitating. Months of persistent fatigue, even with varying sleep amounts… that’s significant. And you mentioned it impacts your daily life; work, sleep, repeat. We need to investigate this. Before we move on, let’s talk a little bit more about this craving for dirt. When did that start?
PATIENT: Ugh, don’t make me talk about the dirt again. It's… shameful. Started maybe around the same time as the tiredness? I don’t know. It’s not like I go out of my way to eat it. It’s just… sometimes I'm outside, and I just… pick some up. Little bits. And then I… eat it. It’s weird. It doesn’t taste good, but… I need it. Like something’s missing if I don’t. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Cantoran. And please, don't feel ashamed. We're here to understand what's going on, and it's important to be honest about everything, no matter how unusual it seems. The fact that it started around the same time as the fatigue is very interesting. This craving—what’s called pica—can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. To get a better understanding, let's go through some questions about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: A typical day? Honestly? Not much. I usually grab something quick for breakfast, like toast. Then… I eat whatever I can get at the factory cafeteria. Mostly just… processed stuff. Burgers, fries, that kind of thing. Not a lot of vegetables, I’ll admit. And for dinner… sometimes I cook, sometimes I just order takeout. I don’t really pay attention to what I eat. It needs to be fast, that’s all. Is that good enough? I don’t have time to list every single thing I put in my mouth.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Cantoran. Just getting a general idea is helpful. It sounds like your diet is… relatively limited in fruits and vegetables. That could certainly contribute to some deficiencies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not that I remember. I had… the usual childhood stuff. Chickenpox, measles, you know. Nothing serious. I haven’t been to the doctor in… years. Probably ten years? Maybe more. I just try to avoid doctors if I can. They never have any answers anyway. My husband… he used to take me when I needed to go. But… he passed away a few years back. So. I’ve been on my own since then.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Cantoran. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. And I understand your reluctance to visit the doctor, especially if you haven’t had positive experiences in the past. Since you haven't been to the doctor in quite some time, and given your symptoms, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. I also think some blood work is important to check for any potential deficiencies. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, more poking and prodding? Look, I really don't have time for all this. I have work to get back to. Blood work…fine, I guess. But keep it quick. And no long explanations, please. I don't understand most of that medical jargon anyway. Just tell me if there's something wrong. And honestly, if it's just "eat more vegetables", I’m going to be very annoyed. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Cantoran. I will certainly keep it quick, and I will avoid using any unnecessary jargon. I’ll focus on getting the essential information. I promise to only explain what's necessary, and I won't dismiss your concerns. First, let’s check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your throat and abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don't take too long. And please, try not to poke me too much. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically so. Your pulse and temperature are normal. I did notice your breathing sounds are a little quiet at the bottom of your lungs. I'm going to listen more closely, if that's alright. Do you have any history of asthma, bronchitis, or other lung problems?
PATIENT: Lung problems? No. Never. I worked in a factory for thirty years, around dust and stuff, but I never got sick. I mean, I get the usual colds, but nothing serious. My father… he smoked a lot, and he had lung problems, but I never did. It’s probably nothing. Just… old age, I guess. Can we just get to the blood work now? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright. It's good to know you haven’t had any previous lung problems, and we’ll keep that in mind. Your father’s smoking history is also relevant. While it’s possible it’s just age, it's important to investigate the diminished breath sounds. Let's move on to the blood work. I'm going to need to draw a few vials. It will take just a few minutes. I'll send these to the lab, and we should have the results back within a few days. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Latex? I don’t know. I don't pay attention to stuff like that. I think… maybe? I've had a rash before after touching some gloves, but I don't remember exactly. Honestly, I’m not even sure what latex is. Just… be careful, okay? And don't take too much blood. I get lightheaded easily. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I’ll use latex-free gloves, just to be safe. And I'll be as gentle as possible. I will also have you sit up for a few extra minutes after the draw to prevent any lightheadedness. Okay, Ms. Cantoran, all done. Please keep pressure on this site for a few more minutes. I’ve sent the samples to the lab, and we should have the results back within 3-5 business days. In the meantime, if you experience any excessive bleeding, pain, or swelling at the puncture site, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell me when the results are in. And don’t bother calling me with a lecture about vegetables. I understand. Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. Thank you. Or… whatever.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. And I assure you, I won't lecture you about vegetables. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before then. Have a safe trip back to work.
