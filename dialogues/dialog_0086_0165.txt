DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever keeps coming back. It's been a pain, honestly. Feels like it disappears for a day or two, then bam, right back.
DOCTOR: A recurring fever, you say. And how long has this been going on for, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… around the end of May, I guess. So, about two months now. Maybe a little longer. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. I don’t usually keep track of these things unless they really bother me, and this one… it bothers me enough to be here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "around the end of May" isn’t terribly specific, but we’ll work with it. And what’s the fever like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a crazy high fever, you know? Like, I haven’t been delirious or anything. Just… warm. Really warm. Usually around 101, 102. I take some of that… Tylenol, and it goes down. But then it comes back. It’s mostly just makes me tired, really. And achy. Like I got a little flu.
DOCTOR: 101, 102… that's not nothing, but it's also not an emergency. Are you experiencing any chills with the fever?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. Not every time, but when it first comes on, I get the shakes. Like, I need a blanket and a hot cup of coffee kind of shakes. Then it eases up once the Tylenol kicks in. And I get a little sweaty, you know? It's… unpleasant. Look, is this gonna be a long thing? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: "Things to do"... Right. Well, we need to figure out why you're having this fever before we can discuss how long it will be. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fever and aches?
PATIENT: Let me think… uh… not really. No cough, no runny nose. No… nothing like that. I mean, I'm a little thirsty sometimes, but that could just be the weather, right? It’s been hot. My wife keeps telling me to drink more water anyway. Honestly, that’s about it. It’s just the fever and the aches. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: No other symptoms... Alright. And have you been traveling anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveling? No, not really. Just to the grocery store, the bakery… you know, regular stuff. Haven't left the state in… oh, maybe five years? My wife likes to say I’m too old to be flying anyway. So, no exotic viruses for me, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's take a look at your chart… I see you haven’t had a physical in… a while. And no recent bloodwork. Alright, Mr. Brege, I’m going to need to do a quick exam, check your vitals, and then we’ll get some blood drawn. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Ugh. Bloodwork. Look, is that absolutely necessary? I hate needles. I just want something to make the fever stop. Is there anything else we can try first?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your dislike of needles, but we need to rule out some potential causes for this recurring fever. Simply masking the symptom with Tylenol isn't going to solve the problem, and it could be indicative of something more serious. It's a simple blood draw, and it will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. It's what any responsible doctor would do.
PATIENT: Fine. Bloodwork it is. But can we make it quick? And a small needle, please. I don’t want to pass out on your floor. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's get started then. If you'll have a seat. I'll need to check your blood pressure and temperature first. And then we'll proceed with the blood draw. Just try to relax. It'll be over before you know it.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Let's just… get this over with. Hopefully it doesn't take long. You got a good nurse, I hope? I’m not good with… procedures.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. And your temperature is 101.3. As for the nurse, Maria is excellent. She’s been with the clinic for years. She’ll be very gentle. If you could sit here, please. Maria will be with you shortly. Now, try to stay still while she draws the blood, and breathe deeply. It will make things easier.
PATIENT: Alright. Easy for you to say. I’m the one getting poked. Just… hurry it up, please? I got appointments this afternoon. Is this gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: It will be a brief discomfort, Mr. Brege. Maria will minimize the pain as much as possible. And I assure you, it’s a necessary step to determine the cause of your recurring fever. Maria! We have a patient here for bloodwork. Just relax your arm, and try to focus on your breathing. The more tense you are, the more it will hurt.
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Relax. Easy for you to say. Just… let’s get this over with. It feels like I’m ten years old again getting shots at the doctor's office. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege, just take a few deep breaths. We'll get this done quickly. This might sting for a moment…
PATIENT: Ow! See? I told you it would sting! This is awful. Just… hurry up and get it over with. I really don't like needles. And don't poke me more than once, please.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Mr. Brege. Just a few more seconds. Try to keep your arm still. There you go. All finished. Keep pressure on this for a few minutes, and you should be all set. And here's a bandage for you. All samples collected.
PATIENT: Finally. That was… unpleasant. Well, that’s done, thank goodness. Can I go now? I really need to get going. I hope those tests find something. This fever is driving me crazy. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go. The lab results should be back in a few days. My assistant will call you with the results. And try to get some rest in the meantime. Next!
