DOCTOR: Right. Lilyanna Snerling, 23 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, it’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady, like I might fall. It's been happening for a little while now, but it feels worse recently. I don’t… I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Gradually” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I apologize. It is difficult. Let me think… Perhaps a few months? Maybe longer? It started subtly, just a little wobble when I was walking. Now… now it's more noticeable. Especially after work, I think. Although, honestly, the days all blur together a bit. I work long shifts, you see. Rotary drill operator, out in the oil fields. It’s… demanding work.
DOCTOR: Oil fields. Right. And this unsteadiness… does anything specific trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it…? That’s a good question. I haven’t really… noticed a specific thing. Sometimes it happens when I stand up quickly, I think. And like I said, after a long day at work it’s much worse. Standing for long periods isn’t good. Or…bending over. I do a lot of bending. But other times it just… happens. Without any reason at all, as far as I can tell. It's very… unsettling. I keep fearing I’ll just fall over, you see.
DOCTOR: Any dizziness associated with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Hmm. Sometimes, yes. Not a spinning sensation, exactly. More like… lightheadedness? A sort of… floating feeling? It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes, and not always with the unsteadiness. It’s hard to describe, I’m afraid. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy, if that makes sense. I’m not usually this… vague. It’s just… everything has been rather stressful lately.
DOCTOR: Stressful?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… my husband… he passed away a few months ago. It’s been… difficult adjusting. And work is very demanding, as I mentioned. It requires a lot of concentration, long hours… and I feel responsible for keeping things afloat, financially. I suppose the stress is… all-encompassing. I’m terribly sorry to bring it up, it's not really relevant to the… unsteadiness, is it? Perhaps it’s just… me.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said this started around the time of your husband’s passing?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I believe so. It’s all a bit of a blur, truly. It was shortly after, I think. I was probably just… preoccupied with everything. I didn’t notice the unsteadiness right away, if that makes sense. I just… kept going. I’m not one to complain, you see. And… well, I had to. Financially, we… relied on his income. I needed to keep working. It just… gradually worsened. I'm so sorry. I don’t mean to ramble.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been… rather tired, of course. But that’s probably the work and… everything else. I haven't had any headaches or blurred vision. No ringing in my ears. My hearing feels fine. And I haven’t had any trouble with my balance, specifically, just the feeling of being unsteady. Oh… sometimes my hands feel a little shaky, but that's only after a long day at work. It's hard to say if that’s related. I really don't know. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Any history of falls?
PATIENT: Falls…? No, thankfully. Not a full fall, no. I’ve had a few close calls, where I’ve stumbled or had to grab onto something to steady myself. But I’ve managed to avoid actually falling. That’s what’s so concerning, you see. I feel like I’m constantly on the verge of losing my balance. It's making me very anxious. I worry about falling at work, especially. It’s a dangerous environment.
DOCTOR: Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just… a mild blood pressure medication. My husband’s family had a history of hypertension, so my doctor prescribed it a few years ago, as a precaution. Just a small dose, every morning. And… occasionally, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever for muscle aches, after work. That’s it, really. Nothing else. I’m generally quite healthy, otherwise. Or, I was… before all of this.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any issues with medications. I’m generally… very robust, I suppose. My husband used to joke that I could eat anything without getting sick. It's just… this unsteadiness. It's so unlike me. It's very worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Please stand up for me. I’m going to check your balance and reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. I apologize in advance if I’m a little… wobbly. I do feel rather unsteady today. Please, let me know if there’s anything I should do. Or if you need me to hold onto something. I’m happy to, if that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head. Reflexes appear normal. Slight tremor noted in hands. Balance is… somewhat impaired. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. And your pulse is a little fast, 98. Not drastically so, but worth noting.
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Elevated, you say? That’s… not good, is it? My husband used to monitor his blood pressure quite closely. He was very meticulous about his health. Is it… serious? And the tremor… is that related to the unsteadiness, do you think? I'm terribly sorry to ask so many questions. I just… want to understand what’s happening. I don’t want to become a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: It's likely a combination of factors. The stress, your husband’s passing, and the demanding nature of your work. The slightly elevated blood pressure could contribute to the dizziness and unsteadiness. As for the tremor, that could be a side effect of stress, or simply fatigue. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. We'll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic metabolic panel. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… that sounds… thorough. Is it… painful? I've never had much done, to be honest. And how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work soon, you see. It's… difficult to take time off. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I really do. It’s just… everything feels so overwhelming right now.
DOCTOR: The blood draw itself is a quick pinch, nothing to worry about. And the results usually take a few days, depending on the lab. I'll have my nurse contact you when they’re available. For now, I recommend you try to reduce your stress levels. Easier said than done, I know. And perhaps consider a less physically demanding role at work, if possible. I’m also going to refer you to a neurologist, just to rule out any neurological issues. It’s always best to be thorough.
PATIENT: Oh. A neurologist… That sounds… serious. Is it something I should be worried about? I thought… I thought it might just be stress. And a less physically demanding role… that’s… difficult. My job is the only thing keeping me afloat financially. I just… I don’t know what to do. Everything feels so uncertain right now. Perhaps it’s just best to… wait for the results. I suppose. Thank you, doctor. For everything.
DOCTOR: The referral is just a precaution. Don’t jump to conclusions. We’ll discuss the results when they’re back. My nurse will give you instructions on where to go for the blood work and the neurology appointment. Here's the information you need. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, doctor. I… I suppose I’ll just… go then. I hope the results are nothing serious. Goodbye.
