DOCTOR: Good morning, Kahrin. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Just the results, please. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just jump straight to it, that’d be great. I remember everything the nurse told me about why I was here, so no need to go over that again.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I understand you'd like to get straight to the results. Let me pull those up now... Okay, so the nurse informed you about the concerns regarding potential iron deficiency anemia, based on your initial bloodwork. I have the full results here. Before we dive in, just so I have a complete picture, could you quickly confirm if there have been any changes to your health since the nurse took your initial information – any new symptoms, or anything feeling particularly worse?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing new. Same as before. Honestly, I barely notice anything different most days. I just get tired easily, I guess. That's why I even bothered coming in.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, the results confirm a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. Your hemoglobin is a bit low, at 11.2 g/dL, and your ferritin level is quite low as well, at 15 ng/mL. These levels indicate your body isn't storing enough iron, which is causing the fatigue you’re experiencing. Do you have any idea why your iron might be low?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat okay, I think. I don't… I don’t eat a lot of red meat, if that matters. I try to eat healthy, lots of fruits and veggies, but I haven't been specifically trying to get more iron or anything. I didn't even know that was a thing people did.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. It's common for people to not realize iron deficiency can develop without consciously focusing on it. Not eating a lot of red meat can definitely contribute, as it's a good source of iron. Other causes can include heavy menstrual periods, certain medical conditions, or difficulty absorbing iron. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to ask a few quick questions to rule out any underlying causes. Would you mind if I ask about your menstrual cycle – how regular it is, and how heavy your periods typically are?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. It’s… pretty regular, I guess. Like, clockwork. But they’re… heavy. Like, really heavy. I always have to use super-plus tampons, and even then, sometimes I'm changing them every couple of hours. It’s annoying, honestly. Is that… bad? I just figured everyone was like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful information. Heavy menstrual bleeding, what we call menorrhagia, is a common cause of iron deficiency anemia in women. It sounds like yours might be contributing significantly. We’ll want to investigate that further to rule out any other underlying issues. Now, let's talk about getting your iron levels back up. The primary treatment for iron deficiency anemia is iron supplementation. We can start with oral iron tablets. The dosage is usually 65mg three times a day. However, oral iron can sometimes cause side effects like constipation or stomach upset. Would you prefer to start with the oral iron and see how you tolerate it, or would you be interested in discussing other options, like an intravenous iron infusion, which bypasses the digestive system and can be more effective, but does carry some minor risks?
PATIENT: Ugh, constipation? No thanks. I already have enough problems with that. Is the infusion… scary? I don’t really like needles. And how much does it cost? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. Constipation is a common side effect with oral iron, but there are ways to manage it – increasing fiber and fluids, or using a stool softener. However, if you're worried about it, the infusion is a good alternative. The infusion isn’t usually scary. It's a relatively quick procedure – we'll start an IV, and the iron is administered slowly over a few hours. We’ll monitor you closely the entire time. As for the cost, since you don’t have insurance, the infusion would be around $300-$500 depending on the exact dosage needed. It’s unfortunately not cheap, but it can be a more effective and tolerable option. Before we decide, let’s quickly review your diet. Are you consuming a lot of Vitamin C-rich foods with your meals?
PATIENT: Vitamin… C? I eat oranges sometimes. And… tomatoes, I guess? I don't really plan my meals around vitamins. I just eat what I like. Is that important? Look, I just want to feel better, and if the pills are going to make me miserable, I'd rather just pay the money for the shot, if that's an option. I just need to know if it’s safe.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. And yes, Vitamin C is important because it helps your body absorb iron more efficiently. Eating oranges and tomatoes is a good start, but ideally, we’d want to include a Vitamin C source with each meal containing iron. And yes, the infusion is a safe option, though, like any medical procedure, it does carry some minor risks – such as a reaction at the IV site, or, very rarely, a more serious allergic reaction. We'll take all necessary precautions to minimize those risks, and we'll monitor you closely during and after the infusion. Given your concerns about constipation and your preference for a faster solution, I recommend we proceed with the intravenous iron infusion. We can schedule it for next week. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Next week sounds good. As long as it doesn't mess up my schedule too badly. I have work, you know. And… what do I need to do to prepare? Anything I need to eat or not eat beforehand? And is there anything I should be worried about after the infusion? Like, will I feel sick? I need to know, because I can’t really take time off.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get all those questions answered. I understand the need to maintain your work schedule. For preparation, you don’t need to do anything specific with your diet beforehand. Just eat normally. However, it’s important to stay well-hydrated leading up to the infusion, so drink plenty of water. After the infusion, you might experience some mild side effects, such as a metallic taste in your mouth, fatigue, or a headache. These usually resolve within 24-48 hours. We’ll monitor you for an hour after the infusion to make sure you’re doing okay. You should be able to return to work the following day, but avoid strenuous activity for the rest of the day of the infusion. Rarely, some people experience a more severe reaction, which is why we monitor you so closely. I’ll have the nurse schedule the infusion for you and give you a detailed information sheet with everything we discussed. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to check your iron levels and see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds… manageable. As long as I don’t have to be sick in bed for a week. Thanks. I think that’s all my questions. I just want to feel normal again. Can we just… get it done? I have a lot going on.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We’ll get everything set up for you. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready, and she’ll take it from there. It’s my pleasure to help you feel better, Kahrin. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions between now and then. .
