DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. My name is Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little bit now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Annoying symptoms are the worst. Can you tell me a little more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not constant, thankfully. Comes and goes. Sometimes it feels like… pins and needles, like when your foot falls asleep. Other times, it’s just… numb. It’s worse in the evenings, I think. And it's both hands and both feet, not just one or the other. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. It's helpful to know it's both sides and that it comes and goes. And yes, describing sensations can be tricky! You're doing fine. When did this tingling start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe a couple of months ago? Around springtime, I guess. It was gradual, not like it just suddenly happened. I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first, just thought I was sitting funny or something. But it hasn’t gone away, so… here I am. I wish I could be more precise, but honestly, time just… slips away these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. A couple of months ago is a good starting point. And it's common for things to start gradually, and easy to dismiss at first. Has anything specific made it worse since it started?
PATIENT: Oh, well, carrying the mail doesn't help, that's for sure. Heavy bags, lots of walking… it feels worse after a long day on my route. And cold weather… brrr, that makes it really bad. I try to wear gloves, but still. I don't know if that's related, though. It's been a cold spring, hasn't it?
DOCTOR: It has been a chilly spring. That's very helpful information, Teretha – the mail route and the cold definitely seem to be triggers. Do you notice anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not really… hmm. Sometimes, if I shake my hands, it helps a little bit. Just for a moment. And when I’m resting, it gets better. But it always comes back. I haven’t noticed anything else, not that I can think of. I don’t take any medications, and I don’t have any other health problems, not that I know of. I just… get tired easily, but who doesn’t these days? I’m 63, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking your hands providing temporary relief is good to note. And you don't currently take any medications and don’t have any known health problems, beyond fatigue. Let’s do a quick review of systems, just to get a more complete picture. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness? Not really… well, sometimes my hands ache after a long day, but that's just from carrying those heavy bags, I think. Not like I can’t lift things, or anything. I can still do everything I need to. My feet get tired, but that's just… walking all day. I don't feel like I'm dropping things, or tripping, or anything like that. I hope that makes sense. It’s just… being old.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Teretha, and you’re very observant. No noticeable weakness, just aches and fatigue, which is understandable given your work. Have you noticed any changes in your skin on your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Changes in my skin? Hmm… well, my hands are a little rough, from all the washing and handling mail, you know? And my feet… I have a couple of corns, probably. Nothing major. I usually just use a pumice stone. No rashes, or anything like that. Just… old people skin. I really don't pay much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Okay, some rough skin and corns, but no rashes or other significant changes. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, diabetes. No, never. My doctor always checks my blood sugar when I get my check-up, and it's always been fine. I do try to watch my sweets, though. My mother had a little trouble with it, so I'm careful. No, never been diagnosed myself.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful. Any history of thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Thyroid problems… hmm. I don’t think so. I don’t remember ever being told I had anything wrong with my thyroid. I’ve had a lot of doctors over the years, and I don’t really remember all the details. I do get cold easily, but that’s just… me. I’m always cold. Is that a thyroid thing? I don't know.
DOCTOR: It can be a thyroid thing, Teretha, but it can also be many other things! Let’s move on for now. Have you ever had any surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… yes. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must have been… oh, goodness, almost 30 years ago now? And I had my appendix taken out when I was a little girl. That’s about it, though. Nothing else. It was all a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder and appendix removed, both a long time ago. And no other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have neuropathy, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Neuropathy… oh, goodness. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands and feet when she got older, something with tingling. I don’t really know what it was, they just said it was “old age” or something. My father… he was healthy as a horse, never had any problems. I don’t think anyone else in the family had anything like that. It was mostly just my mother. It was a long time ago, though, I can't remember details.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tingling in your mother's hands and feet, but not a clear diagnosis of neuropathy. That's good to know. Now, I want to ask about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he smoked, for a long time, but he passed away a few years back. I always hated it, so I made him smoke outside. I just don’t like it. And I don’t drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke, and you only drink occasionally. Now, finally, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, not really. I don’t think so. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the summer, but that’s just from the bugs, I think. Nothing serious. No, I don’t have any allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Can we be done now? I just want to get home and rest. This has been… a long morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And I understand you’re feeling tired. Alright, Teretha, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your reflexes, your strength, and the sensation in your hands and feet. It shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… Well, I suppose so. If you promise it won’t take long. I really just want to figure out what’s going on with my hands and feet, so I can get back to normal. And I do need to get home, I have a little garden to tend to. But yes, alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It won't take long. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? Is that okay? I'm not very strong these days, you know. It’s just… getting old. I used to be able to lift anything, but now… not so much. I’m worried this is something serious.
DOCTOR: That’s good, Teretha. Your grip strength is a bit reduced, but not dramatically. Now, I’m going to check the sensation in your hands and feet. I'm going to lightly touch different areas and ask you to tell me when you feel it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes that sounds alright. Please be gentle, my skin is a little sensitive. Just… poke me and tell me when you feel it, right? I really hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noticing some decreased sensation in your hands and feet, particularly in your fingertips and toes. It's subtle, but it is present on both sides. Alright, Teretha. Based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have peripheral neuropathy. It’s a condition affecting the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. The decreased sensation and diminished reflexes we observed are consistent with this. Now, it's important to figure out why this is happening. There are many possible causes. We’ll need to do some blood work to check for things like diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, and other potential causes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… Neuropathy… Is that… bad? I've heard that name before, but… what does that mean? Will I have to go to the hospital? And blood work… oh, I hate needles. Is there anything I can do to make it better? I just want to be able to feel my hands and feet again. Is this something I got from carrying the mail?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried when you hear a diagnosis like that, Teretha. Let's break it down. Neuropathy itself isn’t a disease, it’s more like a symptom of something else going on. It means there’s some damage or dysfunction to the nerves, which is causing the tingling, numbness, and weakness you’re experiencing. It's not necessarily something that requires hospitalization. Most cases of neuropathy are managed with medication, lifestyle changes, and addressing the underlying cause. The blood work will help us determine what’s causing it. It's a routine procedure, and we'll do our best to make you comfortable. As for the mail route – repetitive stress can sometimes contribute to neuropathy, but it's not the only cause. It’s more likely a combination of factors, and the blood work will help us pinpoint those. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, a complete blood count, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and vitamin B12 and D levels. These will give us a good starting point. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Oh, latex… I don’t think so. I haven’t had much exposure to it, but… maybe? I remember getting a rash once, from a balloon, when I was a little girl. But it could have been anything, really. I just get sensitive skin sometimes. It’s better to be safe than sorry, I suppose. Can they use non-latex gloves? I really don't want to get a rash on top of everything else.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Teretha. We will definitely use non-latex gloves for everything, just to be safe. I'll make a note of the latex sensitivity in your chart. Okay, the orders are in. You can go to the lab at [Clinic Name] anytime this week. They don’t require an appointment. They’ll draw a small amount of blood, and the results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. In the meantime, try to avoid anything that makes the symptoms worse – like carrying heavy bags or being out in the cold. You can try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you’re experiencing discomfort, but don’t take them for more than a couple of days without talking to me. Once we get the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… okay. I’ll go to the lab this week. I just hope they don’t have to poke me too much. And I'll try to take it easy, I guess. It’s hard when you have a route to finish, but… I’ll try. So… that’s it? I can go home now? I really just want to rest and hope it’s not too serious. Is there anything else I need to do, or worry about, before I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, Teretha, that’s it for today. You can go home and rest. And no, there's nothing else you need to do or worry about right now. Just focus on taking care of yourself and scheduling that lab work. We’ll figure this out together. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results come back. Here's a printout of the lab orders and a brief summary of our discussion. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Teretha, and try not to stress too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. And… you too.
