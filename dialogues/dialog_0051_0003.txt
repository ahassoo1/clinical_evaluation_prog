DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, Doc, can we just get this over with? I haven’t got all day. It’s this… shaking. My hand, mostly. Been happening for a while now, and it’s getting… bothersome. Really bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand you want to get to the bottom of this quickly. We will, I assure you. This shaking… when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't rightly recall. A while back. A long while. Everything's a bit of a blur these days, you know? Probably… last year, maybe? Or was it the year before? It’s hard to say. Doesn't matter much, does it? It just is.
DOCTOR: It does matter a bit, sir, to get a timeline. Even a rough estimate helps. But I understand recall can be difficult. So, let's say roughly a year ago. Has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… yes, that's it. Mostly when I try to do things. Like… holding a fork, writing, you know, simple things. It's not always shaking, thankfully. Just when I need a steady hand, which… isn't as often these days, thank goodness. My wife always did the fancy stuff anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. So it seems to be more noticeable with activity. Does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… Stress, probably. Or… when I’m tired. Being tired makes everything worse, doesn't it? And… I don't know… caffeine, maybe? I used to drink a lot of coffee, back in the day. Not so much now, though. It just… jitters me up too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, stress, fatigue, and perhaps caffeine. Noted. Now, tell me a bit more about the shaking itself. Is it a constant tremor, or more jerky?
PATIENT: Jerky… no. Not jerky, exactly. More… a wobble. Like a leaf in the wind, if that makes any sense. A fine tremble, mostly. It's not like I'm spasming or anything. Just… an annoying wobble. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: No, sir, we're making good progress. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a clearer picture. Does the shaking happen in both hands, or just the one you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just this one. The right one, mostly. Sometimes it'll creep into the left, but not often. It’s… manageable, usually. I just try not to use it too much. Honestly, I just wish it would stop. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It can be frustrating and unsettling. Do you have any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I’m… a bit achy sometimes, I suppose. Old age, you know? Everything creaks and groans. But that's just… being old. And… I forget things now and then, but who doesn't? Look, I told you, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, aches and memory issues. Those are helpful things to know. Have you noticed any stiffness in your muscles or joints, or any changes in your walking or balance?
PATIENT: Stiffness… maybe a little in the mornings. Gets better once I get moving. And… no, my balance is alright. I haven't fallen or anything. I walk… fine. For an old man, anyway. Honestly, Doc, are you looking for something specific? This feels like a lot of questions for a simple tremor.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, sir. I apologize if it feels like a lot. I’m trying to rule things out, and get a sense of the bigger picture. I just want to be thorough. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh. Medical history… That's a long list. High blood pressure, I think. And… my wife kept track of all that stuff. She was the organized one. I took some pills for it, but… I don't remember which ones anymore. And… I had that prostate thing, years ago. They… fixed it. That's all I remember. Honestly, I’m probably just getting old. Is that it?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, a past prostate issue. I'll make a note to check your records for medication details. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. Maybe for that prostate thing, but it wasn't a long stay. Just… a couple of days. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was a kid, but that doesn’t count, does it? Just a little thing. I was climbing a tree. Stupid kid.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant hospitalizations. And, lastly regarding your history, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins or supplements that you do remember?
PATIENT: Just… a little vitamin D, I think. My daughter keeps telling me to take it. Says I need it for my bones. And… that little blue pill for my blood pressure, but honestly, I don't even know the name. It’s just… a little blue pill. Look, I’m not good with names and pills, okay? Can we just get to the bottom of this shaking already?
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D, a blue blood pressure pill. I will try to find the exact medication on your record. Now, Mr. Baide, may I ask about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, Lord. Everyone on both sides lived to be ancient, if that’s what you’re after. Except my brother, but he… well, he had nothing to do with his health. A wild one, that one. I doubt there’s anything relevant there, Doc. Truly. Just a lot of old people living long lives.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: A little. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy. Used to drink more, back in the day, when my wife was still around. But not so much now. It doesn’t sit well with me anymore.
DOCTOR: And do you smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never. Never touched the stuff. My wife hated it, and frankly, so did I. Always thought it was a stupid habit. Always made me cough just being near it. No, never.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, about your work history, were you exposed to anything at work that could be related to this, such as chemicals or heavy metals?
PATIENT: Heavy metals? Chemicals? Good Lord, Doc, I was a producer and director. I sat in a room and told people what to do. Not exactly a hazardous occupation. Lots of coffee and stress, maybe, but no heavy metals. No.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. That's all the questions I have for now. Now, let’s have a quick look at you. I’d like to check your pulse, blood pressure, and reflexes, and do a brief neurological exam, if you don’t mind. Then we can discuss what might be going on, and what our next steps should be. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. The sooner I know something, the better. And please be quick, I really do have that lunch date.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, your pulse is a little fast, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not dangerously so. Now, let's see… Your reflexes are normal, and your coordination seems alright. I do notice a resting tremor in your right hand, as you mentioned. It's fairly subtle, but it's present. Your walk is steady, but I do notice a slight rigidity in your right arm when I move it. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Okay, Mr. Baide. Based on what you've told me, and what I've observed during the exam, your symptoms are suggestive of a few possibilities. The most likely, given your age and the nature of the tremor, is essential tremor. However, it could also be related to Parkinson's disease, although your symptoms don't fully fit that profile yet. A small percentage of tremors can be side effects of medications, and it is important to rule that out. We need to rule out any other causes. I will order some blood work to check your thyroid function and rule out other medical conditions. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and possible imaging of the brain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? A neurologist? Look, Doc, is this going to be a long process? Because honestly, I’m not sure I have the energy for all of this. A little shaking, that's all it is! Can’t you just give me something for it? A pill, maybe? Something to calm it down? I really don't want to go through all of this rigmarole if it's just a little wobble.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I wish I could offer a quick fix. However, it’s important to determine the cause of the tremor before starting any treatment. Simply masking the symptom without knowing the underlying reason isn’t responsible medical care. There are medications that can help manage tremors, but they also have potential side effects, and it’s important to make sure they’re appropriate for you, considering your other medical conditions and medications. The neurologist will be able to perform more specialized tests to determine the exact cause of your tremor, and recommend the best course of action. I will order the blood work today, and I can provide you with a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected neurologist in the area. It may take a few weeks to get an appointment, but we can expedite the process if necessary. In the meantime, I can offer some general advice. Try to reduce your stress levels, avoid excessive caffeine, and ensure you are getting enough rest. I’ll also write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication that might help with the tremor if it’s related to stress. However, please use it sparingly and as directed. Do you have any questions about the tests, the referral, or the medication?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Ramirez, you say? I’ll look him up. And the blood work… where do I go for that? And how long will that take? Honestly, this is a lot. Just… tell me everything, step-by-step. And keep it brief, please. I have a very limited attention span these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. First, the blood work. You'll go to the lab at [Lab Address] - the number is on this slip. They're open Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM. It will take about 15-20 minutes, and you don't need an appointment. It typically takes 2-3 business days for the results to come back to me. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Second, Dr. Ramirez. His office is at [Dr. Ramirez's Address]. You'll need to call his office to schedule an appointment. It may take a week or two to get in, as he's quite popular. When you call, explain that I referred you for evaluation of a tremor. Once I have the blood work results, and after you’ve seen Dr. Ramirez, we’ll discuss the best course of action. This might involve medication, physical therapy, or other treatments, depending on the diagnosis. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. I’ll make those calls. Just… remind me again what this anti-anxiety pill is for? And are there any side effects I should be worried about? I don’t want to feel like a zombie or anything. Honestly, I just want my hands to stop shaking. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The medication is called Lorazepam. It’s a mild anti-anxiety medication. I’m prescribing it specifically to see if reducing your anxiety helps calm the tremor. It won’t cure anything, but it may provide some temporary relief. As for side effects, the most common ones are drowsiness and dizziness. That's why I'm starting with a very low dose. Avoid alcohol while taking it, and be careful when driving or operating machinery. If you experience any unusual side effects, such as confusion or difficulty breathing, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me. It's important to remember that everyone reacts to medications differently. We'll monitor how you're doing, and adjust the dose if necessary. And please, don't hesitate to call me if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today, Mr. Baide?
PATIENT: Ugh. No. I think that's everything. Honestly, I’m exhausted just thinking about all this. Can I go now? I have a lunch date, remember? And I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. Thank you for coming in today. I’ve given you all the information you need. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you a pleasant lunch date, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: .
