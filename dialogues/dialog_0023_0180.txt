DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. It’s… well, I’m just tired. Really tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just get this feeling, and I gotta have some. It’s stupid, I know. Don’t look at me like that. It's not like I want to.
DOCTOR: “Dirt,” you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, dirt. Clay, mostly. From the garden. Sometimes just… earth. Don’t make a big deal out of it. It’s just… a thing I do. It started a while back, I guess. I don't really remember when. It's not like I’m shoveling it in or anything, just… little bits. And it makes me feel… better, for a bit. But then I get tired again.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you are… consuming this dirt, Ms. Cantoran?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t keep track. A couple times a week, maybe? Some weeks not at all. Other weeks… more. It depends. When I’m really dragging, I guess. Look, is this important? It's just… a habit. A bad habit, okay? I’ve got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, while it may seem like a harmless habit, the ingestion of soil carries significant risks. We need to explore this further. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, risks? Look, I've been doing this for… a long time. I haven't gotten sick. Not that I remember. Maybe a little tummy ache sometimes, but who doesn't get those? I'm mostly just tired, like I said. Really, really tired. I don't need a lecture on… dirt.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your frustration, but I need to assess all potential causes for your fatigue. The soil could contain parasites, bacteria, or heavy metals, even if you haven’t experienced acute symptoms. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Surgeries? Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… a long time ago. My husband… he was sick. Very sick. That was… a long time ago. Before that… I don’t really remember. A few things, I guess, when I was a kid. Just normal stuff. I don’t really keep track of things like that. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Your husband’s illness... I’m sorry to hear that. And it’s alright if you don’t recall specifics. Were you the primary caregiver?
PATIENT: Yes. I was. For… a long time. It was… hard. Very hard. He needed a lot of… things. And after… well, after he was gone, I just… I don’t know. Things haven’t been the same. Is that important? Look, I just want to know why I'm so tired. Not relive my whole life.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Cantoran. Grief can certainly manifest physically, causing fatigue and changes in behavior. However, we need to rule out any other underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Let’s move on to your family history, if you're comfortable. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history? Ugh. My family… they were farmers, mostly. Back in Mexico. Hard workers. A few… heart problems, maybe? Old age stuff. I don't really know. We didn't… talk about things like that much. Look, I’m not a doctor. I just eat dirt when I'm tired, okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand this is frustrating, but this behavior is not typical, and dismissing it as “just something you do” is not sufficient. We must investigate potential causes. Let's do a quick physical exam, and then I'll order some blood work. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't poke and prod too much, okay? And hurry up. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please sit back and relax as much as possible. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your abdomen. Heart rate is slightly elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but mildly tender in the lower quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness noted. Your abdomen is tender to the touch. It's not severe, but it’s something we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis. The stool analysis is to check for any parasites or bacteria.
PATIENT: Stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… take a sample? Ugh, this is ridiculous. Fine, whatever. Just… tell me how to do it and let’s get this over with. And can we please hurry?
DOCTOR: Yes, a stool sample. It’s standard procedure when investigating abdominal complaints, especially with your… unusual habit. Here are the instructions. You'll need a clean, dry container – the lab will provide one. Collect a small amount of stool – about the size of a walnut – in the container. Try to avoid getting any urine in the sample. Then, bring it to the lab as soon as possible. I'll also order a basic iron panel to assess for potential deficiencies. We will need to rule out anemia. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. It may be necessary to consult with a gastroenterologist.
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Oh, for goodness sake. This is getting out of hand. Fine. I’ll do your little tests. But if it turns out to be nothing, I’m not coming back. And don’t expect me to be happy about it. Now, can I go?
DOCTOR: The lab will call you to schedule a time for the blood draw and provide instructions for the stool sample collection. Once the results are back – typically within a week – my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. If you experience any worsening abdominal pain, fever, or bloody stools before your follow-up appointment, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. .
