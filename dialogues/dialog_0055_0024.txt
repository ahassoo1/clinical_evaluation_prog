DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sayar. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I’m able to fly. It's for an insurance thing, and they need it in writing. I’m going to visit family, and they’re being… difficult.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming your fitness to fly. Yes, I see. While I can certainly document your health status, simply stating you are “fit to fly” isn’t… medically sound, Ms. Sayar. There are numerous factors to consider. Do you have any underlying health conditions that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant… hmm. Not that I know of. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, but nothing serious. I’ve been generally healthy. I do get… a little anxious on planes, but that's just nerves, not a condition. Is that what you mean? And I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Anxiety, yes. While common, it can be exacerbated by air travel, and we must consider that. Medicare is noted. To properly assess your suitability for flight, I’ll need to gather a bit more information. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions, lung problems, or blood clot disorders?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never. I’ve had regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and they’ve always said I was… perfectly healthy. I mean, before… everything. But no heart trouble, no lung problems, and definitely no blood clots. I’m really sure. Is this a lot of questions because of the anxiety? I just need the letter to go visit my sister.
DOCTOR: It’s not simply the anxiety, Ms. Sayar. Air travel presents physiological stresses – changes in cabin pressure, decreased oxygen levels – that can unmask underlying conditions. It is my professional responsibility to ensure your safety, and that requires a thorough assessment. To proceed, could you tell me a bit more about these “regular check-ups”?
PATIENT: They were with Dr. Chen, in… well, it was in Queens, before I moved. He was a good doctor. I saw him every year, the usual blood work, physical exam, that sort of thing. Last one was… October of 2024. He retired after that, actually. That's part of why I haven't had one this year. It's been a bit hectic, settling in and all. He never mentioned anything being wrong. Honestly, I was always the healthiest patient he had, he used to say.
DOCTOR: I'm attempting to access your records from Dr. Chen’s practice, but unfortunately, the system isn’t cooperating. It appears there may be issues with data transfer from that particular facility. In the meantime, let's perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and ask a few questions about your current medications and allergies. Just standard procedure, Ms. Sayar. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. As long as I get the letter. I don't take any medications, and I'm not allergic to anything. I’ve always been lucky like that. Please, just… hurry if you can. My sister is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please take a deep breath for me, and exhale slowly. Blood pressure is 122/78, which is within normal limits. Oxygen saturation is 98%, also normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Nothing like that at all. I get a little nervous on the plane, a bit shaky, maybe a little lightheaded, but that's just the anxiety, like I said. Before the flight, and after, I'm perfectly fine. I haven’t had any chest pain or anything serious. Really. Is this taking a long time? I just need the letter…
DOCTOR: While your vital signs are within normal limits, it’s difficult to provide a definitive statement regarding your fitness to fly without a more comprehensive medical history and, ideally, some recent cardiac testing, given your reported anxiety. To be prudent, I recommend a basic electrocardiogram – an ECG – to assess your heart rhythm. It’s a simple, non-invasive procedure. We can perform it here in the clinic. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An ECG? I thought you said everything looked okay. Is this because of the anxiety again? I really don’t understand why I need more tests. I just want a letter saying I’m allowed to fly, not a whole new medical investigation. My sister is worried about me, and I promised I’d be there this week.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sayar, I understand your frustration. However, my responsibility is to ensure your safety, and a simple statement of “fitness to fly” is not a sufficient medical assessment, particularly with your reported anxiety and the potential physiological stresses of air travel. An ECG is a standard precaution, and it will allow me to rule out any underlying cardiac abnormalities. It is a relatively quick procedure, and it will provide me with the necessary information to make an informed decision. Alternatively, if you are unwilling to undergo the ECG, I cannot, in good conscience, provide you with the letter you requested. I would be happy to refer you to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation.
PATIENT: Fine. Do the test. Just… do it quickly, please. And if everything is okay, can I finally get the letter? I don't want to spend the whole week worrying about this. It’s just a simple trip to see my sister.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. We will need to place some electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. It is a painless procedure. A technician will be in shortly to assist.
