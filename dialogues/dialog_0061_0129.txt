DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Dawnetta. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, lovely to meet you too, I suppose. Look, I don’t have all day, so let's get on with it. It's my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like, really black. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what’s doing it? It’s probably that. I just want to know if I need stronger pills or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black stool can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. And yes, your pain medication could be a factor, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, details? Honestly. Fine. It’s… well, it's solid, mostly. Not watery. It’s just… dark. Like tar. I haven't noticed any blood, if that’s what you’re going to ask. And it smells… normal, I guess. As normal as stool smells, anyway. I haven't changed my diet or anything. Just the pills. I told you that already. Are you writing all this down? It's probably just the pills, honestly. Waste of time, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am making notes, Dawnetta. It’s important to be thorough. Solid, dark, tar-like stool, no blood, normal smell, no dietary changes, and you’re taking pain pills for arthritis. Okay. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the change in stool color?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, young lady, I'm 73 years old. What isn't a symptom? My knees hurt, my back aches, I get tired... but that’s just getting old! You want to know about this black stool, not my entire medical history. No, I don’t feel sick. No fever, no vomiting, no stomach cramps. Just… tired. And annoyed, frankly. Is this going to take much longer? I have a garden to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Dawnetta. We'll get through this as quickly as possible. It's helpful to know what isn't bothering you too. Okay, so no fever, no vomiting, no stomach cramps, just the usual tiredness. Now, let’s talk about those pain pills for a moment. What kind are they, and how many do you take each day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names... I never remember names. They're the white ones. Round. Small. My husband, Bohumil, he gets them for me. He's good with all that. I take… let me think… three a day. Yes, three. One with breakfast, one with lunch, and one before bed. Been taking that much for… oh, a good five years now, maybe longer. They help, mostly. But they make me a little sleepy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three white, round pills daily for about five years. That gives us a good starting point. Now, have you ever had any issues with constipation or bleeding from your rectum before?
PATIENT: Constipation? Oh, heavens yes. Who hasn't? Especially as you get older. It comes and goes. I use… what’s it called… a stool softener, sometimes. Helps things along. And bleeding? Not really. Maybe a little spotting now and then, but nothing major. Nothing to worry about, I always thought. Just… old age again, you know? I really don’t see what all the fuss is about with this black stool. It’s probably just the pills messing with my system. Are we done now?
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation sometimes, you use a stool softener, and occasional minor spotting. It’s good you’ve been keeping track of that. While it could be the pills, Dawnetta, black stool can also be a sign of bleeding in the upper digestive tract, which we need to rule out. To do that, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and then order a simple blood test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A blood test? Honestly. All this for a little bit of dark stool? I told you it's the pills! But fine, do whatever you need to do to get this over with. But I’m not sticking around all day. A quick exam, a quick test, and then I want to go home. And don't tell me I need to change my diet or anything. I eat perfectly fine for my age. Just get on with it, young lady.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. We'll keep it as quick and efficient as possible. No promises about dietary changes just yet. First, let’s just listen to your abdomen, feel your belly, and check your pulse. Then we'll do a quick blood draw. Please lie back on the examination table. Everything feels okay here, not tender to the touch. Your pulse is a little fast, but that could be from being anxious, or just general activity. I don't hear any unusual sounds. Now I'm just going to check your reflexes...
PATIENT: Ugh. Reflexes. Honestly, I haven't had my reflexes checked since… well, I don't even remember. Do it quickly, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And it's cold in here! You have the air conditioning on too high, I bet. Are you nearly finished? I can feel my knees starting to ache. I just want to get home and sit in the sun. It’s good for the arthritis, you know. This is a complete waste of time, honestly. But fine, do whatever you need to do. Just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for your age, but nothing concerning. Now, I’m going to need to draw a small amount of blood. It's just a routine test to check your red blood cell count and make sure there’s no sign of internal bleeding. It’ll only take a few minutes. Just a little pinch… Alright, all done. I’ll send this off to the lab and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, just keep an eye on your stool, and if it gets significantly worse – like very watery, or with bright red blood – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Emergency room?! Goodness gracious. Now you’re really scaring me. Fine, I’ll watch it. But I bet it's just the pills. I told you! So, can I go now? I really need to get home. I have tomatoes to prune. And Bohumil will be wondering where I am. Honestly, this whole thing has been a complete waste of my afternoon. I hope you find out what's wrong, but I bet it's nothing. And if it is something, it’s probably just old age. Just let me go now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll call you with the findings. I'm going to write up a summary of today’s visit and give you a copy to take home. It includes information about what to look for and when to seek immediate medical attention. And yes, you're free to go home now. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon, and enjoy your tomatoes. .
