DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test. A drug test, I think? Someone said I needed to get one done. Honestly, things are a little fuzzy these days, you know? I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston. That’s alright. We can figure it out. So, to clarify, someone requested a drug test for you?
PATIENT: Requested… yeah, that sounds right. It was… something to do with my work, I think? I operate the paving equipment, you know, the big rollers and stuff. Maybe it was for that? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It’s perfectly fine. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Just trying to piece things together. Do you recall who requested the test?
PATIENT: Hmm… a man, I think. Tallish. Worked at the… the depot, maybe? Oh, dear. See? It’s just… names and faces aren’t sticking like they used to. It wasn’t anyone mean, I don’t think so. Just… official-looking. Does that help at all? I really am sorry. It feels like trying to remember a dream.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. It sounds like it was work-related, possibly a requirement of your position operating the paving equipment. We can certainly look into that. Alright, I see a note here about a random drug screening program for heavy machinery operators at your workplace. It appears you were selected for a test on July 28th. Did you complete the test then?
PATIENT: July 28th… Oh! Yes, I think so. I remember going to a lab… a little building downtown. It was hot that day. I had to… you know, give a sample. But… I don’t recall getting any results or anything. Was there a problem with it? I just assumed everything was fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you completed the test on July 28th. And you haven't received any information about the results since then?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… silence. Which is why I’m here now, I suppose. Someone must have said I needed to come back for another one? It's a bit confusing, to be honest. I don't like feeling like I'm messing something up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. Let's see if we can find out what’s going on. It appears the initial test came back with an… unexpected result. It flagged a positive finding. Do you have any medical conditions that might explain this?
PATIENT: A positive finding? Oh, dear. No, not that I know of. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that’s it. And… well, my arthritis flares up sometimes, but I don’t take anything regularly for that. What did it find, exactly? I’m a little worried now. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay. The report indicates a positive result for… opioids. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean you're taking illicit drugs, Ms. Hughston. There are several reasons why this might happen. Do you take any pain medication at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Opioids… No, absolutely not. I haven’t taken anything for pain except maybe ibuprofen for my arthritis, and that’s not very often. I try to avoid it if I can. Ibuprofen… is that an opioid? Oh, goodness. This is making my head spin. I really don't understand. I haven't knowingly taken anything like that. I wouldn’t.
DOCTOR: No, ibuprofen is not an opioid, Ms. Hughston. It's a different type of pain reliever. But a positive result can sometimes be caused by certain medications, or even, in rare cases, by certain foods. To be thorough, let’s review your current medications. You mentioned something for your blood pressure – what is the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It’s a little white pill. I get it refilled every month at the pharmacy. The name… oh, dear. It starts with an 'A', I think. Amlodipine? Is that right? And it's… 5 milligrams, I believe. I take one every morning. I hope I'm remembering that correctly. It's awful getting old, honestly. Things just slip your mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily. That’s good. And besides the Amlodipine and the occasional ibuprofen, are you taking anything else – vitamins, herbal supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think carefully. Sometimes I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but it’s been warm lately, so I haven’t for a while. And… oh! My neighbor gave me some chamomile tea a few weeks ago. She said it was good for sleeping. I’ve had a cup or two, but that’s all. Nothing else, I promise. I really try to stay away from too many pills and potions. It makes me feel strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston. So, Amlodipine 5mg daily, occasional ibuprofen, occasional chamomile tea, and sometimes vitamin D. Given the positive opioid result and the medications you are taking, I think it would be best to order a more comprehensive urine drug screen. This will help us determine exactly what, if anything, is causing the positive result. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Another test? Well… if it will help figure things out, then yes, alright. I just want to make sure everything is okay. I don’t want to lose my job over something I didn’t do. I really appreciate you looking into this for me, Doctor. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hughston. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’m ordering a confirmation drug screen, which is a more detailed analysis. It will also include a test for prescription opioids. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, just to be safe. We’ll need to collect a urine sample now. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the process. It's important that we get a clean sample, so please let her know if you have any questions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. A clean sample… I hope I can manage that! My bladder isn't what it used to be, you know. But I’ll do my best. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience with me. And… well, thank you for not thinking I’m… you know… doing something wrong. It’s just been a stressful few weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It’s my job to figure things out, and I understand how stressful this must be. Don’t worry about the sample – just do your best, and we’ll take it from there. I'll be right back with the results once they come in. The nurse will be in shortly. Here is the form for the lab. The nurse will guide you on how to collect the sample. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results this time? I'm worried about going back to work if they're still waiting on something. I really need to know what's going on. And... thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hughston. I understand your concern. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the confirmation screen. I'll have the results faxed to my office as soon as they're available. I can also call you directly with the results, if you prefer. In the meantime, if your employer asks about the test results, you can explain that you are awaiting confirmation testing as instructed by your physician. I'll let the nurse know you’re ready. She will be in shortly to assist you. Do you have any other questions or concerns before I leave you to it?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Piet. You've really put my mind at ease, even if I'm still a little worried. I appreciate you being so understanding. And… thank you for not judging me. It means a lot. I’ll just… sit here and wait for the nurse, then.
