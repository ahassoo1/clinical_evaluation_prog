DOCTOR: Right. Teretha Uzarski, 63 years old. Well, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Batara, is it? Yes, thank you. It’s this tingling. It’s mostly in my hands and feet. It’s been going on…oh, goodness, a few weeks now, maybe a month? It comes and goes, you know? Not always there, thankfully. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It's hard to say exactly. Time just… slips away, doesn’t it? Especially when you’re busy. I’m a mail carrier, you see. Lots of walking. It started after a particularly rough week with all the packages around the holidays, but… honestly, it could have been before that too. I didn't really pay attention to it at first. Just thought it was my shoes maybe.
DOCTOR: A mail carrier. Lots of walking. Right. And you didn't think to mention this sooner?
PATIENT: Well, I didn't think it was important important, you know? It wasn’t stopping me from working. Just a little… pins and needles. Old age creeping in, probably! It's only gotten… more noticeable lately, that's why I finally came. I figured if it kept getting worse… well, better to get it checked.
DOCTOR: "Old age creeping in," you say. Hmm. Alright. Let's get some details then. Is this tingling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. Some days I barely notice it. Other days… especially if I’ve been on my feet all day, it’s worse. Like a buzzing, almost. And sometimes it feels… numb? Not completely, but like my fingers aren’t quite there, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand "buzzing and numbness." And where exactly are you feeling this numbness and tingling?
PATIENT: Mostly in my hands… the tips of my fingers, mostly. And in my feet… the soles, and sometimes up my ankles. It’s… symmetrical, I think? Both hands, both feet. Not just one side. I haven't really paid that close attention, to be honest. I’m too busy trying to deliver the mail!
DOCTOR: Symmetrical. Alright. And has this tingling been accompanied by any weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness? Hmm… no, not really. I wouldn’t say weakness. My hands get tired, of course, after a long day sorting mail, but… that’s normal, isn't it? I haven’t dropped anything, or had trouble holding things. No, no weakness. Just… the tingling. And maybe a little bit of clumsiness sometimes, but I blame that on being tired.
DOCTOR: Clumsiness… Alright. And any pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s not painful tingling, if that makes sense. More… uncomfortable. Like when your foot falls asleep, but… not as bad. And it doesn't last as long. It's just… annoying, you know? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look at your hands and feet. Please extend your arms. I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. And don’t be alarmed if I poke you with this little hammer. It's for science.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a route to finish, you know. Go ahead then, Doctor. Poke away.
DOCTOR: Okay. Strength seems… adequate, although slightly diminished in your grip. Reflexes are… present, but a little sluggish. Now, let’s look at your feet. Please place your foot flat on the floor. Hmm. Similar findings in your legs. Sluggish reflexes, slightly diminished strength. Now, can you close your eyes and tell me where I am touching your hands and feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Close my eyes? Alright, alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll try my best, but I’m not very good at these things. I’m more of a doer than a feeler, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And…?
PATIENT: Hmm… that one? On my left hand… near the thumb, I think? And… that one on my foot? Toward the heel, maybe? It's hard to tell, Doctor. They all feel a little… fuzzy. It’s like when your hand is cold, and you can’t feel much.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy." Right. Alright. It seems we have some sensory deficits here, although not severe. Now, one more thing. Do you have any history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, goodness no. Never been diagnosed with that. My mother had it, I think, but I’ve always been pretty healthy. I walk all day, you know? Keeps me moving! I try to eat right, too. Not always easy when you're busy, but I do my best. No, no diabetes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms, the physical exam findings, and lack of diabetes history… it could be peripheral neuropathy. However, there are many causes of neuropathy. We need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work. It'll check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other things that can cause nerve damage. I'm also going to order a nerve conduction study. That will give us a more detailed look at your nerve function.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and a nerve… what did you call it? Sounds… complicated. How long will this take? And will it interfere with my route? I really can’t be off work for too long.
DOCTOR: The nerve conduction study will take about an hour. As for your route… you'll need to manage, won't you?
PATIENT: An hour… Well, I suppose I can ask my supervisor if I can come in late one day. It’s just… everything always seems to pile up, you know? It’s not easy being a mail carrier. And what if it is neuropathy? What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Neuropathy simply means nerve damage. It can be caused by many things – vitamin deficiencies, infections, even certain medications. As for what it means... it depends on the cause. Sometimes it's mild and manageable. Other times… it requires more aggressive treatment. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let's get these tests done. I’ll give you a lab requisition and a referral to the neurology department. They'll schedule the nerve conduction study. Come back with the results in two weeks. And try to take better care of yourself. Walking all day isn’t an excuse to ignore your body. Next.
PATIENT: Alright. Two weeks. I’ll try to schedule it as soon as I can. And I do take care of myself! It’s a hard job! Thank you, Doctor. I guess. Just… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, to make the tingling better? Or anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Avoid anything that makes it worse, obviously. And try not to stress. Although, given your profession… There’s not much else you can do without knowing the cause. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Next.
PATIENT: Alright then. Thank you… I think. .
