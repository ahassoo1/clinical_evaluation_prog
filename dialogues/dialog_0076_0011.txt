DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, good to see you… or, well, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ruocco. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Armando Honcoop. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get this over with. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin’ the fella down at the beauty shop is offerin’. A… a fixin’ up. That’s all.
DOCTOR: A… “fixin’ up”?
PATIENT: Yes. A fixin’ up. You know… to make things look… neater. I ain’t lookin’ for a whole makeover or nothin’. Just… tightened. It’s my face, Doctor. Seems simple enough. I just need you to say it’s alright.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, “fixin’ up” isn’t exactly a medical term. Are you referring to a cosmetic procedure?
PATIENT: Cos…metic? Is that what you call it now? Look, I don’t know fancy words. He’s got a machine, it zaps things, and it makes the wrinkles go away. That’s it! I want to know if I can do it. Before I waste my money.
DOCTOR: A machine that “zaps things,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. It ain’t like a surgery or nothin’. He said it’s… modern. And quick. He showed me some pictures, and folks looked much… fresher. I just want to know if it’ll hurt me, or if I’ll… fall apart.
DOCTOR: Well, I certainly can't endorse any procedure I don’t have information about. What exactly is this “fella’s” name and the name of this… machine?
PATIENT: Name? Oh, goodness. I can’t rightly recall. Earl, maybe? Or… something like that. The shop is called “Shear Perfection.” As for the machine… he called it a… a “Rejuvenator 3000” or somethin’. Fancy name, ain't it? Look, I just need a doctor to say it's okay, not a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're in a hurry, but I can't just sign off on something without knowing what it entails. It's a matter of your safety. Do you have any idea what this "Rejuvenator 3000" actually does?
PATIENT: It sends little… sparks, I guess. To the wrinkles. He said it stimulates… somethin’. Look, I ain’t a scientist, Doctor! I just want my face to look a little less… droopy. I figured a doctor's okay was all I needed. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Let me see if I can find anything about this “Shear Perfection” and this… device. It's unlikely a legitimate medical procedure would be offered at a beauty shop. And frankly, “stimulates something” is not a diagnosis. Do you have any allergies or medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Medical conditions… well, I get a little tired sometimes. Old age, I reckon. And my knees ain't what they used to be. But that ain’t got nothin’ to do with my face! Just find out if this thing will kill me, and let’s be done with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's see…“Shear Perfection”… rural location, as expected… no medical licenses listed for anyone associated with the business. And I'm not finding anything about a “Rejuvenator 3000” that isn’t a marketing gimmick for some sort of home facial device. Mr. Honcoop, this sounds… extremely risky. I strongly advise against this procedure. Have you been told about the potential side effects?
PATIENT: Side effects? He said it might tingle a bit. And it could be a little red for a while. Look, I ain't a scared man, Doctor. I served my country! A little tingle ain't gonna bother me. Are you gonna tell me it’s okay, or are we just gonna sit here all day? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, let me be very clear. I cannot authorize a procedure performed by someone without proper medical training, using a device that has no established safety record. It could cause infection, scarring, permanent disfigurement… the list goes on. This isn't about being “scared,” it’s about responsible medical care. I strongly recommend you do not proceed with this “fixin’ up.” In fact, I'm documenting my strong recommendation against it in your chart.
PATIENT: Well, I never! This is ridiculous! You ain't helpin’ me none! Just a waste of my time! I came here for a simple okay, and you’re givin’ me a lecture! I’ll find somebody else who understands what I need.
DOCTOR: Fine. You are free to seek a second opinion, but I will not be party to a potentially dangerous procedure. Have a good day, Mr. Honcoop.
