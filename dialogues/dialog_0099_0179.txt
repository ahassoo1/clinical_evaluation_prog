DOCTOR: Right. Sherrell Gyamfi, 46 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That is correct. It is... difficult to explain, really. I find... the words. They do not come so easy now. It is frustrating, you understand? Like a... a fog. I am having trouble finding the right words when I speak.
DOCTOR: A fog, you say. Right. So, this difficulty with words... when did it start?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start... That is a good question. It was... some time ago, I think. Not suddenly, but... slowly. Perhaps six months? Maybe longer. It is difficult to be precise. My wife… she would know. But she is… not here anymore.
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening. And your wife... passed recently?
PATIENT: Yes. Yes, she did. About… three months ago, I believe. It was… unexpected. A very sad time. She was always very good with remembering things. Dates, names… everything. I relied on her for so much. Now… It feels… emptier. But that is not about the words, is it? I apologize. I get… distracted sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, grief can certainly affect one's concentration. But we need to focus on why you're here today. This difficulty with words… can you give me an example?
PATIENT: An example… yes. Hmm. Let me think… Yesterday, I was at the market, trying to buy… those red fruits. Round ones. You eat them in the summer. I knew what they were called, but when I asked the shopkeeper… I could not say it. It was on the tip of my tongue, but… nothing. I just pointed. Very embarrassing. It happens with other things too. Names… objects… even simple things. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: So, it's not just finding the words, but also recalling names and objects?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Recalling… that is a good word. It is like the memory is… distant. Not gone, but… faint. Sometimes I can get it back if I… concentrate very hard. But it takes effort. And sometimes it does not come at all. It is… worrisome. I do not want to become… forgetful. My wife… she worried about that too, later in life.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this difficulty impacting your daily life beyond just the market?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. At home, I… I try to read, you know? To keep my mind active. But sometimes I have to stop. I lose the thread of the story. The words… they do not make sense anymore. And with friends… conversations are more difficult. I hesitate, searching for the right thing to say. It makes me feel… slow. And sometimes, they finish my sentences for me. It is… not pleasant. I prefer to be… independent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… sometimes I feel a little tired. Not constantly, but… more tired than usual. And perhaps… a little clumsy. I bumped into a table yesterday, which is not like me. But I thought that was just because I was distracted, worrying about… the words. I do not know if that is related. It could be… just old age, perhaps?
DOCTOR: And your past medical history?
PATIENT: My past medical history… That is… a bit difficult to recall precisely. I had… the usual things, I suppose. A cold here and there. The flu. I had my vaccinations, of course. I believe I had my blood pressure checked regularly. It was… okay, I think. Nothing major. My wife… she kept track of all of that. She was very organized. Now… I have a general idea, but not the specific details. I have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was… a young man. A very long time ago. And… I believe I had a small growth removed from my arm, but that was… quite minor. Nothing else that I can recall. My wife… she always remembered the dates of these things. It is frustrating, not having those details readily available. I apologize for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That is… a difficult one. My father… he lived to a good age, I believe. But he was not very talkative. We did not discuss… medical things. My mother… she had some… problems with her memory later in life. Not as severe as this, I don’t think, but… she did forget things occasionally. And my sister… she had… heart problems, I believe. But that was many years ago. I am not very close to my family, so I do not have a lot of… specific information. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… No, not at the moment. I stopped taking the blood pressure medication a few years ago. My doctor said it was no longer necessary. I do take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, during the winter months. But that is… just for general health. Nothing else. I am trying to avoid taking too many pills, if possible. It feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a brief neurological exam. Just to assess your memory and coordination. It’s standard procedure. Can you follow simple commands?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Simple commands… yes, I believe I can. I used to be very good at following instructions. In my job… I had to analyze things, you see. Follow protocols. I am happy to cooperate. Whatever you need. I just want to understand… what is happening. And hopefully… find a solution.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please touch your nose with your index finger. Now, touch my finger with your index finger. Good. Now, with your eyes closed, can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: The year… Hmm. Let me think. It is… August now, isn’t it? Yes. August… It is… 20… 2024? No… I am sorry. I cannot recall precisely. It feels… just on the tip of my tongue. 2025? Is it 2025? I apologize. It is… very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to say three words. Please repeat them back to me immediately. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I am ready. Three words… Yes. Please go ahead. I will try my best. I used to be very good at remembering things. For my job, you see… analyzing data, reports… it required a good memory. I hope I can still… recall them. Please say the words.
DOCTOR: Apple. Table. Penny. Now, repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Apple… Table… and… …and… something shiny? A coin… perhaps? I… I cannot recall the exact word. I apologize. It is… very frustrating. It was just on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the preliminary findings of this exam, I'm concerned about possible early cognitive impairment. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I’d like you to have a brain scan, an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Cognitive… impairment? A brain scan…? I… I do not understand. Is it… serious? Is there something… wrong? I… I just want to know… what is happening. My wife… she would know what to do.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s too early to say definitively. Many things can cause these kinds of symptoms. The tests will help us determine the cause. It could be something treatable. But it's important to rule out serious conditions. I'm referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I'll have my nurse schedule the appointments for you. Now, I'm also going to give you a prescription for a mild cognitive enhancer to see if it helps with your symptoms while we wait for the results. It won’t cure anything, but it might improve your concentration. It’s worth a try.
PATIENT: A neurologist… and a prescription… Yes. I… I understand. A cognitive enhancer… will that… help me remember things? Will it… stop this from getting worse? I just want to… feel like myself again. Before… before all of this started. Thank you… for trying to help. I… I appreciate it. I just wish… my wife was here. She would know what questions to ask.
DOCTOR: The medication is a starting point. It may help, and it may not. Everyone responds differently. The neurologist will conduct a more thorough assessment and develop a personalized treatment plan. It's important to be patient and follow their recommendations. Now, I’ll have the nurse go over the post-visit instructions with you. She’ll explain everything in detail. We’re taking things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: One question… yes. Will this… will this affect my ability to… to live independently? Will I… will I need help? I… I cherish my independence. It is very important to me. I… I just want to know… what the future holds. That is all.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s impossible to say for certain at this stage. We haven’t even had the tests yet. It’s entirely possible that this is something manageable. We'll do everything we can to help you maintain your independence. But it's important to be realistic. The neurologist will assess your cognitive function and provide you with a clear prognosis. In the meantime, avoid stressful situations, stay mentally active, and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Now, I really must see my next patient. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any urgent concerns. .
PATIENT: Thank you… I suppose. My wife… I wish you were here. .
