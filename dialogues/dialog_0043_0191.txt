DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and I’ll be taking care of you today. It’s August 2nd, 2025. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I requested to come in… I wanted to get tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I finally decided to just go ahead and get it done.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. That’s a very responsible decision, and I commend you for taking this step. We can absolutely get you tested for HIV today. Before we proceed with the testing, I’d like to ask you a few questions to get a better understanding of your risk factors. This will help us ensure we’re providing the most appropriate care. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Ask away. I’ll answer as best as I can. I understand it’s important to have all the information.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other sexually transmitted infections, like syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never been diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve always been… careful, you could say. But, well, one can never be too sure, can one? That’s why I’m here today.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – it's always best to be proactive about your health, regardless of precautions. Now, have you had any recent intimate contact with anyone?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I am married, and my husband and I… we are intimate. We’ve been together for a very long time, over forty years now. But, to be honest, it hasn't been… frequent, lately. It's just… life, you know? But yes, we have had contact within the last year.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that information with me. And it’s good that you’re being so open; it helps me provide the best care. Just to clarify, when you say “contact,” are you referring to vaginal, anal, or oral sex?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… mostly vaginal. And sometimes oral, yes. We haven't… engaged in anything else, if that’s what you’re asking, Doctor. We’re… not spring chickens anymore, you see. It's become more about comfort and closeness than… experimentation. I hope that's not too blunt.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Shaub. I appreciate your honesty; it’s very helpful. And you’re right to be comfortable discussing this with me. It's all part of understanding your health profile. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for medical purposes, such as for recreational drug use or tattoos?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no, Doctor! Never! I would never share a needle. I don’t partake in any… recreational activities, and I haven’t gotten a tattoo since… well, a very long time ago, and it was done properly, at a reputable place. I assure you, that’s not a concern. My husband feels the same way, naturally.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Shaub. Thank you for clarifying. Moving on, have you ever received a blood transfusion or any blood products?
PATIENT: Let me think… you know, that's a good question. I believe… yes, I did, a long time ago. When I had my daughter, many years ago now, I needed a blood transfusion due to complications during the birth. It must have been… oh, goodness, almost forty years ago. Everything was fine then, as far as I know. But that was a very long time ago. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you remembered that, Ms. Shaub. While the risk is low with modern screening practices, it's important to note for completeness. Now, to ensure we’re thorough, are you currently experiencing any symptoms such as fever, fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I feel… well, I feel my age, naturally. A little tired sometimes, a little achy, but nothing out of the ordinary for someone my age. I’ve been perfectly healthy, as far as I know. No fever, no swollen anything, and certainly no unexplained weight loss. I’m a bit worried about losing weight, if anything! I enjoy my food, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s reassuring, Ms. Shaub. It sounds like you’re generally in good health. So, to summarize, you’re requesting HIV testing, have been married for over forty years, engage in vaginal and occasional oral sex with your husband, have never shared needles, received a blood transfusion approximately forty years ago during the birth of your daughter, and are not currently experiencing any concerning symptoms. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds absolutely correct. You’ve remembered everything perfectly. It’s… comforting to know you’re listening so carefully. I appreciate that. Now, what happens next? What sort of test will you be doing? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear that, Ms. Shaub. My goal is always to ensure my patients feel heard and well-cared for. We have a few options for HIV testing. We can do a blood draw, which is the most common method, or we can do a rapid oral fluid test – a swab of your gums. The oral fluid test gives you preliminary results in about 20-30 minutes, but a blood draw is more accurate and can also screen for other sexually transmitted infections. Both tests are very safe and involve minimal discomfort. The blood draw will feel like a pinch, and the oral fluid test is just a quick swab. Which option would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the rapid test sounds awfully convenient, but if the blood draw is more accurate, I suppose that’s the better choice. I’d rather have a definite answer, even if I have to wait a little longer. Yes, let’s do the blood draw, please. I’d like to be certain. And… is there anything else I should be aware of? Any preparation I need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent choice, Ms. Shaub. Accuracy is paramount. There's no special preparation needed for the blood draw. You don't need to fast or anything like that. We’ll just take a small sample of blood from your arm. Now, it's important to understand that the test detects antibodies to HIV, which can take some time to develop after infection. Therefore, if you’ve had any potential exposure within the last three months, the test may not be accurate. We call this the “window period.” We can discuss this further, but a negative result within the window period doesn’t necessarily mean you’re HIV-negative. Would you say you've had any recent potential exposures?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question, Doctor. No, not recently. As I said, my husband and I have been together for a very long time, and we've been… careful. We haven't had any… new partners, certainly. And like I mentioned, it hasn’t been frequent lately. Three months… yes, I think we are well past that. I’m fairly certain. Is that window period something to worry about? It sounds… unsettling.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you've been careful, Ms. Shaub, and it sounds like you’re well outside the window period. The window period is just a precaution, and it’s good to be aware of it. Okay, let's proceed with the blood draw. I'll need to ask you a few routine questions to confirm your identity and insurance information. Since you mentioned you’re uninsured, we can discuss options for financial assistance if needed. We also have resources available for counseling and support, regardless of the test result. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly comfortable. I do appreciate you mentioning the counseling and support. It’s… thoughtful. And no, I don’t have any insurance, I haven't for a long time. It’s just… become too expensive, you understand. Financial assistance would be very helpful, yes. Let's just get this over with, then. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. We can absolutely assist you with financial assistance. “Alright, I’m going to clean the area on your arm with an alcohol swab. You may feel a brief pinch as I insert the needle. Then, we’ll collect a small sample of blood, and I’ll apply a bandage afterward. It's very quick. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies to either latex or alcohol. I've never had any problems with them. Just… not a fan of needles, naturally. But I can handle it. Just get it done as quickly as possible, please.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Ms. Shaub, we're all done. Just a little pressure for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. Here’s a bandage. It’s important to keep the bandage on for at least fifteen minutes. You may experience some slight bruising or soreness, but that should resolve on its own within a few days. I’ll have the lab results sent to me, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available, usually within five to seven business days. Now, while we wait for the results, is there anything I can answer for you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That wasn’t as bad as I expected, actually. Five to seven days… that seems a long time to wait, doesn’t it? But I understand. No, I don’t think so, not at the moment. I think that’s all. Just… thank you for being so kind and patient with me. It’s… it’s been a weight off my mind to finally get this done. And thank you for the information about the financial assistance, that’s very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. We are here to support you. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they are available. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude the consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s everything. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve been very thorough. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I'll wait for the phone call. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and have a good day. .
