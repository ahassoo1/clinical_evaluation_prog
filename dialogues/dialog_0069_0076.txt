DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. I see here you're with Medicare and we're at the rural clinic today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They're on my shins, and they really hurt. Red and kinda hard, you know? I’ve had them for… oh, I don’t know exactly. A few weeks, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of red, hard bumps on your shins that are causing you pain. I understand. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: It’s like… a really bad bruise, but it doesn’t really look like a bruise, if that makes sense? It's not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache. And they're sensitive to the touch. Walking around is what really gets to them. Especially if I bump them on something. It makes me wince, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense – a deep ache, sensitive to the touch, and worsened with walking and bumping. Thank you for describing it that way. Have you noticed anything that seems to make them better or worse besides bumping them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I’ve tried putting some lotion on them, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Resting does make it a little better, if I can just sit down for a while. And… I think they look a little worse after a long day of work. I do a lot of lifting, you know, moving things around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lotion doesn't seem to help, resting improves things, and they appear worse after a long day of lifting. That’s helpful information. Now, could you tell me a bit about your work?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. I work as a… well, we call it a mover. I move boxes and stuff, mostly at the warehouse. Heavy lifting, a lot of walking around, you know? It’s not easy work, but it pays the bills. I’ve been doing it for… oh, a long time. Maybe 20 years now? It keeps me busy, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Twenty years – that’s a long time doing physically demanding work! Okay. Have you ever had anything like this happen before – these bumps on your legs?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I've had my share of aches and pains from the work, pulled muscles and things, but never these hard, red bumps. It's kinda worrying, to be honest. It just… appeared one day, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Aluia. It's good you're getting it checked out. Now, let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, for an old man. My wife keeps telling me I need to slow down, but… what can I do? Gotta work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. High blood pressure, currently controlled with medication – good. And you’re working to stay active, which is important. Could you tell me what medications you’re currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine? Yeah, amlodipine, 5 milligrams. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My wife usually fills the prescription, so she knows better than me, to be honest. But yeah, amlodipine.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine 5mg daily. Thank you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that question, too, and I always tell her the same thing. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, you know? Never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix taken out when I was a kid, a long time ago. That’s it. Nothing else. Just the appendix, when I was maybe 10 years old? It was a long time ago, so I don't remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in childhood. And finally, are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. My father… he had heart problems. Had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. And my mother… she had diabetes. She had to get her leg amputated because of it. That’s why I try to take care of myself, you know? It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and diabetes. Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Aluia. Now, I'd like to take a look at your legs. Could you please roll up your pants legs so I can get a better look at these bumps?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There they are. Pretty ugly, huh? They’re a little tender, so be careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see them. They are red, firm, and tender to the touch. There’s no warmth or swelling that I can detect at this point. They appear to be located primarily on the anterior shins, which is consistent with where the muscles are located. Do you have any pain when I press right here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yeah, that one hurts a little. Not terrible, but definitely sensitive. And… yeah, this one too. It feels like a deep ache when you push on it. They're all kinda the same, though. It's not like one is worse than the others.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent tenderness across the bumps. Based on what you've told me – the history of lifting, the location of the pain, and the physical exam findings – my initial thought is that these could be shin splints, also known as medial tibial stress syndrome. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To be sure, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for inflammation and rule out other conditions. I also think an X-ray of both legs would be a good idea to make sure there aren't any fractures or other bone abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests and an X-ray… sounds alright to me, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best. I just want to know what’s causing the pain, you know? And hopefully, there's something we can do about it. I can't really afford to stop working, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Aluia. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and find a solution that works for you. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and X-ray now. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood samples right away. Then you can go to the radiology department for the X-ray. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce the amount of lifting you're doing, if possible, and ice your shins for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help with the pain and inflammation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Less lifting, ice, and pain relievers… I can try that. Ibuprofen… yeah, I have some of that at home. I think my wife uses it for her arthritis. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. I’ll go get the blood tests and the X-ray done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. I'm glad I could help. Please let the lab and radiology department know my name, Dr. Andraca, and that I’ve ordered these tests for you. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if the pain gets worse. Take care, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
