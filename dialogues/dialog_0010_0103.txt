DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Albino. My back… it’s been botherin’ me. Lower part, mostly. It’s not a sudden thing, been buildin’ up for a while now. Feels… weak, you know? Like it could give out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Albino. Weakness in the lower back, building up over time. Can you tell me a little more about that weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. Not like a muscle pull or somethin’. More… just not strong. Like I can’t lift things I used to, even groceries. And sometimes, when I stand for too long, it really hurts. Not sharp, just… achy. It's mostly when I'm doin' somethin', not when I'm sittin' still. Does that make sense? I'm not good with explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Albino. Don't worry about explaining, we'll get to the bottom of it. So, it’s an achy pain brought on by activity, particularly standing or lifting, and not present much when you’re at rest. Has anything specific triggered this pain or made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Not really. I mean, I’ve been doin’ my usual stuff. I volunteer at the church, help with the food bank a couple times a week… liftin’ boxes, mostly. And I try to keep the garden up, but bendin’ over… that doesn't help. I guess bendin’ over is the worst. It's been worse the last month or so, but nothin’ happened. Just… gradual. Oh! And my daughter, she told me I been hunchin’ over more lately. I didn't even realize it.
DOCTOR: Okay, lifting boxes at the food bank, gardening, and your daughter mentioned some hunching over. That’s helpful. And this has been gradually worsening over the past month. Do you feel any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my legs. Just the back. Sometimes it feels… tight. Like a knot. And sometimes… numb, a little. Not all the time. Just… comes and goes. Mostly when I've been on my feet a long time. It's funny, my mother always said I was too skinny. Maybe that has somethin' to do with it? I don't know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no radiating pain. Tightness and intermittent numbness are important details. And we can certainly explore whether your build might be a factor. Let’s talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – arthritis, osteoporosis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, doctor, you're askin’ a lot! Let me think… Arthritis, no. Never been told that. But… about ten years ago, a different doctor, he said my bones were… thin. Said somethin’ about not gettin’ enough calcium. He wanted me to take pills, but they made my stomach upset, so I stopped. I don’t remember the name of the condition, though. Somethin’ with an "o" in it… osteoporosis maybe? Is that right?
DOCTOR: Osteoporosis is exactly right, Albino – very good memory, even if it was ten years ago. And it's understandable you stopped taking medication if it upset your stomach. Okay, so history of osteoporosis, diagnosed but medication was not tolerated. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital, knock on wood! I’ve always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Until this back thing, that is. I had the flu pretty bad once, about twenty years ago, but that's about it. Mostly just colds and aches like everyone else. I try to stay active, you know? Keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Albino. Staying active is very important. Let’s move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings – has had problems with their back, or any bone issues like osteoporosis?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she broke her hip when she was older. Fell in the garden, poor thing. I think they said it was because of weak bones, somethin’ like that. And my sister, she had a lot of trouble with her back after she had her children. Bad posture, she always said. But other than that… not really. My father was strong as an ox, never had a day of illness in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had a hip fracture and your sister had back problems, both potentially related to bone health. That's helpful. Now, just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a baby aspirin every day, doctor. Keeps the blood movin', my other doctor told me. And sometimes, when my joints are achin', I take some ibuprofen. Just when I really need it, though. No supplements or anything like that. I try to eat healthy, get enough fruits and vegetables, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, daily aspirin and ibuprofen as needed. Very good. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything, take anything. Lucky that way too! I guess I’m a pretty simple man, doctor. Just want my back to feel better so I can keep helpin’ out at the church and in the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, Albino, that’s very helpful. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your range of motion, feel your spine, and do a few simple neurological tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. Whatever you need to do to figure out what’s wrong with my back. It's just been makin' things difficult, you know? And I got a food bank delivery to help with tomorrow. Need to be able to lift those boxes.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could please lie down on your side there, and then we’ll have you flip over onto your back. I’ll start with your range of motion. Alright, can you point to exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Right… right here. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. And it kinda spreads out a little. When I bend over, it gets worse. And when you press right there… yeah, that’s it. Feels tender. Like a bruise, almost. But I haven’t hit myself or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness there, as you described. And your range of motion is somewhat limited, particularly when bending forward. I'm also checking your reflexes and strength in your legs... everything appears normal there. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a muscle strain or sprain in your lower back, possibly aggravated by the bending and lifting involved in your volunteer work. Given your history of osteoporosis, we need to be a bit cautious. It’s important to rule out any potential compression fractures. I want to get an X-ray of your lower back to get a better look at the bones. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. And I don't want to make it worse, you know? If it is somethin’ with my bones, I want to know so I can take care of it. So, yes, an X-ray sounds good. How long will that take? And will it be painful?
DOCTOR: It’s a quick procedure, Albino, and shouldn’t be painful at all. We'll just need you to stand still for a few moments while the technician takes the images. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes in total. While we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief – ibuprofen or naproxen, as you’ve already tried, and a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm. I will write you a prescription for that now. In the meantime, I also want you to avoid any heavy lifting or bending, and try to rest as much as possible. We’ll discuss the results of the X-ray as soon as they’re available and create a plan to get you feeling better. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Rest and medicine. I can do that. No heavy liftin’… that’ll be hard, but I’ll try. The food bank will understand. And thank you, doctor. For listenin’ and takin’ the time. I appreciate it. And… one more thing. Is there anything I should be lookin’ for? Any signs that I need to come back sooner?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Albino. I'm glad I could help. That's a good question. Yes, definitely. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as numbness or weakness in your legs, trouble controlling your bladder or bowels, or a high fever – please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Those could indicate a more serious problem. Also, if the pain becomes unbearable despite the medication and rest, don’t hesitate to call. We’ll get those X-ray results back within the hour, and I’ll have the technician come and get you when they’re ready. In the meantime, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, doctor, I think that covers it. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you again. I’ll just… sit here and wait for the results, then. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll check on you in a few minutes, Albino. Don’t hesitate to let the nurse know if you need anything at all.
