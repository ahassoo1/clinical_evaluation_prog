DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. Well, it’s… about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife helped me set this up. Honestly, I don't remember all the details, but it’s something about getting a… a smaller stomach, I think? It’s been on my mind for a bit, and she said this was the first step.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weight loss surgery consultation. Right. And you’re thinking about… gastric bypass or a sleeve?
PATIENT: Oh, wow. See, that’s… that’s what I don’t remember. I just know I need to lose weight. My wife did a lot of research, and she picked something, but I wasn’t really… focused at the time. Is there a big difference? Maybe you could explain it to me? I’m really bad with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly alright not to remember all the specifics. There are differences. Gastric bypass reroutes part of your stomach and small intestine, so you eat less and absorb fewer calories. A sleeve gastrectomy, or sleeve, removes a large portion of your stomach, leaving you with a smaller “sleeve.” Both can be effective, but they have different risks and benefits. Do you recall anything about why your wife thought one might be better for you?
PATIENT: Hmm… She kept saying something about… not wanting me to have to take a lot of vitamins after? And something about… less chance of problems later on? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I was pretty stressed when we were looking into it. I just know she wanted something… safer, I guess. She does a lot of reading, my wife. Way more than I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, safer… less need for vitamins… that does lean towards the sleeve gastrectomy, generally. It tends to have a lower risk of certain vitamin deficiencies compared to bypass, though both require lifelong vitamin supplementation. Let's get a bit more information about your overall health. Have you had any medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think I had… strep throat a couple of times when I was a kid? And I broke my arm once, falling off a bike. But nothing serious, really. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. I usually just try to tough things out. My wife gets mad at me for that. She says I need to take better care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history as far as you know. That’s good. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Just the broken arm, and they put a cast on it, that’s all. Nothing… inside. I don’t like hospitals, if that makes sense. They always smell funny.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kochubey. Many people feel that way. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… I have a brother, he lives in… well, I don’t remember exactly where right now. And my mom, she's doing okay, I think. She’s back in Iraq. As for health problems… I don't really know. We don’t talk about that stuff much. It’s… complicated. My wife knows more about that, probably. She keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known family history of major medical problems. We can always get that information from your wife later, if you'd like. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular, though. I mostly drink water, actually. And… tea. My wife makes really good tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any medications. Not regularly, anyway. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s it. Over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. They always make me feel weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that gives me a basic picture. Before we discuss the surgery options in detail, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I just… I want to get this weight off, you know? It’s been hard. My wife says this is the best way, and I want to give it a try. As long as it’s safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s start with your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. It won’t take long. If you could step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. There. Is that… is that a good number? I try not to look at them. It’s depressing.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds, and you said your height is 155 centimeters?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that sounds right. I think. I haven't measured myself in a while, to be honest. My wife probably knows for sure. She's good with numbers. I'm more of a… feeler, you know? Not a thinker.
DOCTOR: Okay. That puts your BMI at… 58. That's significantly elevated. Alright, let’s listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Like that? I always feel a little silly doing this. It feels like I'm pretending to be sick.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay. Ooh, that's a little tender there… Not really painful, but… uncomfortable. I get a lot of gas, actually. My wife says it's because I eat too fast. She's probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. That could be from a number of things. Nothing too concerning at this point. Alright, that completes the quick exam. Based on what you've told me, and the brief physical exam, you are a candidate for bariatric surgery. Given your concerns about vitamin deficiencies, and your wife's research, the sleeve gastrectomy appears to be the more suitable option. But we need to do some further testing before we proceed. Blood work, to check your overall health, and a psychological evaluation to make sure you're prepared for the lifestyle changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Blood work and… a talking to. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this done. I trust you and my wife. She’s really good at figuring these things out. So, what’s the next step? When can we do the blood work? And… what does the talking to involve? Is it hard?
