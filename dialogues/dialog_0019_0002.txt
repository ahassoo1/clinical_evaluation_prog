DOCTOR: Good morning, Zoie. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Renzi, you say? That's a nice name. Um… what did I come for? Now, let me think… It’s something with… going to the bathroom. Yes! It's hard to… start, you know? Not painful, just… difficult. It’s been going on for a little while, I think. A few weeks maybe? It’s hard to remember things these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, it’s perfectly normal for things to be a little fuzzy sometimes. Don't you worry about remembering every detail. So, it’s difficulty starting to urinate, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Difficulty… starting. Like… it takes a long time, and I have to push a little. Not much pushing, but… some. And sometimes it just… drips. It’s embarrassing, really. My husband, he helps me remember things, but he’s not here today. He’s… busy with the garden, I think. Lots of tomatoes this year!
DOCTOR: It sounds frustrating, Zoie. And it’s nothing to be embarrassed about at all – these things happen. It's good your husband is helping you with things. We'll figure out what's going on. Now, besides the difficulty starting and the dripping, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me think… Well, I get up a lot at night, maybe two or three times. More than I used to, I think. And… sometimes I feel like I don’t empty my bladder all the way. Like there’s still a little left in there, you know? It’s not much, but it’s… noticeable. Oh, and sometimes it burns a little when I go. Just a little. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Zoie, that’s helpful. Getting up frequently at night, feeling like you don't empty completely, and a little burning sensation… yes, those are all things we need to consider. The burning is something we definitely want to look into. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Blood? No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve seen. My husband usually helps me with… checking things. He has better eyes than me now. Pain… not really pain. Just a little… discomfort sometimes, low down. Like a pressure, maybe? It comes and goes. It’s not a sharp pain, nothing like that. Just… uncomfortable. I mostly just feel tired, to be honest. Old age, you know? Everything aches a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, aches and pains are common as we get older. It’s good you’re telling me all of this. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health problems… Oh dear. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. That was… maybe twenty years ago? And I have a bit of arthritis, in my hands mostly. It’s not too bad, just a little stiff in the mornings. And… I think I had high blood pressure once, but they gave me some pills and it went away. I'm not sure anymore, honestly. My husband keeps track of those things. He’s very organized. Medicare pays for most of it, thankfully. Does that help? I don’t remember much else, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, that's very helpful. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and past high blood pressure… I appreciate you sharing that with me. And don’t worry about not remembering everything, we’ll sort through it. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides maybe something for your blood pressure in the past?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Oh! I take a little pill for my arthritis, every morning. It's white, I think. And… sometimes I take something for sleeping, if I can’t get to sleep. But not every night. Just when I’m really restless. My doctor gave it to me a while back. And… that’s all I can think of right now. I try not to take too many pills, you know? They make me feel funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. Just a pill for arthritis and something for sleep occasionally. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just from the sun, I think. My husband puts lotion on for me. He’s very thoughtful. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. Nothing I know of, anyway. I used to love flowers, but sometimes they made my nose tickle. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Zoie. Just a little tickle from flowers. No serious allergies. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam now, if you don't mind. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your abdomen and do a quick neurological exam. That will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t mind. I’ve had doctors listen to my heart before. It’s just… a bit cold sometimes, with the stethoscope. And the abdomen… is that where you press on my tummy? It’s a little sensitive, you know. But go ahead. I trust you, Doctor. Just be gentle, please. My husband always says I have a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zoie. I will be very gentle. Just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Okay, a little tenderness here on the lower abdomen, as you mentioned. Not anything alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes quickly. Just relax your legs for me. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, Zoie. Everything seems generally okay, but based on what you've told me and my exam, I think it's important to do a urine test to rule out any infection or other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A urine test? Yes, alright. If you think it's best. It's just… a little embarrassing, you know? Having to… go in a cup. But I understand. It's for my health, right? My husband always says I worry too much. He'll probably want to know the results too. He likes to keep track of everything. Where do I… go? Is there a bathroom nearby? And… do I need a special cup?
DOCTOR: Yes, Zoie, that's right, it’s for your health. And don’t worry about it at all – it’s a very common test. There’s a bathroom just down the hall, and the nurse will give you a special cup. She’ll explain everything to you. I'll just step out for a moment to allow you some privacy. When you’re finished, just leave the cup on the counter, and I’ll have the results sent to me. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask the nurse if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I think I can manage. Just a cup, right? My husband always says I’m a good patient. I’ll just go now then. Thank you again.
