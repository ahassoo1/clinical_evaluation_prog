DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my leg. It’s been swelling up. It's… after the cancer treatments, you see. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not sure exactly when, honestly. It just… got bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. It's good to know a little bit of the history already. Swelling after cancer treatments is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the cancer treatments you had?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It was… chemotherapy, mostly. And some radiation. A long time ago now, maybe… five years? Six? I get the dates mixed up, sorry. It was for… breast cancer. They said it was… stage two, I think? It was at the hospital, lots of appointments. It was… tiring, very tiring.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize about the dates, Sasha. That’s perfectly understandable. Five or six years ago for stage two breast cancer, with chemotherapy and radiation… okay. And this swelling – is it in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. It’s… it’s mostly in my calf, I think. And my ankle gets puffy too. It feels… heavy, sometimes. Like I’m walking with a stone tied to it. It's not painful, exactly, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the swelling is primarily in your left calf and ankle, feels heavy, and is uncomfortable rather than painful. Has the swelling come on gradually, or was it sudden?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It didn’t just pop up one day. It started small, and I… well, I ignored it at first. Old lady problems, you know? But it just kept getting bigger, so I thought I should probably come see someone.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. And you're right, it's always best to get these things looked at. Now, besides the swelling and the feeling of heaviness, have you noticed any other changes in your leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The skin… it feels a little warm sometimes. And it’s a bit red, maybe? Not bright red, just… a little flushed. And… oh! It itches sometimes, especially at night. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some warmth, slight redness, and itching, particularly at night. Have you noticed any changes in the skin texture, like thickening or sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. The skin feels… normal, I guess. Maybe a little dry, but I have dry skin everywhere. It's just… normal old lady skin, Doctor. I put lotion on it, but it doesn't really seem to help.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. I am tired, but… I’m always a little tired. I'm 59, you know? It’s just… getting old. I don’t think it’s anything to do with my leg, just… life.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to rule things out, though. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Besides the breast cancer, do you have any other health conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been okay since. Nothing else, really. Just the usual old lady aches and pains. I do have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the high blood pressure being managed. Medicare is helpful for documentation, yes. Are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it's really bad. But not every day. Just when it flares up. It’s just… over-the-counter stuff, you know? Ibuprofen, something like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so one medication for blood pressure daily, and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Lucky me, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle? Not very exciting, Doctor. I live alone. I used to work as a… a nuclear technician. A long time ago. Now I mostly… read, watch television, go for little walks when the weather is nice. Nothing strenuous. Mostly just… existing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to take a look at your leg. If you don’t mind, could you please sit on the examination table and elevate your left leg?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. It feels a bit awkward, but I'll manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. I'm just going to take a look and feel your leg. I'm noting some redness and mild swelling in your calf and around your ankle, as you mentioned. The skin feels warm to the touch. Now, I’m going to gently feel for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. Just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe? Not sharp. It's more… pressure, I think. It feels… squishy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. "Squishy" is a good description. I’m also checking the pulses in your foot. Your pulses feel present, but slightly diminished on the left side compared to your right. Now, I'm going to measure the circumference of both your calves to compare. Your left calf measures 41 centimeters, and your right calf measures 38 centimeters. There's a 3-centimeter difference. That difference, along with the redness, swelling, and warmth, suggests possible fluid retention. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly just to get a baseline. Everything sounds clear, but it's good to check.
PATIENT: Oh, my. All that measuring! I feel like a science experiment. Fluid retention… is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Sasha, but it’s something we need to investigate further. Fluid retention, or edema, can be caused by a number of things. Given your history of cancer treatments, it's important to rule out any complications related to those treatments, like lymphedema. It could also be related to your heart, kidneys, or even just prolonged standing. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be okay with a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a complete blood count?
PATIENT: Oh, tests… yes, okay. If you think it’s necessary. Blood tests are… never fun, but I'll do what you need me to do. What exactly will it show, Doctor?
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a good overview of how your kidneys are functioning, which can affect fluid balance. They'll also check for any signs of infection or inflammation, and provide a general picture of your overall health. I’d also like to order a Duplex Ultrasound of your left leg. This is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to look at the veins in your leg and check for any blood clots, which can cause swelling. It will also help rule out or confirm lymphedema. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Duplex… Ultrasound… That sounds… complicated. But if it will help, yes. I just… I don’t want anything serious. I’m an old lady, Doctor. I just want to be comfortable. Will the tests take long? And will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sasha. The ultrasound is not painful at all. It involves applying a gel to your leg and moving a wand over your skin. It's a bit like getting a massage, really. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the blood test, that will just be a quick prick of the finger or a small blood draw from your arm. We'll get the results back within a few days. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… Oh dear. I always thought those were for very sick people. But okay, I'll try. And hydration… yes, I drink water. Not enough, maybe. I prefer tea. Will tea count?
DOCTOR: Tea does count, Sasha, but water is best. Try to aim for at least six to eight glasses of water a day. It helps flush out your system and keeps things moving. And compression stockings are often recommended for mild swelling and can really help reduce discomfort. I’ll write you a prescription for a pair. They come in different strengths, and we can start with a mild compression level. While we’re waiting for the results, if you notice any sudden increase in pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or if you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. It's a lot to take in, but… I trust you. Thank you for being so patient with an old lady and her squishy leg.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. It’s my job to help you feel better, and I’m happy to take the time to answer your questions. We'll get these tests done and figure out what's going on. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and schedule your ultrasound. Here's a prescription for the compression stockings, and a printout with instructions on how to care for them. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We’ll follow up as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, Sasha. And remember to elevate that leg!
