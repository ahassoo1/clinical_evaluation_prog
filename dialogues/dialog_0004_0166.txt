DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kinjerski. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg. It’s… rather bothersome, actually. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. "A little while" is vague, Mr. Kinjerski. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. My apologies. It began approximately three weeks ago, on or around June 15th, if my memory serves. It started subtly, just a slight tingling sensation in my left calf, and has gradually increased to a more pronounced numbness. It isn't constant, mind you, but it’s frequent enough to be concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this numbness present all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not a persistent, always-there feeling. It seems to be most noticeable after I’ve been standing or walking for extended periods. If I sit and rest it for a bit, it usually subsides. Though, I did notice it a little this morning even after a full night’s sleep, which is a bit unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where exactly in your leg are you feeling this numbness?
PATIENT: It’s primarily in my left calf, Doctor, as I mentioned. However, it sometimes radiates down towards my foot and even into my toes. It’s not the entire foot, more the outer side, if that makes sense. And occasionally, I’ll feel a slight tingling sensation in my shin as well, but that’s less frequent. It doesn't travel up my leg, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Have you experienced any weakness in your leg, any difficulty walking, or any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. My strength feels normal, and I haven’t noticed any difficulty walking or issues with my balance. I’ve been quite careful to observe that, actually, as I do a fair amount of walking for my work – scouting locations and such. I haven’t stumbled or felt unsteady at all. It’s purely the numbness that’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any pain associated with this numbness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, there isn’t any pain. That’s what’s so odd about it, actually. It’s just… a lack of sensation. A sort of dull emptiness, if you will. No burning, no sharp aches, no throbbing – simply numbness. It doesn’t feel like an injury, which is why I thought it best to get it looked at. Something doesn't feel quite right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. No chronic illnesses, no significant injuries in the past, and I don’t take any medications regularly. I haven’t had any surgeries, either. I do see a dentist regularly, of course, and get my annual check-ups, but nothing beyond the usual preventative care. I pride myself on taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Good. Any family history of neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My maternal grandmother, on my mother’s side, did have something the doctors called “peripheral neuropathy” later in life. It wasn’t extensively diagnosed, to my knowledge, but I remember her complaining of similar symptoms – numbness and tingling in her extremities. It developed quite late in her life, though, well into her eighties. My mother doesn’t seem to have been affected.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, as I mentioned, I work as a special effects artist and animator. It’s a rather active job, actually. A lot of on-location work, scouting for environments, setting up equipment… I spend a fair amount of time on my feet. Otherwise, I enjoy hiking and spending time outdoors. I don’t smoke, and I drink alcohol only occasionally, socially. My diet is fairly balanced, I try to eat a lot of fish and vegetables when I can. I wouldn’t describe myself as particularly sedentary, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I don’t have any food allergies either. I’m quite careful about what I consume, and I’ve never experienced any issues with hives, swelling, or breathing difficulties. I'm fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No problem at all. Please let me know if there’s anything specific you’d like me to do or if you need me to adjust my position.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Now, let me feel the strength of your legs. Can you lift your left leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I can hold it here for quite some time, if that's helpful. Just let me know if you'd like me to resist any pressure.
DOCTOR: Good strength. Now, can you point your toes up and then down?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Is this range of motion sufficient? I can try harder if needed, but I believe this is my full capacity.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. Close your eyes. I’m going to touch different spots on your legs with this cotton swab. Tell me when you feel it. Okay, now your right leg... and now the left leg… Can you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that on my right leg, Doctor. …And yes, I can feel it there as well… though it’s… somewhat diminished on my left leg. It's not absent, but it’s less pronounced, a little… muted, if that makes sense. It takes a fraction of a second longer to register, and it's not as sharp as it is on my right.
DOCTOR: Hmm. That’s what I suspected. Alright. And finally, I’m going to listen to the blood flow in your legs. Blood flow seems normal on both sides.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you for the thorough examination. Is there anything else you'd like to check, or are we nearing a diagnosis? I appreciate you taking the time to be so methodical. I was beginning to worry it was all in my head, truthfully.
DOCTOR: It's not all in your head, Mr. Kinjerski. Based on the examination, and particularly the diminished sensation in your left leg, I suspect you might be experiencing peripheral neuropathy. However, there are several potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. We'll check your vitamin levels – particularly B12 – your blood sugar, and also screen for any autoimmune conditions. We may also want to consider a nerve conduction study to assess the function of the nerves in your legs, if the blood tests are inconclusive. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. No, I don’t believe I do at this moment. Blood tests and potentially a nerve conduction study sound reasonable, certainly. I'm happy to proceed with whatever you deem necessary to arrive at a proper diagnosis. What sort of timeframe are we looking at for the results of the blood tests? And is there anything I should be doing or avoiding in the meantime?
DOCTOR: The blood tests should come back within three to five business days. As for the nerve conduction study, that will likely require a referral to a neurologist, and scheduling could take another week or so. In the meantime, try to avoid prolonged standing or walking, if possible. If you do spend a lot of time on your feet, make sure you take frequent breaks. And I'd recommend checking your feet daily for any cuts, blisters, or signs of infection, especially given the decreased sensation. Beyond that, just continue to maintain a healthy lifestyle – balanced diet, regular exercise within your limitations, and avoid smoking. Do you have any trouble scheduling appointments, or do you prefer I have my staff assist you with those details?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor. Thank you. I believe your staff could handle the scheduling for me, if that's not too much trouble. I’m reasonably busy with my work, and it would be a great weight off my shoulders. I certainly appreciate you considering my schedule. To reiterate, prolonged standing to be avoided, daily foot checks, and healthy habits. I've got it. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Or do I just wait for a call from your staff regarding the appointment and blood test results?
DOCTOR: No, that's it for now. My staff will be in touch to schedule the blood tests and the neurologist referral. If you experience any worsening of the numbness, or if you develop any new symptoms - such as pain, weakness, or difficulty walking - don't hesitate to call the office immediately. I want to rule out anything serious. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns that arise before your next appointment. Here's a printed summary of our discussion and the plan, and my contact information should you need it. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been incredibly thorough and reassuring. Thank you for your time and expertise. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously, and I'll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. I look forward to hearing from your staff regarding the next steps. Have a good day, Doctor Deschane. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Kinjerski. You have a good day as well. And don't hesitate to reach out if anything comes up.
