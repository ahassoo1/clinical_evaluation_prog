DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Todorovich. It's… troublesome, really. I have a bit of difficulty breathing when I lie down flat. It’s been happening for… oh, a few weeks now, I’d say. Perhaps a month. It wakes me up at night, mostly.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a month. Give or take a few days. I keep very good track of these things, you see. It's usually worse if I’ve had a larger meal. And… well, lying flat is the issue. Sitting up, no problem. Walking, no problem. Just… flat on my back.
DOCTOR: Right. And how many pillows are you using to sleep, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… usually two, but lately… three. Sometimes even four! It’s rather uncomfortable, really. Not ideal at all. I used to just need two, comfortably. And I do prefer a firm pillow, if that matters.
DOCTOR: So, you’ve increased your pillow count to compensate. And you say it’s worse after eating?
PATIENT: Yes, increased. Quite a bit. And, yes, definitely worse after eating. Especially… a heavier meal. Like if I have roast chicken, or something similar. A light soup… not so much. I’ve noticed it myself, and I thought it worth mentioning. I try to eat earlier in the evening now, to avoid it. It’s all a bit… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Well, it sounds like it could be a number of things, Ms. Vanderwiele. Do you experience any swelling in your ankles or feet at the end of the day?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm. Let me consider. Now that you mention it… yes, a little. Not terribly bad, but sometimes, particularly in the evenings, my ankles feel… puffy. I hadn’t connected it to the breathing, though. I just thought it was… old age, perhaps. But yes, some swelling. It goes down overnight, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of heart problems, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I’m aware of. My doctor back in Zuni… Dr. Yazzie, lovely man… he always said my heart was strong. I had my blood pressure checked regularly, and it was always… normal, I believe. Nothing concerning ever came up. I haven’t had any chest pain, or palpitations, or anything of that nature. Just… this breathing. And the swelling. I always told Dr. Yazzie about everything, you know. I'm very diligent about my health.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your weight, Ms. Vanderwiele?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I haven’t weighed myself recently, exactly. But… I’m about 68 pounds. I used to be a bit more, but… well, I’ve lost some weight this year. It’s been a difficult year, personally. But 68 pounds, give or take. I am tall, though. 5’8”, I believe. Perhaps 5’9”. It’s hard to remember precisely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we may be dealing with some fluid retention, Ms. Vanderwiele. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs, and then we’ll talk about some potential tests. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Fluid retention, you say? I hadn’t considered that. Tests… alright. I suppose that's necessary. Let me just… carefully. I don't move as quickly as I used to.
DOCTOR: No rush at all, Ms. Vanderwiele. Just take your time. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Please breathe deeply through your mouth.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths, you say? Yes, I can do that. One… two… three… Is this alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs, Ms. Vanderwiele. And your heart sounds… a little bit muffled. It's not immediately alarming, but we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. Also, I want to check your kidney function and electrolytes with a blood test. We'll also do a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, of course. An X-ray, an EKG, blood tests… all sounds very sensible, Doctor. Kidney function… electrolytes… Yes, whatever you think is necessary. It's all a bit overwhelming, but I trust your judgment. When can I expect these tests? And… will they be painful? I don’t tolerate things very well, you see.
DOCTOR: The X-ray and EKG can be done right here in the clinic, Ms. Vanderwiele. The blood work will require a visit to the lab, which is just across the parking lot. It won't be painful, just a small prick in your arm. A little discomfort, perhaps. As for results, we should have them back within a couple of days. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your salt intake and keeping your head elevated when you sleep. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Salt intake… elevated head… Yes, I suppose so. Limiting salt… I do enjoy a bit of seasoning, but… I can try. And extra pillows, certainly. So, the lab… across the parking lot? And a follow-up appointment… How soon should I schedule that? I have… commitments, you see. Perhaps a week from today?
DOCTOR: A week might be a little too long, Ms. Vanderwiele. Let's schedule it for three business days from now. That will give the lab time to process the results and allow us to address any concerns promptly. As for your commitments, I understand, but we need to prioritize your health. Alright, I’ve scheduled you for an appointment on August 5th at 10:00 AM. Does that work?
PATIENT: August 5th… 10:00 AM. Yes, that will… suffice. August 5th. I shall mark it on my calendar immediately. Very well, Doctor. I believe that concludes our conversation for now? I do appreciate your attention to my… troubles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Vanderwiele. Just remember to limit your salt intake and keep your head elevated. And be sure to get the lab work done as soon as possible. If your symptoms worsen before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's a copy of the lab requisition and instructions. We’ll discuss the results on August 5th. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall remember. And I will… attempt to limit the salt. Thank you. Good day to you as well. .
