DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps comin’ back. It’s been a bit of a nuisance, to be honest. I’d like to get it sorted, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: A fever, you say. “A bit of a nuisance.” Right. Well, let’s not downplay things. We need to figure out why you’re having a fever, not just how bothersome it is. Now, tell me, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, you're right. Not trying to be difficult. Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three weeks ago? On and off, though. Not every day, and usually it breaks in a day or so. But it always comes back. I can tell you exactly when it started, too - July 12th, I was at my grandson’s baseball game, felt a chill then, and boom, fever that night.
DOCTOR: July 12th… alright. And when you say “a fever,” can you give me a number?
PATIENT: A number? You mean like… how high? I haven’t actually taken my temperature, Doctor. My wife, Elena, she usually does when I'm really bad, but it feels… warm, you know? Like a good warm. Not freezing, not burning, just… warm. She said last time it was 101, maybe? But that was a week ago, and I haven’t felt that sick since.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “warm” isn’t a temperature, Mr. Brege. It's important to know the actual number, you see?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor, I do. Look, I just don't mess with thermometers. Never have. Elena usually handles all that. It’s probably around 100, if I had to guess. Really, it’s just… it’s annoying. And it’s been happening more and more. I’d like to get it fixed, if possible. I haven't got time for this, to be honest. I got appointments to keep.
DOCTOR: Appointments, yes. Everyone has appointments. But ignoring a recurring fever won't make it disappear, Mr. Brege. And a guess isn't sufficient for a proper assessment. Now, besides the fever, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Not much, really. A little tired, maybe. But I'm 65, Doctor, a little tired is normal. No cough, no sniffles, no aches, no… well, nothing else. I eat normal, sleep normal, go to my tai chi class. It's just this fever. Elena said I was a little flushed last week, but she always says that when I get a bit warm.
DOCTOR: Tai chi, good. Staying active is important. Alright, Mr. Brege. Let's do a quick physical exam. I want to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your lymph nodes. Just a standard check, to see if we can pinpoint anything obvious. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind. I really do have a busy day.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is a little elevated at 88, but not alarming given the fever. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Alright, everything feels normal to the touch. But a fever that keeps returning… We need to do some blood work to rule things out. It could be anything from a mild infection to something else entirely.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Well, I’m not thrilled about that, but… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just let me know where to go, and how long it'll take. And, uh… will I need a ride? Elena’s at her bingo game all afternoon.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 304. It should take about 15-20 minutes. And yes, you will need a ride, Mr. Brege. You shouldn't drive yourself after having blood drawn, even if you feel fine. We have a volunteer who can drive you home, if you’d like. I’ll have her paged. While we're waiting for the volunteer, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor, not a one. Elena always makes sure I'm not eating anything I shouldn't. She’s very particular about that. Though... I don't really care for cilantro. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Brege, cilantro is a culinary preference, not an allergy. Alright. Let's go over your medical history quickly, while we wait. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Healthy as a horse, mostly. Had a bad back a few years back, that’s why I went to a chiropractor, but that’s all sorted now. No pills, no nothin'. Just tai chi and a good diet. Elena's diet, mostly.
DOCTOR: No chronic conditions, good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had to go under the knife. Lucky, I think. My father… well, he had his share of troubles. But I seem to have dodged a bullet there, thankfully. I just want this fever sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother had a bit of arthritis when she got older, and my father… he had heart trouble. High blood pressure, I think. He wasn't a very healthy man, to be honest. Spent most of his time indoors.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Elena wouldn't allow anything else. And definitely no… "recreational drugs." I’m a respectable man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand. Just covering all the bases. Here's Maria. She'll take you down to the lab. Just tell them Dr. Burlingham sent you for a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. Once that's done, she can drive you home. Maria, please make sure Mr. Brege gets home safely. We’ll get these results back as quickly as possible, and then we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103, or if you develop any new symptoms – like a severe headache, stiff neck, or trouble breathing – go to the emergency room immediately, understood?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Good. 103, right. Got it. And thank you, Maria. I really do appreciate this, Doctor, but I do have to get going. Hopefully, these tests will show something. This fever is just… annoying. .
