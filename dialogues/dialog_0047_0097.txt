DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Omar, suggested I come. He’s been reading articles, you see, about… planning for things. About what should happen if… well, if something were to occur. He wants me to fill out one of those forms – an Advance Directive, I believe he called it. Honestly, I don’t really understand why it’s necessary at my age, but he is quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Right. An Advance Directive. It's… prudent, I suppose, to consider these things. Though, at 44, most people aren’t overly concerned. Still, your husband seems to have a good head on his shoulders. It’s primarily about outlining your wishes for medical care should you become unable to communicate them yourself. Before we get to forms, though, is there anything currently bothering you?
PATIENT: Honestly? No, nothing is bothering me. I feel perfectly fine. A little tired, perhaps – teaching is exhausting, you know – but nothing a good night's sleep won't fix. It's just… this whole thing feels rather morbid. And frankly, I find it a bit insulting to be discussing my potential incapacitation as if I'm an elderly woman. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Insulting, yes, well… I can appreciate that sentiment. It’s certainly not the most pleasant topic. But it's less about anticipating illness and more about ensuring your wishes are respected. It’s a safeguard, really. Regardless, let's establish a baseline. You mentioned feeling tired. Is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing, I suppose. Though it’s worse during the school year, naturally. Grading papers, preparing lessons… it’s a lot of work. And the students… well, they require a great deal of patience. I’ve always prided myself on being a dedicated educator, but it does take a toll. It's just… normal fatigue. I don’t expect you to do anything about it. I simply came for this… form.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even "normal" fatigue can sometimes indicate underlying issues. It's my duty to explore all possibilities, however unlikely. Just a few quick questions, then, to rule things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. Are we really going to do this? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. But… if you must know, I suppose I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. Small things, mostly. Misplacing my keys, forgetting appointments… nothing significant. My husband chalks it up to stress, which is probably accurate. He says I worry too much. It's hardly a medical concern. Now, about this Advance Directive… are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: "Small" forgetfulness can be indicative of several things. And dismissing symptoms simply isn’t good practice. Stress can certainly contribute, yes, but it's important to differentiate. Let’s broaden the scope. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: My appetite is perfectly normal. I enjoy a good tagine, you know, and I always make sure to eat a balanced diet. And my weight… well, it fluctuates, as it does for most women. Nothing drastic. I am not wasting away, Doctor, if that's what you're implying. This is becoming quite tiresome. I feel like I’m being interrogated, not consulted about a simple form. Perhaps I should just speak with Omar’s solicitor instead.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, I am attempting to gather a complete medical history. It is standard procedure. And frankly, your dismissive attitude isn’t helping. I understand you’re feeling frustrated, but I need you to answer my questions honestly if you want me to provide any meaningful guidance. Have you experienced any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Occasionally. Though I attribute that to standing for long periods during lessons. And headaches… well, who doesn’t get headaches? I’ve always had sensitive sinuses, particularly when the weather changes. Really, Doctor, this is all rather… ordinary. I fail to see how any of this is relevant to the Advance Directive. I simply want to complete the form so my husband stops worrying and I can get on with my life. Is that so much to ask? Perhaps this is a waste of both our time. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, I appreciate you coming in today. However, if you are unwilling to engage in a proper medical consultation, I cannot, in good conscience, assist you. An Advance Directive is a serious matter, and requires a clear understanding of your overall health status. If you change your mind and wish to discuss your symptoms further, please schedule another appointment. Otherwise, I suggest you consult with your husband's solicitor as you proposed. Good day. .
