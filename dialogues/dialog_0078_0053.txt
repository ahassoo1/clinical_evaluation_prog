DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been having trouble going to the bathroom. It’s like… it takes me a long time, and sometimes I can’t go at all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. There's no need to be embarrassed; these things are quite common, and we’re here to help. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe about a month ago? It wasn’t sudden, it just… got worse slowly. At first it was just a little straining, but now… well, now it's more difficult each time. I remember the date being around the first of July, because I had just gotten back from visiting my niece in Chicago.
DOCTOR: Okay, around the first of July, after your trip to Chicago. That’s helpful. And is this difficulty with starting urination, maintaining a stream, or completely emptying your bladder?
PATIENT: It’s… all of it, I think. It takes effort to start, and then the stream isn’t very strong. And even when I think I’m finished, I feel like there’s still some left in there, you know? Like I didn’t quite empty everything. It's a very uncomfortable feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating and uncomfortable. Do you find yourself needing to go more frequently than usual, or waking up at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I’ve been getting up… oh, two or three times a night sometimes. Which is new. I usually sleep right through. And during the day, I feel like I have to go more often, even if it's just a little bit. It’s not a huge amount each time, but… more trips. It's disrupting my routine, that's for sure. I like to get my garden done early before it gets too hot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency, especially at night, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. And thankfully, no blood. It’s just… the difficulty, and the feeling of not emptying completely. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it’s… strained, you know? And very frustrating. I’m usually very regular, and this is just so unlike me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, burning, or blood. Just difficulty initiating the stream, a weak stream, incomplete emptying, and increased frequency, especially at night. Now, Ms. Yadao, have you had any changes in your medications recently, or any new medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Let me think… no new conditions, no. I take a small dose of something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were a bit low last year. But that’s it. I haven't changed anything recently, not a thing. I’ve been taking the same things for years, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a vitamin D supplement. And are you currently experiencing any other medical issues, such as constipation, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No constipation, thankfully. I try to eat a good amount of fruit and vegetables. And no abdominal pain, no. It’s really just this… bathroom trouble. It's making me a bit anxious, to be honest. I've never had anything like this before. I always thought I was very healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Yadao, and it’s good that you’re proactive about your health. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix taken out when I was a young woman, maybe 20 years old. And I broke my wrist a few years back, had a cast on for six weeks. But that's about it. Nothing major, really. No other surgeries, no long hospital stays. Just the usual bumps and bruises, you know? I’ve always been lucky, health-wise. Until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy many years ago and a broken wrist. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… she had diabetes, I think. Type 2, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble when he got older. But I don't think anyone else in my family had anything like… what I'm experiencing. Mostly just the usual aging problems, you know? Arthritis and such. My brother has a bad back, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a family history of diabetes and heart trouble. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I live alone in a small house with a garden. I try to stay active, mostly gardening and walking. I don't smoke, and I very rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I try to eat a healthy diet - lots of vegetables and fruit, lean protein. I wouldn't say I exercise vigorously, but I'm not a complete couch potato either. I enjoy reading and spending time with my niece when she visits.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Yadao. Given your symptoms, medical history, and lifestyle, it sounds like we should investigate this further. It could be a number of things, ranging from a simple urinary tract infection – though you haven’t had any pain or burning, which makes that less likely – to an enlarged prostate, even though you are female, or possibly some bladder weakness. To get a better understanding, I’d like to do a physical exam and order a urine test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A test and an exam. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this and feel normal again. I trust your judgment. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll need to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a gentle abdominal exam. Finally, I’ll do a pelvic exam to assess your bladder and surrounding structures. The urine test will help rule out an infection and give us some additional information. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds… alright. It’s not the most pleasant thing, I suppose, but I understand it’s necessary. Please, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m a bit nervous, to be honest, but I trust you’ll be gentle. Do I need to… prepare in any way?
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Yadao, and I assure you I’ll be as gentle as possible. For the pelvic exam, you’ll lie on your back with your feet in stirrups, similar to a gynecological exam. You’ll be covered with a sheet, and I’ll explain each step before I do it. You don't need to do any specific preparation beforehand, but it's helpful to have a full bladder, if possible, but not overly full. Are you comfortable proceeding?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A full bladder, you say? I had a cup of tea a little while ago, so that should be enough, I suppose. Alright, let's get it over with. Just… please, be gentle. And explain everything as you go, like you said. I appreciate that. It helps to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will explain everything as I go. Let’s start with checking your blood pressure. “I’m just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment, and I’ll listen with my stethoscope to get a reading. It might feel a little snug, but it shouldn't be painful.” “Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally.”
PATIENT: Okay, that wasn’t too bad. A bit snug, as you said, but nothing painful. And breathing normally… yes, I can do that. I always try to take deep breaths when I’m nervous. It helps calm me down. My heart feels a little… fluttery sometimes, but that's probably just the anxiety. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that’s not uncommon with anxiety, and we can monitor that. Your heart sounds are a bit rapid, as you mentioned, but otherwise, everything sounds normal. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. “I’m just pressing gently here… and here… Do you feel any pain or tenderness?
PATIENT: No, that’s… alright. Not painful. Just a little… strange, feeling someone touch my stomach. But no pain at all. I always feel a bit self-conscious when someone touches my abdomen, to be honest. But no actual pain. It feels… solid, I suppose. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Ms. Yadao. Your abdomen feels solid, which is expected. Now, we'll move on to the pelvic exam. As I mentioned before, you’ll lie on your back with your feet in stirrups. I’ll use a speculum to gently examine your vagina and cervix, and then I’ll perform a digital exam to assess your bladder and surrounding structures. This may cause some discomfort, but it should be brief. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Lie on my back, you say? And the stirrups… I haven't been through this in a long time. Yes, go ahead. As long as you’re gentle, like you said. I trust you. It's just… a bit unsettling, that’s all. Just let me know before you do anything, if you would.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I will explain each step before I do it, and I will let you know if you need to adjust your position or take a break at any time. “Just relax your legs as much as possible. I’m going to use a warmed speculum to gently examine your vagina and cervix. It may feel a little cold and slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief.” “I’m just inserting the speculum now… Take a deep breath… This may feel a little pressure… There you go…”
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That is a bit cold. And… a little uncomfortable. But… I’m trying to relax. Deep breaths… Yes, deep breaths. It's just… not very pleasant, that’s all. Is it over soon?
DOCTOR: Almost done, Ms. Yadao. I’m just examining the cervix now. Everything looks normal so far. "Now, I'm going to gently insert a gloved finger to assess your pelvic muscles and check for any tenderness. This may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.” “Just relax your muscles as much as possible… there you go…” “Alright, that’s all done. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s better. That was… not my favorite thing, I must say. The digital exam… felt a bit strange, but… not terribly uncomfortable. Just… a bit invasive. I’m a little sore now, I think. But otherwise… alright. I’m glad it’s over. What did you find? Is everything okay?
DOCTOR: Everything appears normal structurally, Ms. Yadao. I didn’t feel any masses or tenderness during the exam. However, your pelvic floor muscles do feel a bit weak, which could be contributing to your symptoms of incomplete emptying. Now, I’ve sent a urine sample to the lab to rule out infection. We'll get those results back in a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend starting some pelvic floor exercises – Kegels – to strengthen those muscles. I can show you how to do those properly. We can also discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol, which can irritate the bladder. Given your age and symptoms, it's also possible you're experiencing a bit of bladder overactivity, which is common as we get older. We can discuss some medication options if the exercises and lifestyle changes don't provide enough relief. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Pelvic floor exercises, you say? Kegels? I’ve heard of those, I think. And avoiding caffeine… yes, I suppose I could cut back on my tea. Medication… I’d rather not, if possible. Let’s try the exercises and the lifestyle changes first. Show me how to do the Kegels properly, please. And when will I get the results from the urine test? I’m just… anxious to know what’s going on. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. Let’s start with the Kegel exercises. “Imagine you’re trying to stop the flow of urine midstream. Squeeze those muscles – the same muscles you use to stop urination. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat this 10-15 times, several times a day. You can do these anywhere, anytime. It’s important to squeeze the correct muscles – avoid squeezing your stomach or buttocks. Here’s a handout with more information. And as for the urine test results, they should be back in a couple of days. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. The instructions are very clear, thank you. I’ll try to do the exercises as you showed me. And I’ll wait for your call about the urine test. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I hope I haven’t taken up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms, such as fever or pain, please call us immediately. Otherwise, I'll be in touch as soon as I have the urine test results. Have a good day, and please take care.
