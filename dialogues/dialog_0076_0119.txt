DOCTOR: Right, Jinnie Wartick, 57 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that’s why one comes to a doctor, isn’t it? It's... a problem with my husband. Or, rather, him. It’s a discharge. A… a leakage. From down there. It’s quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. From your husband. You’re telling me your husband is experiencing a discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor, that is precisely what I said. Honestly, must I repeat everything? It’s… unseemly. And rather worrying, naturally. He isn’t… he doesn’t talk about these things, you see. So, I had to… observe. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know, a week or so, maybe? It’s not a flood, but it's definitely… there. And it smells… not nice.
DOCTOR: A male patient with a discharge… unusual. Look, I specialize in internal medicine. Things... down there… that's usually a urologist’s territory. Are you certain it’s not something else?
PATIENT: Well, of course I'm certain! I'm not an idiot, doctor. It's coming from him. Where else would it come from? And what does it matter where you specialize? You're a doctor, aren't you? You should be able to handle anything. Honestly, the lack of… thoroughness is a bit concerning.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm not dismissing you, but I’m telling you, this is outside my scope of practice. It’s simply… not what I do. It could be a number of things – an infection, irritation… I wouldn't want to misdiagnose him. I can take a quick look, but frankly, I'm very uncomfortable doing so, and I'll be documenting that. Is he experiencing any pain, burning, or fever?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose if you must take a look… though I still think you're being rather dramatic about it all. As for pain… he’s not one for complaining, you see. But he has been a bit… quieter than usual. And he keeps going to the bathroom. More often than necessary, I think. No fever that I’ve noticed. Honestly, the whole thing is most upsetting. It’s… degrading. For both of us.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's get this over with. He'll need to undress from the waist down. I’ll be right back with some gloves and lubricant. And I’m documenting, again, that this is outside my area of expertise.
PATIENT: Well, really! The nerve. Honestly, lubricant? As if that’s necessary. He’s a perfectly healthy man, usually. I suppose… I suppose I should make sure he's… prepared. It's terribly awkward, though. I do wish I hadn't had to come here. This is all very undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright. If he's ready, we can proceed. I'm just going to take a brief look, okay?
PATIENT: He’s… as ready as he’ll ever be, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit humiliating for him. And for me, watching you… Well, let's just get it over with, doctor. The sooner this is done, the better. I’ll look away, if that helps. But do be quick about it, please.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Just relax. Hmm. Yes. There’s some discharge… appears to be urethral. Slight redness. No obvious lesions. Is he circumcised?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, must you ask such questions? Honestly! Yes, he is circumcised. Always has been. Though what that has to do with anything… Honestly, the whole situation is quite dreadful. It looks… inflamed, doesn’t it? Is it serious, doctor? Don't tell me it's something… contagious. He hasn't been… with anyone else, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not going to speculate. It could be a number of things - a simple infection, like urethritis, but it could also be something more serious. Given that it’s urethral and inflamed, I really think he needs to see a urologist. I'm not equipped to handle this properly, and frankly, delaying proper diagnosis could lead to complications. I’ll write him a referral. I'll also suggest some over-the-counter pain relief in the meantime. Is he allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Well, that’s just wonderful, isn't it? All this fuss, and you can't even help him. A referral! Honestly. I suppose… yes. He’s allergic to penicillin. Dreadfully allergic. Makes him break out in hives. And he doesn't like taking pills, if that matters. He prefers… herbal remedies, usually. Though I doubt that will help much with… whatever this is.
DOCTOR: Herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Well, yes. He’s a bit… old-fashioned, you see. Believes in the power of nature. Chamomile tea, garlic… things like that. I suppose I could try some warm compresses, but honestly, I doubt it will make much difference. It’s just… upsetting, seeing him like this. He’s usually such a… robust man. And now… this. I just want him to feel better.
DOCTOR: Look, I’m going to write “no known allergies except penicillin” and strongly advise him not to use any herbal remedies without consulting the urologist. Self-treating could make things worse. I'll also recommend he avoid sexual activity until he's been evaluated. Here's the referral. The urologist's office will call to schedule an appointment. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Avoid sexual activity? Oh, good heavens. That will not go down well. Honestly, you're just piling on the unpleasantness now. Well, no, I suppose not. Unless… is there anything I can do? Some sort of cream, perhaps? Or a… a poultice? I know he likes warm baths. Would that help? Honestly, I feel rather helpless. Just… send him to a good urologist, please. A discreet one. That’s very important.
DOCTOR: I'm recommending a standard warm sitz bath for comfort, but nothing else. I will note on the referral “Patient requests a discreet urologist.” Honestly, I’ve done what I can. I’m not a magician. I’m an internal medicine doctor. Have a good day. And please, encourage him to see the urologist as soon as possible. .
PATIENT: Well! That was… less than satisfactory. Honestly, the lack of bedside manner is appalling. But I suppose I shouldn’t complain. He did give me a referral, eventually. Warm sitz baths… That’s something, I suppose. Discreet urologist… I certainly hope so. Honestly, this whole experience has been utterly dreadful.
