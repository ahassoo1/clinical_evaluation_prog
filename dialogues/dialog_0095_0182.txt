DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly? This whole thing is a bit of a bother. My daughter insisted. Says I look “tired.” Tired! I’ve been working with terrazzo for sixty years, young man. Sixty! It’s hard work, and it shows. She wants me to get some…lifting of the face, I think she said. Just want to get it over with so I can tell her I did it and she’ll leave me alone.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good you’re here, even if it’s just to rule things out. While a cosmetic procedure is an option, we should first make sure there isn’t anything else going on causing you to feel…tired, as your daughter says. Just to be thorough. So, besides feeling tired, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? At my age, everything is changing. Bones ache more, that’s for sure. I get winded quicker. But those aren’t recent changes. Those are just…old age. Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t need a list of everything that’s falling apart. I just want to know if I’m healthy enough for this…procedure, or not.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. And I appreciate your directness. But even with a practical outlook, it’s important to have a clear picture of your overall health before any procedure, cosmetic or otherwise. It’s for your safety. You mentioned aches and getting winded quicker… can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's just…getting old. I used to be able to lay tile all day, no problem. Now, I have to take a break every couple of hours. And the aches…they’re in my back, mostly. From years of bending over. I’ve got a good chiropractor, though. Been seeing him for twenty years. He keeps me going. What does this have to do with my face?
DOCTOR: Those aches and getting winded can sometimes be related to other things, Mr. Orwin, and it's good you have a chiropractor. But we need to rule out anything that might affect how well you heal, or even the safety of a procedure. Have you noticed any chest pain or shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Short of breath…well, sometimes when I climb the stairs, I have to pause. But that’s just…stairs. My house is old, they’re steep. I don’t sit around gasping for air, if that’s what you’re asking. This is getting ridiculous. I’m a strong Norwegian man. I don’t just “gasp for air.”
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be complete, have you had any swelling in your ankles or feet lately?
PATIENT: Swelling? No. Look, I wear work boots all day. My feet are always a little swollen at the end of the day. It’s called working. I don't sit around admiring my ankles. Is this a questionnaire or are we actually going to talk about getting this done? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. I assure you, I am trying to gather information to ensure your safety. It's important to rule out anything that could complicate a procedure. One last question, and then we can move on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in appetite? Not really. I eat what my wife used to make, mostly. Though I do a bit less cooking now, to be honest. Weight? Probably lost a few pounds. Hard to say. I don't weigh myself, and I certainly don't spend my time worrying about it. Now, can we please get this over with? I’ve got a good spot to get a pastrami on rye after this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on what you’ve told me, and your age, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. It will only take a few minutes. Then, I can give you my opinion on whether you are a suitable candidate for a cosmetic procedure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. I'm not one for poking and prodding. Just…hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Okay, that’s 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your…frustration level. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing alarming, but we should note that. Lungs are clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing. Have you had any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Asthma? Good heavens, no! I’ve never had any trouble breathing, until now with you listening to it! I used to work in the cold all the time, maybe it’s just that. I’m a Norwegian, we’re built tough. Look, I'm telling you, I’m fine. Don’t go making something out of nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. I understand your concerns. Given the slight murmur and the mild wheezing, and your age, I would like to order a few tests before we proceed. Specifically, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It's standard procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Now you want tests? This is ridiculous! I came in here to get a face lift, not become a science experiment! Look, I don’t have time for this. My daughter will be furious if I don’t get this done soon. She’s already planned the reveal party. Can’t you just…look at my face and tell me if I need a lift? Honestly, doctors these days…
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, but I cannot ethically proceed with a cosmetic procedure without a proper assessment of your overall health. The tests are not about making you a “science experiment,” they are about ensuring your safety. The murmur and wheezing could indicate underlying conditions that could affect your ability to heal, or even put you at risk during the procedure. To be frank, I am concerned enough that I would strongly advise against proceeding with the face lift until we have the results of these tests. Alternatively, I can refer you to a cardiologist and pulmonologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: This is absurd! Absolutely absurd! I’ve lived a long and healthy life, and I don’t need a bunch of tests and referrals! You’re just trying to get more money! I’m telling you, I’m fine! Forget the tests! Forget the referrals! Forget the whole thing! I’m leaving. And tell your office I expect a full refund for this…this waste of my time! .
