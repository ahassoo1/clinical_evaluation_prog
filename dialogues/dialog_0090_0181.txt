DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kur. It is a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… thorough. I like to know what's happening inside, not just how I feel.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is certainly… prudent. Though, honestly, at your age, a lot of what feels is usually a good indicator. Still, we can indulge you. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly. And please, do indulge me. I believe in knowing oneself, and that includes the inner workings. My medical history… well, I’ve been quite fortunate, truthfully. I’ve always been a strong man, worked hard my whole life. Construction, mostly. Lots of lifting, digging… physical labour. I haven’t had any major illnesses, knock on wood. A few broken bones over the years – a wrist here, a rib there – but nothing that didn’t heal properly. I have private insurance, so I always get things checked quickly when needed. My wife, Elena, she insists on it. A very sensible woman.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “fortunate” is… good to hear. Construction work, you say. That explains a few things, perhaps. And you haven't had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no surgeries at all. Not a single one. I’ve always been… reluctant, I suppose you could say. I prefer to let nature take its course, when possible. Elena doesn’t always agree, mind you. She worries, naturally. But I’ve always bounced back, always recovered. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course – tetanus, influenza, things like that. Nothing out of the ordinary. I’m quite regular with my check-ups, though. Blood pressure, cholesterol, the usual.
DOCTOR: And do you recall any significant family medical history?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, family history. A good question. My father… he lived a long life, into his late eighties, but he suffered from high blood pressure towards the end. He wasn’t as diligent about seeing a doctor as I am, unfortunately. My mother, she passed away younger, in her early seventies, from… well, it was a heart condition, I believe. Not a strong heart, always a bit frail. And I have a brother, Ricardo, who lives back in Venezuela. He has diabetes, type two, I believe. He wasn't as careful with his diet as he should have been. Elena’s family… her mother lived to a very good age, very healthy, surprisingly. Her father… a bit of arthritis, but otherwise, quite robust.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. Not a single pill. I pride myself on that, actually. I prefer to stay as natural as possible. I eat a healthy diet – mostly fish and vegetables, Elena is a wonderful cook – and I get plenty of exercise, still do some light work around the house, help my son with projects. I believe in keeping active. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as we don’t get much sun here, but that’s it. Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite good for my age. Perhaps too good, and that’s why I’m here, to make sure everything is as good as it feels.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Truly. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years – exotic fruits in Venezuela, shellfish, nuts… everything. Elena always worries when I try new things, but I’ve always been fine. No rashes, no breathing difficulties, nothing. I've never even had poison ivy! I sometimes joke that I have a stomach of iron. Perhaps that’s why I’m still going strong, you think? It’s certainly been a blessing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your social history, Mr. Mombrun. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My father smoked, unfortunately, and I saw the effect it had on him. A terrible habit. I always avoided it, even as a young man. Elena, thankfully, also despises smoking. It’s never been an issue in our household. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, a good Chilean Merlot, but that’s it. Very moderate consumption, I assure you. I believe in enjoying life, but I also believe in moderation. And that includes things like alcohol.
DOCTOR: And do you have any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Stressors… that’s a good question, Doctor. Well, life has its challenges, naturally. My son, he’s going through a bit of a difficult time with his business, a new venture, and that worries me. I try to offer him support, but one doesn’t like to see a child struggle. And Elena, she’s been a bit… anxious lately, about the political situation back in Venezuela, of course. We have family there, you see. But overall, I would say my life is quite peaceful. I have a loving wife, a good home, and my health, thankfully. I find that staying busy helps to keep stress at bay. Gardening, reading, spending time with my grandchildren… these things keep me grounded. It's not a bad life, Doctor. Not bad at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m quite comfortable with that. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed. I’ve always been a man who welcomes a good check-up. It puts my mind at ease, you see. And Elena would be most displeased if I didn’t cooperate. She's very particular about these things. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could just sit here for me. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything seems alright so far, Mr. Mombrun. A little bit of abdominal weight, but nothing concerning. Do you have any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain at all. Not a twinge. You may press as firmly as you need to. I’ve always been a fairly robust individual, as I mentioned. A bit of weight around the middle, perhaps, but that’s to be expected at my age, wouldn't you agree? I enjoy my food, and Elena is a wonderful cook, as I've said. She takes pride in her cooking, and I wouldn’t dream of depriving her the pleasure of seeing me enjoy her dishes. No, Doctor, no discomfort whatsoever. You’re doing a very thorough job, I must say.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Mombrun. Everything seems within normal limits. Given your age and family history, and the slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend we get a few blood tests done. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid panel. Just to get a baseline and rule out anything concerning. And perhaps an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A thorough investigation is always a good idea. I trust your judgment entirely. Blood tests, an EKG… whatever you deem necessary. I’d rather be safe than sorry, as they say. And it will give Elena peace of mind, which is always a worthwhile pursuit. Perhaps you could explain what exactly each test entails? Just so I have a better understanding of what you’re looking for. I’m a curious man, you see. Always been interested in how things work.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The complete blood count – that checks your red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can tell us if you’re anemic, if you have an infection, or if there are any problems with your blood clotting. The metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, your electrolytes, and your blood sugar. The lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels – LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. That’s important for assessing your risk of heart disease. And the thyroid panel checks your thyroid hormone levels. That can affect your energy levels and your metabolism. The EKG – that records the electrical activity of your heart. It can detect any arrhythmias or other abnormalities. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that explains it quite clearly. Red blood cells, white blood cells… cholesterol, thyroid… and the electrical activity of the heart. It all sounds very… comprehensive, which is exactly what I was hoping for. So, the EKG… is that the one with the sticky pads? I seem to recall my brother Ricardo having something similar done. And the blood tests… will I need to fast beforehand? Elena is quite particular about my meals, and I wouldn't want to upset her routine unnecessarily. She has a very strict schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, the EKG involves placing electrodes – those are the sticky pads – on your chest, arms, and legs. It’s painless. And yes, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood tests. No food or drinks, except for water. It's important for accurate results. I’ll give you a requisition form for both tests. The lab is just down the hall, and they can schedule you for the EKG. We'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. I have a relatively flexible schedule, thankfully. Elena handles most of the arrangements, but I’m sure she can accommodate. So, 8-12 hours of fasting… I suppose I can manage that. It’s not the most pleasant prospect, but it’s a small price to pay for peace of mind. And the sticky pads… I shall brace myself. I trust your lab technicians are gentle. A bit of kindness goes a long way, you know. May I ask what the typical turnaround time for the results is? Elena is quite eager to have them, as you might imagine.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my assistant call you when they’re available. And yes, our lab technicians are quite professional. I assure you. Alright, Mr. Mombrun. I’ll give you the requisition forms and a pamphlet on healthy eating. Fasting, blood tests, EKG… then we'll discuss the results next week. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions, I must say. I appreciate your taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. I shall follow your instructions carefully – the fasting, the blood tests, the sticky pads… and I shall leave the scheduling to Elena, as always. Thank you again, Doctor Kur. I look forward to our follow-up appointment next week. It was a pleasure meeting you. Perhaps you'll have some good news for me then?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Mombrun. We'll see. Have a good day.
