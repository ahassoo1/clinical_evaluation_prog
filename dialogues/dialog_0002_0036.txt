DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Barban is my name. I am here for… the check-up before the insurance starts, yes? Medicare sent me. It is a requirement, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kiwane, a welcome to Medicare check-up – that’s perfectly alright. We do those frequently. So, it’s a general check-up to get everything baseline before your insurance fully kicks in. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to come in today, besides the insurance requirement?
PATIENT: Hmm. Why I decided… That is a strange question. I do not… choose to be sick, Doctor. It is a formality, as I said. Medicare wants this, so I am here. I feel… alright. No complaints, really. Just… tall. Is being tall a problem?
DOCTOR: No, Kiwane, being tall isn’t a problem at all! It’s a perfectly good height to be. I just like to get a full picture of things, sometimes insurance requirements don’t tell the whole story. Alright, so you're feeling generally well, no specific complaints. That's good to hear. Let's just do a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Never. I have… worked hard, always. Food processing is not easy work, you know. Keeps a man strong. I do not… sit around and get things. My father, he was a farmer, very strong man. No sickness in my family, not really. A few… aches, old age things, but nothing serious. Is this necessary, Doctor? It feels like many questions for a simple check-up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kiwane. It does feel like a lot of questions, and I apologize for that. It’s just standard procedure to rule things out and make sure we have a complete picture. It helps me understand what's normal for you, so if something does change in the future, we'll know right away. Okay, so no major medical conditions in you or your family. That’s great. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. I… broke my arm once, when I was a small boy, climbing a tree. But it healed itself, mostly. My mother, she put a wrap on it. No doctor needed. Are you doubting my story, Doctor? It was a very good tree.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all, Kiwane! I absolutely believe you. It sounds like you had a resourceful mother! Sometimes breaks heal well on their own, especially when you're young. I just need to document everything. Okay, no surgeries, a healed arm from your childhood… That’s good. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. My mother, she cooked with many spices. Very strong flavors. No problems. Dust, maybe. Everyone dislikes dust. But not an allergy, truly. Is this room very clean, Doctor? It feels… dusty.
DOCTOR: You have a very adventurous palate, it sounds like! And you're right to notice, we do try to keep things clean, but dust is a persistent enemy. Okay, so no known allergies. That’s good. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I drink water. And… tea, sometimes. My mother's tea, very strong. She grows the herbs herself. It is… for health, not for sickness. Does tea count as medicine, Doctor? It feels… insulting to ask.
DOCTOR: No, Kiwane, tea absolutely does not count as medicine in this case. Your mother sounds like a very wise woman. I just need to be thorough. Okay, no medications. Let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Smoking is foolish. Alcohol… makes a man weak. And… those other things? Unthinkable. I work hard. I do not have time for… distractions. My father would be ashamed. Are you implying something, Doctor? I am a respectable man.
DOCTOR: No, Kiwane, absolutely not. I wasn't implying anything at all. I apologize if my questions came across that way. It's standard procedure to ask about these things, to get a full picture of your health. I appreciate your honesty. Alright. Let's move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… very well. But quickly, please. I have things to do. And please, no unnecessary… touching. I do not like being… prodded. Is this room cold, Doctor? I feel a chill.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kiwane. I completely understand. We’ll keep it quick and respectful. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can tell me to stop at any time. First, I'll just check your height and weight. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then a quick look in your ears, eyes and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Height and weight… very well. I already know my height. I am a tall man. But proceed. Quickly, please. And do not… stare. This room is cold, Doctor. Perhaps a blanket?
DOCTOR: Alright, Kiwane. I promise not to stare. And I’ll see if we can find a blanket for you. Let's start with your height. I just need to confirm it for the record. Okay, your height is 188 centimeters, and your weight is 90 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… 25.5. That’s within a healthy range. Now, if you could just sit on the examination table, please, so I can listen to your heart and lungs. Would you mind taking your shirt off so I can auscultate properly?
PATIENT: Auscultate? What does that mean? And… take my shirt off? In front of you? No. Absolutely not. I do not… understand this process. Is this necessary, Doctor? It feels… inappropriate. I will not be… examined in this manner. This is a respectable clinic, yes? I think I will leave. This is… unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Kiwane, please, sit down. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel that way. "Auscultate" just means listening with a stethoscope - it's a standard part of a physical exam. It’s completely normal, and I assure you, it's done with respect and professionalism. We can absolutely modify the exam to make you more comfortable. We can listen to your heart and lungs through your shirt if you prefer, although it might not be as accurate. We can also skip any part of the exam you're not comfortable with. I want you to feel safe and respected here. What part of the exam specifically makes you feel uncomfortable, and we can adjust from there?
PATIENT: Listening… through the shirt. That is… acceptable. But no other… touching. And no staring. It makes me… uneasy. I do not understand why so many questions and… examinations are needed. It feels like I am being… judged. Is this a requirement of Medicare, Doctor? Is there a form I can see? I want to understand the purpose of all this… intrusion.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kiwane. We can definitely listen through your shirt. No problem at all. And I assure you, I'm not judging you in any way. I'm simply trying to get a baseline of your health. And yes, this is part of the Welcome to Medicare physical exam. It’s designed to catch any potential problems early, and to make sure you’re healthy. I can show you the form outlining the requirements, absolutely. Here you go. Now, if you’re comfortable, let's listen to your heart and lungs through your shirt. You can breathe normally. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can I quickly take your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… very well. Quickly, please. And do not… squeeze too tightly. My arms are strong, you know. This is all very… disruptive. I had planned to be home by now, preparing my tea. Is this done soon, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Kiwane. And yes, we're getting close to the end. Blood pressure is 130/80. That’s slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. We can monitor it at future visits. Now, just a quick look in your ears and eyes, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: In my ears? And my eyes? No. Absolutely not. I do not… like things near my face. It is… invasive. I am a respectable man, Doctor. I do not need my ears and eyes… examined. This is enough. I will not continue. You have my height, my weight, my blood pressure. That is sufficient. I think I will leave now. This is… unacceptable. And frankly, rather insulting. I do not appreciate being… prodded and poked. .
DOCTOR: Kiwane, please, sit down. I understand your discomfort, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel that way. It seems like we’re not going to be able to complete the full exam today, and that's alright. We can document what we have been able to assess - your height, weight, blood pressure. I can also provide you with some resources on managing your blood pressure, as it was slightly elevated. Would you like that?
