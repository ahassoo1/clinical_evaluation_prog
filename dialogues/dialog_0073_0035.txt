DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, it feels like forever, honestly. Not constantly, but they just keep coming back. It’s a bit of a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, alright. And how long have these been… recurring, as you say?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started properly about three weeks ago, I’d say. Before that, just the odd one here and there, like after a big drink of water. But these last three weeks, they just won’t quit. Sometimes they’ll come every few minutes for a good hour, then nothing for a day… it’s very unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Three weeks of recurrent hiccups… unpredictable pattern. And have you noticed anything specifically that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I can tell. I've tried thinking back, you know? Eating too fast doesn’t seem to do it, getting excited doesn't… Sometimes they just start for no reason at all. Although… I did have a bit of a fright a couple of weeks back – a big dog barked right in my ear! Maybe that started it all? But honestly, I couldn’t say for sure.
DOCTOR: A fright, yes… well, sometimes these things happen. Have you tried any home remedies, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! All sorts! My daughter, bless her heart, told me to hold my breath, you know? And drink water upside down. And a spoonful of sugar. And… oh, there was one with vinegar! The vinegar was not pleasant. None of them’s really worked for very long, though. Just a temporary little stop, then they're back again. It's frustrating!
DOCTOR: Holding breath, water, sugar, vinegar… right. And besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. No pain, no trouble breathing, no… anything else unusual. Just the hiccups! It’s just… annoying, you know? And a little tiring, constantly jumping. It doesn't hurt, thankfully. I just want them to stop. I feel a bit silly coming to the doctor for hiccups, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sucich, it’s always best to get these things checked out. Especially at your age. Let's just do a quick examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds sensible. I suppose it's good to be sure. I haven’t been feeling ill, exactly, but you never know, do you? Just… hiccups! Whatever it is, I trust your judgement, Doctor. What would you like me to do first?
DOCTOR: If you'll just lie down on the table for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a feel of your abdomen. Nothing to worry about, just a routine check.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go… It’s been a while since I was on one of these! Let me know if I need to do anything special. And… please don't mind my rambling, Doctor. I do tend to chat when I'm nervous!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness… though a little distention. Are you experiencing any bloating or constipation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been a bit… backed up, if you don't mind me saying so. And I do feel a bit bloated sometimes, especially in the evenings. I thought it was just… old age! I haven't really said anything about it to anyone, though. Is that connected to the hiccups, do you think?
DOCTOR: It could be. Constipation and bloating can sometimes contribute to these things. Now, have you had any recent changes in your diet or medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diet… not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Fish, vegetables, a little bit of fruit… My daughter keeps trying to get me to eat more fiber, but I’m not a huge fan, to be honest. As for medication… Let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, just a small dose. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when it’s bad, but that’s not every day. Nothing new, though. Definitely nothing new.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication… occasional arthritis medication… Alright. Now, I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are… diminished. Ms. Sucich, it's possible these hiccups are related to some gastrointestinal upset. We can try a couple of things. First, I'm going to recommend a mild stool softener, to see if that helps with the constipation. If that doesn’t improve things within a week, we might need to consider some imaging to rule out any other underlying issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. A stool softener, yes. I’d be happy to try that. I'd rather not have any… imaging, if we can avoid it. I’m not a huge fan of hospitals, you see. So, if the stool softener works, that would be wonderful. What kind do you recommend? And… is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps eating differently?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll prescribe you docusate sodium, 100mg twice daily. It’s a gentle one. As for diet, try to increase your fluid intake – water is best. And attempt to incorporate a little more fiber, even if it’s just a small portion of fruit or vegetables each day. Don’t overdo it, though, as that can cause bloating. Now, if the hiccups persist for longer than two weeks despite the stool softener, or if you develop any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, you need to come back immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I understand perfectly. Docusate sodium, twice a day. More water. Try a little more fiber, gently. And come back if it gets worse or doesn’t improve after two weeks. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I feel much better already, just knowing what might be causing it. Thank you. Do I need to make an appointment for a follow-up, or should I just call if I’m still hiccuping?
DOCTOR: No need for a scheduled follow-up, Ms. Sucich. Just call the office if you’re still experiencing problems after two weeks on the stool softener. We’ll see what needs to be done then. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your help. You've put my mind at ease. I appreciate it very much. I think I’ll just get going now, then. Have a lovely day!
DOCTOR: Very well. You have a good day as well, Ms. Sucich. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Goodbye.
