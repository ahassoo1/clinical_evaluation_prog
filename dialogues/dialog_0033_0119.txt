DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Wartick, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Jinnie Wartick. Though, really, just Jinnie is fine. And I must say, this waiting room… rather drafty, don't you think? It's a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Yes, well. Let's focus on why you're here today, Jinnie. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… delicate. And frankly, a bit embarrassing to discuss. It’s my… a friend of mine. He's been having some… discharge. A rather unpleasant issue, really. I came because someone needs to know what’s going on. He's too proud to come himself, you see. A very stubborn man.
DOCTOR: Right. A… friend. And this friend is experiencing discharge. Okay. Let's try to be a little more specific. Could you describe the discharge?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Specifics. Well… it’s not… clear. It's… yellowish, I suppose. And a bit… thick. Not a large amount, thankfully, but… noticeable. And there’s… an odor. Not a pleasant odor, I assure you. Honestly, it’s quite concerning. He’s been trying to… manage it himself, but it doesn’t seem to be getting any better. I thought a proper doctor would know what to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Yellowish, thick discharge with an odor. And this has been going on for… how long precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… He's not one for keeping track of these things, you see. But I’d say… at least a week. Maybe longer. It started gradually, just a little bit. Then it got… more pronounced. He did mention it felt… uncomfortable. Though he wouldn't elaborate, naturally. Men and their pride, honestly! It’s just… worrying. He’s a good man, and I don't want him suffering needlessly.
DOCTOR: A week or longer. Uncomfortable. And has he noticed any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. He didn't say pain, exactly. He did mention a sort of… burning sensation, when he… uses the facilities. Just a little bit, he claims. He's not very forthcoming, as I've said. He tends to downplay things. He’s a bit embarrassed, you see. And I’m not privy to all the details, naturally. It's… awkward, asking. I just know it’s concerning enough to bring me all the way out here.
DOCTOR: Right. Burning sensation with urination. And has he had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no fever, chills… not that I’m aware of. He hasn’t mentioned anything like that. And abdominal pain… I suppose not. He does have a bit of a… delicate constitution, prone to indigestion, but I wouldn't say it’s anything unusual. He hasn't specifically complained of abdominal pain, no. He's mostly just… bothered. And worried, I think, though he’d never admit it. Really, it’s just this… discharge. It's the discharge that's the problem, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And to be absolutely clear, this is a male friend experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, of course it’s a male friend! What did you think? Honestly, the questions! It’s rather… presumptuous to even ask. He’s a perfectly respectable man, and I'm concerned about his health. It’s a bit insulting to imply otherwise, don’t you think? Really, I came here for help, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Apologies. Just clarifying. It’s important to get all the details correct. And has he had any recent sexual contact?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens! That is a most inappropriate question! Really, Doctor, I’m quite shocked! I hardly think his… private life is relevant. And I certainly don’t come to a doctor’s office to discuss such things. It’s… unseemly. I came because of a medical issue, not to air his dirty laundry! I thought you were a professional! Honestly, this is becoming quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand your discomfort. However, for accurate medical assessment, it is relevant. If you are unable to provide this information, I'm afraid I can only offer limited assistance. I’m obligated to ask these questions. I can refer you to another physician if you prefer.
PATIENT: Oh, honestly! You’re making me feel quite foolish now. Fine. Yes, he… he has been seeing someone. A… a widow from the village. Mrs. Gable. But I fail to see what that has to do with a simple discharge! It's just… ridiculous. And frankly, I don't appreciate being put in this position. I came here hoping for help, not a lecture on… morals. It's a medical issue, not a social scandal! Honestly, I’m starting to regret coming at all.
DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Gable. And has he had any prior sexually transmitted infections, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That is enough! I will not answer any more of these… impertinent questions! I came here seeking help for a friend, not to be subjected to a personal investigation! This is completely unprofessional, and frankly, quite rude. I think I’ll take my friend to another doctor, one who shows a little more… discretion. Good day!
DOCTOR: Very well. .
