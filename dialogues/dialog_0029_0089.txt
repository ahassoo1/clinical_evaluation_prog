DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my stomach, really. Lower part. It’s been hurting quite a bit, on and off. It’s difficult to explain… it just aches. I do seem to recall something about… a condition? I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be. Something the other doctors mentioned.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches in the lower part of your stomach. That's a good place to start. And you mentioned something about a condition other doctors have discussed with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It… it had something to do with my system, I believe. A… a long name. Something about… lupus? Is that right? It’s terribly embarrassing, but I simply can’t pull it to mind. They said it could cause… well, all sorts of things, I suppose. I’ve been under a doctor’s care for it for some time now, but this pain feels… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, lupus is definitely something we should consider, given your history. And you're right to bring up that this pain feels different than what you've experienced before. That's important information. Just to clarify, when did this different pain start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a good question. Let me think… it feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It came on gradually, not all at once. It wasn’t terribly bad at first, just a little discomfort. But it's been getting worse, steadily. I honestly couldn’t say exactly when it started, Doctor. My days… they tend to blend together, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Glymph. It's alright if you can't pinpoint an exact date. A few weeks, gradually worsening… that gives us something to work with. Now, can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well… it’s a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, thankfully. It’s… constant, really, but it flares up at times. Like a tightening, almost. And… sometimes it radiates, I think that’s the word? It goes to my back a little, and occasionally down my legs. It's… unpleasant. I find myself just trying to sit very still, which doesn't always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache, constant with flares, radiating to your back and legs… That’s helpful. And does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. I haven’t noticed anything specific, Doctor. Eating doesn’t seem to make it worse, nor does lying down. Perhaps… when I’m stressed? Though, with my age, I believe I’m always a little stressed. It’s difficult to say for certain. I suppose movement sometimes aggravates it, but then again, not moving does as well. It's rather… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like it's a difficult pain to manage. Let's talk about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your stool lately?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That’s… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. I have. It’s been… looser, I suppose. More frequent as well. And… darker. Not alarmingly so, but definitely a change from my usual. I hadn't thought to mention it, frankly, but you asked. It's been happening alongside the pain, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser, more frequent, darker stools… That's important information, thank you for sharing. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool at all?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, not that I’ve seen. I… I always check, you know, just to be sure. And no, thankfully, there hasn’t been any blood. That would be… quite concerning. It’s just the color, a bit… off. A very dark brown. Not black, mind you, but… darker than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, darker brown stools, no visible blood. Now, let’s briefly touch on other systems. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. I do get a bit warm sometimes, but I attribute that to the weather, or perhaps just my age. And no chills, thankfully. As for weight loss… that’s possible, I suppose. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. My appetite hasn’t been very good lately, but I haven’t made a conscious effort to monitor my weight. I… I simply haven’t been feeling myself, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chills, possible unintentional weight loss with decreased appetite. Now, let’s talk about your medications. What medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another long list, I’m afraid. Let me see… I take Plaquenil, for the lupus, of course. And… a low dose of methotrexate as well. For the joints, you see. And… oh, and a vitamin D supplement. The doctor said my levels were low. And… occasionally, ibuprofen for the pain, but I try to avoid that if possible. I… do I need to list everything? It's rather a lot to remember, even with the bottles in front of me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Plaquenil, methotrexate, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. That's a good start. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. No known allergies to medications, food, or anything else, as far as I’m aware. I do have… a slight sensitivity to strong perfumes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Just a little… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Ms. Glymph, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check your reflexes. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. I do hope it won’t be too… unpleasant. My joints aren’t what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, I'm just listening and feeling your abdomen. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s… a little tender, right there. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It’s the same area where I’ve been feeling the ache, generally. And… perhaps a little bit here as well. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower left and lower center abdomen. I’m also noting some mild guarding – that’s when your muscles tense up when I press. No rebound tenderness at this time. And I don't feel any masses. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they're a bit diminished, a little quieter than usual. Overall, the exam reveals mild tenderness and diminished bowel sounds.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Diminished bowel sounds… what does that mean, exactly? Is it serious? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I simply… worry, you see. And I don’t understand all the medical terms.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Glymph, that's what I'm here for. Diminished bowel sounds can indicate a few things – it could be a temporary slowdown, or it could suggest something is obstructing the normal flow through your intestines. It's not necessarily serious immediately, but it does warrant further investigation. Given your history of lupus and methotrexate use, along with the tenderness, darker stools, and diminished bowel sounds, I'd like to order some tests. Would you be agreeable to a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for blood and infection?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test… yes, please. I trust your judgment completely. I’d like to get to the bottom of this, if possible. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any particular foods I should avoid? Or anything else?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We'll get those tests ordered right away. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce. Avoid anything spicy, fatty, or high in fiber. Stay well hydrated – drink plenty of water. And, importantly, if you notice any significant worsening of your pain, any fever, or any bright red blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'm also going to write you a prescription for an anti-spasmodic medication to help ease the abdominal cramping. It's not a cure, but it might provide some relief while we wait for the test results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… very thoughtful. Bland diet, stay hydrated, watch for worsening symptoms, and an anti-spasmodic medication… yes, please. Thank you. I do appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience. It’s… reassuring to know someone is taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I understand your concerns, and I'm here to help. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and give you instructions for the stool test. The lab results should be back in a few days, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m going to write a work note excusing you from work for three days. Let’s get you those prescriptions and the lab orders, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is everything. A work note is very kind of you. You’ve been wonderfully helpful and considerate. I truly appreciate your time and attention. Thank you again. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll see you in a few days, then?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll see you in a few days to discuss the results. In the meantime, take it easy, stay hydrated, and don't hesitate to call if anything changes. The nurse will be in shortly. Take care. .
PATIENT: .
