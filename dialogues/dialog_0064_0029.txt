DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this…feeling full real quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a big meal. It’s been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Alright, a feeling of fullness quickly, even with small amounts of food. And you say this has been going on for a "little while"... can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just noticed it now and then. But it’s gotten worse lately, that’s for sure. Like, I used to enjoy a nice plate of salmon with my wife, but now… I can barely get through half of it. It’s a shame, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating, especially when it impacts something you enjoy. So, three to four months, gradually worsening. And it’s happening regardless of what you eat – salmon, soup, anything?
PATIENT: Pretty much anything, yeah. Doesn’t seem to matter. Toast, fish, stew… even a little bit of bannock, which I used to love. It just… fills me up too fast. Makes it hard to keep my strength up, you know? I'm not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this early fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really… I’ve been a little tired, maybe? But I figure that’s just gettin’ old. No pain or anything like that. Sometimes a bit of… well, just a little bit of heartburn, but I get that now and then anyway, especially if I eat somethin’ rich. Nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and occasional heartburn. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. No sickness, no…trouble with that end, no. Everything's pretty regular, if you know what I mean. Just tired and full too quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. My wife does most of the cookin’ and worryin’ about things like that, so I’m not sure. I feel a bit lighter, maybe? But I haven’t stepped on the scales in a while. She might know. We used to weigh in every couple of weeks, but… well, we’ve gotten a bit lax lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. We'll ask your wife about that. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was ages ago. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothin’ like that. I used to be pretty healthy, active… did a lot of fishin’ and huntin’ when I was younger. Just…old age creepin’ in, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal as a child, otherwise generally healthy. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t take nothin’ regularly. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. My grandmother always said they were more trouble than they were worth.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much anything put in front of me, as long as it tastes good.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of any medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother lived to be a good age, but I don’t remember her havin’ much trouble. My father…he had a bit of trouble with his heart in his later years, I think. And my sister, she had some trouble with her digestion, but that was a long time ago. Not much else comes to mind, really. We weren't big on talkin’ about sickness in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright, some heart trouble in your father, digestive issues in your sister. Okay. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it! She always said it was a terrible habit. And I tend to agree with her.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little glass of wine with dinner now and then. Just a small one, though. Nothing heavy. It helps me relax. Used to have a bit more with my friends when I was younger, but I’ve slowed down a lot these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine with dinner. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve asked me everything, I reckon. Just hopin’ you can figure out what’s goin’ on with this full feeling. It’s just…wearin’ me down a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Let’s do a quick exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then feel your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table, if you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. Take your time, Doctor. No rush.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds good so far. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Do you experience any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’. Just feels… normal, I guess. A little pressure, but no pain. It feels the same all over, really. Maybe a little gurgly, but I always have a bit of a rumble in my tummy.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little gurgling is normal. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Now, given your symptoms and the exam findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. This early fullness could be caused by a variety of things. It could be something as simple as slowed gastric emptying, or it could be something a little more complex.
PATIENT: Slowed…what now? Gastric… You're losin’ me, Doctor. Just tell me straight, what are you thinkin’? Is it somethin’ serious? Is it my age catchin’ up to me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr, let me explain. "Gastric emptying" just means how quickly food moves from your stomach to your intestines. If that process slows down, it can make you feel full quickly. It’s not necessarily serious, and it could be related to age, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To do that, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a complete blood count to check for anemia or infection. And then, I think a stool test to rule out any digestive issues. And, given your history, and to be thorough, I’d also like to schedule an upper endoscopy. This is a procedure where we use a small camera to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It will help us to rule out any blockages or inflammation. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A camera… inside me? Sounds… unpleasant. I don’t like the sound of that endoscopy, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary… What are the risks? And what if… what if it is somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Obarr. Endoscopies are generally very safe procedures, but there are some risks, as with any medical procedure. The most common risks are mild discomfort, bloating, and sore throat. Very rarely, there can be bleeding or perforation, but those complications are extremely uncommon. We have a skilled team and take every precaution to minimize those risks. Regarding what if it is something serious... the endoscopy will allow us to identify the cause and create a treatment plan. It could be something treatable, like an ulcer or inflammation. Or, in rarer cases, it could be something more serious, but knowing what we’re dealing with is the first step to getting you the right care. We will discuss the results with you in detail and explain all of your options. We can start with the blood count and stool test first, if that makes you more comfortable. We don’t have to schedule the endoscopy right away. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Yeah… start with the blood work and… the stool stuff. That sounds… less scary. We can hold off on the camera for now. And… thank you, Doctor. For explainin’ everything so clearly. It helps to know what's goin' on, even if it's not good news. Now, how do I go about gettin' those tests done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work and stool test. You can take it to the lab at the clinic – it’s just down the hall. They’ll take a sample and send the results to me. The stool test will require a sample – they’ll give you instructions at the lab on how to collect it properly. It might be a little unpleasant, but it's important. Once the results come back – usually within a week – my nurse, Sarah, will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. We’ll discuss the results and decide what the next steps are. In the meantime, try to eat smaller, more frequent meals. And if you’re experiencing any new or worsening symptoms – like nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain – please call us right away. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Smaller meals… I can try that. Thank you again, Doctor Smetak. You've put my mind at ease a little. I guess I’ll head down to the lab then. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. You take care of yourself. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Sarah and I are here to help. It was nice meeting you. .
