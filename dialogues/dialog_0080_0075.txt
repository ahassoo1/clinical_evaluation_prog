DOCTOR: Hi Moshe, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor. Please, call me Moshe. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, you see. It’s… bothersome. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – a CPAP, I think they call it – for a while now, and it should be helping, but I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s just… wearing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe, daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP… that is bothersome, and we definitely want to figure that out. Just to clarify, how long have you been using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… almost two years now, I believe. The doctor at the time – Dr. Feldman, lovely man – he said I had sleep apnea. He fitted me with the machine and everything. It helped at first, really. I used to snore something awful, my ex-wife used to complain endlessly, bless her heart. But lately… well, the tiredness has crept back in. It’s not as bad as before the machine, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Alright, two years on CPAP with a return of some daytime sleepiness… good to know. And you said it helped significantly at first. Has anything changed since then – your weight, your sleeping position, any new medications, or even just changes in your daily routine?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me see… my weight, well, it’s maybe gone up a few pounds. Nothing drastic, mind you, just a bit. I enjoy my food, you see. Sleeping position… no, not really. I still sleep on my side, mostly. As for medications… I take a little something for my arthritis, but that’s been the same for years. Daily routine… well, I retired a few years back, so I have more time to myself now. I spend a lot of time reading, and I volunteer at the local library a couple of times a week. Nothing too strenuous, though. Honestly, I can’t think of anything major that’s changed. It just… gradually came back.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual return of sleepiness despite consistent CPAP use, with a slight weight gain as the only notable change. That gives us a little something to work with. Before we delve deeper, could you describe what this tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Ah, that's a good question. It’s not like being… exhausted, not exactly. It’s more… a constant dragging feeling. Like I'm wading through mud all day. It makes it hard to concentrate, you see. I used to love reading history, but now I find myself rereading the same pages without absorbing anything. And I get these little… dips in energy throughout the day. I’ll be perfectly fine, and then suddenly, I just feel… foggy. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s enough to be annoying, and sometimes, it’s a bit frightening, to be honest. It’s like… a little wave of sleepiness that washes over me. And it makes me a bit… irritable, I suppose. Not with anyone in particular, just… generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant dragging feeling, difficulty concentrating, intermittent “waves” of sleepiness and irritability… that sounds frustrating, Moshe. To get a better picture, let's do a quick review of your medical history. Do you mind if I ask about any other health problems you have, past or present?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. Ask away. I've got a bit of arthritis, mostly in my hands and knees. It’s not crippling, just a bit achy, especially in the cold weather. I had my gallbladder removed years ago, back in the ‘90s, but that hasn’t bothered me since. Oh, and I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back – some irregular heartbeat thing – but the cardiologist said it was nothing to worry about, just age, he said. I’ve been taking a low dose of something for my blood pressure, too, for a few years now, but it’s usually well-controlled. Other than that… I think that's about it, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, gallbladder removal, past cardiac arrhythmia, and controlled hypertension… thank you for that, Moshe. And you said the cardiac arrhythmia was years ago, and resolved?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It was about… oh, eight years ago, I believe. I went to the cardiologist, he did some tests, said it was a benign arrhythmia, and told me to just keep an eye on it. It hasn't bothered me since, thankfully. He did mention something about my age being a factor, something about the heart naturally changing as you get older. He didn't seem too concerned, and I haven't had any symptoms since, so I haven’t worried about it.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh yes, there's the arthritis medication, naproxen, I believe it's called. I take one tablet twice a day. And… that's about it, really. I also take a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication, is it? Just something to keep me going. I try to eat a healthy diet, but sometimes, a little extra help doesn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright, naproxen twice daily for arthritis and a multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about bee stings when I was younger, but I haven't been stung in years. And I eat pretty much everything, although I try to avoid too much sugar these days. My doctor keeps telling me to watch my weight, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask a few questions about your sleep habits specifically. Aside from the CPAP, what time do you typically go to bed and wake up?
PATIENT: Usually, I try to be in bed by 10:30, 11:00 at the latest. I don’t sleep particularly well before I put on the machine, you see. I toss and turn a bit. But once I have the mask on, I usually fall asleep pretty quickly. As for waking up… it varies. Sometimes I wake up naturally around 6:30, 7:00. Other times, I need to set an alarm. I try not to sleep too late, though. I like to get up and have a proper breakfast.
DOCTOR: Alright, bedtime around 10:30-11:00, using CPAP to fall asleep, wake up around 6:30-7:00. Now, do you feel rested when you wake up, after using the CPAP?
PATIENT: That’s a… complicated question, Doctor. When I first started using it, yes, absolutely. I felt like a new man. I had energy, I was able to concentrate, and I didn't feel the need to nap all the time. But lately… not so much. I wake up feeling… not exactly tired, but not refreshed either. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… I’ve had a night of sleep, but not necessarily a restful night. If that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Moshe. It sounds like the CPAP is helping you sleep, but not necessarily providing the restorative quality of sleep you need. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just take a quick look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you see. Spent a good chunk of my life in hospitals and doctor’s offices, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Throat appears clear, no significant redness or swelling. Okay, Moshe. Everything sounds and looks relatively normal so far. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning given your age. Now, do you happen to know what your AHI was when you were initially diagnosed with sleep apnea?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question, Doctor. I remember Dr. Feldman telling me it was quite high, something about needing the machine urgently. But honestly, I don't remember the actual number. It was… a long time ago, and I wasn’t really paying attention to the details, if I’m being truthful. I just trusted his judgment. He said I was stopping breathing dozens of times an hour, something like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, high AHI requiring immediate CPAP therapy, but no specific number recalled. Considering your continued daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, and the fact that it was quite some time ago since your initial diagnosis, I think it would be a good idea to repeat your sleep study. AHIs can change over time, and it's possible yours has increased, or that you may be experiencing a different type of sleep disturbance altogether. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. If the machine isn’t working as well as it used to, it makes sense to check. I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get this sorted out, honestly. I just want to feel like myself again. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What would be involved?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Moshe. A repeat sleep study would involve spending a night in a sleep lab, where they’ll monitor your brain waves, heart rate, breathing, and oxygen levels while you sleep. It’s a painless procedure, and a technician will be there to assist you. It's usually covered by Medicare, but we'll verify your coverage beforehand. If the study shows a significant change in your AHI, or if it reveals another underlying sleep issue, we can discuss the next steps, which might involve adjusting your CPAP settings, trying a different type of mask, or exploring other treatment options. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable, Doctor. A night in a lab, nothing too scary. And it’s good to know Medicare should cover it. Adjusting the settings or a different mask… that makes sense. I’ve been using the same one for years, perhaps it’s time for an upgrade. Yes, let’s go ahead and schedule the study. When would be a good time?
DOCTOR: Great. We have openings next week on Tuesday and Thursday evening. Would either of those work for you, Moshe?
PATIENT: Tuesday evening would be perfect, Doctor. I have a volunteer shift at the library on Thursdays. Yes, Tuesday works very well. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tuesday evening it is. I'm going to have my nurse schedule you for a sleep study at the Valley Sleep Center. She will also call to verify your insurance coverage and provide you with detailed instructions on how to prepare for the study. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I feel much better knowing we're taking this seriously. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. Thank you again.
