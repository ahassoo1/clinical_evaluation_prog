DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It just… aches. I don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. My daughter, May, she told me I should come. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s often hard to pinpoint when things started. So, you're experiencing pain when you take a deep breath… an ache, you said. And your daughter, May, encouraged you to come in – good on her for looking out for you. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: More… how so? It's just… in my chest, I guess. Not a sharp pain, like when I fell off the ladder last year – that was bad! This is… dull. It feels like… old. Like it's been there a long time, even though I can't remember it being there. Does that make sense? I get tired easily too, but I don't know if that's related.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ruocco. Dull, in your chest, feels “old”… and you're getting tired more easily. Okay. And just to be clear, this pain isn't related to the fall you had last year?
PATIENT: No, no. That fall was my ribs, I think. They told me at the hospital. This is… different. It's not when I move, or if someone touches me. It's just… when I try to take a big breath. Like I can’t fill my lungs all the way. It’s a little scary, to be honest. I just want to get this sorted so I can get back to helping May with the garden. She’s got a bad back, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re letting me know what's concerning you. So, it's definitely connected to breathing, not movement or touch. And it's making you feel a little anxious, which is completely understandable. Okay, let’s try to get a better picture of things. Have you noticed if anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Worse… Hmm. I mostly just sit around now. Used to do a lot of building, you know? Construction. But now… not so much. When I walk upstairs, it gets a little harder, and the pain feels… heavier. But honestly, everything feels heavier these days. I don’t think anything makes it worse, exactly. It's just… always there, a little bit. I mostly just ignore it, but it's been bothering me more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be somewhat related to exertion, like walking upstairs, and it's been gradually worsening. You’re right to mention that, even if it feels subtle. Now, I’m going to ask you some general health questions, just to get a fuller picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, boy… Let me think. I… I had something when I was younger, a long time ago. Something with my lungs, I think. But I was in Laos then, and the doctors weren’t… the best. I don't really remember the name of it. They gave me some pills, and it went away. As for heart problems… no, I don’t think so. I used to be very strong, you know. Built houses, climbed all over them. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. I mostly just try to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. Something with your lungs when you were younger, treated in Laos, and no known heart problems. And you haven't been to a doctor recently. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Do you have any family history of heart disease, lung problems, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Family… That's a tough one. My… my wife, she passed away a long time ago. Lung trouble, I think. But she smoked, you know? Lots of cigarettes. My brothers and sisters… I haven’t seen them in a very long time. We came to this country separately. I don’t really know much about their health. They probably have the usual aches and pains, like everyone else. Sorry, I'm not very helpful. I don’t remember much about any of that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s very common to not have detailed family medical history, especially given your circumstances. Your wife had lung trouble, potentially related to smoking, and limited information about your siblings. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat whatever May cooks – she’s a good cook! I don’t take any pills regularly, except for what she gives me for my knees sometimes. They don’t really help much, though. Honestly, I just try to avoid anything that might bother me. I’m getting old, you know? Things just… stop working. I just want to get this chest pain sorted, if that’s possible. Can we do that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Ruocco, we can certainly try to get this sorted. And it's good to know you don’t have any known allergies and are only taking something for your knees occasionally. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds… sensible. Just… be gentle, alright? My chest is a little tender. And don't take too long, if you don't mind. May is waiting outside, and I don’t want to keep her waiting all day. She worries too much, you know. But… yeah, go ahead. Just be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco, just breathe normally, in and out. Okay. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds in both lower lobes. That means there's a little less air moving through those areas than expected. I also noticed a slight wheeze, which suggests some narrowing of the airways. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little on the low side, but not critically low. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not a strong murmur, but we should investigate it further. Palpating your chest, I do feel some tenderness as you mentioned. No obvious masses or abnormalities. Now, I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. The X-ray will help us see what’s going on in your lungs, and the EKG will check your heart’s electrical activity. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: X-ray and… EKG? Sounds… serious. What are you looking for, exactly? And will it hurt? I don’t like hospitals much, you know? Too many bad memories. Will it take long? I just want to know… am I gonna be alright? My daughter… she's the only family I got left. I don’t want to worry her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. It's natural to be anxious when we're facing medical tests, especially given your past experiences. The X-ray and EKG are just ways for us to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your chest. The X-ray won't hurt at all – you'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The EKG involves placing some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn't hurt either, just a little cool feeling. It takes only a few minutes to do both tests. We're looking for anything that might explain your pain, like pneumonia, fluid in your lungs, or problems with your heart. The diminished breath sounds and slight wheeze I heard suggest some blockage or inflammation in your airways. The murmur requires further investigation to rule out any structural heart issues. It's too early to say definitively whether everything is alright, but these tests will give us more information so we can make the best plan for your health. I promise we'll take it one step at a time, and I'll explain everything clearly along the way. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and a picture. That doesn't sound too bad, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take all day. And you'll explain everything to me? I don't understand much of what doctors say, usually. Too many big words. Just… tell me what it means, alright? And… if it's bad, you’ll tell me straight, won’t you? I don’t want any surprises. May worries enough as it is. Alright, let's get it over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Yes, I promise to explain everything in plain language, no big words, and I’ll be straightforward with you about the results. We’ll take it one step at a time, and you're not alone in this. Okay, great. The technician is just down the hall, in room 3. I’ll have the nurse escort you. Once they’re finished, I'll review the results with you as soon as they're available. Do you have any questions before we head down there?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just get it done, and tell me what it means. And… thank you, Doctor. You seem… kind. Most doctors just rush you through, don’t listen. Alright, let's go. May is probably worried sick already. Just… hurry, if you can.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Ruocco. We'll do our best to be as quick and efficient as possible. And you're very welcome. I understand your concerns, and I want you to know I’m here to listen and provide the best care I can. Let's head down to room 3. The nurse is expecting us.
