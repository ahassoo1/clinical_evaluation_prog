DOCTOR: Right. Well, Velda Squiers, 45 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’m hoping you can help me with a wee bit of paperwork. I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and they require some medical information before I can confirm my booking. Just a standard thing, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Of course. It’s always paperwork. And cruises… Honestly, people. Alright. So, you want me to fill out some forms for your cruise line. Just to confirm you're generally… functional enough to travel, is that it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, Doctor. Functional is a good word for it! It’s mostly just confirming I don’t have anything… serious, I suppose. Things like that. I’m a fairly healthy woman, all things considered, but they need a doctor's signature, and I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a good while, now that I think about it. My husband, God rest his soul, always handled these things.
DOCTOR: A “good while,” you say. Right. Well, we’ll need to get a proper history then, won’t we?
PATIENT: Indeed, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Where shall we begin? Perhaps with what ails me currently? Though, truthfully, there’s not much. Just a bit of achiness in my joints on damp days, but that’s hardly a new thing. It runs in the family, you see. Scottish weather, and all.
DOCTOR: “A bit of achiness.” Right. And where exactly is this achiness?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees, Doctor. And sometimes my wrists. It’s not crippling, mind you. I can still manage my work just fine. I’m a merchandise displayer – window trimming, mostly. Lots of standing and reaching, but nothing I can't handle. It just… feels a bit stiff on particularly grey mornings. Or after a good rain. It's the damp, you see. It gets right into your bones.
DOCTOR: “Gets into your bones.” Right. So, it’s worse with the weather. And how long has this been going on, this… weather-related achiness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time, Doctor. Since I was a girl, I think. My grandmother had it, and her mother before her. It’s just… always been there, really. It flares up and eases off. Never anything severe enough to trouble a doctor, until now, when this cruise line requires all this paperwork. It’s a bit frustrating, honestly. But I understand they must have their reasons.
DOCTOR: Right. So, decades of “a bit of achiness” that you’ve never bothered to have checked out. And you expect me to just sign off on this form?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! I didn’t mean to imply that, Doctor! I just… well, we didn’t bother doctors much in my family. It was always a bit of a last resort. I’m perfectly happy to let you examine me, of course. Whatever you need. I understand you need to be thorough, and I respect that. It’s just… I’m quite fit, truly. I walk everywhere, I eat reasonably well, and I haven’t been seriously ill in years. Perhaps a quick check of my blood pressure, and a listen to my heart? I’m sure everything is perfectly normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this over with. Blood pressure first, then we’ll listen. But don’t expect me to just rubber-stamp this form based on you saying you "walk everywhere." Step up here, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me. It’s good to be sure, even if it is just a bit of paperwork for a cruise. It's a lovely cruise, you know. Mediterranean. I’ve always wanted to go.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Not ideal. And a bit elevated for someone claiming to be so “fit.” Now, let's listen to your heart. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again…
PATIENT: There you are, Doctor. Is everything alright? It always feels a bit strange having someone listen to my chest. My husband used to say my heart beat very strongly. A good, solid beat, he'd say. Though, he wasn't a doctor, of course. He was a carpenter. Very practical man.
DOCTOR: There’s a slight murmur. Nothing alarming, but we’ll need to document it. And I’m hearing some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Have you had any cough, shortness of breath, or chest pain recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A murmur, you say? I haven’t noticed anything, Doctor. No cough, no shortness of breath, and certainly no chest pain. Perhaps it’s just the damp air? We’ve had a particularly wet summer, you know. Everything feels a bit… congested. As for crackles… well, I’m not entirely sure what that means, to be honest. Do you think it’s serious? I really was hoping this wouldn’t be too much trouble. The cruise departs on the 15th, you see.
DOCTOR: “Not much trouble.” Right. Well, crackles in the lungs aren’t normal, and a murmur requires further investigation. We're going to need to get a chest X-ray. And I want a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. It's standard procedure. I need to rule out any underlying infection or other issues before I can even consider signing off on this form. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. An X-ray… and blood tests. That is more than I anticipated. But, yes, Doctor, I understand. If that’s what you require, then I suppose I have no choice. Though, I must admit, I’m not fond of needles. Is it very painful? And will the X-ray take long? I have an appointment with my hairdresser on Thursday… and I really don’t want to miss it.
DOCTOR: Needles and hairdressers. Right. The blood draw will be a minor pinch. And the X-ray will take five minutes, tops. But frankly, at this point, I’m more concerned with finding out why your lungs are crackling and what’s causing that murmur than accommodating your social schedule. I’ll write you a referral order for the lab and the radiology department. Go get those tests done as soon as possible. And don't come back here expecting a signed form until I have the results. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand perfectly. I’ll go and get the tests done immediately. As soon as possible. I apologize for… for any inconvenience. And I promise I won't bother you again until you have the results. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
