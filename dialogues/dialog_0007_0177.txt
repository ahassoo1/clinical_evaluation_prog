DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… hello. It’s… somethin’ down there. It’s… leakin’. Not a lot, but it’s… wet. It’s been happenin’ a little bit. I don’t know what it is, ya know? Never had this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Something down there” that’s leaking a little bit, and it’s new for you. That definitely warrants checking things out. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Oh dear. Let me think… It wasn’t… recent. Not like yesterday or somethin’. Maybe… a week? Two weeks maybe? Time gets away from me, ya know? I been busy with my paintin’. Lots of commissions. It just… started showin’ up on my… underclothes. That’s when I noticed, for sure. It wasn’t painful, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for roughly a week or two, noticed initially with some dampness in your underclothes. No pain associated with it, just the presence of some leakage. Is it happening constantly, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Not… all the time. More when I… well, when I’m relaxin’. After I shower, maybe. Or… when I’ve been sittin’ a long time. It’s not… a flood, if that makes sense. Just a little… somethin’. Not like when you gotta go to the bathroom. It’s different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s intermittent, seems to happen more when you're relaxing or after sitting/showering, and it's not the same as needing to urinate. That’s helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your urination itself – any burning, increased frequency, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burnin'. Urinatin’ is… normal. I mean, I gotta go the same amount. And it doesn't hurt, nothin’ like that. I don't go more often, either. Nope, pretty normal. It's just… this other thing. It’s… kinda embarrassing to even talk about, ya know? I'm a respectable woman. I paint beautiful things. This… this is… not beautiful.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. It is often difficult to talk about these things, and you’re absolutely right to feel comfortable bringing it up with me. It’s my job to help you figure out what’s going on, and there's no judgment here. So, let's try to narrow things down a bit further. Have you noticed any odor associated with this leakage?
PATIENT: Odor? Hmm… I dunno. I try to keep things clean, ya know? I bathe every day. I put powder on… down there. So I can't say I smell anything. Maybe a little… you know, normal smell? Like skin. But nothin’ bad. Definitely nothin’ fishy or somethin’. I hope not! That sounds awful. I’d know if it smelled bad, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no unusual odor, just a normal skin smell. That's good. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or any problems with your bladder or kidneys?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history. Well, I been pretty healthy, mostly. Old age is comin' on, of course. I got my arthritis in my hands, that's why paintin' is gettin' harder. But… no, I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with anythin’. The doctor always said I had a strong heart. And… no problems with my bladder, not that I know of. Never had any trouble holdin' it, or anythin’. I drink plenty of water. Mostly. I like a little wine with dinner sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, a little wine with dinner isn't bad! Okay, so no major medical diagnoses, arthritis in your hands, and no known bladder problems. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That was… a long time ago. And… I had a mole removed from my back maybe ten years ago? But that was just a little thing, the doctor just cut it off. Nothing big. No other surgeries, not that I can remember. I don't like hospitals, ya know? I try to stay away from them.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a mole removed ten years ago. No other surgeries. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family – your mother, sisters, daughters – had any problems with bladder issues, urinary incontinence, or any gynecological cancers?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that's… complicated. My mother passed away when I was young. I didn’t really… talk to her about those things, ya know? And I don’t have any sisters or daughters. I was an only child, and I never married. So… I don’t know. I really don’t. Nobody ever talked about… girl things. It was just… not done. I'm sorry, I can't help ya there. It's not somethin' I ever asked about.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for those things not to be discussed. Let’s move on to allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. I love guava cake. And I haven't taken any… regular medications, nothin' like that. Sometimes I take somethin' for my arthritis when it's really bad, but that’s just ibuprofen, over the counter. I don’t like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel sick. So, no, I’m not allergic to nothin', as far as I know. I’m pretty tough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, only occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Alright, Jimmi, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. It'll just involve me listening to your abdomen, and then a quick external exam of your pelvic area. It’s very straightforward, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. An exam? Well… I’m not so sure. I don’t really… like people lookin’ down there. It’s… personal. But I suppose if you have to. I just… I hope it won’t take long. And please, be gentle. I’m an old woman, my skin is delicate. Explain everything, like you said. I get nervous easy. And… is it gonna hurt? I really don’t like pain.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your nervousness, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. It will not take long, and I’ll explain everything step-by-step. It won’t involve any internal exam at this stage, just a quick external look and listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It won’t hurt, I promise. We're just trying to gather some information. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen to see if there’s anything unusual. Then, I'll just take a quick look at the external area. Do you want to keep your undergarments on?
PATIENT: Oh... well, keepin' my underthings on sounds better. I'd really prefer that. I don't wanna be… exposed. Just listenin' and lookin', you said? That's alright. As long as you're gentle. And explainin’ what you’re doin’ the whole time. I don't like surprises. And… try to be quick, okay? My arthritis is actin' up. It's makin' it hard to lie down for too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. You are completely in control, and we’ll keep your undergarments on. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take things as slowly as you need to. Okay, first I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Just breathe normally. Okay, sounds are normal there. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at the external pelvic area. I’m just checking for any visible irritation or anything unusual. Okay, I see a little bit of mild redness in the area, but no significant swelling or open sores. I also see a very small amount of clear discharge. That could be perfectly normal, but it's good that we've noted it. Alright, that's all for the exam. It was very quick. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it's possible this is a mild case of stress incontinence – meaning a little leakage when you relax or put pressure on your bladder. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I think it would be helpful to get a urine sample to check for an infection or other issues. Would you be able to provide one?
PATIENT: Stress...incon… what was that word? Leakage from… relaxin’? Well, I have been a little worried lately. My niece is comin' to visit, and she's always judgin' me. Maybe that's it? Urine… sample? Oh dear. I haven’t done that in years. Where do I… go? Is it gonna be… messy? I don't want to make a mess. And will I have to… fill a whole jar? I have a bad back, ya know. It's hard for me to bend over. Is there a place I can… sit? I hope it's not too complicated. I'm really not good with all these medical things.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Jimmi. Stress incontinence is just leakage that happens when you put pressure on your bladder, like when you cough, laugh, or relax. It's very common, especially as we get older. And yes, it absolutely could be related to stress! As for the urine sample, it's not too complicated, I promise. We have a private bathroom right down the hall. You'll get a small, sterile cup—it’s not a jar! You just need to collect a small amount of urine—about two ounces is fine. There’s a comfortable place to sit in the bathroom. We’ll provide instructions, and the nurse can help you if you need assistance. It’s more important to get a clean sample, so we’ll make sure you understand how to do that. It might be a little uncomfortable if you haven’t done it in a while, but we’ll take it slow. Would you like me to have the nurse come in and walk you through it?
PATIENT: Oh... a nurse? That sounds… helpful. I really don’t want to make a mess. And I’m a little embarrassed, ya know? Havin' to… do that in a bathroom. But… if you think it’s important, then I guess I’ll do it. A clean sample, you said? What does “clean” mean? Do I have to… wash somethin’ first? I just don't want to do it wrong, and then have to do it all over again. My back is really botherin' me today. Can the nurse… help me sit down? And explain it slowly, okay? I’m a little slow sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jimmi. I completely understand your concerns, and it's perfectly okay to feel a little embarrassed. That's why the nurse will be there to help you through it—she's very experienced and gentle. “Clean” means we want to make sure there's no soap or lotion residue in the sample, so we just ask you to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before collecting it. You don’t need to do anything special internally – just washing your hands is fine. The nurse will provide you with a special wipe to use before you collect the sample to make sure it’s as clean as possible. She'll also help you sit comfortably and explain everything step-by-step. It will be a very private and comfortable setting. We're just trying to get a clear picture of what's going on, so we can help you feel better. Let me call the nurse, and she can come in and assist you right away. "She'll be right in, Jimmi. Just take a deep breath, and she'll take care of you.”
PATIENT: Oh... alright. Thank you. A deep breath, you said? Yes, I can do that. My niece always tells me to breathe. She’s always tellin’ me what to do. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. And I hope the nurse is nice. I don’t like people rushin’ me. And I hope I don’t make a mess. This is all… a little overwhelming. I just want to go back to my paintin’.
DOCTOR: Nurse: “Hi Jimmi, I’m Nurse Maria. Dr. Hernandez explained that you’re going to collect a urine sample for us. We’ll just go to the bathroom right over here. Don’t worry, we’ll take our time, and I’ll walk you through everything step-by-step. We have a clean cup and wipes, and I’ll show you how to use them. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable before we go?
PATIENT: Oh... hello, Nurse Maria. You're very kind. I’m a little nervous, to be honest. My back is botherin' me, so bendin’ over is hard. And… I’m afraid I’ll spill it. That would be awful. Can you… hold my hand? Just while I’m doin' it? And… can you make sure I don’t make a mess? I really don't want to cause any trouble. This is all just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Nurse Maria: “Of course, Jimmi. Absolutely. That’s what I’m here for. We'll take it very slow, and I’ll hold your hand the entire time. And don’t worry about making a mess – I’ve seen it all! We have plenty of wipes, and I’ll be right here to help you. We can take as long as you need. Is it alright if we go to the bathroom now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you promise you’ll hold my hand… and you won't let me make a mess… then yes. Let's go. But… go slow, okay? My back is really achin’ today. And… don't laugh if I spill it, okay? I get embarrassed easy.
DOCTOR: Nurse Maria: “Of course not, Jimmi. I promise I won't laugh, and we'll go at your pace. Slow and steady is perfect. Don’t worry about anything—I’m right here. Here we are. Now, I’m going to hand you a sterile cup and these wipes. Just gently clean the area with the wipe, and then collect a small amount of urine in the cup. Don’t worry about filling it all the way—two ounces is plenty. Take your time, and if you need anything, just let me know.”
PATIENT: Oh dear… alright. This is… awkward. Where… where do I…? Oh. It’s… hard to bend. Oh, dear. Is it… enough? I don’t want to have to… do it again. It's… burnin' a little. Is that normal? Is this enough? I really don't want to make a mess. Oh, dear.
DOCTOR: Nurse Maria: “That’s perfect, Jimmi. Absolutely perfect. You did a wonderful job. And yes, a little burning can sometimes happen when you’re collecting the sample, especially if you haven’t done it in a while. It should go away soon. And don’t worry about making a mess—you didn’t make any mess! You were very careful. Now, let’s just wash your hands, and then we can go back to the examination room. You did a fantastic job, Jimmi. I’m very proud of you.”
PATIENT: Oh... well, thank you, Nurse Maria. You were very kind. I was… very nervous. It's been a long time since I had to do that. I'm glad it's over. And… I'm glad I didn't make a mess. I really didn't want to cause any trouble. Now… what happens next? Do we… wait for the results? Is it gonna take long? I have paintin' to do, ya know. I have a commission… a portrait of a little girl. I promised her mother I’d have it done next week.
DOCTOR: Nurse Maria: “You did wonderfully, Jimmi. Absolutely nothing to be nervous about! We’ll take this sample to the lab, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes to get the results back. While we're waiting, Dr. Hernandez will come back in and talk to you about your symptoms and what we’ve discussed. She’ll explain everything clearly and answer any questions you have. And don’t worry about your painting – we’ll try to get this done as quickly as possible so you can get back to it! Let me let Dr. Hernandez know you’re ready. I’ll be right back if you need anything.”
PATIENT: Oh... alright. Thank you, Nurse Maria. You're a very nice woman. I’m glad it’s over. Now… I hope the results are good. I don’t like being sick. I just want to go back to my paintin’. I hope it’s not somethin’ serious. My niece always tells me I need to take better care of myself. She's always judgin' me. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: “Hi Jimmi, how are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh... hello, Doctor. I’m… alright, I suppose. A little tired. And a little nervous. It was… awkward, doin’ that. But Nurse Maria was very kind. She helped me a lot. I just hope it's not somethin' bad. I don't like bein' sick, and I have a paintin' to finish. It's a portrait of a little girl, and her mother is expectin' it next week. I just want to go home and paint.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: “I understand your nervousness, Jimmi. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way after going through that. And I’m glad Nurse Maria was able to help. Don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. The good news is, the results are back, and they look pretty good. There’s no sign of any infection. That’s a great start. It looks like you likely have some mild stress incontinence, which, as we discussed, is leakage that happens when you put pressure on your bladder. It’s very common, especially as we get older, and it's often caused by weakening of the pelvic floor muscles." "Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Stress… in-con-tin-ence? Weak muscles? What does that mean? I don't understand. I just feel… embarrassed when I laugh, or when I relax. That's all. Is it serious? Do I need… medicine? I don't like takin' pills. And what about my paintin'? Can I still paint? I have a commission, ya know. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. Is it gonna stop me from paintin'? This is all very… overwhelmning.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: "It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, Jimmi. Let's break it down. Stress incontinence simply means that a little bit of urine leaks out when you put pressure on your bladder – like when you cough, laugh, or relax. It's not serious, and it’s very treatable. The weakening of the pelvic floor muscles is also normal as we age. Those muscles help support your bladder, and when they weaken, it can cause leakage. “As for medicine, we don’t necessarily need to start with pills. There are several things we can try first. One of the most effective things is pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises strengthen those muscles and help improve bladder control. We can show you how to do them properly. “And yes, you can absolutely still paint! It shouldn’t stop you from doing anything. In fact, staying active is a good thing. We just want to help you manage the leakage so you feel more comfortable. Do those exercises and then we'll see how it goes." "Would you like me to show you how to do the Kegel exercises now?
PATIENT: Kegel… ex-er-cises? Like… squeezin’? What exactly do I have to do? It sounds… awkward. And will it hurt? I have arthritis in my hands, ya know. It's hard for me to squeeze things. And what if I can't remember how to do it? I'm an old woman, my memory isn't what it used to be. And… will it take long? I have a paintin’ to finish, ya know. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. I just want to go home and paint. This is all very… complicated.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: "That's a very good question, Jimmi. Yes, Kegel exercises involve squeezing the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. It's like you're stopping yourself mid-stream. It doesn't have to be a strong squeeze – just a gentle contraction. “And no, it shouldn’t hurt at all. You should feel a mild tightening in your pelvic area, but no pain. And it’s okay if you have arthritis in your hands - you don't need to use your hands at all for these exercises! It’s all about squeezing those pelvic muscles. “And don’t worry about remembering – we can give you a handout with clear instructions. We can also review them together a few times. You can do them anywhere, anytime – while you’re watching TV, cooking, or even waiting in line. They only take a few minutes each day, and we can start with a small number of repetitions and gradually increase them as you get stronger. “Would you like me to show you how to do them now, and then we can practice together?
PATIENT: Alright. If you think it will help… I guess I can try. But don't expect much, ya know? I'm an old woman, and my muscles aren’t what they used to be. And… will it make me… red? When I squeeze? I don't want to look silly. And what if I can't feel anything when I squeeze? What if it doesn't work? I just want to go back to my paintin'. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. This is all very… frustratin'. Show me, then. But go slow, okay? And don't expect too much.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: "That's perfectly alright, Jimmi. We'll take it very slow, and don't worry about expecting too much. It’s not about doing it perfectly – it’s about practicing and strengthening those muscles. “And no, it won’t make you red. You won’t feel anything externally, and nobody will know you're doing them. It’s a very discreet exercise. “Okay, so here’s what we're going to do. I want you to imagine you're trying to stop the flow of urine mid-stream. Squeeze those muscles like you're trying to hold it in. Hold the squeeze for about three seconds, and then relax for three seconds. That’s one repetition. Try to do ten repetitions. “Let’s try it together. Ready?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That’s… hard. I don’t think I’m doing it right. It doesn’t feel like anything is happening. And… my back is starting to ache. It’s hard to concentrate. And what if I squeeze too much? What if it hurts something? I just want to go back to my paintin'. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. This is all very… stressful. I don’t think I can do this. It’s too hard.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: "That's perfectly alright, Jimmi. It takes practice, and it's normal to feel a little awkward at first. Don't worry about squeezing too hard - you should feel a gentle tightening, but no pain. And it’s okay if you can’t feel much at first – it takes time to reconnect with those muscles. “It sounds like your back is bothering you, and that’s making it harder to concentrate. Let’s not push it. It's okay if you can only manage a few repetitions. We can start with just five repetitions a day and gradually increase them as you get stronger and your back feels better. “Don’t worry about doing it perfectly, and don't compare yourself to anyone else. The important thing is that you're trying. We'll take it slow and work at your pace. Here, let's focus on just three repetitions right now. I'll count along with you. And I'll give you this handout with clear instructions and pictures. It's okay if it doesn't work right away. We'll revisit it at your next appointment. Does that sound better?
PATIENT: Alright. Three… just three. That doesn't sound too bad. But… what if I forget? I have a lot on my mind, ya know. And what if it doesn't work at all? I just want to go back to my paintin'. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. This is all very… frustrating. There. I did three. Now… can I go home? I just want to paint. This is all very… tiring.
DOCTOR: Dr. Hernandez: “You did three, Jimmi! That’s fantastic! And you're right, it's okay if you forget sometimes. Just try to do them when you remember. Maybe you can tie it to something you already do, like watching TV. “And don’t worry about it not working right away. It takes time and consistency. We’re just getting started. “Absolutely, you can go home now. I think you’ve done a great job today. We'll check in at your next appointment to see how you're doing. Here’s the handout with the instructions, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Most importantly, try not to worry too much, and focus on doing what you enjoy—like painting! I have a feeling you'll do just fine. “Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you. I still don't understand it, but… I guess I’ll try. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not gonna worry about it. I just want to paint. A little girl… her mother is expectin' it next week. I think I’ll just go home now. I need a nap. Thank you again. Goodbye.
