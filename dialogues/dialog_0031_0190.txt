DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling rather unsteady lately. A bit off balance, you see. It’s been… troubling. I don’t quite recall when it started exactly, but it’s become more noticeable these past few weeks, I believe.
DOCTOR: I see. “Unsteady” and “off balance” – can you tell me more about that, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s difficult to pinpoint. It’s not… a constant thing, thankfully. More like… moments. I might be walking, and just… feel a little swimmy, like the floor is tilting. Or I’ll be standing, and it feels as though someone gently nudged me. Nothing major, thankfully. But enough to make me concerned, and… a bit frightened, if I’m being honest. It hasn’t caused me to fall yet, but it’s unsettling. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds quite concerning, and it's good you came in to have it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you describe when these episodes happen most often?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I don’t know if there is a particular time. It doesn’t seem to be after exertion… I work, you see, with a rotary drill, oil and gas… it’s quite physical, but I haven't noticed it happening during work any more than… any other time. It feels rather random, actually. Sometimes it’s first thing in the morning, other times it’s in the evening. I… I wish I could be more specific, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random occurrences can be trickier to diagnose, but we’ll work through it. You mentioned working with a rotary drill—that is physically demanding work. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying these episodes of unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes feel a little dizzy, I suppose, right before I feel unsteady. Not a spinning dizziness, but… a lightness, almost. And… occasionally, a bit of nausea. It doesn’t usually last long, thankfully. Just a fleeting feeling. Nothing… debilitating, you understand. I haven't experienced any blurred vision or headaches, if that's what you’re asking. And…no, nothing else that I can readily recall. It's just… the unsteadiness, the lightheadedness, and sometimes, a little bit of feeling unwell in my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness and occasional nausea along with the unsteadiness. Thank you for sharing that. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… that’s… a difficult one. I work around rather loud machinery, Doctor. It's quite noisy, as you might imagine. I've always assumed any slight ringing I experience is simply from the noise. I haven’t noticed a change in my hearing, no. And… I don't typically pay attention to things like ringing. If there is some, it’s just background noise, really. I can still hear perfectly well, as far as I’m aware. I'm not very good at noticing those sorts of things, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's helpful to know you work in a noisy environment. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well… my husband passed away a little over a year ago. It was… sudden. He had a heart condition, I believe. As for myself… I don't recall any specific diagnoses. I’ve always been… relatively healthy. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, naturally, but nothing serious enough to warrant regular visits to the doctor. I have private insurance, so I’ve always had check-ups when needed…but I don't have any papers with me to recall anything specific. I'm sorry, I’m not being very helpful, am I? My memory… it’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Snerling. I’m sorry to hear about your husband—that must have been incredibly difficult. And it's alright about your memory; we'll take things at your pace. Knowing about your husband’s heart condition is useful information, thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, not to my recollection. No surgeries… and I haven't been hospitalized. I’ve always been quite fortunate, health-wise. Just the occasional doctor's visit for routine things. I… I remember getting vaccinations as a child, naturally… but that’s about all. I wish I could provide you with more details, Doctor, but it’s like… the past is a little… hazy. It’s disconcerting, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's not uncommon for memories to be less clear over time, and it’s perfectly alright. Let's talk about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's… a tricky one. My family is… rather large, and scattered across Ethiopia. We don't keep in close contact, I'm afraid. My mother… she lived to a good age, but I don't recall any specific illnesses she suffered from. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, and I didn't know him well enough to know of any health problems he had. I believe my grandmother had some trouble with her joints… arthritis, perhaps? But beyond that… I'm afraid I don't have much information. It's difficult to say, Doctor. We weren’t a family that discussed such things openly. I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Snerling. It's understandable that information may be limited, especially with a large and distant family. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol… perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And recreational drugs… the very idea! No, Doctor. I've always led a very… simple life. I prefer a quiet evening at home to… well, to anything like that. My work keeps me busy enough, as it is.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not currently. I haven’t needed any regular medication. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, and no supplements. I believe a healthy diet is the best medicine, you see. And… plenty of rest when one needs it. I suppose that’s all, Doctor. I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Snerling. That's very helpful. Thank you for providing me with that information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. I… I just hope you can find out what’s causing this unsteadiness. It’s rather unsettling, as you can imagine. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No murmurs, wheezes, or crackles. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 128/76, and your pulse is 72 and regular. I'm going to briefly examine your ears with an otoscope. Your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums look normal. Finally, I’d like to test your balance and coordination. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Your eye movements are smooth and coordinated. Now, I’d like you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. You have a slight sway, but nothing overly concerning at this point. I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Overall, the physical exam doesn't reveal any immediate cause for your unsteadiness. However, to rule out any underlying issues, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend a simple hearing test, just to be sure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: That… that is reassuring to hear, Doctor, that nothing obvious showed up. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. Blood work and a hearing test… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if that’s what you recommend, then I’m happy to proceed. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And… what will happen next, depending on what they show? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Snerling. It's important you understand everything. The lab should have the results back within 2-3 business days. We’ll call you as soon as they are available. If the blood work is normal, we'll consider other possible causes, such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo – or BPPV – which is a common cause of dizziness. We can perform a specific test for that in the office. If the hearing test comes back abnormal, we may refer you to an audiologist for further evaluation. Depending on the results, we might also consider a neurological consult. However, let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: BPPV… neurological consult… it all sounds a little daunting, honestly. But I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. No, I think that’s all for now. I’ll just wait for the results and go from there. Thank you for your time and your kindness. I feel… a little less anxious, knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. When I get the call, who should I ask for?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Snerling. I understand your concern, and we’ll definitely take things at your pace. When the lab calls, just ask for me, Dr. Rakosky, or for my nurse, Sarah Miller. She can also answer any questions you might have. Here is a lab requisition form. You can take this to the lab at [Lab Name and Address]. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you experience any severe dizziness, difficulty walking, slurred speech, or vision changes—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else before you leave?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very thorough of you to mention the emergency room. I will certainly keep that in mind. No, I believe that’s all. I appreciate your patience and your clear explanations. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Rakosky. I will wait for the call. .
