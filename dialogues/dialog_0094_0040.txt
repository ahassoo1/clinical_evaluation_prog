DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's this pain in my side, you see. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been more frequent. And with the pain… I keep getting these water infections. The doctor back home – he said it has something to do with my kidneys. Something about lots of little… pockets in them? I’m not very good with remembering the details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in your side that’s been coming and going, but worsening recently, and recurrent water infections. And your previous doctor mentioned something about your kidneys having “pockets” in them. That’s a good starting point. Just to clarify, when you say “side,” can you point to where exactly you’re feeling the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s… well, it’s mostly here, on my right side. Sometimes it goes around to my back a bit too, but mostly here. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, you understand? And it can be quite uncomfortable when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache on your right side, sometimes radiating to your back. And you said it's been more frequent lately?
PATIENT: That’s correct, Doctor. It used to be maybe once or twice a year, but these last few months… it's been almost every month. And with each time, it takes a little longer to feel better. The water infections aren't helping, of course. It's just… tiring, to be honest. It worries me a bit too.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand why it would be tiring and worrisome. Frequent infections and persistent pain are definitely not something anyone wants to deal with. Let’s go through some more details to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you remember anything that seems to trigger the pain – certain foods, activities, or positions?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. I don’t think there’s anything specific that starts it, no. It just… comes. Though, I do find it’s worse when I’ve been lifting things. Even something not too heavy, if I bend over awkwardly, that can bring it on. And if I’m walking a long distance, that doesn’t help either. But it happens even when I haven’t been doing anything strenuous, to be honest. It’s a bit unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not reliably triggered by anything, but seems to be aggravated by lifting and walking. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides what your previous doctor said about your kidneys?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I have high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take tablets for that. And… oh, I had a bit of trouble with my heart a long time back, but they fixed it with a little procedure. Nothing since then, thankfully. Other than that… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Until this kidney business, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of a heart procedure. Good to know. And do you recall what kind of procedure it was, roughly when it happened?
PATIENT: It was… a long time ago. Must be twenty years or more. They said something about a blockage. I think they put a little… tube in it, to open it up. It wasn't surgery, it was done through a little hole in my leg, I remember that much. And I had to stay in the hospital for a few days. It was all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I was younger then, and I didn’t worry about details as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a procedure to open a blockage, done through a small incision in your leg, about twenty years ago. That sounds like an angioplasty and possible stent placement. We can look into the records to confirm that later. Now, let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar kidney problems, or any other health issues like high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure too, towards the end of her life. And my brother… he had some trouble with his kidneys as well, years ago. I don’t remember the details, but he was always a bit sickly. He passed away a few years back now. As for others… not that I know of. My father was very healthy, lived to a good old age. But we weren’t very close, so I don’t know much about his medical history. It’s difficult to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and kidney problems. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. You mentioned taking tablets for your blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… let me see if I can remember. Ah, here we are. It's called… Amlodipine. 5 milligrams, once a day. Every morning, with my breakfast. I’ve been taking it for… oh, I don’t know, must be ten years or more now. The doctor said it’s important to keep my blood pressure under control.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5 milligrams daily. Good. And are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the Amlodipine. I don’t really believe in all those vitamins and herbal things, to be honest. I stick to what the doctor prescribes. I might take a painkiller now and then, if the pain gets really bad, but that’s it. Usually just Paracetamol, nothing strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Amlodipine, and occasional Paracetamol for pain. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, and never had a problem. I don’t have any skin allergies either, or anything like that. Just a bit sensitive to the sun, if I’m out in it for too long, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll feel your abdomen to get a better sense of where the pain is located and if there's any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, I suppose. I’ve had a few check-ups over the years. Just let me know if you feel anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, rate is a little elevated at 78, but that could be due to anxiety or discomfort. I don’t hear any murmurs. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and exhale. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, there. That’s where it hurts. Not a sharp pain, but… definitely tender. It feels a bit… achy, you know? And if you press a little harder… it’s a bit uncomfortable. The rest feels alright, though. No pain anywhere else.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the right lower quadrant. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. I don’t feel any obvious masses. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your history of recurrent water infections, the pain in your side, and the tenderness in your right lower quadrant could indicate a kidney infection, or possibly a blockage in your urinary tract. The mention of "pockets" in your kidneys by your previous doctor raises the possibility of polycystic kidney disease, or other structural abnormalities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some tests. A urine analysis to check for infection, a blood test to assess your kidney function, and an ultrasound of your kidneys and bladder. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get some relief from this pain. Yes, please, go ahead and order those tests. The sooner the better, if you ask me. I’m ready whenever you are. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get the orders sent to the lab right away. For the urine analysis, you'll need to provide a sample – they’ll give you a cup and instructions when you get there. It's best to try and collect a mid-stream sample, meaning you start to urinate, then collect a sample mid-way through. The blood test will just require a standard blood draw. And the ultrasound doesn't require any special preparation, you can eat and drink normally beforehand. The lab is just down the hall, and the receptionist will help you schedule the ultrasound. It may take a few days to get all the results back. Once I have them, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience a high fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or severe pain in your side or back, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I’ll go and see the receptionist now, and get those tests scheduled. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. I hope you feel better soon.
