DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's August 2nd, 2025. I see here you're 64 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need a… a permission slip, I guess you could say. For somethin’ the young man at the… the beauty place wants. Says he needs your say-so before he does it. It's about my face. Don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. So, this is a request for medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure at a beauty salon, concerning your face. Could you tell me a little more about what the young man—the technician—plans to do?
PATIENT: Technician… yes, that’s right. He… somethin’ about makin’ it smoother? And tighter? I think he said somethin’ about… needles? And a light. Look, I just wanna look… not so droopy, alright? It’s my face, I should be able to do what I want with it. Don't ask me to spell it out, I don’t remember the fancy words he used. It’s not like I'm gettin' open heart surgery here.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re hoping for a cosmetic improvement to address some concerns with facial drooping. And you’re right to want to understand exactly what’s involved before proceeding. While it may not be surgery, any procedure involving needles and light does carry some risk, and it's my responsibility to ensure it’s safe for you. To help me determine that, could you tell me when you first noticed this drooping?
PATIENT: Drooping… well, now, that’s a question. Seems like… a long time. Probably… after my sister passed. She always said I had a handsome face. But that was… a good while back. Before that… I don’t rightly remember. I ain’t got the memory I used to have, you know? Things just… fade. It's just been gettin' worse, I suppose. Not like it happened overnight.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. Memory can certainly be affected by many things, and it’s not uncommon for changes to occur gradually. Knowing it's been worsening over time is helpful. Have you noticed any other changes to your face besides the drooping?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmmm. Let me think. Well, there’s… this little spot. Over here. It’s been there for… well, a spell. Don’t bother me none, really. Just… always there. And I suppose… wrinkles. Everybody gets wrinkles. Don’t need to write all that down, it’s just… old age, plain and simple. I’m not expectin’ to look like a boy scout again.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you letting me know, Mr. Honcoop. It's good to be thorough. We will certainly take a closer look at that spot. Have you ever had any skin cancers or any other concerning growths removed?
PATIENT: Skin cancers? Heavens no! Never had nothin’ removed. I worked with radio towers for years, you know. Climbin’ all over ‘em. Got a few scrapes and bruises, that's about it. Always been healthy as a horse, I reckon. Never been one to sit around a doctor’s office complainin’ about aches and pains. This is… well, this is different. Just wantin’ to look a little better, that's all. Don’t make it complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Honcoop. Your work history is good to know, and it’s positive to hear you’ve generally been healthy. We won’t make it complicated. Just trying to gather all the information to make sure this procedure is safe for you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had any reactions to any treatments in the past?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Ate everything put in front of me as a boy. My mama made sure of that. Maybe… a little itchy once after eatin’ some shrimp. But that was a long time ago. And I ate shrimp plenty of times after that. Didn’t bother me none. Never been one to shy away from a good meal. Reactions… no, nothin’ I can recall. I tell ya, I'm a pretty simple man. Don't take much to bother me. Let's just get this over with, alright? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. That’s helpful. And I appreciate your patience. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I don’t take medications. Never have. I believe in fresh air and hard work. Maybe a little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. I don’t like bein’ all drugged up. Makes me feel… sluggish. I got things to do, remember? This whole thing is takin’ up a perfectly good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. That’s good to know. Very well. To proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better look at your face and assess the area the technician plans to treat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don’t poke around too much. I ain’t got all day. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just going to examine your face, palpate the areas of concern, and take a closer look at that spot you mentioned. I’ll also check your vital signs—blood pressure and pulse—just as a routine precaution. I'm noting some mild ptosis—that’s drooping—of the upper eyelids bilaterally, more pronounced on the right side. The skin texture is generally good for your age, with some expected fine lines and wrinkles. Palpating the spot on your left cheek, it feels… slightly raised, approximately one centimeter in diameter, and firm to the touch. It’s not particularly tender. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Alright, Mr. Honcoop. That completes the exam.
PATIENT: Elevated… what was that now? Look, I don't understand all that doctor talk. Does that mean I can’t get this done? I just want to look a little better, that's all. I'm a simple man, remember? Don't need a whole lot of fuss. Just tell me yes or no. Can this young man do his job or can't he?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which is something we should discuss with your primary care physician. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t proceed with this cosmetic treatment. However, given the slightly raised and firm spot on your cheek, and based on the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, I cannot give you clearance for this procedure without further investigation. It’s important to rule out any potential skin cancer or other concerning growths before undergoing any treatment that could potentially disrupt it. It would be irresponsible of me to do so without knowing for sure. I recommend a biopsy of the spot to get a definitive diagnosis. I can provide you with a referral to a dermatologist for that purpose. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A biopsy… now you’re talkin’ about cuttin’ into my face? Heavens no! I just want to look a little better, not have holes poked in me! A dermatologist… what’s that? Sounds expensive. Look, I ain't got insurance, remember? This is gettin’ way too complicated. Can’t this young man just… smooth it out a little? It’s just a little droop. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I don’t need all this fuss. I’m gonna go now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your concerns, and I apologize for the added complexity. I assure you, my primary concern is your health and safety. A biopsy is a relatively minor procedure, usually done in the dermatologist’s office with local anesthesia. It’s the only way to determine what that spot is and ensure it’s not something serious. Given your lack of insurance, I can explore some options for low-cost or free dermatological services in the area. There are often community clinics that offer affordable care. I strongly advise against proceeding with any treatment without a proper diagnosis. Smoothing it out, as you say, could potentially spread any concerning cells if it is something serious. Would you allow me a few minutes to gather some information on affordable dermatological care for you?
PATIENT: Affordable… you say affordable? Look, I ain’t got much money. I worked hard all my life, but it don’t amount to much these days. If you can find somethin’… somethin’ cheap… maybe. But I don’t want no fancy clinics, and I don’t want to be waitin’ around for months. I just want to get this over with. Alright, Doctor. See what you can find. But make it quick. And make it cheap. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. Let me see what options are available. Okay, here’s a community clinic a few blocks from here, "Urban Health Services," that offers dermatological consultations and biopsies on a sliding scale based on income. They have appointments available next week. I can fax your medical records to them immediately, and they have a financial assistance program. Here is their number: 555-123-4567. And their address is 123 Main Street. Would you like me to fax your information now?
