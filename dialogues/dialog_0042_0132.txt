DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Coby’s the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But this heat… it’s something else this year, isn’t it? I just… can’t handle it like I used to. Get overheated easy, feel weak. It’s not right, at my age. I’ve built houses in this sun, you know? I should be tougher than this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. It is a particularly harsh summer. And it’s very common to find that our bodies don’t handle extremes quite the same way as we age. It's good you came in to get it checked out. So, to clarify, you're experiencing increased sensitivity to heat, feeling weak, and it’s a recent change?
PATIENT: Recent-ish. Started properly, I'd say, maybe a month ago. Before that, a little warm was a little warm, you know? Normal. Now? Now it feels like the sun’s aiming right for me. And it's not just feeling a bit hot and bothered. It's like… all my energy just drains away. Makes working a proper pain. I do a lot of painting, mostly. Outside. Can’t be doing that if I’m going to faint every five minutes. And I need to work. Can’t just sit around.
DOCTOR: I see. A noticeable change over the past month, with a draining of energy specifically when exposed to heat… and it's interfering with your work. That’s important information. Can you describe what happens when you start to feel overheated?
PATIENT: Well, it starts with just feeling…flushed. Like my face is burning up. Then I get dizzy. Real dizzy. Not like a little wobble, but like the room’s spinning. And then just…nothing. Weak. Can't really stand for long. I tried to keep going on a job last week, repainting a porch, and nearly fell off the ladder. Had to get old Martha next door to come and help me down. Humiliating, that was. And then I just feel… drained. Like someone’s unplugged me. Takes ages to recover. It's not like a quick rest fixes it.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite frightening, Mr. Coby, especially nearly falling off the ladder. It’s good you had Martha nearby. It’s definitely concerning that it’s not resolving with rest. Just to get a clearer picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the flushing, dizziness, and weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really symptoms, exactly. But I haven’t been sleeping well. Just tossin’ and turnin’. I put that down to the heat, though. Too hot to get comfortable. And my appetite’s been a bit off. Don’t fancy much when it’s this sticky. But I wouldn’t call them symptoms. Just…old age, probably. And the heat. Everything’s the heat, isn't it? I’m a practical man, you see. Don't go running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. But this…this is interfering with my work.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Coby. It’s good you’re a practical man, but sometimes those "little things" can add up to something important. The difficulty sleeping and decreased appetite could be related to the heat, but they're also things we need to consider. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine – the color, amount, or frequency?
PATIENT: Urine? Now you’re asking… Look, I go to the toilet when I need to, like everyone else. I don't exactly analyze it, do I? Color seems… normal enough. You want me to start paying attention to my… bodily functions now? Honestly, Doctor, I came here because I'm struggling to work in the heat, not to become a… a urine expert. Is that even relevant? I'm a painter, not a scientist.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask that, Mr. Coby. My apologies. Sometimes I get carried away with trying to be thorough. Changes in urine can be a sign of dehydration, which could be playing a role here, but it’s not my intention to make you feel like you need to analyze everything. Let's move on. Have you been drinking more or less water than usual?
PATIENT: Less, probably. I usually have a flask with me when I'm working, but I haven't been as thirsty, strangely enough. And if I'm honest, I've been trying to get jobs done quicker, before it gets too hot. So, less breaks. Less water. Probably not helping, I suppose. But I don't usually drink loads of water anyway. Never have. A cup of tea is more my style. Though even that feels like too much effort in this heat.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Coby. Decreased fluid intake, especially when you're physically active and exposed to heat, can definitely contribute to these symptoms. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, the doctor said, a few years back. Put me on a little pill for it, but I didn't really like the way it made me feel. Stopped taking it after a while. Seemed alright after that. Apart from that… nothing much. A bad back now and then, from all the painting. And my knees aren't what they used to be. But who’s knees are at my age? No diabetes, no heart problems. I'm a strong man, always have been. Still am, mostly. It’s just this heat… It’s getting me down. And it's interfering with my work!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were previously diagnosed with high blood pressure and stopped taking medication due to side effects. That’s important information. And you’ve been experiencing some back and knee pain. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements at all, even occasionally?
PATIENT: Just the occasional paracetamol for the back pain, when it flares up. Nothing regularly. And a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. Old Martha keeps giving me them. Says I need to look after myself. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a simple man. I don't go in for all these pills and potions. If it hurts, I take a paracetamol. If I'm feeling a bit tired, I have a cup of tea. It's not complicated. And it certainly doesn’t explain why I’m nearly fainting in the sun! It’s the heat, I tell you. The heat.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Coby. You're a practical man who prefers a straightforward approach, and that's perfectly fine. We just need to cover all the bases. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have any health conditions, like heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had a weak heart. Died young, actually. Around sixty. Always said he pushed himself too hard. Worked on the land, you see. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a bit…fussy about her health. Always going to the doctor. Not like me. My brother’s alright, as far as I know. Lives up in Kathmandu. Don't see him much. But he seems healthy enough. Strong lad, always was. So, weak heart for my father, high blood pressure for my mother. That’s about it, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for remembering family medical histories. It’s all a bit hazy. It's the present that matters, isn't it? And the present is me struggling to work in this ridiculous heat.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Coby. History of heart problems in your father and high blood pressure in your mother. We’ll keep those in mind. Finally, let's talk briefly about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn't allow it. Always said it was a terrible habit. And I've seen enough of the damage it does. No, I don't smoke. Never have, never will. Always been a healthy lad, mostly. Despite the dodgy knees and the occasional back pain. And the…heat intolerance. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel like I'm being interrogated! All I want is to get back to work. It’s interfering with my livelihood. Can we please get to the bottom of this heat problem?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Mr. Coby. I apologize if I’ve kept you for too long with these questions. It’s important to gather all the information, but I understand your frustration. Now, let's move on to a quick physical examination. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will only take a few minutes. Would you mind stepping up onto the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. The sooner I know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to work. Honestly, all this poking and prodding… It's not my idea of a good time. But if you must… Just be quick about it, eh? This isn’t exactly comfortable. And I’ve got a porch to paint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, which isn’t unusual given your reported symptoms and the warm temperature, but I'm noting a slightly irregular rhythm. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. Your blood pressure is elevated, 150/90. Not dangerously high, but higher than it should be, especially given your history. Your pulse is a little weak and fast. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your skin is warm and slightly flushed. Okay, Mr. Coby. Everything seems otherwise within normal limits. But the slightly irregular heart rhythm and elevated blood pressure are something we need to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood work to check your electrolyte levels, kidney function, and rule out any underlying infections. And I'd also recommend an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. A bit of heat and I'm being treated like a… a complicated case! I just want to know why I'm getting tired and weak in the sun. Is that too much to ask? Electrolytes? Kidney function? It sounds… serious. Look, I'm a practical man, remember? I don't want a lot of tests and scans and… complicated explanations. Can't we just… try something simple? Maybe a vitamin supplement? A change of diet? Anything but all this poking and prodding and blood work. I've got a job to finish. And frankly, Doctor, it's expensive. Medicare only covers so much, you know? I'm not made of money. I just want to get back to work. Is that too much to ask? Can't we just… try something simple first?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask those questions, Mr. Coby, and I understand your hesitation. I apologize if I’ve made you feel overwhelmed. You're right, we should start with the least invasive options and only proceed if necessary. However, given your history of high blood pressure, the slightly irregular heart rhythm, and your symptoms of weakness and fatigue, it’s important to rule out anything serious. The blood work and EKG will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help me make an informed decision about the best course of action. I understand your concerns about costs. Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but I can also discuss options with the billing department to see if we can reduce your out-of-pocket expenses. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend the following: Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, especially water, throughout the day. Avoid strenuous activity during peak heat hours: Work in the shade or during cooler times of the day. Take frequent breaks: Rest when you feel tired or weak. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood work and EKG?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You've worn me down. But I'm telling you, Doctor, if these tests come back saying I'm perfectly healthy, I'm holding you responsible for wasting my time. And my money. But… fine. Blood work and EKG. Get it over with. But I want a clear explanation of the results, in plain English. None of this medical jargon. And I want to know what it all means. And I want it to be quick. I've got a porch to paint, remember? And if it’s just a waste of time, you’re buying me a cup of tea. A good cup of tea. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go? And how long will it take? Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Coby. I understand your concerns, and I promise to explain the results in plain English. And yes, if the tests come back normal, a cup of tea is the least I can do! The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The technician will draw a small sample of blood. It shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. Then, the EKG technician is in room 3. It’s a quick, painless procedure where they’ll attach some electrodes to your chest to monitor your heart rhythm. That will probably take around 10-15 minutes as well. Once the results are back – usually within a few hours – my nurse will give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment with me. In the meantime, please follow the recommendations I gave you earlier: stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity during peak heat, and take frequent breaks. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just get it over with. The sooner I know what’s going on, the sooner I can get back to work. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me sweat just talking about it. Alright, let’s get this over with. Lab, you said? Second door on the left. Right. Honestly… this heat… and now this. It's a nightmare.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Please let the lab technician know if you have any questions. And don't hesitate to call my office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Good luck, and I’ll see you soon.
