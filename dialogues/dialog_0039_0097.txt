DOCTOR: Hello Marija, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. I requested an appointment to discuss… well, planning for the inevitable. I understand you provide those forms – the Advance Directive, or is it a POLST? Frankly, I find it rather… distasteful to dwell on such things, but my husband insists. He says it’s “responsible.”
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. It is responsible, and it's very thoughtful of both you and your husband to be thinking about this now. It can feel a bit uncomfortable, definitely. We can definitely go over both Advance Directives and POLST forms – or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. They’re a little different, and we can decide which one is best for you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what your husband has said specifically?
PATIENT: He… worries. He believes I haven’t clearly expressed my wishes should… something happen. He’s quite fond of dramatic hypotheticals, you see. He wants it all written down, “just in case.” He mentioned something about machines and tubes… Honestly, it’s all a bit much. I simply want to ensure that if I am unable to speak for myself, things are handled… with a degree of dignity. And, of course, according to my preferences, not a doctor’s.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. It’s very common for loved ones to worry and want to be prepared, and it's absolutely your right to have your wishes respected. We focus on making sure your preferences are what guides everything. Could you tell me a little bit about what "handled with dignity" means to you in this situation?
PATIENT: It means… no prolonged suffering. No being kept alive by artificial means simply because it’s possible. I’ve seen it happen to relatives, you know. A miserable existence, hooked up to machines, barely conscious. Absolutely not. I have a… reasonable quality of life now, and I would prefer it not be extended at all costs if that quality were to diminish significantly. I would like to be… allowed to pass peacefully, if my time comes. Is that so difficult to understand?
DOCTOR: No, Marija, that is not difficult to understand at all. In fact, it’s a very common and thoughtful wish. It sounds like you’re very clear about wanting to prioritize quality of life and avoid prolonged suffering. That’s excellent. Just to be sure I have everything right, when you say "significant diminish," can you describe what that would look like for you?
PATIENT: Doctor, honestly. If I were unable to communicate, unable to recognize my loved ones, dependent on machines to breathe or eat… if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery, no chance of regaining any semblance of my former self… then, yes. That would be a significant diminish. I do not wish to be a vegetable. I have always prided myself on my independence, my intellect. To be reduced to… that, is unacceptable. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is very clear. Thank you for explaining that so well. It sounds like you’ve given this a great deal of thought. Now, have you ever discussed this with your husband in detail?
PATIENT: Discussed it? He has nagged me about it for months! He reads those medical articles online, you see, and becomes convinced I'm on the verge of collapse at any moment. He knows I don’t want “heroic measures,” as he calls them, but he wants everything meticulously documented, just to be safe. He worries about legal complications, about family disagreements… He’s a very… practical man, my husband. And prone to anxiety. Honestly, I feel like I’m explaining this to him through you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've had these conversations before, and he's seeking reassurance. That's good – it's helpful to have those discussions. To get a clearer picture, and just to be thorough, would you mind if I asked a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? What for? I’m not ill, Doctor. I came here to discuss… preferences, not to have my ailments catalogued. I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… but I fail to see the relevance. I haven't been to a doctor in years. I maintain a healthy lifestyle, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. I apologize – I didn’t mean to imply you were ill. It's standard practice to ask about medical history when completing these forms. It helps us understand your overall health, and ensures that your wishes are documented accurately. For example, knowing about any allergies or current medications is important. It also informs the discussion about what “quality of life” means for you, and what interventions might be appropriate – or not. I promise, it won’t be a long list. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Fine. Very well. I have a slight sensitivity to penicillin, though I haven’t encountered it in years. And… I used to take medication for my blood pressure, but I’ve managed to control it through diet and exercise. No other allergies, no other medications. I pride myself on my health, you know. I don't believe in unnecessary pharmaceuticals. Honestly, I wish doctors would focus more on preventative care.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know. Penicillin sensitivity, and previously managed blood pressure through lifestyle changes. That's helpful. And I agree – preventative care is extremely important. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you have any major medical conditions that have been diagnosed, like diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying that I look unwell? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. I have never been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or any other debilitating illness. I occasionally experience mild aches and pains, as one does at my age, but nothing of consequence. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting. I came here to discuss end-of-life planning, not to have my physical fitness scrutinized. Is this truly necessary?
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize, Marija. I did not intend to imply anything about your physical fitness. I assure you, you appear very well. As you said, these questions are simply a standard part of the process. It's about ensuring we have a complete picture and documenting everything accurately. I just want to be thorough. Would you mind if I asked a quick question about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Family medical history? Really, Doctor? Is no aspect of my life to remain private? Very well. My mother suffered from arthritis in her later years. My father… he had high cholesterol, I believe. And my brother has asthma. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of all this genealogical probing. I simply want to complete these forms and be done with it. I have a luncheon appointment, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Marija. Arthritis in your mother, high cholesterol in your father, and asthma in your brother. Thank you. Now, I understand you’re eager to finish, and I want to respect your time. I just have one more brief area to cover – a few questions about your lifestyle, just to get a complete picture. Things like smoking, alcohol consumption, or your general activity level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you attempting to ascertain my moral character now? I find this entire process… invasive. Very well. I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – a very small glass, mind you. And I maintain an active lifestyle, thank you very much. I walk every day, I garden, I engage in intellectually stimulating pursuits. I assure you, I am not a sedentary individual. Is this finally sufficient? I have a luncheon engagement, and I am beginning to lose my patience.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly sufficient, Marija. Thank you. No smoking, occasional small glass of wine, and an active lifestyle. I appreciate your patience. Now, if you’re willing, we can finally move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST forms themselves. Do you have any initial thoughts or questions about either of those documents?
PATIENT: Yes. Perhaps you could explain the difference between the two? My husband mentioned something about a POLST being more… immediate, whereas the Advance Directive is more general. Is that correct? I simply want to be clear about which one best suits my needs. I want to ensure my wishes are unambiguously documented, without any room for misinterpretation. And I want to be certain that my husband will be able to enforce them without undue difficulty. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely correct. Your husband is right; the POLST is more immediate. Think of the Advance Directive as a broader statement of your values and wishes for future medical care, especially if you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s a good way to outline what kind of treatments you would want or not want in a variety of situations. The POLST, or Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment, is a specific medical order signed by a doctor, based on a conversation with you about your current health and wishes. It details specific treatments you want or don't want right now, and it’s typically used by people with serious illnesses or frailty. It is a portable medical order that EMTs and other healthcare providers can easily follow. Essentially, the Advance Directive is more about your overall values, while the POLST is a more specific set of orders. Given your circumstances, and what you’ve told me about wanting to avoid prolonged suffering, it sounds like both might be helpful. We can complete an Advance Directive to outline your values, and then discuss creating a POLST to detail specific orders. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Hmm. I suppose… both would provide a greater degree of clarity. If the POLST is more immediate, then it would be beneficial to have that in place, just in case. But I confess, I find the entire process rather… unsettling. The thought of outlining specific medical interventions… it’s rather morbid, isn’t it? But I suppose, if it provides peace of mind to my husband… and ensures my wishes are respected… then I am willing to proceed. Perhaps we should start with the POLST, then? It seems the more pressing of the two. But please, Doctor, let us keep it concise. I do not wish to dwell on the details of… unpleasant procedures.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. We will absolutely keep it concise, and we'll go at your pace. We don't need to dwell on anything that makes you uncomfortable. The POLST form has a series of questions about different medical treatments. We'll simply go through them one by one, and you can tell me your wishes. The first question is about CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation. If your heart were to stop beating, would you want us to attempt CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… Honestly, the thought of being… jolted back to life… it’s rather terrifying. And if it’s simply to prolong suffering, then no. Absolutely not. I do not wish to be revived if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. I prefer a peaceful passing, if my time comes. So, no, Doctor. I do not want CPR attempted.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. No CPR. That’s perfectly clear. The next question is about intubation – a procedure where we insert a tube into your airway to help you breathe. If you were unable to breathe on your own, would you want us to intubate you?
PATIENT: Intubation… another unpleasant procedure. No, Doctor. I do not want to be intubated. I have made my wishes clear. If I am unable to breathe on my own, then… then it is my time. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially. Please, let us not prolong this discussion unnecessarily. It’s rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. No intubation. I understand this is distressing, and we can go as slowly as you need. We’ll skip any questions that make you particularly uncomfortable. The next question is about artificial nutrition and hydration – meaning feeding and fluids through a tube. If you were unable to eat or drink on your own, would you want us to provide those through a tube?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… another method of prolonging the inevitable. Honestly, Doctor, it's all rather… barbaric. No, I do not wish to be fed or hydrated artificially. If I am unable to eat or drink on my own, then… then I have no desire to continue living. Please, let us be done with this soon. I have a luncheon appointment, you know. This is proving to be quite a… ordeal.
DOCTOR: Okay, Marija. No artificial nutrition or hydration. I understand your feelings and we're getting through this. The next question pertains to comfort measures. If you were nearing the end of life, would you want us to focus on providing comfort and pain relief, even if it might hasten your passing?
PATIENT: Comfort measures… finally, a sensible question. Yes, Doctor, absolutely. I want to be comfortable, pain-free, and surrounded by loved ones, if possible. I want a peaceful passing, with dignity. That is all I ask. I do not wish to be subjected to unnecessary suffering. So, yes. Please, focus on comfort measures. That is my wish. Can we be finished now? I feel quite drained.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, we are almost finished. This covers the main elements of the POLST form. I'll just review everything with you to make sure it accurately reflects your wishes. So, to summarize: you do not want CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition and hydration. You want a focus on comfort measures. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly correct. Thank you for your patience. I confess, this process was rather… unsettling, but I am glad it is finished. I feel much better knowing my wishes are documented. Perhaps my husband will finally be satisfied. Can I have a copy of this form, please? And thank you again for your… understanding. I believe that concludes our business.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. Here you are. Yes, you’re very welcome. And I’m happy we were able to get this completed. Your husband will be glad to know it’s done, and I'll be sure to keep it in your chart. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. Thank you once again for your time and your… patience. I believe I have wasted enough of your afternoon. Goodbye. .
