DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 62 years of age. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning to you too, Doctor. I'm here for a tryout physical. I'm trying out for a… well, a team. It’s a bit silly at my age, I guess, but here we are. Let’s just get this over with, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. A tryout physical – excellent. It's never too late to pursue an activity you enjoy. To ensure I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little more about the team and the type of physical activity involved?
PATIENT: It's… a Mongolian wrestling team. You know, bukh. Pretty rough stuff, lots of grappling. Not like… fancy boxing or anything. Mostly just strength and… well, throwing each other around. I haven't done it seriously in years, though. Just keeping myself busy, you know? Trying not to get too old. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kingan, that is very helpful. Mongolian wrestling—bukh—requiring significant strength and grappling. To proceed, let's gather some information about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any pain currently – anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really… constant pain, no. My knees get a bit creaky in the mornings, especially if it’s cold. And my shoulder, the left one, sometimes aches after I do… anything strenuous, really. But it's just old age, I figure. Nothing to worry about, hopefully. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. Creaky knees and shoulder aches are certainly common with increased activity and age. To clarify, when you say strenuous activity, could you give me a specific example of what brings on the shoulder pain?
PATIENT: Uh… like, lifting heavy things. Or… just trying to throw someone around, honestly. Even practicing some of the moves. It's not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache that builds up. It's been happening on and off for a few months now, I guess. I just thought I was pushing myself too hard. I don’t want to bother you with old man problems.
DOCTOR: It’s not a bother at all, Mr. Kingan. Understanding the details of your discomfort is crucial. Now, let's briefly review your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise, actually. I haven’t really been to a doctor in… well, a long time, to be honest. Maybe ten years? I try to stay active, eat reasonably well, you know, the usual. No major problems that I’m aware of. Just getting old, like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Kingan. Staying active and eating well are excellent habits. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I broke my arm when I was a kid, fell out of a tree, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. Definitely nothing that would stop me from… wrestling, hopefully. Is this all the questions you have? I’m starting to feel a little… antsy.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kingan, we’re nearly finished with the preliminary questions. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamin D in the winter. The sun's not what it used to be, you know? And sometimes I take ibuprofen if my knees are really bothering me. But that’s it. Nothing regular. Honestly, I try to avoid pills as much as possible. They never seem to do much good anyway. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kingan, that is perfectly alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. I eat pretty much anything. Never had any reactions to anything. My wife – she was always the one with the allergies, poor thing. But me? I can handle anything. I think. Is that it? Can we get this over with? I'm ready for the physical part, if you are. I just want to know if I’m too old for this.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Yes, Mr. Kingan, let’s proceed with the physical examination. I'd like to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll assess your range of motion, strength, and listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that sounds fine. Just… get it over with, alright? The sooner I know if I’m too old to be throwing people around, the better. Let’s go.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. First, let’s take your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this moment. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’d like you to stand up for me, if you’re able. Can you rotate your shoulders for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. There we go. Left one's a bit… tight. Like I said, it gets stiff easily. Not much to it.
DOCTOR: I noticed a slight restriction in your left shoulder range of motion, and you mentioned some discomfort. Now, let's check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that good enough? My grip isn’t what it used to be, I’ll admit. Years of… not wrestling.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Kingan. Grip strength is 4 out of 5 bilaterally, slightly diminished but within acceptable limits. Now, I’d like to check your lower extremity strength. Could you please extend your legs against my resistance?
PATIENT: There. That’s about as much as I got right now. Knees are a little creaky, you know? Getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kingan. Leg extension is 4 out of 5 bilaterally. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Finally, let's assess your spine. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Nope. Can’t quite get there anymore. Back’s not as flexible as it used to be. There. That’s about it. Is that enough? Can you tell me if I’m too old for this wrestling thing now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Thank you for completing the examination. Based on my examination, you have mild age-related decline in strength and flexibility, which is expected. Your vital signs are stable, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Your reflexes and heart and lungs sounds are normal. However, your shoulder discomfort and limited range of motion warrant further evaluation. While you may be able to participate in wrestling, I recommend caution and gradual progression. To be safe, I would like to order an X-ray of your left shoulder to rule out any underlying issues such as arthritis or rotator cuff tendinitis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Hmm. That sounds… serious. I just want to know if I can wrestle, not get a bunch of tests done. But… if you think it’s necessary… I guess. Better safe than sorry, right? I don’t want to break anything. Yeah, alright, go ahead and order the X-ray. Let’s just get this over with. And can you tell me, honestly, do you think I’m too old for this?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kingan, I understand your hesitation. The X-ray is simply a precautionary measure to ensure there are no underlying structural issues contributing to your shoulder discomfort. It will help us determine the best course of action. Honestly, based on my assessment, your age itself isn’t necessarily a contraindication to wrestling. However, your reduced strength and flexibility, combined with your shoulder discomfort, increase your risk of injury. I recommend starting with a very gradual training program, focusing on strengthening and flexibility exercises. It would also be beneficial to consult with a physical therapist to develop a personalized program and learn proper techniques to minimize your risk of injury. While I can't definitively say whether or not you should wrestle, I strongly advise proceeding with caution and listening to your body. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… alright. That sounds… reasonable. So, no firm "no," but definitely “be careful.” I guess that’s fair. Okay. So, the X-ray, then the physical therapist… and I should listen to my body. Got it. Is there anything else I need to do? Any blood tests or anything? Because honestly, the thought of more tests is making me tired. I just want to wrestle, or know for sure I can’t. Is it possible to just… try it and see? I’m a stubborn old man, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kingan. While blood tests aren't necessary at this time, I strongly advise against simply "trying it and seeing" without proper evaluation and guidance. Starting too aggressively could lead to a significant injury, which would unfortunately sideline you for much longer. I can provide you with a referral to a physical therapist experienced in sports rehabilitation. They can assess your current condition, develop a tailored training program, and monitor your progress to ensure you’re not pushing yourself too hard. Once you've completed a few sessions with the physical therapist and are feeling stronger and more confident, we can reassess your situation and discuss whether or not you're ready to gradually reintroduce wrestling-specific activities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Physical therapist it is. You’re probably right. I don't need to be breaking any bones at my age. Just… make the referral, please. And can I at least get a copy of the X-ray results so I know what's going on? I like to know these things. And… is that all for today, Doctor? I'm ready to go home.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. I completely understand your desire to be informed. I will ensure you receive a copy of the X-ray results as soon as they are available. Yes, that concludes our visit for today. I've provided you with a referral to Physical Therapy, and I'll also send over some information about shoulder strengthening exercises you can start doing gently in the meantime. Please schedule an appointment with the physical therapist as soon as possible. And remember, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Kingan. I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate it. Hopefully, this physical therapist can work some magic. I just want to wrestle, you know? Okay. I’ll… I’ll schedule the appointment. Thanks again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I hope the physical therapy proves beneficial. .
