DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling quite unwell after eating fava beans. My skin and eyes are yellowing, and I just feel really tired and weak. It started a few days ago, and it's getting worse.
DOCTOR: I see. Yellowing of the skin and eyes, fatigue, and weakness, and it seems to be correlated with consuming fava beans. That is unusual, but certainly provides us with a starting point. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the yellowing in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like… bright yellow, you know? It’s more of a… dull, sort of jaundiced color. It's easiest to see in my eyes, I think. And my skin just looks… pale and a bit sickly. It’s hard to explain. I hadn’t really noticed it on my skin until someone pointed it out. It wasn’t sudden, it just… appeared over a couple of days. Is that… normal? I've never had anything like this happen before.
DOCTOR: That’s a very helpful description, Ms. Haggar – “dull, jaundiced color” and appearing gradually over a couple of days. It's good that you noticed it wasn't sudden. Jaundice, as you describe it, can indicate a number of things, and the connection to the fava beans is particularly interesting. To get a clearer picture, let’s delve a little deeper into your history. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, no abdominal pain, thankfully. I haven’t been sick at all, no vomiting or nausea. My stool… I don't think so. It's been… normal, as far as I can tell. Maybe a little paler than usual, now that you mention it, but I wasn't sure if that was just me imagining things. Everything feels a bit off, so it's hard to say what's normal anymore. I haven’t been eating much, either, because I just don’t feel up to it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no abdominal pain, no vomiting, stool color slightly paler than usual, and decreased appetite. That helps narrow things down. Now, have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills, and definitely no body aches. Just… tired. Really, really tired. It’s not like a normal tired, it’s… like my bones are tired. Does that make sense? And I just feel weak, even after sleeping. I haven’t been able to do much at all these past few days. It’s quite worrying, honestly. I’m usually very active.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Haggar. “Bone tired” is a very descriptive way to put it, and it is certainly concerning that this is interfering with your usual activity level. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, liver problems, or any autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've been generally very healthy my whole life. I don't have any known medical conditions. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalized for anything in… well, ever, I think. And I don’t take any regular medications. I sometimes take something for a headache, but that’s about it. Just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Haggar. No pre-existing conditions and no regular medications. And have you ever had any surgeries or major medical procedures?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had any surgeries or major procedures. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Just the usual check-ups with the dentist and things like that. I’ve always avoided hospitals if I could. This whole situation is… unsettling. I’ve never felt like this before, and I don’t understand what’s going on. Is it possible it’s something I ate besides the fava beans? I’ve been eating pretty normally otherwise.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Ms. Haggar. It’s unsettling to experience new symptoms, especially when you’ve been healthy most of your life. We'll get to the bottom of this. While the fava beans are a strong lead, it’s always good to consider other possibilities. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as liver disease, anemia, or any blood disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My mother had some problems with her gallbladder when she was older, she had to have it removed. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he was always a bit… sickly, I think. He had some kind of anemia, I think my mother told me, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very interested in medical things as a child. I don’t think anyone else in the family had any serious illnesses. Mostly just the usual things – heart problems, arthritis… nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder issues in your mother and anemia in your grandfather. That's helpful information. And lastly, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… well, I’m single. I live alone. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I work as a receptionist at a doctor’s office – ironically enough! I’ve been there for about ten years. I don’t travel much. Mostly, I just enjoy reading and gardening. I haven’t been around anyone who’s been sick recently, as far as I know. Is that the sort of thing you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Haggar, that is exactly the sort of thing I meant. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, just to confirm, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I haven’t ever had a problem with medications. I’m usually very careful with what I eat, but I haven’t had to worry about allergies or anything like that. I’m really starting to worry about this fava bean thing, though. It seems so strange. Is it common to get sick like this from food?
DOCTOR: It is unusual, Ms. Haggar, but not entirely unheard of. The connection to the fava beans is highly suggestive of a condition called Favism. It’s a genetic deficiency of an enzyme called G6PD, which makes individuals susceptible to hemolysis – the breakdown of red blood cells – when exposed to certain triggers, fava beans being a common one. To confirm this, we’ll need to do some blood tests. I’d like to check your G6PD levels, a complete blood count to assess your red blood cells, and also some liver function tests to rule out any other potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds sensible. I mean, I trust your judgment, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on and what I can do to feel better. I haven’t felt this weak in years. Are the tests… painful? I’m not a fan of needles.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Haggar. It’s a very quick pinch, and most people don’t find it particularly painful. We’ll use a small needle and take just a few vials of blood. Our phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as possible. I'll also order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, just to get a complete picture. While we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods that might be potential triggers. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and then we can formulate a plan. Now, let's proceed with the blood draw. I’ll have the nurse come in and get everything set up. After that, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Avoid fava beans… I can definitely do that! I don't think I’ll be eating those anytime soon. And a physical exam is fine, too. Whatever you think is necessary. I just want to get this sorted out. Please, let’s get the tests done. I'm starting to feel a bit anxious, to be honest. Is it… serious? I’m worried about what the results might show.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Ms. Haggar. I will be upfront: Favism can cause a range of symptoms, from mild fatigue to more serious complications like anemia and jaundice. However, it's often manageable with proper diagnosis and avoidance of triggers. It's important to remember that we don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet, and the blood tests will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. I’ll explain everything clearly once we have the results. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’ll begin with the physical exam. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. It will be a quick and painless examination. If you could please lie down on the table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ll lie down. It's just… it's all a bit overwhelming, isn't it? I've never been this sick before, and I’m not good with medical things. I trust you, of course, but it’s still scary. Please, just tell me everything clearly, like you said. I want to understand what’s going on, and what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Haggar. I completely understand your apprehension, and I assure you I will explain everything in clear, understandable terms. That's my priority. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular and strong, with no murmurs or irregularities. Your lung sounds are clear on both sides, with no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender, with no guarding or rebound tenderness. I do note a slight enlargement of your spleen, which could be a sign of increased red blood cell breakdown. However, we need the blood tests to confirm this. As I suspected, your sclera are noticeably yellowed, indicating jaundice. This, along with your fatigue and the slight splenic enlargement, supports the possibility of Favism. However, we need to rule out other potential causes before making a definitive diagnosis. Alright, Ms. Haggar, that concludes the physical exam. We now have a better understanding of your condition, but the blood tests are crucial for confirming the diagnosis and determining the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the samples. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Splenic enlargement… is that bad? And jaundice… is that permanent? I’m worried about being yellow all the time. This is all very frightening. But thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes it a little less scary. I just… I hope it’s not too serious. I really don’t want to be sick forever. I’m a bit nervous about the blood draw, too. Will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to feel anxious, Ms. Haggar, and you’re asking very important questions. The splenic enlargement, while concerning, is often reversible with proper treatment and avoidance of triggers. It simply means your spleen is working harder to remove damaged red blood cells. As for the jaundice, it's not necessarily permanent. Once the underlying cause is addressed – in this case, potentially Favism – and the red blood cell breakdown is stopped, the jaundice should subside. It may take some time, but it's usually not a lasting condition. And regarding the blood draw, it shouldn't hurt a lot. It's a quick pinch, and the phlebotomist is very skilled at minimizing discomfort. You might feel a slight stinging sensation, but it should be brief. Deep breathing and relaxation techniques can also help. Let’s focus on getting the blood tests done first. Once we have the results, we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on and can formulate a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, try to stay calm and rest. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I’m just… really anxious. But thank you. Thank you for being so patient and explaining everything so clearly. I’m glad I came to see you. I trust you’ll do your best to help me. I’ll try to stay calm and rest, like you said. I guess I’ll just… wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Haggar. That's what I'm here for. And you’ve made the right decision by coming to see me. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this and get you feeling better. Nurse, could you please come in and draw Ms. Haggar’s blood?
