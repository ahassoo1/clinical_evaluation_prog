DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And…hungry. Constantly. It’s quite disruptive, really. I just…feel like I’m always needing something to eat or drink.
DOCTOR: Okay, disruptive is a good way to put it. Constant thirst and hunger… alright. Can you tell me a bit more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… it's been… perhaps a month, now? Maybe a little longer. It didn’t start suddenly, more of a gradual thing. I just noticed I was refilling my water glass more and more, and…well, snacking more, too. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it began, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, a gradual onset. And has anything changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Not that I can readily recall. Divorced a few months before that, mind you, but…that's been settled. Work’s been the same – shipping and receiving, keeps me busy enough. No new medications, no big changes in diet… I suppose I've been a bit more stressed lately, if I'm honest, but that’s just…life, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, shipping and receiving…that can be physically demanding work. Stress, we can certainly explore that further. Besides the increased thirst and hunger, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... Now that you mention it, I have been feeling rather tired. More so than usual, I mean. I put it down to the work, and, well, everything else, but perhaps it's connected. And… occasionally, I feel a bit…fuzzy headed, if that makes sense. Not a headache, exactly, just…not quite as sharp as I normally am.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a bit of mental fogginess alongside the thirst and hunger. Have you noticed any changes in your weight—either gaining or losing weight recently?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. I hadn’t really thought about it. I think I’ve maybe lost a pound or two? It’s hard to say, I don’t weigh myself regularly. My trousers might be a bit looser, now that you ask. But I wouldn’t swear to it. It could just be my imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright, potential slight weight loss. And have you noticed any changes in how often you’re urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s…yes, more often. I've been going to the lavatory quite a bit more, particularly at night. It’s a nuisance, really. Disrupts my sleep, it does. I hadn’t connected that to the thirst, but…it makes sense, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination, especially at night… and thirst. Alright, I'm going to need to ask you some further questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. First, any family history of diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes… let me think. My mother's side… my grandmother, I believe, had it. Type 2, I think it was. She was a bit older when she was diagnosed, though. Not like me, being… well, 32. I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. My parents aren’t around anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of Type 2 diabetes. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I haven't needed much in the way of medication, thankfully. Just the occasional painkiller for a bad back, but nothing regularly. No reactions, ever.
DOCTOR: And what about current medications?
PATIENT: None, Doctor. As I said, nothing at all. Just…a bit of ibuprofen now and again when my back acts up. That’s it. I try to avoid taking anything if I can, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. Alright, let's do a quick exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your feet and do a basic neurological exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this. And preferably, quickly. I have a shipment arriving later this afternoon I need to oversee.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don’t mind, please sit back and relax. First, let's check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Not drastically so, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Heart and lungs sound clear. Pulses are present, but a little weak. I’m noting a slight decrease in sensation in both of your feet. Nothing alarming, but something to be aware of. Now, I'm just going to do a quick reflex test…
PATIENT: Right. I hadn’t noticed anything wrong with my feet, to be honest. I’m on them all day, you see, shipping and receiving. I just assumed it was…tiredness. What does the diminished sensation mean, Doctor? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are intact, which is good. Diminished sensation can be associated with prolonged pressure on the feet, as you said, from being on them all day. However, it can also be a sign of nerve damage, which can be associated with elevated blood sugar levels over time. That’s why I want to run a few blood tests to get a clearer picture. I want to check your blood glucose, your A1C – which gives us an average of your blood sugar over the last few months – and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests. A1C, you said? Right. As long as it doesn't take too long, Doctor. I really need to be back at work this afternoon. What sort of timeframe are we talking about? And… is it likely to be something serious? I'm not keen on worrying about things unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: The lab is usually pretty quick. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. Results should be back within a couple of hours, hopefully before your shipment arrives. As for whether it’s serious… it’s too early to say. The symptoms you’re describing – increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, potential weight loss – are consistent with diabetes, but they can also be caused by other things. The blood tests will give us the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. We'll be checking for elevated blood sugar, and other markers as well. In the meantime, try to drink water as you normally would, but don’t overdo it. And try not to stress too much. We’ll get this sorted out. Do you have any questions for me before we get the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you would. I appreciate you explaining things so clearly. It puts my mind at ease somewhat. Where do I go for the blood draw? Is it here in the clinic?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It’s right down the hall, room 3. The phlebotomist, Maria, is expecting you. She’ll take excellent care of you. After the blood draw, just come back here and we’ll wait for the results together. I’ll have the nurse prepare a room for us. Down that hallway, first door on the left. Just let them know you're here for Dr. Chora's tests. And again, try not to worry. We’ll have answers soon.
PATIENT: Right. Room 3. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
