DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this… fad. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps going on about it. Medical marijuana, she calls it. Says it'll help with… well, with everything. Frankly, I think it's a waste of time, but she's quite insistent, and I do have a bit of trouble sleeping these days. So, here I am. I suppose I need a… permission slip, as it were, to try it, if it's truly necessary.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re considering medical marijuana primarily for sleep difficulties, as suggested by your daughter. And you’d like my professional opinion on whether it’s appropriate for you. To best assess that, Ms. Ranells, I’m going to need a bit more information. First, how long have you been experiencing trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, a good while now. Years, I suspect. It comes and goes, you see. Sometimes I sleep like a baby, other times…well, let’s just say I’m acquainted with every hour of the night. It’s not constant, mind you. But it's… inconvenient. And I simply don't have the energy for it anymore. I used to be able to power through, but at my age… it's different.
DOCTOR: Years, and intermittent. And you feel it's become more troublesome recently, impacting your energy levels. Are there any specific things that seem to make it worse, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, life makes it worse. Worrying, mostly. I have a rather… demanding family, you see. Always something. My son-in-law's business ventures, my grandson's… questionable choices. And the news! Honestly, it's enough to keep anyone up at night. It's not a physical ailment, you understand. It’s… stress. Pure and simple. Though, my knees do bother me sometimes, but that’s another matter entirely.
DOCTOR: So, the insomnia is largely related to stress and worry about family matters, with some occasional knee discomfort. To get a more complete picture, Ms. Ranells, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Doctor, are you implying I'm… unwell? I assure you, I’m quite healthy for my age. I’ve always been… robust. But, very well. I had my tonsils out as a child, a bout of the flu a few years back. Nothing serious. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a horse. A long time ago. I don’t go to doctors often. I prefer to… manage. I take a little something for my blood pressure now and then, but honestly, it fluctuates. It's probably just nerves, you know?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood, a broken wrist, and intermittent blood pressure management. Do you recall what medication you take for your blood pressure when you take it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, I don't recall the name. A little white pill, I believe. My daughter handles all that. She's very organized, thank heavens. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to those things. I just take it when she tells me to. It’s not as if I enjoy being a patient, you understand. I prefer to be… proactive. But sometimes, one needs a little assistance. Though, I suspect this whole medical marijuana business is rather… exaggerated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, with all due respect, it’s important for me to have accurate information about any medications you are taking, even if it's just occasionally. It can interact with other things, and it's crucial for your safety. Do you have any way to find out the name of this blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my judgment? I assure you, my daughter would never give me anything harmful. She's a very responsible young woman. And frankly, I find this line of questioning rather… insulting. I came here for a permission slip, not an interrogation. If you're not willing to simply write the prescription, I suppose I can go elsewhere. I have other doctors, you know. Though, I must say, your bedside manner leaves much to be desired.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I understand your frustration. However, my primary responsibility is to ensure your health and safety. Prescribing any medication without knowing your full medical history, including all medications you’re taking, would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I am not questioning your daughter’s intentions, but I am obligated to gather complete information. Given your reluctance to provide details about your blood pressure medication, and your concerns about medical marijuana, I recommend that we explore other options for addressing your sleep difficulties. Perhaps a referral to a sleep specialist would be beneficial?
PATIENT: A sleep specialist? Doctor, with all due respect, that is absurd. I simply want a little something to help me relax. My daughter says this marijuana works wonders. You're making this far too complicated. I will speak to another physician, one who understands that I am a grown woman capable of making my own decisions. I do not need a lecture on bedside manner or a referral to a specialist. Good day.
