DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh... good morning, Doctor. I been... coughing. A lot. And tired, always tired. Feels like... something in my chest, always. And my nose... gets blocked, like, every few weeks. Bad blocked. It's been going on... a while now. I dunno how long, exactly.
DOCTOR: "A while now," alright. That isn't particularly helpful, unfortunately. Can you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Uh... maybe... six months? Or more? Things kinda blur together, you know? I work... outside a lot. With the tires. Dusty work. Maybe it started around then? I dunno. Sorry. It's hard to remember. It just... got worse slowly. Then better a little, then worse again. Just kinda... like that.
DOCTOR: Dusty work, yes. And the coughing... is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: Uh... not dry. There's... stuff. Yeah. Like... mucus. Sometimes clear, sometimes... yellowish. Not much, usually. Just a little bit when I cough hard. Sorry. It's not a pretty thing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It’s what I’m here for, Mr. Tati. And yellowish mucus is... typical with many things. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this?
PATIENT: Fever... uh... sometimes I feel warm. But I dunno if it’s fever warm. Like, when I’m really tired, maybe. Not every time. And no chills... no. And... night sweats? No, I don’t think so. My wife would say something if I was all sweaty at night, right? She notices things.
DOCTOR: Your wife sounds observant. Alright. Have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really… unless I'm running. Then yeah, of course I get breathless. But just walking? Normal stuff? No. Maybe a little sometimes, when the cough is really bad… like I can’t catch my breath after coughing, but… it goes away quick. Just feels… tight, maybe?
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, Doctor. Never. My father… he smoked. Very bad for him. I never started. No, no smoking.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… uh… not sure. I get a runny nose sometimes when the flowers are blooming… but everyone does, right? And dust, I guess, from work. Itchy eyes sometimes, but… I dunno if that's an allergy. Never been to a doctor about allergies. It’s just… itchy. And dust is just dust. You work with tires, you get dust.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree… but that was a long time ago. And I had the flu… a few times. Nothing else, I think. I'm pretty healthy, usually. Just this cough… and getting tired. Never been in the hospital for anything. Should I have been?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Tati, not necessarily. It's good you're generally healthy. Do you have any family history of lung problems—asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Lung problems… hmm. My grandmother… she coughed a lot when she was old. But she was old. My mother… she had asthma, I think, when she was little. But she grew out of it. My father... he smoked, like I said. He… he got sick. Very sick. But I don't know what kind of sick. It was a long time ago. It was… bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your current medications, or any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Uh… no. No medications. I don't take anything regularly. Just… painkillers, sometimes, if my back hurts from work. And... I don't think I'm allergic to anything. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I just… take the painkillers if I need them. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay… uh… what will you do? It's alright if it's quick, yeah? I gotta get back to work… the tires, you know? I got customers waiting.
DOCTOR: It will be brief, Mr. Tati. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take your temperature. Please, take a seat on the table and take a deep breath. Take a deep breath... and exhale. Again. Hmm. Slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted at this time. 130 over 85. Acceptable. Pulse is 78 and regular. 98.9 Fahrenheit. Slightly elevated, but not concerning. Your oxygen saturation is 96% on room air, which is normal. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable, although diminished breath sounds are noted.
PATIENT: Unremarkable? That's good, right? No bad news? Diminished breath sounds… what does that mean? Is that… serious? Because the tires… I need to work. My wife… we need the money.
DOCTOR: "Diminished breath sounds" simply means your lungs aren't quite as… robust as they could be. It can be caused by many things—exposure to dust, mild inflammation, even being slightly dehydrated. It’s not immediately alarming, Mr. Tati, but it does explain your cough. Given your occupation and the length of your symptoms, I suspect this is likely related to chronic dust exposure. However, to rule out other possibilities, I recommend a chest X-ray. And a complete blood count to check for any sign of infection. It's standard procedure, Mr. Tati.
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… expensive? And blood tests? I don't have insurance, Doctor. We just… can’t really afford a lot of tests right now. Are they really necessary? Maybe… maybe it’s just the dust? I could try wearing a better mask at work?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your concerns about the cost. However, it is my professional opinion that these tests are necessary to ensure we are not missing something serious. A chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and rule out any underlying conditions such as pneumonia, bronchitis, or, in a worst-case scenario, something more concerning. Continuing to work in a dusty environment without knowing the cause of your symptoms is simply irresponsible. I can provide you with a list of low-cost clinics in the area that may offer financial assistance. As for the mask, while it's a good idea, it will not address the underlying cause of your cough. I strongly recommend scheduling these tests as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Low-cost clinics… okay. That… that sounds… okay. But how long will it take to get the results? And… can I still work while I wait? We really need the money, Doctor. My wife… she's been sick too. Just a cold, but… I guess… I guess I’ll do the tests. If it's really necessary. .
DOCTOR: The results should be available within three to five business days. As for working, I advise limiting your exposure to dust as much as possible during this time. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, shortness of breath, or severe chest pain – you must seek immediate medical attention. I will write you a referral for a chest X-ray and complete blood count. Here is a list of low-cost imaging centers and labs in the area. Please schedule the appointments at your earliest convenience. I will also provide a brief summary of your symptoms and examination findings for the imaging center and lab technician. Do you have any further questions?
