DOCTOR: Hello Jimmi, good morning. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good mornin’ to you too. I… well, somethin’s just not right. Down there. It’s…leaky. That’s what my niece said. She told me to come see the doctor ‘cause it’s been goin’ on a little bit now. Not a lot, but… yeah. Leaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Leaky” is a good way to describe it, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say it's been going on for a little bit now, can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Hmm… a little bit… lemme think. Seems like… after da fiesta? Yes! After da fiesta. Maybe… two weeks? Three? Time kinda… slips away, you know? Old lady problems. It ain’t been a long time, just… noticeable now. More than usual, I guess.
DOCTOR: I do understand, time can slip away! So, about two to three weeks since the fiesta. And it’s become more noticeable recently. Okay. Can you describe what's happening?
PATIENT: Well… it’s… sticky. And smells funny. Not like me, if you know what I mean. And sometimes… sometimes there’s a little bit of… stuff. Clear stuff. Not blood, I don't think. My niece said if it's colored I gotta come right away, but it's just clear. Mostly just sticky and smelly. Like… fishy, kinda.
DOCTOR: Okay, sticky, smelly – fishy is a good way to describe it – and clear discharge. And you haven’t noticed any blood?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Not that I’ve seen. I wipe… you know. After I go. Always wipe. It’s always just clear. Sometimes nothin’ at all, but then sometimes… sticky. And… uncomfortable. It kinda itches, but not bad itchy. Just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so clear discharge, occasionally sticky, no blood, and some mild itching. That helps. Have you noticed any pain, burning, or unusual odor outside of what you’re already describing?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… not really pain. Like I said, just kinda uncomfortable. It gets… warm. Down there. Like after you been in da sun too long. And the smell... well, it’s mostly when I go. Not all the time. Sometimes I don't smell nothin'. Just… when I use da restroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, warmth and the odor occurring mostly with urination. Have you experienced anything like this before, Jimmi?
PATIENT: Eh… not like this exactly. I've had… troubles down there before. When I was younger, of course. Different troubles. Not… leaky. And smelly. That wasn't a thing. Mostly just... aches and pains. Old age, you know? This is somethin' new. And a little bit worryin'.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re letting me know about your history, and it's completely reasonable to be worried when something new comes up. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little more generally. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Eh… nothin’ really. The doctor used to tell me my pressure was a little high, years ago, but I stopped goin’ to that doctor. He was always rushin’ around. I don't take any pills or nothin'. Just… old lady stuff. Achin' joints, bad back. Nothin' serious. Never been told I got sugar or nothin' like dat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no diagnosed medical conditions and no current medications. That’s good to know. How about any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My tonsils came out when I was little. That was… a long time ago. And I had a baby, of course. Dat was a hospital stay, but dat was… well, a long, long time ago. Other than dat… nothin’. I mostly just stay home and garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and childbirth, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. And you’re mostly at home gardening, that’s nice. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Eh… no. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, mostly. My niece gave me some kinda pill once for my back, but I didn't like how it made me feel, so I stopped takin' it. Didn't have a rash or nothin', just felt… funny. But I don't got allergies to food or… dust or nothin'. I’m pretty tough, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you didn't have a reaction to the back pill you tried. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had similar problems or any kind of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Eh… my mama, she got… somethin' with her tummy. Years ago. Not cancer, not dat I remember. Just… sick tummy. She was always complainin’ about her tummy. And my brother… he had heart problems. But he smoked too much. Always smokin'. No one else… not that I remember. My family was pretty healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had stomach problems and your brother had heart issues related to smoking. Do you currently smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mama didn't like smokin'. Said it was bad for ya. I always listened to my mama. I drink a little bit of beer sometimes, when I'm watchin' the ball game, but dat’s it. Not much, just one or two.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and only light alcohol consumption. Good to know. And just to clarify, you’re currently living at home, gardening?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. I live by myself. I always have. Got a nice garden, you know? Growin’ all kinds of things. Tomatoes, peppers, mangoes… keeps me busy. No husband, no kids livin’ with me. Just me and the garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, living alone, gardening, and no immediate family living with you. That gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It'll involve just an external exam and a quick look inside, nothing too invasive. This will help me figure out what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Eh… exam? Lookin' down there? Sighs. Well… I suppose so. But be gentle, okay? I'm an old lady. And don't take too long. I got things to do. Mostly waterin’ the tomatoes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. I understand, and I’ll be as quick as possible. Let me just explain what I'm going to do... First I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll just take a look at your abdomen. Then, with a speculum and a light, I’ll gently examine the vulva and vagina. I’ll use lubrication to make it more comfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lubrication? Dat sounds… better. Dat heart and lungs thing, dat’s alright. Vulva? Is dat what you call it? Sighs again. Alright, alright. Just… hurry, okay? And don’t poke too much. It’s sensitive, you know. Just look and see what’s wrong and let me get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: I understand. I will be quick and gentle, I promise. Okay, let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. Alright, everything sounds good there. Now, let’s take a quick look at your abdomen. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Winces slightly as Dr. Kimm presses. Eh… a little bit. Right there. Not bad, but… yeah. It’s kinda tender. Like… a dull ache. Not sharp or nothin’. Just… uncomfortable. And a little bit swollen, maybe? I dunno. It's hard to tell. I get bloated sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness to palpation and possible swelling. Now, I’m going to prepare to do the pelvic exam. I’m going to ask you to bend your knees and keep your feet flat on the table. I will let you know each step as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sighs heavily. Alright… Just… be quick, okay? I got tomatoes to water. And try not to… I dunno. Just be gentle. Bend my knees, you say? Alright. Do it already. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to take a look now. Okay... I'm seeing some mild redness and some discharge. It looks like there's some inflammation. There’s no obvious sign of any masses or lesions. Everything appears to be normal structurally. It does seem like you have a bit of a vaginal infection. It could be bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. That wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: Winces and sits up carefully. No, it wasn't too bad. But… it wasn’t pleasant either. Inflammation? What does dat mean? And what's bacterial… vagino-whatsis? Sounds scary. Is it serious? Am I gonna die? And… does it mean I can’t garden? I need to garden.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s absolutely not serious. You’re not going to die. And you absolutely can still garden. Inflammation just means there's some irritation. Bacterial vaginosis, or BV, is a common infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. It's usually not serious, but it can cause discomfort and discharge. It's very treatable with antibiotics. It’s also possible it's a yeast infection, which is also very treatable with antifungal medication. To be sure which one it is, I'd like to send a sample of the discharge to the lab. It’s a quick, painless swab. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Swab? Another poke? Sighs deeply. Well… if you gotta, you gotta. Just be quick about it. I got tomatoes to water, remember? And don’t make it hurt. I'm an old lady, I bruise easy. Is dat gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Alright, that was quick. Just a little bit of discomfort, right?
PATIENT: Winces slightly. A little bit. It’s… itchy now. Just itchy. And now I gotta wait for… lab results? How long is dat gonna take? And then you gonna give me pills? What kind of pills? Will they make me sleepy? I need to be awake to garden.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, a little itchy is normal. It should go away pretty quickly. The lab results should be back in about two to three business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. Okay, the results will tell us whether it's BV or a yeast infection. If it’s BV, it's treated with antibiotics – usually metronidazole or clindamycin. Both are pills you take by mouth for about a week. They can sometimes cause a little bit of nausea or a metallic taste in your mouth, but they usually don’t make people very sleepy. If it's a yeast infection, it's treated with an antifungal pill like fluconazole, or a cream you apply to the area. In the meantime, to help with the discomfort, you can try avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear, and keeping the area clean and dry. I'm going to write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic just in case, and you can hold off on taking it until we get the lab results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Frowns, looking worried. A broad-spectrum… antibiotic? Dat sounds scary. All kinds of pills. I don’t like takin’ pills. What if they mess up my stomach? And I gotta hold off? What if it gets worse while I’m waitin’? And I don’t wanna mess up my garden! I need to get back to waterin’ the tomatoes. What if I just… try some kinda tea? My niece always says tea fixes everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. A broad-spectrum antibiotic just means it covers a wide range of bacteria. I wouldn't prescribe it if I wasn't confident it was the best option. And it's important to remember that antibiotics aren't always necessary. If it turns out it's a yeast infection, you won’t need it at all. And while tea can be soothing, unfortunately, it won’t clear up this type of infection. I’m happy to discuss potential side effects with you, and we can adjust the medication if you experience any issues. But waiting a few days to get the results will help us make the most accurate diagnosis and get you the right treatment. It's much better to be sure before starting any medication. To reassure you, I can also give you a referral to a gynecologist if you would feel more comfortable getting a second opinion. Would that be something you would like?
PATIENT: Sighs deeply, rubbing her forehead. A gynecologist? More doctors? No, no, I don't want more doctors. Too much pokin’ and proddin’. I just want to be able to garden. And not itch. And maybe not take any pills. But… if you really think I need ‘em, and it’ll make it stop itchin’, alright. But promise me they won’t mess up my stomach. And promise me I can still garden. And call me as soon as you know, okay? I got tomatoes to water!
DOCTOR: I promise I’ll do everything I can to make sure you feel comfortable. I’ll write you a prescription for a low-dose antibiotic. It's usually well-tolerated, but if you experience any stomach upset, please call me immediately, and we can adjust the dosage or switch to a different medication. And yes, you can absolutely still garden. Just wash your hands well after working in the soil, and avoid strenuous activity for a day or two while you're getting used to the medication. I will call you as soon as the lab results are back, which should be in about two to three business days. And if your symptoms worsen before then, please don’t hesitate to call me. Here's the prescription, and a handout with information about bacterial vaginosis. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Takes the prescription and handout cautiously. Alright. Wash hands… avoid strenuous activity… garden… okay. And you’re sure it won’t mess up my stomach? Looks skeptical. I don't think so… not right now. Just… call me as soon as you know, okay? I gotta go water my tomatoes. And thank you… I guess. Gets up slowly, looking relieved to be leaving.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll call you as soon as I have the results. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Have a good day, Jimmi, and enjoy your garden! .
