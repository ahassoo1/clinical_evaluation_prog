DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve been having this… pressure in my bladder. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s definitely uncomfortable and quite frequent. It’s been disrupting things a bit, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frequent bladder pressure… alright. And how long exactly have you been experiencing this discomfort, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started around the middle of July, I believe. So, roughly three weeks, maybe a little longer. It was gradual at first, just noticing I needed to go a bit more often, but it’s definitely increased in the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you describe the sensation a little more precisely?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain... it's not a sharp pain, like a urinary tract infection I had years ago. It’s more like a fullness, a constant feeling that I need to urinate, even when I’ve just gone. It’s… insistent, I suppose. And sometimes, especially when I'm standing for a while, it feels like something is pressing down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a better idea. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this—anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I have been feeling a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to work being busy lately. Oh, and I’ve been drinking more water, trying to help with the… fullness, I suppose. I haven't noticed any pain when I urinate, or any fever or chills, thankfully. My appetite is normal, and, well, everything else seems… regular, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: No fever, normal appetite... alright. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, thankfully not. Everything is… consistent in that department, if you don’t mind me being so blunt, Doctor. I haven't had any trouble with constipation or anything like that. I apologize for the detail, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Please, don’t apologize. Thoroughness is appreciated. Now, let's move onto a bit of your medical history. Have you had any prior medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I had pneumonia when I was a child, but that was many years ago and I recovered fully. And I had the aforementioned urinary tract infection about ten years ago, but it was easily treated with antibiotics. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I do have slightly high blood pressure, diagnosed about five years ago, and I take medication for it – Lisinopril, 20mg daily. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… yes, that is relevant. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was 16. And I had a C-section with my son, eight years ago. Those are the only two surgeries I’ve ever had, Doctor. I remember being quite nervous about both, but they both went smoothly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: My mother has type 2 diabetes, and my father had heart disease. His side of the family has a history of it, unfortunately. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had bladder problems later in life, though I don’t know the specifics. She just… always seemed to be going to the bathroom, if that makes sense. It wasn’t ever formally diagnosed, as far as I know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It is. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat all types of food, and I’ve taken many different medications over the years without issue. I do get mosquito bites, naturally, but that's hardly an allergy!
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Definitely not. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – and I’ve never used any recreational drugs. I consider myself very health-conscious, despite the high blood pressure, and I try to take good care of myself. It’s just this bladder issue that’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Creagh. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle pelvic exam to rule out any obvious abnormalities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a physical exam. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I’ll do my best to be cooperative.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please lie down on the table, we'll begin with listening to your abdomen. I’m going to use the stethoscope here… and take a deep breath for me… Good. And another deep breath… Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’m going to need you to bend your knees and relax. I will perform a gentle pelvic exam now. Let me know if you experience any discomfort. … No obvious masses or tenderness… Bladder feels full, as expected… Reflexes seem normal… Okay. That wasn’t particularly revealing, but it’s important to rule things out. Now, I’d like to order a urinalysis, and a urine culture to check for any infection. We should also run a complete blood count to get a baseline. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. A urinalysis, culture, and blood count all seem like good ideas. I trust your judgement. What do we do while we wait for the results? Should I be restricting my fluids, or is there anything I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Alright. For now, don't restrict fluids drastically, but try to avoid excessive caffeine and alcohol, as those can irritate the bladder. And keep a detailed log of your urination – how often you go, the amount each time, and any associated symptoms like pain or urgency. If you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. We'll review the results as soon as they are available – should be within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I'm not overly concerned about a serious infection, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s very thorough. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Keeping a log sounds manageable, and I’ll be mindful of the caffeine and alcohol. 24-48 hours… alright. I suppose I’ll just try to be patient and wait. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I feel a little more reassured now, knowing we’re taking steps to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll have the lab results sent directly to me and my staff will contact you as soon as they are available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if anything changes or worsens, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’ll also provide you with a printed summary of today’s visit and the ordered tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds excellent. A printed summary is very helpful. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your kindness and professionalism. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor Murtic. .
