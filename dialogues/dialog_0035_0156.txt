DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jase. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Alzoubi. Um… it’s my stomach, I think. It’s been… well, not good. Lots of… going to the bathroom. Like, a lot. It’s been going on for a while now, but it’s getting… more frequent, if that makes sense? I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. Sorry, I’m terrible with dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Frequent bowel movements, and it’s been getting worse. Not remembering exactly when it started is perfectly alright, don’t worry about it. Can you describe what the stool looks like?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is embarrassing. It's… watery, mostly. Sometimes there’s… stuff in it, but I don’t really… want to talk about it. It’s just… not normal. Really loose, you know? And it happens several times a day. It's exhausting, honestly. I feel like I can't leave the house.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s uncomfortable to talk about, and that’s alright. “Watery” and loose stools several times a day – that gives us a starting point. Do you have any pain or cramping with the bowel movements, or afterwards?
PATIENT: Sometimes. It’s not… sharp pain, exactly. More like… a really uncomfortable squeezing feeling in my stomach. It comes and goes. And afterwards, I just feel… drained. Like all the energy’s been sucked out of me. It's worse in the mornings, I think. But honestly, the whole thing is just… bleh.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping with the loose stools, particularly in the mornings, and then feeling drained afterwards. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t really… looked, to be honest. I know, that sounds awful, right? It's just… I try to avoid looking. It’s not a pleasant thought. I think I might have seen… a little bit of red once or twice, but I figured it was just something I ate.
DOCTOR: It's alright, it’s a common reaction to avoid looking. Even a small amount of blood warrants checking. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And… I get a little queasy sometimes, like I might throw up, but I haven't actually been sick. Just… feel a bit off, you know? Kind of weak and shaky. But no throwing up or anything. It's mostly just… the bathroom thing. And feeling tired. A lot of tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, just occasional nausea, feeling weak, shaky and very tired along with the frequent bowel movements. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. I’ve been to the doctor a few times, obviously, but… I don’t really remember what they said. I think… something about my stomach when I was a kid? And something about being sensitive to certain foods? My husband usually handles all that paperwork, so I don’t really keep track. He mentioned something about… IBD? Or Celiac? One of those. Does that ring a bell? I'm really bad with medical terms.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible past issues with your stomach and mention of IBD or Celiac disease. That’s helpful. Do you know if you’ve ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… maybe when I was really little? Something with my tonsils, I think my mom said. But that was ages ago. I don’t remember it at all. And I haven’t had anything since then, as far as I know. Again, my husband probably knows better. He remembers everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. No recent surgeries, tonsil removal possibly in childhood. And now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members have any stomach problems, like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or Celiac disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… my aunt, on my mom’s side, she’s always had a sensitive stomach. She’s always complaining about it. I think she was diagnosed with… something? But I don’t know what. And my grandfather… he had something really bad, years ago. He was always in and out of the hospital. I think it was to do with his digestion, but again… details are fuzzy. No one really talks about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, aunt with a sensitive stomach and grandfather with past digestive issues. Lastly, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Just a regular multivitamin, I think. And… I take something for heartburn sometimes, when it gets really bad. It's just over-the-counter stuff. As for allergies… not that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything recently. I'm not really one for taking a lot of pills. Does that help? I feel bad that I can’t remember more.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, occasional over-the-counter heartburn medication, and no known allergies. Alright, Jase. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. I'm a bit of a wimp, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the exam table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax. Okay. I'm listening now… I hear some bowel sounds, which is normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain. A little tender here… on your lower left side. Nothing alarming, but it’s good to note. Your abdomen isn’t distended, and I don’t feel any masses. Do you feel any pain when I press here now?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, a little bit. Not bad bad, but… yeah, definitely something there. It feels… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, almost. It's been like that for a while, I think. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache on the lower left side. It’s likely related to your symptoms. Given your history of frequent bowel movements, the tenderness, and the family history, it could be a few things. It could be related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or possibly a mild flare-up of something like diverticulitis, but we need to rule some other things out. I’m going to order some blood work and a stool sample test to check for infection and inflammation. We'll also do a urine test just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… stool sample? Okay. Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. How long will it take to get the results? And… is it going to be expensive? My insurance… it's not always the greatest.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 2-3 business days. As for cost, I’ll have the billing department check your insurance coverage and give you an estimate before we proceed with anything. They can also discuss payment options if needed. Medicare should cover most of it, but it's always best to double-check. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – things like rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Also, stay well-hydrated. If you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… bland diet, stay hydrated, and watch for a fever or blood. And check with billing. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you, Dr. Alzoubi. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I feel a little better just knowing what we’re looking for. Where do I go to get the tests done?
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Jase. The lab is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist there will have all the paperwork and instructions. They'll send the results directly to me. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Does Tuesday at 2pm work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2pm… Yes, that should be fine. Thank you again, Dr. Alzoubi. I think that’s everything. I’ll go get the tests done now.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Just let them know it's for Dr. Alzoubi. Get well soon, Jase.
