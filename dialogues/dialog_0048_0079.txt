DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Hainley, yes?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. Look, I don’t usually come to doctors, so let’s just get this over with quickly if we can, okay? It’s just… this bruising is getting a bit much.
DOCTOR: Bruising, you say. Alright. And where exactly are we seeing this bruising?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms and legs. It started small, like little spots, but now… well, yesterday I bumped into the coffee table and it turned into a purple mess. And I barely touched it. It feels… weird. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, the one Dr. Lee prescribed after my… never mind. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, yes. And you said Dr. Lee prescribed it after… what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, it was… a blood clot in my leg. A while back. It’s fine now, mostly. I just take the pills to, you know, keep another one from happening. But like I said, this bruising… it’s new. And it's a lot easier than it used to be. I don’t remember hitting myself that hard.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your records… Dr. Lee, yes. Deep vein thrombosis, treated six months ago, currently on warfarin. Alright. And how much warfarin are you taking daily?
PATIENT: Umm… hold on. Let me think… I have the bottle somewhere… Okay, here it is. 5 milligrams. Every evening. I usually remember. Sometimes I’m a little late, but never miss more than a day. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It can. And aside from the occasional missed dose, have you had any other changes in your medications or diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been eating pretty much the same stuff. More fruit lately, because my sister keeps telling me to. But that's it. No new pills, no weird supplements, nothing. Look, I know I should probably be more on top of this stuff, but I just… don't have the time. Is this bruising something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, easy bruising can be a side effect of warfarin, especially if the dosage isn't quite right. We need to rule out other causes, though. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you roll up your sleeves and your pant legs, please?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with, okay? I have stuff to do. And please don’t poke me too much. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just palpating your limbs, checking for tenderness or swelling. The bruising appears widespread, as you said. No significant swelling at this time, but there is some tenderness to the touch here… and here. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s a little sore. Not awful, but definitely noticeable. It feels… kind of like a dull ache, actually. And it's been like that for a few days, even when nothing's happened. Is this because of the pills? Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It could be related to the warfarin, as I mentioned. But easy bruising with unexplained pain warrants further investigation. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel – that will check your INR levels, to see how well your blood is clotting, and rule out any other underlying issues. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve had blood work done before, plenty of times. It always makes me feel a bit faint, but I haven’t ever reacted or anything. So, no allergies. How long will these tests take? And will I get the results today? I really don’t have time to come back multiple times.
DOCTOR: The lab can usually process those fairly quickly. We should have the results back within a couple of hours. While we wait, do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? Hmm… Not that I know of. My grandmother on my mother's side was sick a lot, but it was never anything specific. Everyone just said she was “delicate.” That's all I know. Honestly, my family doesn't really talk about health stuff. It's considered… rude, I guess. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll proceed with the blood work first. We can discuss the results when they come back and decide on a course of action from there. While we wait, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Nope. No fever, no dizziness, no weird rashes, nothing. Just the bruising. And the soreness. And… honestly, just a lot of stress, if that counts. Work's been crazy lately, and I’m always tired. But I figured that was just… life. Is that what this is? Just being tired?
DOCTOR: Fatigue is common, yes, but unexplained bruising and soreness warrant further investigation. I’d like to hold off on attributing it to stress just yet. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any bleeding from your gums or nose recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, my gums have been a little sensitive when I brush. And I think I had a nosebleed a couple weeks ago, but it was just a tiny one, stopped pretty quickly. I didn’t think much of it. But yeah, both of those things have happened. Is that bad? Is this something serious? I really don’t have time for this, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Gum bleeding and a recent nosebleed, combined with the bruising and soreness, makes me a little more concerned. We'll need to rule out several possibilities. Given your history and current symptoms, I'm going to order a peripheral blood smear in addition to the CBC and coagulation panel. I'm also going to refer you to a hematologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They specialize in blood disorders and can provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you prefer to meet them at their clinic or the hospital?
PATIENT: Ugh, a specialist? Hospital? This is getting way out of hand. Look, I just want to know what's wrong, not get poked and prodded by a million different doctors. If I have to see someone, can't I just… go to the clinic? It's closer, and I don't like hospitals. And what does a hematologist even do? Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: A hematologist specializes in disorders of the blood and bone marrow, Ms. Hainley. Given your symptoms – unexplained bruising, gum bleeding, recent nosebleed, coupled with being on warfarin – a referral is the most prudent course of action. I understand your reluctance, but it's better to be thorough. The clinic may have a longer wait time. I'll put in a referral to Dr. Sharma at the clinic. They should contact you within 24-48 hours to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that could cause injury. And if you experience any significant bleeding – heavy nosebleeds, bleeding from your gums that won’t stop, blood in your stool – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. I understand. Avoid injury, call the hematologist… emergency room if I'm bleeding out. Great. Can I go now? I really need to get going. Is there anything else? I'm hoping this isn't going to be something awful.
