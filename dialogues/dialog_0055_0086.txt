DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kovtun. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for the results, if you don't mind getting straight to it. I've got a pretty full day.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Though I do find it’s rather important to have a comprehensive understanding of why tests were ordered in the first place, to properly interpret the findings. However, if you prefer to focus on the results directly, we can do that. I do have your records here… it appears you had some blood work and a basic metabolic panel performed on July 26th. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. July 26th… I remember now. It was a bit of a rush, honestly. I was feeling…off, and they wanted to check things. But yeah, blood work and…that other thing. Can we just get to what it means?
DOCTOR: Very well. The blood work revealed slightly elevated levels of… several things, frankly. Your glucose was a little high, your cholesterol is borderline, and your Vitamin D is quite low. The metabolic panel was largely unremarkable, but it does suggest we should investigate the elevated glucose further. Now, when you say “feeling off,” can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Okay, "slightly elevated" isn't good, is it? I guess I was tired a lot. Just really dragging. And…thirstier than usual, maybe? I drink a lot of water anyway, being active, but it felt like more. Honestly, I thought it was just the heat, you know? August is brutal. Did those numbers change a lot from my last check-up? I don't really keep track of stuff like this.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there isn't a readily available prior comprehensive metabolic panel for comparison. It appears this is your first visit with our practice, and the records transferred are rather minimal. As for “slightly elevated,” it isn't immediately cause for alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. The thirst you’re experiencing… and the fatigue… these can certainly be indicative of several things. We need to rule out more serious possibilities. Were you experiencing any changes in vision, increased urination, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, not really. Vision's fine, I think. I don't wear glasses, so it would have stood out. Urinating…normal, I guess. And no weight loss. Actually, maybe a little gain if anything, because I haven't been up for much exercise lately. Look, I work in logistics. I'm always on my feet, but it's stressful, and lately I've just been... less motivated. Does that make sense? I just want to know if I need meds or something. Or if I need to change my diet drastically.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in urination, vision normal, and some recent weight gain coupled with decreased motivation. That’s helpful. Given the elevated glucose, the fatigue, and the increased thirst, it’s prudent to investigate the possibility of prediabetes or early-stage diabetes. However, it could also be related to stress, lifestyle factors, or even a Vitamin D deficiency contributing to fatigue. We will need to repeat the glucose test, and I'd also like to check your HbA1c, which gives us an average blood sugar reading over the past few months. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't really believe in all that stuff, honestly. Just coffee, lots of coffee, to get through the day. That’s it. So, more tests, okay. How long will that take? And can we do it quickly? I've got a shipment coming in later this afternoon and... well, you wouldn't believe the headache it'll be if I'm not there.
DOCTOR: Very well. We can certainly expedite the process. A repeat fasting glucose test and an HbA1c test will take approximately ten minutes to draw the blood, and the results should be available within 24-48 hours. Our lab technician can draw it for you now, if you’re willing. While I understand your time is valuable, Ms. Kovtun, it's important to emphasize the significance of these tests. We need to ascertain the underlying cause of your symptoms before formulating an appropriate plan. Jumping to conclusions without proper evaluation is… unwise. Now, do you consent to the additional blood work?
PATIENT: Look, I get it. You're doing your job. Yes, fine. Let’s just get it done. The quicker we know, the quicker I can get back to work. Where do we go? And can I get a copy of the results sent to my email? I don't have a lot of time for follow-up calls.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll have the lab technician, Marie, come in to draw the blood. She’ll explain the procedure. As for the results, yes, we can certainly email them to you. Please provide me with your preferred email address. You’ll need to fill out a brief consent form authorizing us to release your results electronically. And while you’re waiting, I would like to take your vital signs and do a quick physical examination, just to get a more comprehensive baseline. It won’t take long. Blood pressure, pulse, and a brief listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever. Just…get this over with, please. And yes, do whatever you need to do. Blood pressure, pulse… just be quick about it. I really do need to get back to work. My email is k.kovtun.logistics@email.com.
DOCTOR: Very well. Marie will be in shortly. If you’ll step over here, I’ll take your blood pressure first. Please relax your arm. Do you have any history of hypertension, or has a doctor ever mentioned your blood pressure being elevated?
PATIENT: No. Never. I feel fine, usually. Just tired lately. That’s all. Is this going to take much longer? My shipment… honestly, it's a whole thing. I'm the main point of contact. If it goes wrong, it's on me.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not critically so. It's possible it's a result of stress, or simply the fact that you're in a medical setting. Now, I’m just checking your pulse. Normal rate. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Everything appears to be within normal limits at this juncture, Ms. Kovtun. However, as I stated previously, we need the blood work results to ascertain the underlying cause of your symptoms. Marie should be here momentarily to draw the samples. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: No allergies. Latex is fine. Alcohol swabs… whatever. Just get it over with. I'm starting to feel a little impatient. Honestly, I'm not a fan of doctors' offices. It's always a waste of time. Are you sure this is necessary? Could it just be… dehydration? I drink a lot of coffee, you know. Maybe I just need to drink more water.
DOCTOR: While dehydration can cause fatigue and thirst, Ms. Kovtun, it does not account for the elevated glucose levels indicated by your initial blood work. It is prudent to rule out other possibilities before attributing your symptoms solely to dehydration. Marie is here now. She will explain the procedure. I understand your time is valuable. However, I must emphasize that proper diagnosis is paramount. We will expedite the process as much as possible, but I cannot compromise patient safety for the sake of expediency. Do you have any further questions before Marie begins?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… get it done. .
