DOCTOR: Hello Jase, it’s good to meet you. My name is Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Asami, it’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… trouble with it. A lot of… going to the bathroom. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… not stopping. I think it’s… diarrhea? Is that what it’s called? I get confused about those things. Honestly, I don’t really remember when it started, just that it’s been happening a lot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea. Yes, that’s a good way to describe it. It’s perfectly alright to be confused about medical terms – that’s what I'm here for. “A lot lately” is helpful, but can you try to pinpoint when this started, even roughly?
PATIENT: Ugh, it’s hard. See, my memory isn’t the best. Maybe… a few months ago? Or was it longer? It feels like it started getting worse around… maybe June? But honestly, I’m not sure. Things just… blur together sometimes. It’s not a sudden thing, it kind of… crept up on me. I also feel tired a lot, but I don't know if that’s related.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we’ll work through it. It’s common for things to start gradually. So, around June it started becoming more noticeable. And you've also been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Yeah, the tiredness is definitely a thing. Just… more tired than usual, you know? Like, I used to be able to get through the day no problem, and now I feel wiped out by the afternoon. My husband keeps telling me I look pale, too. I don’t know if that means anything, but… he’s usually pretty good at noticing things. And it’s not just the diarrhea and the tiredness… sometimes my stomach just hurts, like a cramping feeling. It comes and goes though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diarrhea, fatigue, and abdominal cramping. It's good you mentioned the cramping – where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… all over, really. Mostly in the lower part, you know? Like, down low. But sometimes it feels like it’s higher up, too. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It’s not like a sharp pain, more like… a really uncomfortable ache. And it changes. Some days it's worse than others, and sometimes it feels like it’s on the left side more than the right. It's just… annoying. And it makes me worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating and concerning. Do you notice anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… eating makes it worse, sometimes. Especially if it's something… rich, I guess? Like, fried food definitely doesn't help. And dairy… yeah, dairy usually makes it worse too. But honestly, it happens even when I’m careful. It's hard to say for sure. Drinking water seems to help a little, but not much. Oh! And stress. When I'm really stressed, it gets way worse. My job can be pretty hectic sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so certain foods seem to aggravate it - fried foods and dairy – and stress definitely plays a role. Let’s talk about your job a little. What do you do?
PATIENT: I’m a sales representative. Mostly selling services, like… things for businesses. Not advertising or insurance, though, that's too complicated. It's mostly phone calls and meetings, trying to get people to sign up for different things. It's not bad, but it can be stressful when you have quotas to meet and stuff. I'm on the road sometimes, too. I'm usually gone a couple days a week. I think the travelling messes with my diet sometimes, because I end up eating whatever's available.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sales, phone calls, meetings, some travel… that can definitely disrupt your routine and diet. And it sounds like stress is a big factor. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes. A little. Not a lot, and not every time, but… yeah. It’s… it's usually just a little bit. Darkish red. It makes me really nervous. I try not to think about it. That’s… why I came, actually. It's been happening more recently. Is that… bad? I’m really sorry, I feel awful talking about this.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jase. You did the right thing coming in to get it checked out, and it's important to be honest about everything, even the things that are difficult to talk about. The presence of blood is something we need to investigate further, and I appreciate you telling me. Now, let's go through some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any problems with medications before. I had a penicillin shot as a kid, but that was ages ago and I don’t remember anything being wrong with it. And no food allergies, as far as I’m aware. I eat pretty much everything. Well, I used to, before all of this started. It's hard to eat much now with everything going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing regularly. I tried taking some vitamins a few months ago, just a general multivitamin, but I stopped because I didn't really feel any different. And no other medications, not even over-the-counter stuff. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. My husband sometimes gets me pain relievers when my stomach is really bad, but I don't take them often. Just ibuprofen, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once, when I was little. Oh! And the doctor said I had… something with my stomach a few years ago? I think it was something to do with how I was digesting food. They said it was… irritable bowel or something? I don’t really remember much. They gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while because they didn’t seem to help. My husband thinks I might have celiac disease, because his aunt has it, but I’ve never been tested. I’m not sure. Everything’s a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, chickenpox as a child, a broken arm, and a past diagnosis of something related to digestion - possibly Irritable Bowel Syndrome. It's alright that it's blurry - we can look into getting records if that's something you'd like. And your husband mentioned celiac disease. We can definitely consider testing for that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries at all. I've been pretty lucky, I guess. Apart from the broken arm, I haven’t really had any major health problems… until recently. This stomach thing is really worrying me, especially with the blood. It's just… not normal, is it? It makes me really tired, too. And I feel so embarrassed talking about it. I feel awful.
DOCTOR: No surgeries, that’s good to know. And it’s completely understandable to feel worried and embarrassed – it is a lot to deal with. It's good you're talking about it. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate, and we will. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my dad has high blood pressure, and my mom has diabetes. His sister had… heart problems, I think? And like I said, my husband's aunt has celiac disease. Oh! And my grandfather, on my dad’s side, had… stomach cancer. A long time ago, though. I’m not sure if that’s relevant, but my husband keeps worrying about it. He says stomach cancer can run in families. It makes me even more nervous. Everything feels so scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and diabetes in your parents, heart problems in your dad’s sister, celiac disease in your husband’s aunt, and stomach cancer in your grandfather. That gives us a good starting point. Given the family history of stomach cancer, and the presence of blood in your stool, it’s important to be thorough. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I’ve never smoked, and I don’t drink alcohol. My husband drinks sometimes, on special occasions, but I never do. And I definitely don’t use any recreational drugs. I’ve never even tried them. I’m a pretty healthy person, usually. Well, I was a healthy person, before all this started. Everything feels so different now. I feel exhausted all the time, and worried. And the blood… it keeps playing on my mind. It's so scary.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That’s good. Now, I’m going to do a physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to feel for any tenderness or masses. I'll also check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Asami. I just want to figure out what's going on. I’m a little worried about the exam, but I trust you. Please be gentle, though. My stomach is really sore. And it’s so embarrassing… I feel awful even saying it. I just want to feel normal again. I’m really tired all the time, and it's starting to affect my job. I feel awful.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. It’s alright to feel embarrassed – it's perfectly natural. And we will figure out what's going on, together. Okay, your vital signs are stable. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Okay, bowel sounds are a little louder than normal. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Okay, there’s some tenderness in your lower left quadrant. No masses are felt. Based on the physical exam, you have tenderness in your lower left quadrant and slightly hyperactive bowel sounds. This could indicate inflammation or irritation in that area. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some lab tests. We’ll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool sample to check for infection and blood, and a Celiac disease panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Asami. Lab tests sound… scary, but I understand. The stool sample… is that going to be… difficult? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm really worried about what they might show, especially with the family history of… everything. And if it is something serious, what happens then? I feel awful. I just want to feel normal again. I’m really tired all the time, and it’s starting to affect my job, and my husband is really worried about me.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel worried, Jase. Let’s take things one step at a time. The stool sample is relatively straightforward – the lab will provide you with a kit and instructions. It's not pleasant, but it's not difficult. As for the results, it usually takes about 3-5 business days for everything to come back. I understand your concern about the family history. It's good we're investigating thoroughly. If the tests reveal something concerning, we’ll discuss all your options, including potential further testing, specialist referrals, and treatment plans. We'll work together to develop a plan that's right for you. We will address everything. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to write you a prescription for a referral to a gastroenterologist, just in case we need a more specialized evaluation. I also want you to try to stay hydrated, eat bland foods, and avoid dairy, fried foods, and anything that seems to trigger your symptoms. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… that sounds serious. Is it… bad? And what exactly will they do? I feel awful asking so many questions, but I’m really scared. And… what if it is celiac disease? What would that mean? Would I have to… change my diet completely? I feel awful. I’m already so tired, and the thought of having to completely overhaul my diet… it's overwhelming. And… what if it’s something worse? I feel awful. And… how do I even get the stool sample? Is it… difficult to collect? I feel awful. I'm just… really worried. I just want to feel normal again. My husband is really worried about me, and I don't want to worry him even more. I feel awful.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Jase. In fact, it's good that you're asking them. It means you're actively involved in your care, and that's exactly what I want. A gastroenterologist is a specialist in digestive health. We’re referring you now as a precaution. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. If the initial tests are concerning, they can perform further evaluations, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy, to get a clearer picture of what's going on. If it is celiac disease, it would require a strict gluten-free diet for life. It can be challenging at first, but there are many resources available to help you navigate it. A registered dietitian can provide guidance on meal planning and finding gluten-free alternatives. As for the stool sample, the lab will provide you with a kit and detailed instructions. It involves collecting a small sample of your stool in a sterile container. It’s not pleasant, but it’s relatively straightforward. The lab technician can walk you through the process if you have any questions. I understand your anxiety, Jase. It's normal to feel overwhelmed when facing uncertainty. Remember, we're taking things one step at a time. We'll start with these initial tests, and then we'll develop a plan based on the results. I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to focus on taking care of yourself. Get some rest, stay hydrated, and eat bland foods. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything for now. Thank you, Dr. Asami. You’ve been very… patient with me. I feel awful asking so many questions, but you explained everything so clearly. I’ll get the stool sample and call the office if I have any problems. I feel awful. I’m just… really worried. But I feel a little bit better knowing that we’re finally doing something. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. It’s my job to be patient, and I’m glad I could help ease some of your anxiety. Remember, you’re not alone in this, and we’ll get through it together. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns, no matter how small they may seem. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
