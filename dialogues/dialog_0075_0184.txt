DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get right to it. It's… well, it’s this. <gestures vaguely at his stomach> It just ain’t what it used to be. Sagging and… loose. My wife always liked a firm belly, and now… well, you see. I want it fixed. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You're concerned about changes in your abdominal area. We can certainly discuss that. Just to clarify, when you say it “ain’t what it used to be,” are you experiencing any pain or discomfort in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Pain? No! What kinda question is that? I'm an old man, Doctor, not a baby. Things sag. It’s just… unsightly. It’s embarrassing, that’s what it is. I used to have a good build, strong from all the pile drivin’. Now I look like… well, never mind what I look like. I just want it tightened up. Is that possible, or are you gonna start askin' me about feelin' sick?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question seemed… direct. It's important to rule out any underlying medical causes for these changes, even if you're not experiencing pain. It's good to know it's not painful. When you mention changes from “pile driving”, how long ago were you doing that work, and have you noticed these changes gradually over time, or were they more sudden?
PATIENT: Suddenly? Grad-ju-al? Look, I stopped the drivin’ ‘bout ten years ago, maybe a little more. Retirement. Best thing I ever did. But that was a strong job! I was built from that work. Then my wife passed… five years ago, come September. Everything kinda went downhill after that, if you wanna know. Ate more, didn't bother with… keepin’ up appearances. And then I noticed this. It wasn’t overnight, but it wasn’t slow either. It just… happened.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Trendler. It's understandable that significant life events can impact many aspects of our well-being. So, ten years ago you retired, and about five years ago you experienced the loss of your wife. And you've noticed changes in your abdomen since then. Has there been any change in your weight during this time?
PATIENT: Weight? A little. Not a lot. I used to be… well, I was solid muscle, you understand? Now it's more… soft. I reckon I gained about twenty pounds, maybe. Not much, but enough to notice in the mirror. I didn’t used to have this… wobble. <gestures again to his stomach> It bothers me. It really does. I just want to look respectable again. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Trendler, that's not too much to ask at all. It's perfectly normal to want to feel good about your appearance. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I did a quick physical examination?
PATIENT: Examination? You wanna poke around? Hmph. I suppose so. But make it quick, alright? I got things to do. And don't be diggin’ around too much. Just a look will do. I ain’t here for a full check-up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. Just a quick look and feel. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. Okay, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. I’m noting some increased softness and laxity of the abdominal muscles, consistent with a loss of muscle tone. The skin has some expected age-related changes in elasticity, and I don’t feel any unusual masses or abnormalities. Overall, it appears to be primarily a matter of subcutaneous fat and decreased muscle mass.
PATIENT: Hmph. Palpatin', is it? Feels like you're pushin' on… well, never mind. Just get on with it. What does all that fancy talk mean? Muscle tone? Sub-cu-tan-eous… what? Are you tellin' me I'm just… soft? I knew it! My wife would've… never mind. So, can you fix it, or not? Is there a way to tighten things up? I ain’t got time for long explanations, Doctor.
DOCTOR: What it means, Mr. Trendler, is that with age, and especially after significant life events, it’s common to lose some muscle mass and for the skin to lose elasticity. What you're describing—the looseness and the changes in your belly—is a natural process. There are options for addressing this, but it’s important to understand what they involve. We could discuss lifestyle modifications—diet and exercise—which can help improve muscle tone and reduce fat. There are also surgical procedures—like a tummy tuck—that can remove excess skin and tighten the abdominal muscles. However, surgery carries risks, and it’s a significant undertaking. Before we consider any of those, I would like to check your overall health to make sure you're a good candidate for any procedure. Would you be open to a brief blood test to assess your kidney and liver function, and perhaps an EKG to check your heart health?
PATIENT: Blood tests? EKG? Look, I came here to get somethin’ fixed, not poked and prodded like a prize pig! I’m an old man, Doctor, not a young athlete. I ain’t lookin’ for a six-pack, just to not look like I swallowed a watermelon. Lifestyle… diet and exercise? I tried that. Didn't work. That’s why I’m here! So, is this tummy tuck thing… is it painful? And how long would I be… out of commission? I got a garden to tend, you know. And I don’t wanna be lyin’ around for months.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. You're right, you came here for a solution, and I apologize if I’m making this more complicated than it needs to be. The blood tests and EKG are simply standard precautions to ensure your safety if we were to consider surgery. They help us assess whether you're healthy enough to undergo the procedure. A tummy tuck, also known as abdominoplasty, does involve some recovery time. It's a surgical procedure where we remove excess skin and fat and tighten the abdominal muscles. It is a significant undertaking, and there will be pain involved afterwards, which we manage with medication. Typically, the recovery period is several weeks, with limited activity for the first few weeks and gradual return to normal activities over several months. You'd likely need assistance with daily tasks during the initial recovery phase. However, before we even discuss surgery, I want to be thorough. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions – like diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No! Heart disease? Not that I know of. High blood pressure? The doctor used to mention somethin’… but I ain’t been to a doctor in a few years. I mostly just take a little somethin’ for my joints. Arthritis, you know? Old age. Look, this is gettin’ long. Can you just tell me if I'm a candidate for this… tuck thing? Or not? I ain't got all day to answer questions about what I ate for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, given your age and the fact that you haven’t seen a doctor regularly for a few years, it would be irresponsible of me to determine if you are a suitable candidate for surgery without a more comprehensive evaluation. While a tummy tuck may be an option, it carries risks, and we need to ensure your overall health is good enough to handle it. I recommend a full physical exam, blood work to check your kidney and liver function, an EKG to evaluate your heart health, and a consultation with a cardiologist to assess your cardiovascular risk. This will give us a clear picture of your health and allow me to make an informed recommendation. Alternatively, if you are not interested in surgery, we can discuss strategies to improve your muscle tone and reduce fat through diet and exercise. I can refer you to a registered dietitian and a physical therapist who can create a personalized plan for you. Would you be interested in either of those options?
PATIENT: Hmph. See? Just like I figured. More tests, more doctors… more waitin'. Look, I appreciate you tellin’ me straight, Doctor. I just… don't have the patience for all that. I came here hopin' for a quick fix, and it sounds like that ain’t gonna happen. Never mind. Forget the tests, forget the other doctors. Forget the whole thing. I'll just… live with it. It’s just a sag, after all. Thank you for your time, Doctor. But I think I’m done here.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. I respect your decision. It's perfectly okay to choose to live with something if you're not comfortable pursuing other options. If you change your mind in the future, or if you develop any concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to come back and see me. Here's a summary of our conversation, and some resources on healthy lifestyle choices, just in case. I wish you all the best, Mr. Trendler. .
