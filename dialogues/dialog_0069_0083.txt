DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Hmm. Well, it's not somethin’ serious, you understand. Just… I thought a little encouragement from a doctor might be nice. My ex-wife… she doesn’t send cards anymore, and it’s…well, a little lonely. I was hopin’ for one of those “Get Well” cards, even though I am well. More of a… a pick-me-up, really. Is that… alright? Some doctors don't understand these things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I absolutely understand. It's perfectly alright to come in for something like this. Your emotional wellbeing is just as important as your physical health, and it’s very responsible of you to address this. It sounds like you’re experiencing some feelings of loneliness and would appreciate a little support. To make sure I understand everything, could you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Well, it's like this. My wife… she left, oh, about five years ago now. Said I wasn't… romantic enough. Romantic! I worked hard my whole life, kept a roof over our heads, put food on the table… that's romantic, isn't it? Anyway, she used to send cards for everything. Birthday, Christmas, even if I just had a bad day. Now… nothing. And it’s not like I’m askin’ for a lot. Just a simple card. A little somethin’ to show someone’s thinkin’ of you. You understand, don't you? It's the thought that counts.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Kammer. It sounds like those cards were a really important way for you to feel connected and cared for, and it’s completely natural to miss that when it’s gone. It's not about the card itself, it’s about the feeling of being remembered and valued. You mentioned it's been about five years since your wife left. Has this feeling of loneliness been consistent since then, or are there times when it’s worse than others?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly consistent. Holidays are bad, naturally. Christmas especially. But it's the little things. Seein’ other folks with their families, gettin’ cards in the mail… things like that. Makes you feel… forgotten. I keep busy, you understand. Work keeps me goin’. Stationary engineer, you know. Boilers and all that. It’s a good job, honest work. But it doesn’t fill the… the emptiness. I try to not dwell on it, but it's hard. Really hard.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been doing a good job of coping with a difficult situation by staying busy with work, Mr. Kammer. But it’s also perfectly valid to acknowledge and address those feelings of loneliness. It's clear this is more than just wanting a card; it’s about a deeper need for connection. To get a better understanding of your overall health, and to rule out anything that might be contributing to how you're feeling, could I ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? What's that got to do with a card, Doctor? I'm not sick. I just… feel a little down. I suppose… alright, ask your questions. But I don’t see how my blood pressure is gonna help me get a "Get Well" card. I'm on Medicare, if that’s what you're askin'. Everything's pretty standard, I think. Just the usual check-ups. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Kammer. It might seem unrelated, but sometimes feeling down or experiencing loneliness can be connected to underlying health issues, or even side effects of medications. It's important to rule those things out. And knowing your medical history helps me understand you better as a whole person. You mentioned being on Medicare and having standard check-ups – that’s good. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions… let me think. The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on some pills. I take ‘em every day. That's all I remember, really. And the usual aches and pains, you know. Workin’ with boilers ain't easy on the body. Arthritis in my hands, maybe? Old age, mostly. I don’t bother much with doctors, if I can help it. They just want to give you more pills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the high blood pressure medication. Do you happen to know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: The name… now that's a problem. I got a little bottle from the pharmacy, you know. White bottle… little blue pills. I take one every mornin’. I ain't one for rememberin’ names, Doctor. I just know it keeps my blood pressure down. My ex-wife used to handle all that stuff, rememberin' appointments and pills. I'm sorry, I just… don’t know the name.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kammer. It's very common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in your Medicare records if you’d like. It might also be helpful to understand what other medications you’re taking, even over-the-counter ones. Do you take anything else regularly, like pain relievers, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Pain relievers… sometimes. When my hands are really achin’ after work. Just ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind. And… I used to take vitamins, but I stopped. Didn't seem to make much difference. Just felt like a waste of money. I take that pill for my blood pressure, that's about it. Honest. I’m a simple man, Doctor. No fancy medicines or nothin’. I just want a little encouragement, like I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so ibuprofen as needed for hand pain and a medication for your blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me about any allergies you have, to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never been much for allergies. Maybe a little sniffly nose in the spring sometimes, but that’s just the dust, I think. My ex-wife always said I was too stubborn to be allergic to anything. She used to joke I could eat anything and not get sick. I don't think that's true, but… I haven't had any serious allergic reactions, no. Never needed an EpiPen or nothin'.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Kammer. Now, thinking about your family history – are there any health conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a long story, Doctor. My father, he had a bad heart. Worked too hard, they said. Always pushin’ himself. He passed away when I was young. My mother, she lived a long life, but she had… well, I don’t really know what she had. Something with her memory, I think. She got… confused towards the end. That’s about all I remember. We weren’t a close family, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kammer. It's not uncommon to not have a complete family medical history. Knowing about your father’s heart condition is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What's that got to do with a card? I go to work, I come home, I eat dinner, I go to bed. It's not a glamorous life, Doctor. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. And I certainly don't smoke. I try to eat healthy, mostly. My ex-wife was a good cook, and I got used to her food. Now I mostly just heat up some soup or somethin'. Not much exercise, though. Work keeps me movin’ enough, I figure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, limited alcohol, and you eat relatively healthy. Work provides you with some physical activity. Now, just one last thing before we move on to a physical exam – have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, sleep, or mood?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. I suppose I've lost a little weight, maybe. Not much, just a few pounds. My appetite hasn't been great lately. Not that I’m not hungry, just… not really interested in food, you know? Sleep… well, I sleep alright, I guess. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night thinkin’ about things. And my mood… Well, it’s been better. I feel a little down sometimes. Lonely, mostly. But what can you do? It’s just life, I figure. I’ve been feelin’ this way for a while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot, and it’s understandable to feel down and lonely. Given everything you've told me about your weight loss, appetite changes, sleep disturbances, and mood, I think it would be helpful to do a quick physical exam to rule out any underlying medical causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Look, Doctor, I came here for a card, not a check-up. I’m not sick, I told you that. But… alright, if you think it’s necessary. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I’m a simple man, and I don’t like doctors messin’ with me. But if it’ll get me that card… I suppose I can suffer through it. Just hurry up, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kammer. I understand your concerns, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – that’s just checking your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. It shouldn't take too long. First, let's take your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But don’t squeeze too tight, okay? My arm gets sore easily. And don’t be surprised if it’s a little high, I get nervous around doctors. Always have. Just get it over with, please. And then… then can we talk about the card? I’m really hopin’ for somethin’ cheerful. Maybe with a picture of a sunny beach? That would be nice.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer, just relax your arm as much as possible. I’m just getting a reading now. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your nerves. Heart rate is 78, and your temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just take slow, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's likely benign, but we may want to investigate it further with an EKG just to be safe. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let me just take a quick look at your ears. Your ears look clear as well. Overall, everything seems within normal limits, but the murmur warrants a quick EKG. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG? Now you're talkin’ about more tests. What's wrong with me? I told you, I just want a card! A little encouragement! Is that too much to ask? A murmur… that sounds serious. Look, Doctor, I don't want an EKG. I just want to go home. Maybe I'm just tired. Maybe I need a good night's sleep. I'm an old man, maybe my heart is just… old. Just give me a card, please. And let me go home. I don't want any more tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your concerns and your reluctance to have more tests. You're right, you came here for a card, and it's completely valid to want something that can lift your spirits. However, as your doctor, my primary responsibility is to ensure your health and wellbeing. A murmur doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it's a change from what's considered normal, and it's always best to investigate it further to rule out any potential issues. I don’t want to make you uncomfortable. We can skip the EKG for now. However, given your recent weight loss, appetite changes, and mood, I do think it would be beneficial to run some basic blood work to check your overall health. This can help us identify any underlying deficiencies or issues that might be contributing to how you're feeling. Would you be comfortable with just the blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… It’s always somethin’, isn’t it? First it’s the blood pressure, then a murmur, now blood work. I just… I just want to feel better. And I thought a card might help. But now I’m stuck here gettin’ poked and prodded. Alright, alright. Fine. Do the blood work. Just… just hurry up and get it over with. And promise me… promise me you’ll still try to find me a card, even if I’m not feelin’ so good. A cheerful one, with a sunny beach. Please.
DOCTOR: I promise, Mr. Kammer. I absolutely will find you a cheerful card with a sunny beach. And I’ll do my best to make this blood work as quick and comfortable as possible. It's a standard procedure, just a few vials of blood, and the lab technician is very skilled. We’ll need to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function, and a few other basic markers. This will give us a good overview of your health. Alright, this might feel like a little pinch, but it will be over quickly. Just relax your arm and try to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Just get it over with, Doctor. Hurry. Sunny beach… cheerful card… just get it over with…
DOCTOR: Alright, all done, Mr. Kammer. Just a little pressure here for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. There you go. All finished. That wasn’t so bad, was it?
PATIENT: It wasn’t pleasant. But I suppose… I suppose it’s over now. So… about that card? Are you going to find me one, Doctor? A cheerful one? With a sunny beach? Please tell me you’re going to find me a card.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammer. I promise you, I will find you a cheerful card with a sunny beach. In fact, I’ll see if I have one right here in the office. Let me see… Ah, here we are! What do you think of this one?
PATIENT: A sunny beach… palm trees… It’s… it’s beautiful. Just what I wanted. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. This… this means a lot to me. More than you know.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I’m glad I could find one that you like. Sometimes, the smallest things can make the biggest difference. Now, regarding your blood work, it will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan to address any issues that might be present. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to focus on things that bring you joy and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. And if you're feeling down or lonely, please don't hesitate to reach out to friends, family, or a mental health professional. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. You've answered everything. Thank you… for the card. And for… listenin'. I appreciate it. I think… I think I'll go home now. And maybe… maybe I'll take a walk on the beach. Even if it’s just in my imagination. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Mr. Kammer. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your walk on the beach, even if it's just in your imagination.
