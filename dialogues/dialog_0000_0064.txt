DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion Chelberg. 62 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Batara, is it? Yes. Well, my chest. It’s been... hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like... a tight squeezing, mostly. It started maybe a week ago? I think so. It's hard to remember exactly when, but a week sounds right.
DOCTOR: A week, alright. And you say it’s a tight squeezing… where exactly in your chest are you feeling this?
PATIENT: Right here, mostly. Not like, all over. Just… here. And sometimes it goes a little bit into my left arm, but not bad. Not like a real bad pain, just… feels funny. Like a little ache, you know? It’s scary, though. My husband, Ricardo, he told me to come right away. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, center of the chest, radiating slightly into the left arm. And it’s been happening for about a week. Does anything specifically bring it on?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Well, it seems worse when I walk up hills. Or if I'm carrying something heavy, like groceries. It doesn't happen when I'm just sitting, resting. And... oh! And yesterday, I was cleaning the kitchen, bending over a lot, and it got really bad then too. Just for a little while, though. Then it went away. But it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: So, exertion seems to be the trigger – walking, carrying, bending. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Nothing else comes to mind. I haven't been sick, no cough, no fever. Just... this chest thing. And a little bit of worry, of course! I'm a little short of breath sometimes when it hurts, but not always. It's hard to explain. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It does, Sherion. It does. Now, let’s go through some basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Ricardo always worries about my blood pressure. The doctor did mention it a couple of times, a long time ago, but he said it was okay, just to watch my salt. But no, I don't have high blood pressure, not that I know of. And no, no cholesterol problems either. And definitely no diabetes! I love sweets, but Ricardo makes sure I don't have too many. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of those conditions. Any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling from a tree. But nothing serious, not really. No heart problems, no lung problems, nothing like that. I haven't been in the hospital for anything in… oh, goodness, probably 30 years! I'm usually a pretty healthy person, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. No significant medical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother, she… she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired, and she died when she was pretty young, maybe in her 60s. But I don't know exactly what she had. My father, he was strong as an ox, lived to be 90! No problems with his heart. And my brother, he’s still alive, healthy as can be, lives in California. I think he had his blood pressure checked once, but everything was okay. Does that help? It's hard to remember all that old stuff.
DOCTOR: So, mother with a weak heart, father healthy, brother healthy. Now, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor! Never. Ricardo would never let me. He says it’s terrible for your health, and he's right. I maybe tried a puff once when I was a teenager, but it made me cough so bad I never tried it again. No, I don't smoke. And I don't drink much either, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not very often, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, minimal alcohol. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to need to check your vital signs and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just let me know if it's going to be cold! I get chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherion. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me. Alright. I’m hearing a faint murmur and some mild crackles. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen levels are okay, but a little on the lower end. I'm also going to feel your pulses. Pulses are a little weak. Sherion, I think we need to order some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I want an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a cardiac enzyme panel. We also need to rule out any underlying lung issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot of tests. A lot. Is it… is it serious, Doctor? The crackles and the weak pulses… that doesn't sound good. I just want to know what's wrong, you know? If it's something bad… I understand you need to do tests, but it scares me a little. The tests sound… complicated. Will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a dinner with Ricardo on Friday… I hope I can still make it.
DOCTOR: Sherion, I understand your concern. It is a lot of tests, but that’s because we need to be thorough. The crackles could indicate fluid in your lungs, which could be due to a number of things. The weak pulses and elevated blood pressure are also concerning. We need to rule out heart problems, and the cardiac enzymes will help us with that. The tests themselves aren’t painful. The EKG involves placing stickers on your chest, the chest X-ray is just a quick image, and the blood work is a standard procedure. As for the results, they usually take 24-48 hours. We'll have a better idea of what's going on by early next week. I want to be upfront with you: your symptoms could indicate a cardiac issue, which needs to be addressed promptly. However, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. These tests are crucial to help us determine the cause and develop the appropriate treatment plan. I will personally review the results with you as soon as they come in. And we will do everything we can to ensure you can still make your dinner with Ricardo on Friday, if possible. We will proceed cautiously and make informed decisions based on the test results. Now, do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… stickers and a picture and blood. I can do that. But… the cardiac enzymes… that sounds scary. Is it… like a heart attack? Ricardo… he worries about my heart so much. He lost his uncle to a heart attack. Is that what you think it is? I just want to be sure… is it something I did? Did I eat too much salt? Or not exercise enough? I’ve been trying to walk more, but it’s hard with my knees. And what about the dinner? If I’m really sick… I don’t want to ruin Ricardo’s Friday. He’s been looking forward to it all week. And… what if it is a heart attack? Will I need… surgery? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Sherion, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. The cardiac enzymes will simply tell us if there has been any damage to the heart muscle. It does not automatically mean you are having a heart attack. Many things can cause elevated enzymes, and we need to rule out all possibilities before making any diagnosis. And no, it’s not necessarily something you “did.” While diet and exercise play a role in heart health, there are other factors involved, such as genetics and underlying medical conditions. As for surgery, that is a possibility if we determine there is a significant blockage or damage to the heart, but we are nowhere near that point yet. We need to get the test results first. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and explain the other procedures. I will personally review your results with you as soon as they are available. And we will make the best possible decisions based on what we find. Now, are you able to walk to the lab, or would you like me to arrange transportation?
PATIENT: I can walk… I think. But… the nurse? Will she hurt me when she takes the blood? I don’t like needles. Ricardo always has to hold my hand when I get a shot. And… if it's really bad, will you… will you be there? Just… just in case? It's just… I get nervous. And… the results… can I call you if I get really worried before you call me? I don't want to just sit here and panic all weekend. Maybe Ricardo can come with me to the lab? He's good at asking questions. He’s very… thorough.
DOCTOR: Sherion, the nurse is highly skilled and will do her best to make you comfortable. It’s a simple blood draw. You may feel a slight pinch, but it’s brief. As for calling me, my office staff will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results in detail. They will provide you with the necessary contact information. I do not personally answer calls from patients outside of scheduled appointments. Ricardo is welcome to accompany you to the lab, and he is certainly free to ask any questions he may have. However, I assure you, there is no reason to panic. We are simply taking precautionary measures to rule out any potential issues. Now, let’s get these tests done. The sooner we have the results, the sooner we can address any concerns you may have. I will expect you to attend your follow-up appointment, so we can discuss this in a calm and rational manner. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… thank you, Doctor. I hope… I hope everything is okay. And… please be kind to the nurse. She might have to poke me a lot. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
