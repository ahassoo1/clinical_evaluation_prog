DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re 22 years old. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi Doc. Thanks. It's... my head. Been gettin' these headaches, pretty bad ones. And... well, I get kinda sweaty when they hit, and my heart races a bit. It's been happenin' on and off for a while now, I guess. Not sure how long exactly. It all kinda blurs together, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. “Blurs together.” That is… not particularly helpful for a diagnosis, Mr. Lawther, but I appreciate you telling me. “On and off for a while” could mean anything. Can you be more specific about when these headaches started?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah, you're right. Sorry. Hmm... It's tough. I wanna say... maybe six months ago? Around the time of... things with my ex, I think. Everything kinda went sideways then. But honestly, I've had headaches on and off for years, just not like these. These are... different. Worse, definitely. And the sweaty, fast heartbeat part is new. It's just... hard to pinpoint when it started started, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do “know,” Mr. Lawther. Emotional stress can certainly contribute to headaches, but we need to rule out other potential causes. Let’s try to focus on the characteristics of these new headaches. Where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Everywhere, kinda? Usually it’s like… all over my head. Like a band squeezin’ tight. Sometimes it’s more on the front, kinda behind my eyes. And sometimes it feels like it's in the back of my neck too, spreadin’ up. It's not one spot, if that makes sense? It kinda moves around. And it’s not like… a throbbing pain, really. It’s just… pressure. A lot of pressure.
DOCTOR: "Everywhere" is still not particularly useful, Mr. Lawther. However, the description of “pressure” is somewhat more informative. Do these headaches occur at a specific time of day, or are they random?
PATIENT: Random, I think. Or... maybe more often in the afternoon? Now that I think about it, I usually feel 'em comin' on after work. But sometimes they hit in the mornin' too, or even in the middle of the night. There’s no real pattern, I don't think. I haven’t been keepin’ track, sorry. It just… happens. I usually just try to lie down and hope it goes away.
DOCTOR: “Hope it goes away” is not a treatment plan, Mr. Lawther. We need to determine the underlying cause. Have you noticed any triggers – certain foods, smells, activities – that seem to bring these headaches on?
PATIENT: Triggers... hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I mean, I drink coffee, but I've always drunk coffee. And I eat pretty much the same stuff as always. Work's kinda stressful, I guess, but it always is. Oh! Actually... sometimes when it's really hot outside, like really hot, it feels like it makes 'em worse. But that's just a feelin’, ya know? It could be just 'cause I'm hot.
DOCTOR: “Feels like” and “could be” are not particularly helpful, Mr. Lawther. We are trying to establish facts, not speculation. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… um… sometimes I feel kinda nauseous, like I’m gonna throw up, but I never actually do. And… I get blurry vision sometimes, when the headache’s really bad. Just for a bit, though. Everything gets all… wavy. And… I've been more tired lately, I guess. Just feelin’ run down. Is that a symptom? I don't know. It's probably just 'cause I’m not sleepin’ well, ya know? It's all kinda mixed up.
DOCTOR: "Kinda mixed up" is a concerningly vague description, Mr. Lawther. Nausea, blurry vision, and fatigue alongside headaches are… noteworthy. Let’s delve into your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't really… been to the doctor much. Well, I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. And… I had strep throat once, I think. But other than that… no. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothin'. I just… kinda avoid the doctor, if that makes sense. Always seemed like a waste of time, ya know? And expensive. I haven't really needed to go. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Avoiding the doctor is rarely a sound medical strategy, Mr. Lawther. Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgery. Nothing like that. Just the broken arm when I was a kid, and they just put a cast on it. No operations or anything. I'm pretty sure, anyway. It was a long time ago, my mom did all the takin' me to appointments and stuff, so I don't really remember the details. She's not around anymore to ask.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom… she died a few years ago. Cancer. And I don't really have a relationship with my dad. He… wasn't around much when I was growin' up. And I don’t have any siblings. So, no family history of headaches or anything like that that I know of. Not that I ever asked, really. It wasn't really talked about. Is that what you were askin'?
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I drink sometimes. A few beers on the weekend, usually. Nothing crazy. And no, I don't smoke. Never have. And no drugs, either. Not into any of that. Just the beer, occasionally. Honestly, I don't drink as much as I used to. It kinda makes my head worse, ya know? So I've been cuttin' back. It doesn't help the headaches, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. I think we have enough information for now. I’m going to perform a brief neurological exam. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Neurological… what does that involve? Is it gonna be uncomfortable? I'm not really good with… medical stuff. Just so you know. But okay, I'll lie down. Where's the table?
DOCTOR: Just lie flat on your back, Mr. Lawther. It involves checking your reflexes, your balance, and your vision. It’s not particularly uncomfortable, but it’s necessary to assess your condition. I will explain each step as I proceed. Now, if you would please.
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I'm here. Flat on my back. Just tell me what to do, Doc. And if it gets weird, I'll let you know. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Very well. First, I’m going to check your pupils. Please follow my penlight with your eyes, but don’t strain. Look left… look right… look up… look down. Good. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Now, I will test your cranial nerves. Can you smell this?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can smell something. It smells… kinda like alcohol? Like… rubbing alcohol? It's not a strong smell, but yeah, I can definitely smell it. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Please smile for me, Mr. Lawther. And now, raise your eyebrows. Good. Facial symmetry appears intact. Now, I am going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, sure. Like this? Is that too tight? I don’t want to break anything.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That's sufficient. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Left leg… right leg… Both reflexes are 2+, within normal limits. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Uh… like this? I’m kinda clumsy. It’s hard lying down. Did I do it right?
DOCTOR: It's alright. Now, please sit up slowly and stand. Then, walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Whoa… okay. Yeah, walking… It’s a little weird. I’m kinda shaky. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and your balance appears somewhat impaired. Now, please sit back down. Given your symptoms and the findings of this neurological exam, I suspect you are experiencing tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and fatigue. However, given the blurry vision, nausea and unsteady gait, further investigation is warranted to rule out other potential causes. We will need to run some blood tests to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and thyroid function. I am also ordering a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural abnormalities. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything, not that my mom ever told me about. No, no allergies. But… a CT scan? Is that… serious? What are we looking for?
DOCTOR: A CT scan is a standard imaging procedure, Mr. Lawther. It’s not inherently serious, but it allows us to visualize your brain and rule out any underlying structural problems. We need to be thorough. We’re looking for things like tumors, aneurysms, or signs of stroke. I understand your concern, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Now, let’s discuss your current medications. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I’m not taking anything. No prescription medications, no over-the-counter stuff… not even vitamins. I haven’t really been feeling well enough to bother with that stuff, ya know? Just… trying to get through each day. No, nothing at all. I used to take ibuprofen for headaches sometimes, but I stopped. It didn't really help much, and it kinda made my stomach upset.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild anti-nausea medication and a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. The neurologist will schedule the CT scan and interpret the results. I would also recommend that you prioritize rest and reduce your stress levels as much as possible. It's important that you seek immediate medical attention if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe headache, fever, stiff neck, confusion, or weakness. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, actually. How long will it take to get in to see the neurologist? And… what if they do find something? Like, what if it's… serious? I’m kinda scared, Doc. And… how much is all this gonna cost? I don’t have insurance, so… I'm kinda worried about the money, too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lawther. It can take several weeks to get an appointment with a neurologist, but I will submit a priority referral to expedite the process. As for the cost, I unfortunately cannot provide an exact estimate, as it depends on the specific tests and procedures performed. However, I can direct you to the hospital’s financial assistance program, which may be able to provide some relief. Let’s focus on getting you evaluated first. It's important to remember that most headaches are not caused by serious underlying conditions. However, it's crucial to rule out any potential problems to ensure your well-being. I am ordering blood work now, and I will also give you a list of emergency warning signs to watch out for. If you experience any of those symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, financial assistance… emergency signs… I'll write that down. I think… I think that's all for now, Doc. Thank you. You've… you've been really helpful. Even if I'm still kinda scared. I guess I’ll just… wait for the call about the neurologist? And get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. You’ll receive a call from the neurologist’s office to schedule your appointment. The lab results will be sent directly to me, and I will contact you as soon as they are available. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you, Mr. Lawther. Get well soon.
