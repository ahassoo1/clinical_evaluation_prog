DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. So, to start us off, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I haven't got all day. It's this hand. Shakes, see? Been shaking for… well, a while now. Honestly, it's embarrassing. Just want something to stop it, alright? My grandkids think I'm a hundred years older than I am.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. It sounds frustrating and concerning to have a tremor that's interfering with your life, especially when it affects how you interact with your grandkids. We'll definitely try to figure out what's causing it and what we can do to help. When you say "a while now," can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Honestly, Doc, I don't do detail. Maybe… six months? Eight? Time all blurs together when you're my age. It started gradually, you know? Just a little quiver at first. Now it's… noticeable. I try to hide it, but… well, it's not easy. It's worse when I’m trying to do something precise, like… I don’t know… eating soup. Or signing my name.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight months, gradual onset, and worse with precise movements like eating or signing. That’s helpful. Is it present all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm trying to do something. When I'm just… sitting, it's not so bad. Though sometimes, even then, it’ll just… start. It's annoying, alright? And frankly, I haven't got time for annoyances.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's intermittent, more noticeable with activity, but can occur even at rest sometimes. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it better?
PATIENT: Better? No. Nothing. I tried… holding my hand real tight, but that just made it ache. Honestly, Doc, I’m starting to think it’s just old age catching up with me. Shoulda stayed in Italy. Everything was simpler there.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. While it's easy to attribute these things to age, it's important to rule out other potential causes. We want to make sure we address this properly. Now, aside from your hand shaking, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I’m eighty years old. What don’t I have symptoms of? Aches, pains, forgetfulness... the usual. You want a list? We'll be here all day. Is this hand thing connected to all that or what?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Mr. Baide. It’s good you're thinking about whether this could be connected to other things. It’s definitely something we need to consider. When you say “forgetfulness”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It means I forget things! What, do I need to draw you a picture? Names mostly. Faces. Sometimes where I put my glasses. It’s… inconvenient. My daughter keeps telling me I need to write things down. Honestly, it’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficulty with names and faces, occasionally misplacing items. And you mentioned aches and pains. Where are those located, and how would you describe the pain – is it sharp, dull, constant, intermittent?
PATIENT: Ugh. Everywhere. Honestly, Doc, my whole body creaks like an old ship. Knees mostly, and my lower back. Dull, mostly. Constant. It’s just… being old. I've lived a long life, alright? I’m not expecting miracles. Just fix the hand, and let me get on with things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. And we’ll certainly focus on the hand shaking. But to get a clearer picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have a list of medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. Just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think? And some little white pills for… cholesterol? I honestly don’t keep track. My daughter handles all that. I just take what she gives me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and something for cholesterol. We'll verify those dosages with your daughter. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… Appendicitis when I was a kid. That was… a long time ago. And… oh, yeah. They fixed my hip a few years back. Fell down the stairs. Stupid stairs. That’s about it. Nothing else that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a hip replacement a few years ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Loved a good plate of spaghetti, always have. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing. Don't bother me with allergies. Honestly, Doc, are we almost done here? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Almost, Mr. Baide. Just a few more quick questions. And then we'll do a brief physical exam. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My father… he lived to a good age. Mother too, I suppose. Everyone smoked back then, you know? Lung cancer, probably. Lots of heart problems on both sides. But honestly, Doc, it was a long time ago, and everyone’s dead now. Not much point in dwelling on it, is there?
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Baide. It's good to be aware, but not dwelling on it is perfectly understandable. Now, finally, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoked? Heavens, yes. A pack a day for… well, for most of my life. Quit about twenty years ago. Best thing I ever did. Though it didn't do much for my lungs, I suppose. There. Happy? Can we finally get to fixing this hand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Baide, very. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. My time isn’t exactly free, you know. Honestly, I’ve got a perfectly good afternoon nap waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. We'll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit here on the table, that would be great. Okay, I'm going to take a look at your hands. I notice a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on this side. Now, can you hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's shaking, alright? You didn't need to ask. Honestly, Doc, sometimes I think you doctors just like to make things complicated.
DOCTOR: I see, yes. And can you try to touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: There! Almost got it. It's harder than it looks, you know. This shaking isn’t helping. Are you writing all this down? You better be.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm writing everything down, Mr. Baide. Now, can you tap your fingers together, one after the other, as quickly as you can?
PATIENT: See? It's not easy! This is ridiculous. I’m getting tired. Can we just skip this nonsense and give me something to stop the shaking?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing what’s likely an essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes a rhythmic shaking, often in the hands, and it can become more noticeable with age. However, it's important to rule out other potential causes. I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any vitamin deficiencies. And, I think it would be helpful to get a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. They can confirm the diagnosis and discuss treatment options. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… neurologist… More waiting, more poking, more doctors… Honestly. Alright, fine. Do what you gotta do. But I’m telling you, it’s just old age. And don’t keep me waiting all day for these results. I’ve got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. I'll put in the orders for the blood tests right away, and I'll help you schedule an appointment with a neurologist as quickly as possible. I will also send your primary care physician a summary of our consultation. In the meantime, there are a few things that might help manage the tremor. Avoiding caffeine and alcohol can sometimes make a difference, and some people find that using weighted utensils or adaptive devices can be helpful. We can discuss those options in more detail if you’re interested. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. Just get it fixed. That’s all I ask. And don't waste my time with fancy utensils. I just want my hand to stop shaking. Now, can I go? I’ve got a nap waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. The nurse will be in shortly to review the lab orders and schedule your neurology appointment. Here's a summary of our visit and the orders for the lab tests. If you have any questions or concerns after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a restful nap. Have a good day, Mr. Baide.
PATIENT: Waste of time, the whole lot of it… just old age, that’s all it is… .
