DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I just… I want to have a baby, okay? And I want it to be easy. My first… well, it was fine, but I don’t want any trouble this time around. I’m not getting any younger, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Planning a pregnancy is a good idea, and addressing any concerns beforehand is smart. So, to clarify, you've had a previous pregnancy… and you're hoping for a straightforward experience this time. Can you tell me a bit more about your first pregnancy?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was ages ago. Normal, I guess. I went to the doctor, they told me what to do, I had the baby. No complications, thankfully. I don’t remember all the details, it was… a long time ago. I just want this one to be the same. No fuss. Is that… possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, “normal” pregnancy, no complications… that’s good to hear. And wanting a similar experience is perfectly reasonable. To help me assess things, let’s go through some things. First, when was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You need to know that? Look, I don't really track that stuff. It was… sometime this year. Maybe June? Honestly, I really don’t keep up with it. Is it that important?
DOCTOR: It is, Ms. Villarreal. Knowing your last period helps us estimate how far along you might be, and that impacts what tests we need to do. It also helps rule out any immediate concerns. Approximately June… okay. Do you have any idea about the regularity of your cycles – are they usually fairly predictable, or do they vary a lot?
PATIENT: Predictable? Look, they come when they come. Sometimes sooner, sometimes later. It’s never been… precise. I don’t sit around with a calendar waiting for it, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s just… body stuff, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Irregular cycles can sometimes make things a little more challenging, but it’s certainly not a roadblock. Have you been trying to conceive for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: Trying? Well, we’ve… not been actively trying, if that makes sense. You know. We’ve… stopped preventing things. That’s it. It hasn’t happened yet, and I'm starting to worry it won’t. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious when you’re hoping to get pregnant, Ms. Villarreal. Stopping prevention is a good first step. "Not actively trying" for how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know. Maybe three months? Four? Time gets away from you. My husband… well, he passed away last year, and things have just been… different. I want this to be… simple. I just want a baby, and I don’t want to spend years going to doctors and getting tests and… everything.
DOCTOR: I am so very sorry for your loss, Ms. Villarreal. That must have been incredibly difficult. And I understand completely wanting this process to be as straightforward as possible, especially given everything you've been through. Three or four months of trying… okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss some basic blood tests to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… quick, please. And no poking and prodding if you can avoid it. I just want to know if there’s something obviously wrong with me, okay? I don’t need a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Then, a quick weight check. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/76, that's within normal limits. Weight is 130 pounds, height is 164 centimeters, BMI is 24.2, which is within a healthy range. Now, I'd like to draw some blood to check your hormone levels and rule out any common issues. Do you have any allergies to latex or bandaging materials?
PATIENT: Latex? I don’t think so. I’ve never had a problem, but I don't go around testing things, do I? Just… get it over with, please. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem. We’ll be as quick as possible. I'll use a standard needle, and let the phlebotomist know you're not a fan. This will take just a few minutes. We'll check your thyroid levels, basic blood count, and some hormone levels that can affect fertility. After the blood draw, we can discuss the results and what the next steps might be. Just relax your arm for me…
PATIENT: Just… hurry. And don’t let it hurt. I really don't do well with pain.
DOCTOR: Alright, all done. You might feel a little pinch for a moment, but it should be over quickly. Here's a bandage, keep that on for a few hours. We’ll send the blood to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, is there anything else you want to discuss, or any questions you have?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell me if something's wrong. And don't make me come back if it's nothing serious. I really don’t have the patience for a lot of appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Villarreal. We'll focus on getting you the information you need, and keep things as efficient as possible. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we can discuss them either over the phone or schedule a brief follow-up appointment, depending on what they show. If everything looks good, we can simply continue trying. If we find anything that needs attention, we'll discuss treatment options. Do you have any questions before I let you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get the results back quickly, please. I'm done here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We’ll do our best. The lab usually prioritizes fertility testing. The nurse will give you instructions on how to access your results online, and my office will contact you with any concerning findings. Thank you for coming in today. And again, I'm very sorry for your loss.
PATIENT: .
