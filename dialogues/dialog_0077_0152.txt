DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter...from the lab, I think? It said my cholesterol is high. Hyper... something. I don’t really understand all the medical words, but it seemed important, so I made an appointment.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, yes. That simply means high cholesterol. It is good you came in to discuss it. It can be important, you are right to be proactive. Now, do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father...he had a heart attack when he was fairly young, maybe in his sixties. And his brother, my Uncle Jan, he had a stroke a few years after that. I don’t think anyone else, though. My mother was always very healthy. Did she? It’s hard to remember sometimes, it was so long ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. And are you currently experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel fine. A little tired sometimes, but I’m 54, so… I just thought it was getting older. Nothing that made me think it was anything serious. I don't have any chest pain or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Very good. And have you had your cholesterol checked before?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think so, maybe at my yearly physical a couple of years ago? But I don’t remember the doctor saying anything about it being high then. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I usually don’t pay too much attention unless they tell me something is wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No medications, no. And no allergies that I know of! I'm pretty lucky that way. I haven't had much trouble with anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. My mother always said it was terrible for you, and she was right about most things. I don’t even like being around people who smoke, actually.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat pretty healthy. Lots of vegetables, some fish… I do like my cheese, though! And I have a sweet tooth, I’ll admit that. A little chocolate now and then. Nothing too crazy, I don’t think. I do like a good pastry… maybe that's bad?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily bad, Ms. Geho. Everything in moderation. And how much exercise do you get?
PATIENT: Oh, not enough, probably. I used to walk more…when I was younger. Now, I mostly just potter around the garden. And I do some light housework, does that count? I should probably be doing more, I know. My daughter keeps telling me to join a walking group.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a bit of regular physical activity is beneficial. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. That can be related to the high cholesterol, and sometimes anxiety about the results. Pulses are good, and abdomen is soft. Now, to get a better picture of your cholesterol levels and overall health, I'd like to order a full lipid panel, and also check your blood sugar and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. A full panel, absolutely. Anything that helps you figure out what's going on is good with me. I trust your judgement, Doctor. When do you need the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: The lab is right down the hall. You can go anytime today. I'll review the results as soon as they come in – usually within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, let’s focus on some initial lifestyle adjustments. I’d recommend incorporating a 30-minute walk most days of the week, and trying to reduce saturated and trans fats in your diet. We can discuss the results and potential medication options at your follow-up appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Thirty minutes of walking...I think I can manage that. And I'll try to be better about the food. Less cheese, maybe. When would the follow-up appointment be? A week? I hope it's not too long. I'm a little worried, even if I try not to show it.
DOCTOR: We can schedule you for one week from today, same time. That will give the lab time to process the results, and allow me adequate time to review everything thoroughly. Now, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please contact the office immediately. It's unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit better knowing we’re getting it checked out. I’ll go to the lab now, and I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Excellent. You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'll see you next week. Have a good day.
