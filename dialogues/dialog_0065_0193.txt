DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a bit embarrassing, actually. But, uh, I have been having… a lot of gas. More than usual. It is… quite disruptive, you understand? And sometimes… uncomfortable. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. Well, many things can cause increased flatulence. To get a better understanding, let's start with the basics. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started, I would say, maybe… three weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. It wasn't sudden, it was… gradual. Slowly getting worse, each day. I remember because the county fair was on, and it started around then. Not that I think the fair caused it, necessarily. But that's when I first noticed it was becoming… a problem.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, gradual onset. And you attended the county fair during this timeframe. Very well. Can you describe the gas itself?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. Well… it is… plentiful. And, uh, it has a… distinct odor. Not always, but often. Sometimes it smells like… cabbage, perhaps? Or onions. I eat both, you see. I like a good goulash. But it is… more than just what I eat, I believe. It’s… powerful, sometimes. I hope that is not too much information.
DOCTOR: No, it’s… information I need to assess the situation. Distinct odor, resembling cabbage or onions, you say. And you’ve noticed this is occurring despite your usual diet. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits – diarrhea, constipation, or a change in stool consistency?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. There is some bloating. Especially after I eat. It feels… full, very full. Not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable and tight. And, uh, my… stool has been a little… looser, perhaps? Not diarrhea, not watery, just… not as firm as usual. It’s difficult to explain. I have not noticed any constipation, no. It is… regular, but… different. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Bloating after eating, looser stools… Not necessarily bad, but it’s certainly something we need to investigate. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No, no blood. Definitely not. And… no, I haven’t lost any weight. If anything, I might have gained a little. I do enjoy my food, you see. My wife… well, she used to cook very good meals. But… that was some time ago now. But no weight loss, no. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid medications if I can. My mother always said… they do more harm than good. Just a little liniment for my knees sometimes, when they bother me. But nothing regularly. And no supplements, no vitamins… just… food. And water, of course. Plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been… quite healthy, all my life, really. A few colds, of course. And a bad flu once, years ago. But no… no diagnoses. My knees bother me a little, but that’s just old age, I think. Nothing serious. The doctor back in the village… he just said it was arthritis. But never anything with my stomach. Or… intestines, is that the right word? I am not very good with medical terms, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… My mother… she had a weak stomach, I remember. Always complaining of indigestion. And my father… he had… something with his gallbladder, I think. Had to have an operation. But… nobody with anything like this. No… no gas problems. Or… bowel trouble. My sister is very healthy, also. She lives in Budapest. Very strong constitution, she has. Always did.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Well… I live alone, you see. Always have, since… since my wife passed. I used to work at the bakery, but I retired a few years ago. Now I mostly… keep to myself. I like to garden. And read. And… I enjoy a little pálinka sometimes. Not much, just… for medicinal purposes, you understand? It helps with my knees, you see. And my digestion. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Goodstein, I'm going to perform a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently palpate it to assess for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything causes you discomfort.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I shall lie down, then. Please… be gentle, if you would. My back… it isn’t what it used to be. And… please let me know if you find anything. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I am detecting some mild tympany – that is, increased air in the abdomen – primarily in the lower quadrants. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness, but there is some… diffuse abdominal discomfort upon palpation. No palpable masses. Bowel sounds are… present, but slightly hyperactive. Alright, Mr. Goodstein. It appears your abdomen is somewhat distended and hyperactive, likely contributing to the gas. However, there is no immediate cause for alarm. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel – to rule out any underlying inflammation or electrolyte imbalances. I will also order a stool sample analysis to check for any bacterial overgrowth or parasites.
PATIENT: Blood work and… a stool sample? Oh dear. Well… if that is what is necessary, Doctor. I suppose I understand. So… I will need to… collect a sample? And bring it here? When? And… how much? I am not very good with these… medical procedures, you see. And the thought… it is a little distressing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Goodstein. You will need to collect a stool sample. The laboratory will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. It’s a relatively simple procedure. You will need to collect a small amount – about the size of a walnut – in the provided container. The instructions will specify how to properly collect and transport the sample. I will have the nurse provide you with the kit and instructions before you leave. It is important to collect the sample as soon as possible. Preferably within 24 hours. The laboratory will need to receive it within 72 hours. It is a necessary step, Mr. Goodstein, to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we are providing you with the appropriate care.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. A walnut, you say. Within 72 hours. I shall… endeavor to comply. I trust the nurse will be… discreet? It is a rather… delicate matter, you understand. And… what about the blood work? Will I need to fast? And… how long will it take to get the results? I do not want to be waiting for weeks, you see. I have a garden to tend, and… well, I would like to get back to my routine as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Goodstein. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours prior to the blood work. The nurse will provide you with a requisition form and instructions. As for the results, it typically takes 3-5 business days for the laboratory to process the tests and provide us with the findings. We will contact you as soon as they are available. I understand you would like to get back to your routine, Mr. Goodstein, but it’s important to be thorough. These tests are necessary to rule out any serious underlying conditions. For now, I am going to recommend a bland diet – avoid fatty foods, sugary drinks, and carbonated beverages. You may also consider over-the-counter simethicone to help alleviate the gas. If your symptoms worsen or you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, abdominal pain, or bloody stools – please contact us immediately. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Simethicone… Bland diet, avoid… carbonated beverages. And simethicone. I shall try to remember that. No… I do not think so, Doctor. Unless… Will this… gas… cause any long-term problems? Or… is it just… embarrassing? And… is there anything I can do right now? To… perhaps minimize it? Before I take the simethicone and eat… bland things? I do hate to bother you, but… it is quite distressing, you see. And I have a county fair to attend next week…
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, it’s unlikely that this gas will cause any long-term problems, assuming it’s not related to a more serious underlying condition – which is why we’re running the tests. As for minimizing it right now… avoid swallowing air – eat slowly, chew your food thoroughly, and avoid talking while you eat. You may also try gentle abdominal massage, moving in a clockwise direction. Beyond that, there's not much you can do until we have the results of the tests. I believe that covers everything. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the collection kit, requisition forms, and instructions. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask her. And Mr. Goodstein… perhaps reconsider attending the county fair next week. The fried food and sugary drinks are unlikely to improve your condition.
PATIENT: .
