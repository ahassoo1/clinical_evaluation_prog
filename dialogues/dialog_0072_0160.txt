DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I’m Dr. Hembrey. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… tiredness. And something else that's just… embarrassing, really. I don’t even want to say it. It’s not normal, I can tell you that much. I just feel so weak all the time, and then I get these… urges. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s difficult to discuss sensitive matters, Ms. Hardenburgh. My role is to help you, and that requires complete honesty. We are in a safe and confidential environment. Let’s start with the tiredness. Can you describe it further?
PATIENT: Oh, I know what you’re thinking. “Old lady getting weak,” right? It's not just that! It’s… it's like there's no energy in me. Even getting out of bed is a struggle. And it's been getting worse, slowly, over… well, I don't know exactly how long, truthfully. Months, probably. It’s just… draining. Like someone is sucking the life out of me.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Hardenburgh, I am not making assumptions. Fatigue can stem from a multitude of causes, and age is rarely the sole determining factor. You mentioned it's been gradually worsening over months. Is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, naturally. But even on a “good” day, I feel… depleted. Like I could collapse if I tried to do too much. And it’s not just physical, you know? It’s… mental exhaustion too. Like I can't focus, can't think straight. Honestly, I'm surprised I even remembered to come here today.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned something else was bothering you, something… embarrassing?
PATIENT: Ugh. This is the part I really don’t want to talk about. It’s… I eat dirt. Not regularly, but when I get this feeling… this craving… I just… have to. Clay, mostly. Sometimes just earth from the garden. It sounds insane, I know. My mother would roll over in her grave. I try not to, really I do, but it's like… a need. And I feel… better, temporarily, afterwards. But then I feel awful for even doing it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, what you are describing is a condition called pica. It’s the persistent craving and consumption of non-nutritive substances. While it can occur in various populations, it’s important we investigate the underlying cause. Have you noticed anything that triggers these cravings?
PATIENT: Triggers? Honestly, no. It just… happens. Usually when I’m feeling particularly weak and tired, like I said. Sometimes it's just the smell of the garden after it rains. It's silly, really. I don't want to eat dirt! It’s disgusting. I try to distract myself. Watch television, read… anything. But if it gets bad enough, nothing helps. It’s like a… compulsion, I suppose. I just… give in.
DOCTOR: Compulsions, as you describe them, coupled with the fatigue and the pica, raise some concerns. It's crucial we rule out any underlying nutritional deficiencies. Specifically, we need to check your iron levels, vitamin B12, and zinc. Additionally, given your age and symptoms, we should also assess your thyroid function. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a complete blood count as well. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Medications? Not really. I don’t take much. Just… a little something for my arthritis when it flares up. Ibuprofen, usually. Sometimes naproxen. Nothing regular, though. And no allergies, as far as I know. I've lived a long life, I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? Look, are you just going to poke and prod me with needles all day? Because if that's all this is, I’d rather just go home and try to get some rest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, the bloodwork is a necessary step in determining the cause of your symptoms. It is not simply "poking and prodding." It allows us to identify any underlying issues that may be contributing to your fatigue and pica. As for your arthritis medication, what dosage do you usually take when you experience a flare-up?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. Two ibuprofen, maybe 200 milligrams each, when it really hurts. Usually just once or twice a day, if that. I don’t like taking pills, you know? I try to tough it out. And frankly, I don't see what any of this has to do with eating dirt. It just… happens! You're making a mountain out of a molehill, honestly. Can't we just give me something for the tiredness?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your frustration, but dismissing your symptoms or self-treating with over-the-counter medication without a proper diagnosis is not advisable. The pica is significant, and it can be indicative of a serious underlying issue – such as iron deficiency anemia. We must determine the root cause before addressing any symptoms. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions, besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Fine. Arthritis, that’s it. Old age, really. A little high blood pressure, the doctor mentioned it once, years ago, but he said it wasn’t anything to worry about. I don't remember taking anything for it, though. I mostly just try to watch my salt intake. Honestly, I've been perfectly healthy most of my life, until this… weakness started. I don't need a laundry list of tests, I just need some energy.
DOCTOR: You mentioned high blood pressure, but haven’t been formally diagnosed or treated?
PATIENT: No. The doctor just said to watch my salt. Years ago. A long time ago. It wasn’t anything serious, or so he said. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? Because I'm starting to feel even more tired just sitting here. Can’t you just… give me something? Anything?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand you are seeking relief, however, prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. Given your fatigue, the pica, and the mention of past blood pressure concerns, I'm concerned about several possibilities, including iron deficiency anemia, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. We must proceed with the bloodwork and a physical examination to determine the underlying cause. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Family history? Really? Everyone just… gets old and dies, mostly. My mother had arthritis, like me. And she… well, she was always a bit frail. Not much else, really. No heart problems, no cancers, just… old age. Look, I didn’t come here to relive my family tree. Can we please just focus on me and getting me feeling better? I've got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: While a detailed family history isn’t always critical, it can provide valuable clues. Nevertheless, we will proceed. Now, regarding your social history: Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes. Always have, really. Never married. Didn't see much point in it. I manage fine on my own. Always have. I have a gardener who comes once a week, and a cleaning lady every other week. But mostly, it’s just me. Honestly, I prefer it that way. Don't need anyone fussing over me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! I'm a respectable woman. I barely drink tea, and I certainly don't smoke or… whatever it is people do these days. I eat sensible foods, mostly. I try to stay healthy. I don't understand why you're asking me all these ridiculous questions. It's not like any of this is relevant to eating dirt.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, everything is potentially relevant. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine you for any signs of physical deficiencies. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, just wonderful. More poking and prodding. Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to be grateful. I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Please take a deep breath, and exhale slowly. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Lungs are clear, with no apparent wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 150/90. Elevated. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses palpated. Slight edema in the ankles. Skin appears slightly pale. Your blood pressure is elevated, and you exhibit some edema and pallor. This, combined with your fatigue and pica, is concerning. We must proceed with the bloodwork to determine the underlying cause.
PATIENT: See? I told you something was wrong! But you just kept poking and prodding and asking me about my family tree. Now you’re finally admitting something is amiss. Well, get on with it then! Order the tests, give me something, whatever it takes. I just want to feel like myself again. Honestly, this whole experience has been dreadful. I should have just stayed home and rested.
DOCTOR: The results will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a multivitamin with iron to address the potential deficiency. It won't resolve the underlying issue, but it may provide some temporary relief. I'm also going to recommend a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. If your symptoms worsen before then, please contact the office immediately. And, Ms. Hardenburgh, I strongly suggest you consider making some dietary changes to include more iron-rich foods. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… get me out of here. I'm tired, I'm frustrated, and frankly, I don't trust any of this. I'll take the pills, I suppose, but I'm not holding my breath. And please, don’t call me again unless it’s absolutely necessary. Good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hardenburgh. The nurse will escort you to the checkout desk. If you experience any significant changes in your condition, please do not hesitate to seek medical attention. .
