DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty. Or... is it Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. It’s… well, people call me Betty. Always have. Mr. Schneer feels… formal, you know? Though, I suppose that is my name. It’s a bit fuzzy these days, all the names and dates.
DOCTOR: Betty it is, then. No worries at all about the names and dates, that happens. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Everything’s a bit muffled, like talking underwater. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Said I was missing things on the television and not hearing folks when they talk. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very common for hearing to change with age, Betty. But we should take a look, just to be sure. Can you tell me how long you’ve noticed this muffling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It’s been… a while, I suppose. Not sudden, more like it crept up on me. Maybe… a year? Two? It's hard to say for certain. I used to be able to hear a pin drop, my mother always said. Now… not so much. Is that helpful? I feel bad not knowing exactly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A gradual change over a year or two is common. And don't worry about not knowing the exact dates – we'll figure things out. Have you noticed it being worse in certain situations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I think so. When there’s a lot of noise, like at the grocery store, it’s awful. And when people aren’t speaking clearly, or are facing away from me. It’s easier when it’s quiet and they’re right in front of me. Does that make sense? I sometimes have trouble explaining things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Sounds like it's more difficult to hear in noisy environments and when the sound isn’t clear. Alright. Now, have you ever had any ringing in your ears, or any pain or discomfort in either ear?
PATIENT: Ringing… now that’s a funny thing. Sometimes, yes. A little bit of a… whooshing sound. Not all the time, and it’s not terribly loud. More like a distant hum, you know? And no, no pain. Never any pain. Just the quiet… or the muffling, as I said. I haven't fallen or bumped my head or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little bit of ringing, no pain, no recent injury. Good to know. Now, let’s see... have you ever had any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: Balance? Well… I wouldn’t say problems, exactly. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I figured that was just… old age again. I don't fall often, but I do need to hold onto things a bit more than I used to. My daughter worries about that, too. Says I shuffle when I walk.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little unsteadiness, shuffling when you walk. That’s good information. Now, I’m going to ask you about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a long list, I think. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure years ago, but they got that under control with pills. And I had my gallbladder taken out when I was younger. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I might be forgetting something important.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. High blood pressure and gallbladder removal. We can look through your records to confirm. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the pills for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the blood pressure pills, definitely. And… let me see… my daughter helps me with those. She puts them in little containers each week. I think there’s one for my arthritis, to help with the joints. And… oh, a little vitamin D, she says I don't get enough sunshine. Let me see… that's all I can think of right now. She keeps track of most of it, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, arthritis medication, and vitamin D. I see it here. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I used to help my mother with the gardening, and I never had trouble with the pollen. I eat most things, too. Though I don’t care for beets, but that’s not an allergy! Is that helpful? I always feel silly trying to remember these things.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Betty. No known allergies. Alright. Now, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope. It just helps me see if there’s anything obvious going on. It won’t hurt a bit. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. I’m a bit nervous about things going in my ears, you see. I always worry something will get stuck. But if you say it won’t hurt, I trust you. Go ahead, dear. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, just going to take a quick look… Okay, left ear… hmm… and now the right ear… Okay. I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which is common, especially as we get older. The ear canals themselves look normal. No signs of infection or anything concerning. It looks like the wax might be contributing to the muffling you’re experiencing.
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? Well, that’s… good, I suppose. Something simple. I always thought it was just my old age. My daughter will be relieved if it's something fixable. So, can you… get it out? Is that what you do? I don't want anything poked around too much, mind you.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely remove the wax. There are a few ways to do it. We can use ear drops to soften it up and then gently flush it out, or we can use a small tool to carefully remove it. I think the ear drops would be the most comfortable option for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, drops sound much nicer than… tools. Definitely drops, dear. As gentle as possible, please. I don’t like the idea of anything being poked around in there. My ears are rather sensitive, you see. Will the drops sting? Or make me dizzy? I always get a bit nervous about things going in my ears.
DOCTOR: No, the drops shouldn't sting or make you dizzy at all. They're just a mineral oil-based solution to soften the wax. It might feel a little cool or slightly strange for a moment, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. I'll explain the process thoroughly before we start, and we can go as slow as you need. We'll start with a few drops in each ear, wait about five to ten minutes, and then gently flush them out with warm water. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Five to ten minutes, and warm water. Alright. As long as it's warm. Not cold! And you’ll explain everything, you said? That would be very kind of you. I always feel better when I know what’s happening. My daughter usually does all this for me, but… well, she's busy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll explain every step before I do it. And we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. First, I’m going to warm up the water to body temperature. Then, I’ll instill a few drops into each ear… … and then we’ll gently flush them out with a syringe. It's a very gentle process, and it shouldn’t take long at all. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. I think… I think I’m ready. As long as you promise to be gentle. And explain everything. And warm water, remember! My ears are very sensitive, you know. This is probably the bravest I’ve been all year, I reckon. Go ahead, then. But slowly, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty. Just a few drops now… warm water, as promised. This might feel a little cool. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We’ll wait about five minutes for the water to soften the wax… How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: It's… a little cool, you're right. Not unpleasant, just… noticeable. It feels a bit tingly, maybe? Like a tiny bubble in my ear. Not painful, though. And I’m relaxed, I think. Just a bit nervous, as I said. Five minutes, you said? That seems like a long time to have water in my ear. But alright, I’m trusting you, dear.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a few more minutes. The tingling is normal. It's just the water working to soften the wax. We’ll wait until it feels a little looser, and then we’ll gently flush it out. We’re halfway there… How are you doing?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… still tingly. Not worse, just… present. I can hear a little bit of… a whooshing sound now, in my ear. Like the ocean, maybe? That's probably the water, isn't it? I’m trying to relax, dear. It's just hard when I know something is in my ear. My daughter always says I worry too much.
DOCTOR: Yes, the whooshing sound is likely the water. It's completely normal. You're doing great, Betty. Just a few more moments… Okay, it's been about five minutes now. Are you feeling any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Just… awareness, I suppose. Like a little fullness in my ear. Not painful, just… present. The whooshing sound is still there, a bit like waves. Are you ready to… flush it out now? I’m a bit nervous about that part, but I trust you, dear. Just promise to be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. Just a few gentle flushes with warm water now. I'll start slowly, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Now, this might feel a little strange… just relax, and breathe deeply. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh! That is strange. It feels… swishy, and a bit tickly. Like a little wave inside my ear. Not painful, but… unexpected. It’s making my head feel a bit… light, maybe? Just a little bit. Is this normal? I’m trying to relax, dear, I really am. Just… let me know if something isn’t right, alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal. The sensation is due to the water dislodging the wax. A little bit of dizziness is also common, but it should pass quickly. Let me take a look... Okay, excellent. I’m seeing a lot of wax coming out now. We'll repeat the process a few more times to ensure we get everything out. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh, it's… better now that you stopped for a moment. The dizziness is fading, I think. I can hear a little bit clearer, maybe? It's hard to tell. I'm glad you're getting the wax out, though. It feels good to know something is finally happening. Keep going, dear. I trust you. Just… be gentle, alright? And let me know if you see anything… unusual.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few more gentle flushes… Okay, excellent. I’m seeing very little wax coming out now. I think we’ve gotten the majority of it. Let me take one final look… Okay, excellent. The ear canal looks much clearer now. I think we’ve gotten all of the wax out. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, that feels… much better. Really. Lighter, and clearer. I can definitely hear better now. It's not perfect, but it's a huge improvement. It's like… lifting a weight off my ear. Thank you, dear. You were very gentle, and you explained everything so well. I really appreciate it. Now, what happens next? Will I need to come back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. I'm glad we were able to improve your hearing. Now, I recommend we schedule a hearing test with an audiologist to assess the extent of any remaining hearing loss. It's possible the wax buildup was masking some underlying loss. I'll write you a referral. If the hearing test reveals significant loss, we can discuss options like hearing aids. The audiologist will be able to provide you with more detailed information. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A hearing test, you say? Alright, that sounds sensible. Better to know for sure, I suppose. I'll give the audiologist a call, then. Thank you for the referral, dear. I think… I think that's all my questions for now. You’ve been very kind, and very patient with an old woman like me. I appreciate it. Now, can I get a cup of tea before I leave? I feel a bit shaky after all that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Betty. Let me have one of the nurses bring you a cup of tea. And you're not an old woman at all! You’re a very brave one, for letting me work on your ears. "Nurse, could you please bring a cup of tea to exam room three?
PATIENT: Oh, you're too kind. "Brave" is a bit much, I reckon. Just a bit stubborn, perhaps. Thank you again, dear. You've put my mind at ease. A cup of tea sounds lovely. I'll just sit here and rest for a moment while we wait. It's good to finally have some clarity, you know? Not just in my ears, but in my head, too.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Betty. I'm glad I could help. Take your time and rest. We’ll get that tea for you right away. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after the hearing test. Here’s my card. .
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. I appreciate that. .
