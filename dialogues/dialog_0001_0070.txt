DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, yes… 58. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, yes. New to area, you know? Just… checking things. Doctor says I need to come. Medicare thing. Not much wrong, really. Just… old. Everything gets old, yes?
DOCTOR: Right. “Old.” Well, everyone gets older, that's a fact. But “checking things” isn’t a diagnosis, sir. Is there something specific bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering? Not… not really. Back aches a little. Always has. From work, you see? I do… faces. Make up the faces for the… the plays. Very important work. Lots of bending. Is that… is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: “Make up the faces for the plays?
PATIENT: Yes! Makeup artist. For… the theater. You know, the actors? They need to look like someone, yes? I make them look. Very good, I am. Used to be very busy. Now… not so much. Old, remember?
DOCTOR: Right. A makeup artist. Okay. And this back pain… how long has it been bothering you?
PATIENT: Long time. Very long. Maybe… ten years? Fifteen? I don't keep track of these things. Comes and goes. Worse when it’s cold. I rub it. Sometimes helps.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it just the back?
PATIENT: Just back. Mostly. Sometimes knees… a little creaky. But that's just… age, you know? I told you. Everything goes. Not a big deal. I walk. I still walk.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other issues?
PATIENT: Issues? No. Not really. I… I forget things sometimes. But that's always been me, yes? Not new. Wife used to… well, never mind. Old. Everything fades.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmm. I… I don’t think so. Maybe? I take a little something for… for the water. My water isn't good. But not an allergy. Just… a pill. Small, white pill.
DOCTOR: A pill for the water?
PATIENT: Yes. For the… the pipes. Makes it… taste better. Not good water here, you know? Old pipes. My wife… she found it. Small bottle. I just take one every day. Don’t know what it is. Doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll need to figure out what that “pill” is. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand? Yes, yes, I can stand. Little stiff, but… alright. Here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me check your range of motion… And any pain with this?
PATIENT: Ooh. Yes. A little. There. Not… bad, but… you feel it, yes? Old injury, I think. From lifting. Heavy boxes. For the plays.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about bending forward?
PATIENT: Like this? Oof. Not so good. Can't go very far. Stiff. Very stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about sideways?
PATIENT: No. No good. Very… tight. I told you. Old. Everything is stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Like this? Not much air, you see? Old lungs. Always been a little… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need to get some x-rays of your back to get a better look. And I want a full blood panel, including a kidney function test. That pill you're taking for the "water" is concerning. We need to know what it is.
PATIENT: X-rays? Blood? Oh. That's… a lot. Is something wrong? Very wrong? I just want my back to feel better. And maybe remember where I put my glasses.
DOCTOR: Look, sir. You're 58. You have back pain, you take an unknown pill, and you're forgetting things. It’s standard procedure to rule things out. We'll get the results back quickly and then we can figure out what's going on. I’m going to write up the orders for the x-rays and blood work now. The receptionist will schedule the appointments for you. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. Will it hurt? The x-rays? And the blood? And… what if the pill is… bad? My wife… she always knew best. Oh. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: The x-rays won't hurt, sir. It's just a brief exposure to radiation. The blood draw will sting for a moment. As for the pill… we won’t know if it’s “bad” until we get the results. That’s why we're doing the tests. I'm writing the orders now. Once you have the appointments scheduled, go, get them done, and we’ll go from there. Do you have any appointments you need to cancel?
PATIENT: Cancel? No. No appointments. Just… old. I used to be busy. Very busy. Is… is this going to cost a lot of money? Medicare… will it cover it? My wife… she handled all this.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover most of it, sir. We'll submit everything. Look, I need to see other patients. The receptionist will handle the specifics with the billing. Just focus on getting the tests done. Here's the requisition form. And the appointment slip for the lab. Is that everything?
PATIENT: Lab? Requisition… Okay. Okay. Lab. Where… where is the lab? And… will they tell me what the pill is? Or do I have to ask you? My wife… she would have known all this.
DOCTOR: The lab is down the hall, to the left. The results will be sent to me. I will tell you the results. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have other patients waiting. Try to relax, sir. And please, try to remember the name of that pill. It would make things much easier.
PATIENT: Relax? Remember? My wife… Where are my glasses…? .
