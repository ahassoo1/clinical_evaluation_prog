DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I’m Dr. Sham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Sham. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. It's been… not good, for a while now. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been on and off, but mostly on lately, if that makes sense? I just... feel really drained because of it. Honestly, I don’t really remember exactly when it started, but probably a few weeks, maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: A few weeks to a month… alright. And when you say “not good,” can you describe the diarrhea a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Um... okay. It’s… watery, mostly. And it happens a lot. Like, more than usual, definitely. Sometimes it's just a few times a day, but other times… well, a lot more. And it's… kinda urgent, if you know what I mean? Like, I have to go right now. It’s… disruptive, I guess. I’ve also been feeling really tired, even when I get enough sleep. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: Watery, frequent, and urgent… yes, that’s helpful. And you mentioned tiredness. Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain associated with this?
PATIENT: Hmm... fever, no, I don’t think so. I haven’t checked my temperature, but I don’t feel hot. Nausea… sometimes, a little bit, but not usually. Vomiting, no, thankfully. Abdominal pain… yeah, a bit. Not really sharp pain, more like… cramping? And it comes and goes. It's not constant, but it's there sometimes, especially when I… well, when I need to go to the bathroom. I’m really sorry, this is kinda embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, cramping with bowel movements. No fever, minimal nausea, no vomiting. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or a change in its color?
PATIENT: Oh, um… blood, no, not that I’ve seen. The color… I don’t really pay attention, to be honest. It’s… brown, I guess? Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker, but I haven’t really noticed anything different different, if that makes sense? I just… usually don't look. I know, it's bad, but I try not to think about it too much. It's probably just… you know. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's not always easy to discuss these things. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet… hmm. Not really. I eat pretty much the same stuff. My husband does most of the cooking, and it’s usually Pakistani food – rice, daal, maybe some chicken or lamb. Nothing new that I can think of. I did have a salad a few days ago, from that new place downtown, but that’s it. And I didn’t feel sick right after, so I didn't think much of it. Maybe that? But I eat salads sometimes, and I've never had problems before. Honestly, everything feels… blurry, remembering. Is that weird?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not weird at all. Memory can be… unreliable. Okay, so consistent diet, no recent major changes, a salad a few days ago. Any travel recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No, not at all. I haven’t left town in… a long time. My husband and I… we don't really go anywhere. We mostly just stay home. Work keeps us pretty busy. And… well, to be honest, I haven't had the energy to travel, even if I wanted to. Does that… matter? I’m probably just making this harder. I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making it harder. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture. No recent travel. Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. I… I just want to figure out what’s wrong. It's just been so draining, and I'm tired of feeling like I can’t leave the house. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the exam table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels painful. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Anything there?
PATIENT: Okay... Deep breath… No… not really. It doesn't really hurt, exactly. Just… a little bit uncomfortable, sometimes. It’s… hard to explain. Like a cramping feeling, but not sharp. Ooh, there, maybe? Just a little. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, a little tenderness in the lower left quadrant. Normal bowel sounds, but I do hear some… hyperactive activity. No significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft overall. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to rule out anything else. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing some form of gastroenteritis, possibly infectious, but we need to rule a few things out.
PATIENT: Gastro… what-itis? Is that bad? And what do you mean, rule things out? Like… what things? I get so confused when you say all those words. Is it something serious? I'm sorry for being so... dense.
DOCTOR: Gastroenteritis just means inflammation of the stomach and intestines – basically, a stomach bug. It can be caused by a virus, bacteria, or parasites. Usually, it’s not serious, and it goes away on its own, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. We’re going to order a stool sample – it'll help us identify if there’s a specific infection causing this. We’ll also check your electrolytes to make sure you aren't dehydrated from the diarrhea. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Stool sample… oh. That sounds… unpleasant. But okay, if you think it's necessary. Electrolytes? Is that from a blood test? I… I don’t really like needles. I understand about the stool sample… mostly. I just want to feel better, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes. Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, electrolytes require a blood draw. I understand your apprehension about needles – many people feel that way. We'll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. The lab technician is very skilled. We’ll also run a basic metabolic panel, just to get a broader picture. As for the stool sample, the nurse will give you instructions and a collection kit. It's not pleasant, no, but it's a very important step in figuring this out. Results usually take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated – drink plenty of fluids, like water or electrolyte solutions. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and fatty foods, as these can worsen the diarrhea. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay... hydrate, no dairy, caffeine or fatty foods. I can do that. My husband is really good at making soups, so maybe I'll just stick to that for a bit. And… the stool sample, I'll get that done as soon as possible. Will the nurse give me the kit right away? And… if it is something serious, what… what are we talking about? I get so scared just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: The nurse will give you the kit right away, yes. As for “serious,” we’re thinking about things like bacterial infections – C. difficile is one possibility – or inflammatory bowel disease. But it's far too early to jump to any conclusions. That’s why we need the tests. The vast majority of cases are viral and resolve on their own with supportive care – hydration and rest. We’re just being thorough. I’ll write an order for the lab tests and the stool sample. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the collection process and draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh... C. difficile? Is that… bad? I don't think I've ever heard of that. No allergies, no. Not to any medications. I haven't had to take much, thankfully. Just painkillers for headaches sometimes, and I’ve never had a reaction. This is all just… a lot. I just want to know what's wrong and get it fixed.
DOCTOR: C. difficile is a bacterial infection that can cause severe diarrhea, especially after antibiotic use. But you haven’t mentioned taking any antibiotics, so it's less likely in your case. We’ll know more once we have the results. Alright, here’s the lab requisition. The nurse will be with you shortly to collect your sample and draw your blood. In the meantime, try to rest and focus on staying hydrated. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or see blood in your stool – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… fever, severe pain, blood in stool… I’ll remember that. I think I understand. Thank you, Dr. Sham. You’ve… explained everything really well. Even the scary parts. I appreciate it. I guess… I’ll just wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The nurse will be right with you. .
