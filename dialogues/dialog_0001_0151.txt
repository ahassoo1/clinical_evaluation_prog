DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's getting… annoying. Not painful, just… there. Feels like pins and needles, you know? Especially when I’m sorting mail. It makes it hard to feel what I’m doing.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles, huh?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s mostly in my fingers and thumbs, but sometimes it goes up my arms a little bit. It comes and goes, but it seems to be happening more often now, especially after a long day at work. I deliver a lot of mail… it's a physical job, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, a physical job. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? At first it was just now and then, I didn’t pay much attention to it. I figured it was just my hands getting tired. But like I said, it’s been happening more often lately. It’s not constant, thankfully. It's just… worrisome. I need my hands for work, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months. Okay. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. No pain, like I said. Not weakness, or anything like that. Just the tingling. Sometimes my hands feel a little… numb, but that goes away pretty quickly. Oh! And they get cold easier, I think. But it’s been warm lately, so maybe I'm just imagining that. I don't know. It’s hard to say. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Cold hands… alright. And you said you deliver mail. Any changes in your routine recently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Same route, same amount of mail, same everything. Except… well, the weather’s been hotter this summer, I suppose. More sun, maybe? That doesn’t seem important, though. I always wear gloves when I sort, of course, but still. It's the same job I’ve been doing for… oh, goodness, almost 40 years! I don’t know what would cause this now. It’s just… frustrating. It makes me nervous, you know? Losing my job wouldn’t be good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your hands. Just spread your fingers out for me, please. And try to relax them.
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. Try not to drop anything, I guess? I'm a little shaky today, to be honest. Is there anything wrong wrong, Doctor? I don't mean to rush you, but I have a lot to do after this.
DOCTOR: Grip seems… adequate. Reflexes are present, though a little diminished. Skin feels… normal. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, never. Not that I know of, anyway. My husband, God rest his soul, he had a little trouble with his sugar sometimes, but I don't… I don't think I do. I try to eat healthy, you know? Mostly vegetables, some meat… not too much sweets. I walk a lot with my job, so I figured I was okay. Are you thinking that’s what this is? Because I haven’t been feeling sick or anything, just the tingling.
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility. We’ll need to run some blood work to rule things out. There are other possibilities too, of course. Could be a nerve issue, something along those lines. But blood work is a good place to start. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. No trouble with bee stings or anything, or different foods. I don't take any medications, either. Just… what I need to keep going, you know? A little tea sometimes, that's all. So, blood work, huh? Will that take long? I have a route to finish today, and… well, the supervisor isn’t very understanding.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t take long. Just a standard blood draw. Go down to the lab, they’ll take care of it. I’ll have the results sent over, and we’ll go from there. And no, it shouldn’t interfere with your route. Now, is there anything else that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the tingling, really. And worrying about losing my job, but that’s not a medical problem, is it? I mean, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you looking at it. I just… hope it's not anything serious. I need to keep working. I don’t have insurance, you see, so… a big medical bill would be… difficult. But thank you again. I’ll go down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just let the lab know I sent you. And we'll see what the results say. Have a good day.
