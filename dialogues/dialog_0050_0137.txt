DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Para-skay-vo-poo-los? It’s a long name! My name is Lindra. My husband, he make appointment for me. Is for… the place. The senior place? He say I need… check before I go live there.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, that is correct. Paraskevopoulos. It is a bit of a mouthful, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes! Very long. My husband, he good with names. I… forget easy. So, the check… is for the senior place? You know, so I can go live there? Is good place, he say. Very nice.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lindra, this appointment is a pre-placement physical exam, as requested by your husband, to ensure you are in good health prior to transitioning to the senior living facility. We simply need to document your current health status. Now, to start, could you tell me a little about why you are considering moving to the facility?
PATIENT: Moving? Oh. He say is… better. I stay at home now. He work all day. Is… lonely sometimes. And the stairs… many stairs! My knees, they not so good anymore. He say the place have no stairs. Is… safe place, he say. He worry about me when he not here.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds as though your husband is very thoughtful, wanting to ensure your safety and well-being. And you are quite right, minimizing risk of falls is important. To get a more complete picture, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Doctor, I… I see the man. Not every time. Sometimes I feel okay, sometimes not. He give me… pills for the water, you know, for my blood. And the lady… she check my heart. Not the same man. Is… hard to remember all the names. My husband, he take me. He do all the… the scheduling.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that makes things a little more difficult, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes. Is difficult. I try remember, I promise. But… old age. You know? My brain… not work like before. Is okay, though. My husband, he very patient. He good man. He always remember for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's try to piece things together. Do you happen to know the names of the medications you are currently taking, even approximately?
PATIENT: Hmmm… the little white pill… for water, you know? And the blue one… for my heart. Sometimes I take the orange one when I… ache. My husband, he give me the right ones. He write it down, I think. In the kitchen? On the… refrigerator? I not sure. He keep all the papers.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can certainly try to obtain a list from your husband later. For now, let's focus on what you are experiencing. Are you having any specific symptoms at the moment?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… sick? No. Not now. I feel… tired sometimes. And my knees… they always hurt. A little bit. Not so bad. Just… old. And… sometimes I forget things. Like… what I was saying. Or… names. You know? But not all the time. Is just… a little bit. Is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindra. It sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes, as well as some discomfort in your knees. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? You mean… touch me? Is okay. I… I trust you, Doctor. My husband, he say you very good doctor. Just… gentle, please? My bones, they… old and break easy. He always tell the doctors, “Be gentle with her bones!” He worry.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lindra. I assure you, I will be very gentle. We'll start with checking your blood pressure and pulse, and then we'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’d like to take a look at your knees and check your range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… okay. Blood pressure? Pulse? I… I don't know what that mean, but okay. As long as you are gentle, like my husband say. And… not too long? I get tired easy. Is okay to sit down for a little bit during? My knees… they not like standing for long time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lindra. We can take things at your pace, and you are welcome to sit or lie down whenever you need to. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat here on the examination table, and I'll get started. Now, this may feel a little tight, but it won't hurt. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Tight is okay. I relax. My husband, he always say, “Relax, Lindra, relax!” He say I worry too much. But… is hard to relax sometimes. The stairs, you know? And the forgetting… But I try. I try very hard. Is okay, Doctor. You start. I relax.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is 148/86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath for me, Lindra. And another one. Heart sounds are regular, with a mild murmur. This is common with age. Now, let's listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Murmur? Is that bad, Doctor? Like… a little animal in my heart? My husband, he worry about everything. He say, “Always ask the doctor, Lindra!” Is okay, though. He just… care a lot. Lungs? I take deep breath. Is okay. Deep breath… like when I was young? I used to sing. A long time ago. Deep breath…
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees. They always make noise, Doctor. Like… little rocks rubbing together. Is okay, though. I bend… slowly. Is hard, you know? They not like they used to. See? Noise. And… a little bit of pain. Not so bad. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear some crepitus – that's the grating sound you're describing. There is mild tenderness on the inner aspect of both knees, and a small amount of swelling. Your range of motion is limited, but you are able to bend them to a reasonable degree. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Like… when you tap with the little hammer? My husband, he say I have good reflexes sometimes. But other times… not so good. Is okay. You tap, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? My legs… they sensitive. Like… little baby legs. Even though they old. Is okay. Tap.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but present. This is also common with age. Now, before we finish, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmmm… I think… maybe to the little red fruit? Strawberries? I get… little bumps on my skin. And… itchy. My husband, he remember. He always read the things. He say, “No strawberries for Lindra!” Is okay. I don't eat strawberries anyway. I like mango. Is sweet. No allergies to mango.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindra. And are you currently taking any medications, other than what we've already discussed?
PATIENT: Hmmm… I… I think that's all, Doctor. The white pill, the blue pill, the orange pill when I ache. And the strawberry no-no. My husband, he keep them safe. He put them in the little box. He very careful. He good man. Is all he do for me. I think… I think that's everything. Do you need more?
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindra. I believe we've covered everything for now. Based on my examination, you are in generally good health for your age, with some typical age-related changes and mild knee discomfort. I recommend continuing to manage your knee pain with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and to avoid activities that exacerbate the discomfort. I also advise you to maintain a healthy diet and get regular, gentle exercise. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmmm… Will… will I be okay at the senior place, Doctor? My husband, he say is very nice, but… is new. And I worry about falling. And forgetting things. Will I be safe? That is my question. Will I be safe?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Lindra. The senior living facility has staff available 24/7 to assist with any needs you may have. They are equipped to handle falls and provide assistance with medication management. It's a supervised environment, and they will be able to ensure your safety and well-being. Given your current health status, I don't foresee any major obstacles to you living comfortably and safely there. However, it's important to remember that no environment can completely eliminate risk. We've discussed fall prevention strategies, and I encourage you to follow those recommendations. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… My husband… he want me to be… happier. He say I lonely at home. Is okay, though. I used to sing. But now… Is that… is that okay? To be lonely sometimes? Even at the senior place? Will they let me be lonely sometimes? If I need to be? Or will they always make me… talk?
DOCTOR: Lindrah, it's perfectly normal to feel lonely from time to time, even in a social environment. The staff at the facility are there to support you, not to force you into social interactions you don't desire. They understand that everyone needs their own space and quiet time. They offer a variety of activities, but you are free to participate as much or as little as you wish. You will not be required to constantly socialize if you don't want to. The goal is to improve your quality of life, and that includes respecting your individual needs and preferences. Now, if you don’t have any further questions, I’ll have the nurse come in to review your medications and discharge instructions with you.
PATIENT: No… I think that is all, Doctor. You… you are very kind. And you make me feel… a little bit better. My husband, he will be happy to hear that. Thank you, Doctor Paraskevopoulos. For… for everything. You be careful too. Is important.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Lindrah. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a pleasant day. .
PATIENT: .
