DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Nixon. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Well, my left leg... it's gotten quite swollen. It's been bothering me, and I do have a bit of a heart flutter sometimes, the doctors told me about it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, a swollen left leg and some heart flutters… I see. Let’s start with the leg. When did you first notice the swelling, Nixon?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It started, I believe, maybe three days ago? It wasn't much at first, just a little puffiness, but it's gotten bigger each day. I noticed it properly on Monday, I think it was.
DOCTOR: Okay, Monday. And has anything specific brought it on, as far as you can tell?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven't been doing anything different. I’ve been teaching, as usual, and sitting at my computer a lot, but that’s normal for me. I didn't trip or bump it or anything like that. It just... appeared.
DOCTOR: Right, no injury. And is it painful?
PATIENT: Not terribly. It's more uncomfortable than painful, really. It feels… heavy, and a little achy if I stand for too long. It’s not a sharp pain, just a dull sort of feeling. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Hm. Dull ache and heaviness. It's good you can differentiate. And does anything make it better – like, elevating it, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, a little. If I put my leg up on a chair when I'm sitting, it feels a bit better. Not completely gone, but the ache isn’t as bad. And sitting does seem to help more than walking.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. That's good to know. Let's do a quick exam of your leg, if that’s alright with you. I just want to take a look and feel for anything unusual. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I hope it isn’t too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. The swelling is most noticeable around your calf and ankle. It is warm to the touch, and a little tender when I press here. Your pulses feel normal, thankfully, and seem equal in both feet. I don’t feel any unusual masses or lumps. It does appear to be localized to the left leg, as you said. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart, if that’s alright, just to get a baseline since you mentioned the flutters.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Please do. I haven't had it checked in a little while now, so a listen would be good. It doesn’t happen all the time, only sometimes when I'm stressed or tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not dramatically so, given that you’re here at the clinic. I can hear a regular rhythm, but there is a slight irregularity, which I suspect is what you've been feeling. Now, have you ever had a blood clot before?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven't, Doctor. I don't believe so, at least. I’ve not been told about one. My family doesn’t have a history of them, either, if that makes any difference. It’s just my heart that's given me trouble.
DOCTOR: Right, no personal or family history of clots. Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, Nixon?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I don't take anything regularly. Not for my heart, not for anything. I haven’t needed to, up until now. I just get a bit tired easily, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, I don't. As far as I am aware, I haven't got any allergies. I can eat anything, and I've not had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Now, one last question for now. Could you tell me a little bit about your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I'm a teacher, as I mentioned. So, most of my day is spent on my feet, walking between classrooms, or sitting at my desk grading papers. I don’t do much strenuous exercise, truthfully. I walk to and from work, which is about a fifteen-minute walk each way, and I do some light gardening on the weekends, but that’s about it. Nothing too exciting, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right, so mostly moderate activity. Okay Nixon, based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. The swelling, along with your history of heart flutters, raises a few possibilities. We need to rule out a blood clot, which can be serious. I’m also going to order some blood work to check your kidney function and overall health, and potentially an EKG to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… a bit worrying, to be honest. A blood clot sounds rather frightening. But yes, Doctor, if that’s what’s needed, then please do. I trust your judgement. An EKG and some blood work sound sensible. I just want to know what’s causing this swelling, and make sure it isn't something too serious. When would I be able to have those tests done?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s understandable to be concerned. It's always better to be cautious and rule things out. We can get the blood work done right here in the clinic today. I'll write you a requisition. For the EKG, we have a technician who comes in on Wednesdays, so let’s schedule that for Wednesday afternoon. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg as much as possible, and avoiding prolonged standing. If the swelling gets significantly worse, or if you experience any pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately, do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly. Elevate my leg, avoid standing, and go to the emergency room if it gets worse. Wednesday for the EKG sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing what’s going on, even if it is a bit worrying. I will try not to fret too much, and I will keep my leg up as you instructed. Where do I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, that’s good. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The technician there will need the requisition I'm giving you now. They will draw some blood and send it to the lab for analysis. They’ll let you know when it’s been sent, and we'll review the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That's everything, I believe. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I’ll see you on Wednesday then.
