DOCTOR: Hello, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day. I woke up this morning and…well, I can’t hear out of one ear. And my face feels…droopy on that same side. It’s rather inconvenient, if you must know. Is that enough for a starting point?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is a good starting point, thank you. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping… that definitely needs our attention. Just to be clear – and please correct me if I misunderstand – this started this morning?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely this morning. I woke up, went to make tea, and noticed immediately. It wasn’t gradual. It wasn’t a slow decline. It just…was. Honestly, I find it rather alarming. I’ve never experienced anything like it. And frankly, I don't have time for these sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sudden onset is important information. And I understand your concern – it is alarming when something comes on so quickly. Just to be thorough, and to help me understand the whole picture… have you had any other symptoms with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? A headache, maybe. A slight one, but I get those all the time. Nothing particularly… noteworthy. Look, I'm not one for dwelling on every little ache and pain. I’m a radiologist; I see problems all day. I'm used to bigger issues than a little headache. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. You're very familiar with medical issues, and that's helpful. Still, we need to be careful, even with a little headache, to rule out anything serious. A sudden change like this, especially with facial weakness, could have a number of causes. Before we go any further, have you noticed any dizziness, trouble with your balance, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Balance is fine. Vision…well, I wear glasses, as you can see. It's not better or worse, if that's what you’re asking. Just the same blurry mess as always. I really don’t understand why I need to go through all of this detail. Surely, a quick examination would be sufficient. I have appointments to get to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and that you're busy. But it’s important to gather all the information we can. We’re just trying to be as thorough as possible to determine the best course of action. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses? Hmm…let me think. No, nothing significant. A bit of a sniffle a couple of weeks ago, but nothing I bothered with. I rarely get sick. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. It's…unlikely that a simple cold would cause all of this. Really, are we getting anywhere with these questions or are we just going in circles?
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent illness is helpful to know. And you're right, we need to move toward an examination. Before we do, I’m going to ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? No. Diabetes? Absolutely not. I eat very well. Look, I'm a radiologist. I understand the implications of those conditions. I take good care of myself. Are you a new doctor? You seem… overly thorough. Perhaps a more experienced physician would get to the bottom of this faster.
DOCTOR: I've been practicing for eleven years, Stephane. And I apologize if I seem overly thorough – it's my job to be careful and gather as much information as possible. Especially with something like this, we don’t want to miss anything. Okay. No high blood pressure or diabetes. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… years ago, I had my tonsils removed. When I was a child. Other than that, no. I've always been remarkably healthy. Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if I shouldn’t just go to another doctor. This is incredibly inefficient. Do you have any idea what could be causing this, or are we just going to continue with this endless questioning?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils removed as a child. Okay. I understand your frustration, and I apologize again for the length of these questions. It is a bit of a process, but it helps us narrow down the possibilities. Before we move forward, I need to do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then do a neurological exam, which will involve checking your facial muscles and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get on with it. I have things to do. And try to be quick about it. Honestly, the longer this takes, the more concerned I become. It's probably just a nerve issue. Something minor. But dragging it out like this isn’t helping matters.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as efficient as I can. First, let’s take your blood pressure. It's a quick and easy first step. Relax your arm, please. Okay. Your blood pressure is 160 over 95. That's a bit elevated. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now.
PATIENT: Elevated? Of course it is. I’m stressed! Being subjected to this endless questioning isn’t exactly calming. Honestly, it’s probably just anxiety. I lead a very demanding life. Now, are we going to actually diagnose something, or are you just going to keep taking measurements? I have appointments with colleagues I need to get to.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Let me take a quick look at your ears now. Alright. Your ear canals look clear. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your facial muscle strength. This will involve me asking you to smile, raise your eyebrows, and close your eyes tightly. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just...get it over with. Honestly, this is all rather tedious. I can already tell there's weakness on one side of my face. I don't need a formal examination to confirm what’s obvious. I suspect a nerve issue. Something simple, hopefully. Don't make it more complicated than it needs to be. I really must get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noticing significant weakness on the left side of your face. You have difficulty closing your left eye completely and your smile is asymmetrical. Strength is also diminished on the left side. I am also checking your gag reflex, and it is reduced on the left side. Based on these findings, I'm concerned about Bell’s palsy, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities, such as a stroke. Your elevated blood pressure is also a concern. I’m going to recommend an immediate CT scan of your brain to rule out any other serious causes for your symptoms. Would you be able to go to the hospital for a scan right away?
PATIENT: A CT scan?! Now you're just being dramatic! Bell's palsy? A stroke?! I’m a radiologist! I know what a stroke looks like! This is ridiculous. My blood pressure is elevated because I've been subjected to this…ordeal. You're frightening me unnecessarily. Honestly, this is beyond unacceptable. I'm leaving. I'll find another doctor who takes my concerns seriously. And I expect a full refund for this…waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Stephane, please. I understand your frustration, but I have a duty to ensure your safety, and these symptoms require a thorough investigation. I am not trying to frighten you, but it’s crucial to rule out a stroke quickly. Even if it is Bell’s palsy, we need to start treatment as soon as possible to improve your chances of a full recovery. I strongly advise you to go to the hospital for the CT scan. I will prepare a referral note. Regardless of your decision, I recommend seeing a neurologist as soon as possible. .
