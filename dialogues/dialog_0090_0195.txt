DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s just… well, my sister, she always gets these lovely cards when she’s feeling a bit under the weather. All pretty flowers and nice words. I thought… well, I thought you might write me one. Just to… cheer me up, you know? It’s not like I’m sick sick, but a little encouragement never hurt anyone.
DOCTOR: I… see. While I appreciate your sister’s thoughtfulness, this clinic is for medical concerns, Ms. Micucci. I am a doctor, not a… card-writing service. Perhaps a greeting card store would be more helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, don't be like that! It's just a little thing. A nice card from the doctor means something, you know? It shows you care. And honestly, who else would write me a card? My husband just grumbles. It’s not like I’m asking for a prescription or anything. Just… a few kind words. Is that really too much to ask of a professional? You are supposed to be about people, aren't you?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, my professional responsibility is to address your health concerns. I am trained to diagnose and treat illnesses, not to provide emotional support through handwritten correspondence. I understand you're feeling… down, but perhaps a social worker or therapist would be a better resource for that. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms that prompted you to schedule this appointment, or are we solely discussing this card request?
PATIENT: Oh, now you’re being difficult. Physical symptoms? Well… my knees ache a bit, sometimes. It’s just old age, I suppose. But that's not why I came. I just thought a doctor was supposed to be a comforting presence. You know, a nice person. You don't have to write a novel, just something to stick on the fridge! Honestly, you’re making me feel worse now. It’s just… rude. You’re the doctor, aren’t you supposed to help people? Or just poke and prod at them when they’re actually ill?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, “aching knees” is a symptom. It requires assessment, not a Hallmark card. Many things can cause knee pain. It could be arthritis, a tendon issue, even referred pain from your hip. To simply dismiss it as “old age” is… irresponsible. Are these aches constant?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright! Don’t get your stethoscope in a twist. They come and go, mostly when I’ve been on my feet too long. I work at the factory, you know, assembling… things. Lots of standing. It's not constant pain, just… bothersome. And sometimes they feel a little stiff in the mornings. But really, I just wanted a card. You don’t seem to understand that at all. Is it really that hard to write a few kind words? Honestly, my sister's doctor even draws little flowers on hers!
DOCTOR: So, you’re experiencing intermittent knee pain, worse with prolonged standing, and morning stiffness. Do you notice any swelling, redness, or warmth in the knees?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. Just… achey. And a bit stiff, like I said. Not red or warm. Just… old lady knees, I guess. Look, can we just forget about the card? It's clearly upsetting you. But you’re not even listening to me! You’re just asking questions about my knees. I came here hoping for a little kindness, and all I’m getting is… a medical interrogation. Honestly, it’s… disappointing. My sister was right, you Marshallese doctors are very… direct.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am attempting to gather information to determine the cause of your knee pain. To dismiss it as simply “old lady knees” is not helpful, and frankly, quite dismissive of your own health. My ethnicity is irrelevant to my medical training and professional obligations. Do you have any difficulty walking, climbing stairs, or bending your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go again. Difficulty? Well, sometimes when I first get up, it’s a little creaky. And stairs… stairs aren’t my favorite. But who likes stairs? It's just… normal for someone my age, isn't it? You’re making a mountain out of a molehill. It's not like I'm hobbling around with a cane! Honestly, you're so focused on the technical details, you've completely missed the point. It's just… never mind. I can see this isn't going anywhere. I think I’ll just go home. Maybe my sister is right about needing a different doctor. A kinder doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Micucci. If you are not interested in addressing your knee pain, that is your prerogative. However, I strongly advise you to consider a proper evaluation if the discomfort persists or worsens. It is better to rule out any underlying issues than to simply dismiss them. Have a good day.
