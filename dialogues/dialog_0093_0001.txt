DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Bakan. It is… a pleasure to meet you also. Well, to be frank, it is about the smoking. I have been… attached to cigarettes for a very long time, and I believe it is finally time to… disentangle myself from the habit. It is causing me some concern, naturally.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knoch. It takes courage to address a habit like that, and I commend you for taking this step. It's excellent you’re recognizing the concern and seeking help. To give you the best advice, could you tell me a little more about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I began smoking when I was quite young, perhaps sixteen years of age. It was… a foolish thing, really. Peer pressure, mostly. And the war, you understand. A difficult time. I smoked American cigarettes then, mostly. Later, when I came to this country, I switched to… whatever was available, really. Marlboro, mostly. I have smoked… oh, a pack a day, easily, for… sixty years, I would estimate. Perhaps a little more. It has been a constant companion, I am afraid.
DOCTOR: Sixty years is a significant amount of time, Mr. Knoch. Thank you for sharing that with me. And you’re right to acknowledge that’s a long history. Do you currently smoke a full pack a day, or has that amount changed recently?
PATIENT: No, not recently. My… consumption has decreased somewhat. Old age, you see. Less energy for… everything. I would say… fifteen to twenty cigarettes a day, perhaps. Sometimes more if I am… agitated. And I always have one after a meal. It is… a ritual, you see. A very ingrained ritual.
DOCTOR: I see. So, approximately fifteen to twenty cigarettes a day, with a tendency to increase with stress and a consistent habit after meals. That gives me a clearer picture, thank you. Have you ever attempted to quit before, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. Several times, actually. When my sister became ill, I attempted to quit then. And again, when my… friend passed away. Each time, I lasted… a few days, perhaps a week at most. It is… a difficult craving to overcome. I tried chewing gum, those… patches, even. Nothing seemed to… hold for very long. The desire… returns with great force.
DOCTOR: It sounds as though you’ve put in a considerable effort, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Those cravings can be incredibly strong, and it’s understandable that it’s been difficult. To help me get a better understanding of your overall health and how best to approach this, could you tell me a little bit about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I have… arthritis, in my knees, mostly. It bothers me, especially in cold weather. And my… blood pressure, it tends to run a little high. My doctor, Dr. Volkov, has prescribed medication for that, which I take regularly. Otherwise… I am remarkably healthy for my age, I believe. I walk every day, if the weather permits. And I maintain a… reasonable diet. Although, I confess, I do enjoy a good sausage.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're active and maintain a reasonable diet, despite the occasional sausage. And it's important that we consider both your arthritis and your blood pressure when discussing a plan to help you quit smoking. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms related to your arthritis, besides discomfort in cold weather?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. The pain… it can be quite sharp sometimes, especially when I first get out of bed in the morning. And my knees… they swell up a little after a long walk. It does not prevent me from walking, but it is… unpleasant. Dr. Volkov suggested some exercises, which I attempt to do, but… I am not always diligent, I confess. Old habits, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for arthritis to cause stiffness and swelling, and it’s good that Dr. Volkov has recommended exercises. Now, let’s turn our attention back to the smoking. Have you noticed any coughing or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I have. A cough, mostly in the mornings. It has… worsened somewhat over the past few years. And yes, shortness of breath. Not… debilitating, but noticeable, especially when I climb stairs. I… attribute it to my age, naturally. But I suspect the smoking does not help.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Knoch. A worsening cough and shortness of breath are important things to note. Before we discuss a specific quit plan, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… perfectly alright. Whatever is necessary. I am… willing to cooperate fully. I simply wish to… be rid of this habit, once and for all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knoch. Please breathe deeply in and out through your mouth. Okay, your oxygen saturation is currently at 92%, which is a little lower than ideal. And I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. This could be related to your smoking history. I also note some decreased air movement on the lower lobes. It would be prudent to get a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs more thoroughly. Have you had one recently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. Not recently, no. Perhaps… five years ago, I believe. It was… after a bout of pneumonia. A minor illness, thankfully. A chest X-ray… sounds sensible. If that is what is… required, then I am… agreeable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order that for you now. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, let’s discuss some options for helping you quit smoking. Given your history of attempts and the mild wheezing I’m hearing, I think a combination approach would be most effective. We could consider nicotine replacement therapy, such as patches or lozenges, alongside a prescription medication to help reduce cravings. There are several options available, and we can discuss which one might be the best fit for you. Would you be open to exploring those options?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am… quite open to that. I have tried the patches before, but perhaps… with medication, they would be more effective. I am willing to… try anything at this point, frankly. As long as it does not involve… unpleasant side effects. I am… not a young man, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about side effects, Mr. Knoch. We’ll certainly take that into consideration. There are a few different medications we can discuss. Bupropion and Varenicline are the most common. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline works on the nicotine receptors in the brain to reduce the pleasurable effects of smoking. Both have potential side effects, but we can discuss those in detail and weigh the risks and benefits together. To start, I think it’s important we rule out any underlying lung conditions with the chest X-ray. While we wait for those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the medication options in more detail. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. The chest X-ray first, then… a discussion about the medications. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your patience. It is… a daunting prospect, this. But I am… determined.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It is a daunting prospect, but you’ve already taken the most important step – deciding to quit. I commend you for that. I’ll have the X-ray order sent to the radiology department, and they’ll schedule an appointment for you. We can also schedule your follow-up appointment now. How does next week on Tuesday at 10 AM sound?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 10 AM… yes, that would be… quite suitable. I have no prior commitments. Thank you, Doctor. I believe… that will work perfectly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. So, that’s Tuesday at 10 AM for a follow-up to discuss medication options. In the meantime, please try to avoid smoking as much as possible, and focus on taking deep breaths. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not believe I do. You have been… remarkably thorough and… reassuring. I am… grateful for your time and your… guidance. I shall… await the results of the X-ray, and… look forward to seeing you next Tuesday.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knoch. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday. .
