DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather… inconvenient, to be frank. I seem to be losing my sight and… and my hearing. It happened quite suddenly, you see. Honestly, it’s terribly disruptive. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden changes in vision and hearing can be quite concerning, and disruptive as you say. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. When you say “suddenly,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Honestly, Doctor, I don't do details. It was… a few days ago, I suppose. Perhaps a week? It’s all a bit of a blur. I was… attending a gala, a charity event, and I noticed things weren't quite as sharp. And then the sounds… muffled. It’s just… bothersome. Really. I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand it's frustrating when things don't have a clear timeline, especially when you're busy. A week is helpful, though. So, it started at the gala, and has it been gradually worsening since then, or was it more of a sudden change at the gala?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual… sudden… Honestly, Doctor, I wasn't paying that much attention. It wasn't a dramatic collapse, if that’s what you’re asking. More like… a fading. Everything just… became less. Less clear, less audible. It was a rather stuffy room, perhaps that had something to do with it? I wouldn’t know. I’m a surgeon, not an audiologist.
DOCTOR: Right, a surgeon. That makes sense. And you've noticed this "less clear, less audible" sensation consistently since the gala?
PATIENT: Consistently… yes, I suppose. Although, there was that rather loud luncheon yesterday. Everything seemed…normal-ish then, if you can believe it. But otherwise, yes. It’s just… annoying. Frankly, I have patients waiting. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be better during louder events, and worse otherwise. That's a helpful piece of information. Before we proceed, I do want to be thorough, as sudden changes in both vision and hearing deserve careful attention. I'll need to ask a few more questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It shouldn't take too long, but it will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. First, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, I have a life. I don’t spend my time cataloging ailments. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Divorced, busy practice, good genes, you know the type. I suppose I had a touch of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. I take a multivitamin, if that’s what you’re looking for. Really, I doubt it’s anything… significant. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your busy schedule, Ms. Julie. Just a few quick questions to rule things out. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Surgeries… Well, I am a surgeon, Doctor. I perform them! But me? Let me think… I had my tonsils out as a child, a very long time ago. And… I broke my wrist once, skiing, decades ago. Other than that, no. I’ve always been very careful. And I maintain a rigorous fitness regime, you know. Honestly, I doubt either of those are relevant. Are we getting anywhere with this?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and a broken wrist. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't spoken to most of them in years. It’s a long story. My mother… she had something with her joints, I believe. Arthritis, perhaps? And my father… he was a very stoic man. Never complained about a thing. So, I doubt I inherited anything useful from either of them. Really, I’m a bit of an anomaly, if you ask me. Are you quite finished with the family history? It’s rather… depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really! Do I look like the sort? I maintain a very respectable lifestyle, thank you very much. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on occasion. But certainly no… vices. I need a clear head for my work, you see. I couldn't possibly perform delicate surgeries if I were… indulging. Honestly, I find the question rather insulting. Are we almost finished? I have a waiting room full of children.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Ms. Julie. I just need to gather all the information I can. One last quick question about medications – besides the multivitamin, are you currently taking any other prescription or over-the-counter medications, creams, or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I told you. Just the multivitamin. A very reputable brand, I assure you. I don’t believe in cluttering my system with… chemicals. I prefer a natural approach to health. Now, are we quite finished with the interrogation? I really must get back to my practice. This is taking up far too much of my valuable time. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Thank you for the information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, just to check your vision and hearing, and maybe do a quick neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
