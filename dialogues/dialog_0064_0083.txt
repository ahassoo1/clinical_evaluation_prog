DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. It’s… well, it’s a little silly, maybe. I just… I was hoping you could write me a card. A “Get Well” card, or something encouraging. You know, like you give people who are sick.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a card, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. See, my daughter… she’s… going through a hard time. And she always liked getting cards. Little things like that. It just… lifts her spirits. I thought if you wrote one, being a doctor and all… it would mean more. You understand? It’s not for me, it’s for her.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammer. That's very kind of you to think of your daughter. And you're right, sometimes a little gesture can make all the difference. Before I write anything, could you tell me a little bit about what your daughter is going through?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don't really… understand what it is. She talks about… feelings. Sad feelings. And… pressure. From work, I think. She’s a teacher, you see. Lots of responsibility. And she doesn’t sleep. Says she has… anxiety. I don't know what that is, exactly. Just… she’s not herself. And she used to love getting mail.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like your daughter is dealing with a lot. "Anxiety" is a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease, often quite strong. It can definitely affect sleep and make things feel overwhelming. It’s good that she’s talking to you about it. Just to get a better picture, has this been going on for a long time, or is it more recent?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been a while now. Maybe… six months? She tries to hide it, you see. Says she’s “fine”. But I can tell. She doesn’t visit as much, and when she does, she’s… quiet. Doesn't eat much. And she used to call every week, now it’s… only when I call her. It worries me, Doctor. A lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Kammer. Those are all signs that something isn't quite right. It’s good you’re paying attention. It sounds like she might be experiencing some depression alongside the anxiety. Now, before I write the card, and just to be sure, has she seen a doctor about this already?
PATIENT: No. No, she hasn't. She says she's "too busy". And… she doesn’t like doctors. Thinks they’ll just tell her to “snap out of it”. She's a stubborn one, my daughter. Always has been. I tried to tell her she should go, but she won’t listen. That's why I thought… maybe a card from you… it might encourage her.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, a card is a lovely idea. But I feel it's important to mention, Mr. Kammer, that while I’m happy to write something encouraging, it’s not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Depression and anxiety are real medical conditions, and they often require professional treatment. Before I write the card, would you be comfortable with me suggesting she schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect… she’s an adult. I can’t make her do anything. And frankly, she probably wouldn’t listen to me anyway. I just… wanted the card. For a little boost. She respects doctors, maybe if you told her… but I don’t want to cause trouble. Just… a nice card. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. I understand. I’m happy to write a card. I’ll keep it encouraging, and mention that seeking support can be helpful. I’ll also include my contact information, just in case she does decide to reach out. Could you tell me a little bit about what you'd like me to write?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good, Doctor. Thank you. Um… just something… warm. Tell her I love her. And that I’m proud of her. And… that it’s okay to not be okay sometimes. She tries to be so strong. Always. Just… a little encouragement. She likes flowers, if you can write something about flowers. Anything nice, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Kammer. I think I have a good idea. Let me just finish this up. It might take a minute to get it just right. While I'm doing that, do you have any concerns about your daughter’s safety?
PATIENT: Well… no. Not exactly. But she’s been… distant. And she stopped doing things she used to enjoy. Reading, gardening… she just stays home. And she cries sometimes. Quietly. When she thinks no one is listening. It worries me, Doctor. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay. That does sound concerning, Mr. Kammer. It's good you're paying attention to these changes. Just so you know, if you ever feel like your daughter is in immediate danger, you can always call 911 or take her to the nearest emergency room. While I finish writing the card, would you like me to provide you with some resources about depression and anxiety, just in case?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I don’t understand those things. Websites and… brochures. It won’t help. I just want the card. For my daughter. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Here you go. I hope this brings her a little comfort. And please, if you ever have any concerns about her well-being, don’t hesitate to reach out, even if it’s just to talk. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate it. I think… that’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammer. I'm glad I could help, even in a small way. Take care of yourself, and please give your daughter my best. .
PATIENT: .
