DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They sent me here for a check-up, I guess. Need to get it done, you know? Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A life insurance physical. Perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re taking care of it. So, to start, can you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Uh… well, I’m okay, I guess. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I work long hours at the hotel, managing things. It’s a busy place. No major problems, really. I have Medicare, so they check me up when I need to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Long hours at the hotel… that can certainly take a toll. And you have Medicare, which is helpful. When you say “tired sometimes,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Just… worn out. Like, at the end of the day I just want to sit. No energy to do much else. It’s not… sick tired, just… heavy. Happens most days, I’d say. Sometimes it lasts a couple days. Not always, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” and lasting a couple of days sometimes. That's helpful. Do you notice anything that makes it worse, or anything that seems to help?
PATIENT: Not really. Seems to just… happen. Maybe worse when it’s really busy at the hotel, lots of stress. But even when it’s slow, it still happens sometimes. Sleeping doesn’t really seem to help a whole lot, honestly. I get some sleep, but… not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my joints ache a little, especially my knees. But I’m getting older, right? Probably just that. And… I’ve been a little short of breath lately, but that could just be the heat, I figure. It's been pretty warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, joint aches and shortness of breath. It’s good you’re bringing these things up. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. Just the usual stuff, you know? High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back. I take a pill for it. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that, nothing major. I don't really go to the doctor much unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and an appendectomy as a child. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Uh… honestly, no. Little white pill. I just… take it every morning. The pharmacy refills it for me, so I don’t really pay attention to the name. Sorry. I’m not good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Putney. It’s common to forget those details. We can look it up in the system. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I mean, I try to eat healthy, but sometimes you just want a burger, you know? No allergies, though. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… my mom had heart trouble, I think. She died when I was pretty young. And my dad… he had diabetes, I think. He passed away a long time ago. Not a lot of healthy people on that side of the family, if you want to know the truth. Mostly just… gone too early.
DOCTOR: I see. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father. That’s helpful information. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but not anymore. Quit a long time ago. And definitely no drugs. Never been into any of that. I’m a pretty straight-laced guy, if you want to know. Just trying to get this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs. That’s all very good. Alright, Mr. Putney, I think we have enough information for now. I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Let’s just get it over with. The sooner it’s done, the better. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just have a seat here, we’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Finally, I'll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. It won't take long. Just relax your arm for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… hurry it up, if you could. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. A bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Putney… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but present. Now I’m going to listen to your lungs. Again, deep breath in… and exhale. Lung sounds are clear, but slightly diminished in the bases.
PATIENT: Murmur? Diminished? What does that mean? Is that bad? I just want to know if I’m healthy enough for this insurance thing, you know? Don’t need all this complicated stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. A murmur is simply an extra sound your heart makes. Many murmurs are harmless, what we call "innocent murmurs". But it’s good we’ve noted it. Diminished lung sounds could indicate a few things, like mild congestion or just deeper breathing. It’s not necessarily concerning on its own. Now I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Your abdomen is slightly firm, but no significant tenderness. Finally, I’m just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: No pain, just… feels weird. Like, I can feel it. Everything feels weird when someone’s poking around. Reflexes… just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems relatively stable, but the murmur and diminished lung sounds, along with the firm abdomen, warrant some further investigation. Based on what we’ve discussed today, and the findings of the physical exam, I recommend we order a few tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to assess your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Just what I needed. Look, Doctor, I just want this insurance. Is this going to stop me from getting it? Are these tests going to show something bad? I got bills to pay, you know? I don’t have time for a lot of… complications. Can’t I just… skip the tests?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Putney. It’s frustrating to have to jump through hoops, and I want to assure you I’m here to help get you the answers you need, and to support you in getting this insurance sorted. Skipping the tests isn’t advisable. While I don’t anticipate anything serious, these tests will give us a baseline of your current health, and help the insurance company make an informed decision. More importantly, they’ll give us peace of mind. Early detection is always best, and knowing what’s going on allows us to address any potential issues promptly. The tests are relatively straightforward – a simple blood draw, an EKG which is a painless recording of your heart’s electrical activity, and a quick chest X-ray. I can order the tests right now, and the results should be available in a few days. We can discuss them then, and decide on the next steps. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A few days… fine. Just… get it over with. Order the tests. I guess I don’t have much of a choice, do I? But if they’re going to deny me insurance because of this, I’m blaming you, Doctor. Seriously. Just… let’s get the paperwork done.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney, and I’ll do everything I can to ensure a smooth process. I'll write a note for the insurance company outlining your medical history and the reasons for the tests. Here are the requisitions. You can take these to any lab, and they'll draw the blood and perform the tests. The EKG and chest X-ray will require a separate appointment, but I can provide you with referrals to local facilities. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant fatigue, please don't hesitate to call the office, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I hear about the results? And will someone call me, or do I have to call you? I don't like calling people. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll do it. I got things to get back to, you know? This whole thing is just… a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. My office will call you with the results, Mr. Putney. You won't have to call us. We'll explain everything to you over the phone, and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. Here’s my card with the office number in case you have any urgent questions before then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
