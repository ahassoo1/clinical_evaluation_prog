DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 67 years of age. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, 67 is correct. I received a letter regarding some… unusual results from a test I had done on my stomach. An endoscopy, I believe it was called? I’m here to discuss those findings, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy, yes. I see. Well, let’s go over that. Do you recall when this endoscopy was performed, and perhaps who the physician was who carried it out?
PATIENT: Certainly. It was… let me see… July 12th, I believe. Just a few weeks ago. Doctor Ramirez performed it. A very kind woman, though I was quite nervous, naturally. It’s not every day one has a camera go down one’s throat, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Ramirez is a competent physician. Let me pull up the report here… Hmm. It appears the report does indicate some… abnormalities. Before we delve into the specifics, could you describe why you were referred for the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, for several months now, I’ve been experiencing some discomfort in my stomach. Not severe pain, precisely, but… a persistent ache, mostly after I eat. And a good deal of bloating, you see. I also… haven’t been keeping food down as easily as I used to. My appetite isn’t what it once was, either. It was becoming quite worrisome, so my primary care physician suggested the test.
DOCTOR: Bloating, decreased appetite, and difficulty keeping food down… and this discomfort is primarily after meals?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It's not immediately after every meal, mind you, but most of the time. It seems to be worse with richer foods… anything with a good deal of fat, or spice. Though sometimes, even a simple biscuit will cause some trouble. It's rather unpredictable, to be honest.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… well, I have been feeling rather fatigued lately, more tired than usual. I attributed that to my age, naturally, but perhaps it is related. And… oh, yes. There’s been a change in my stool. Darker, and… thinner than it used to be. Not drastically, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Darker, thinner stools… and fatigue. Alright. And, Ms. Minatra, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That is a very good question, Doctor. Yes, actually. I haven't weighed myself regularly, but my clothes have been feeling a bit looser. I hadn’t thought much of it, assuming it was simply part of getting older… but looking back, I believe I have lost some weight. Perhaps five or six pounds, over the last few months.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, to confirm, you said this discomfort began several months ago. Has it been a gradual worsening, or were there specific instances that triggered it?
PATIENT: It was rather gradual, Doctor. Not a sudden onset. I suppose I first noticed it… around March, maybe April? It started with just a little bloating after certain meals, and then the discomfort began to linger a bit longer. Then, slowly but surely, the other symptoms started to appear. No specific incident that I can recall triggered it, just a slow decline, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Minatra, the report from Dr. Ramirez indicates the presence of some… polyps during the endoscopy. Furthermore, the biopsy results show evidence of… dysplasia. It is a preliminary finding, but warrants further investigation. Do you have any idea what those terms mean?
PATIENT: Polyps… I recall Doctor Ramirez mentioning something about growths. And dysplasia… no, I don’t believe so. I pride myself on being an informed patient, but some of these medical terms… they escape me. Is it… is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Dysplasia refers to abnormal cells. The polyps themselves are not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but the dysplasia suggests a potential for… progression. It requires a more thorough evaluation to determine the extent of the abnormality and the appropriate course of action. Given your symptoms – the discomfort, bloating, decreased appetite, weight loss, and changes in stool – combined with these biopsy results, I recommend a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to assess for any further spread. And I would like to consult with a gastroenterologist for their expert opinion. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan… and a consultation with a specialist. Yes, Doctor, that sounds… prudent. Whatever you believe is best, I trust your judgment. I want to understand what is happening, and to address it as effectively as possible. I confess, I am a little frightened, but I appreciate your thoroughness.
DOCTOR: Very good. I will arrange for the CT scan to be performed as soon as possible. The radiology department will contact you directly to schedule an appointment. As for the gastroenterologist, I will submit a referral, and their office will contact you to arrange a consultation. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining a bland diet, avoiding spicy or fatty foods, and monitoring your symptoms closely. If you experience any severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or persistent vomiting, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, which is often used in CT scans?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no known allergies to contrast dye, or to anything, for that matter. I've never had a CT scan before, so I cannot say with certainty, but I've never had any adverse reactions to medication. I will certainly follow your recommendations regarding the diet, and I will monitor my symptoms as closely as possible. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for taking such good care of me.
DOCTOR: Very good. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion, including the results of the endoscopy and the recommendations for further evaluation. It is important to attend your appointments promptly. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I will certainly attend the appointments as scheduled. I am very grateful for your time and expertise. Perhaps… just one small question, if you don't mind. Is this… is this something that is common?
DOCTOR: Dysplasia and polyps can occur in individuals of varying ages, Ms. Minatra. While not uncommon, their presence does warrant investigation to rule out any potential for malignancy. Your symptoms are consistent with several possible conditions, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the precise cause. It is important not to jump to conclusions. I will have the nurse provide you with a list of resources regarding gastrointestinal health. Are there any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. That is… reassuring, to a degree. Thank you for being so forthcoming. I appreciate your honesty, and your willingness to explain everything in such detail. I will be sure to schedule those appointments right away. Thank you again, Doctor Gonzalezperez. I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: Very good. You have a good day as well, Ms. Minatra. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any changes in your condition. .
