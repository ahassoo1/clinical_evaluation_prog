DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is good to meet you as well. Well, my foot is… hurting. A bad sore, it is. Been there a while now. Very painful when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been painful for a while. I understand. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It's on the bottom, near my toes. Red around the edges, and… it's not getting better. I try to keep it clean, very clean, but it just… stays. And the pain, like I said, it’s pretty bad when I try to walk, even around the house. I have been careful, you know? Trying not to step on it too much.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so careful. And thank you for explaining that so clearly. When did you first notice the sore, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It was… maybe two, three months ago now? It started small, I didn't think much of it at first. Just a little red spot. But it grew, and then it started to hurt. It’s hard to remember exactly, you know, old man and all. But around May, maybe June, it started bothering me a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, it's understandable. So, it started small around May or June and has gradually gotten worse. Has anything specific made it better or worse, that you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Well, resting helps. If I stay off it all day, it doesn't hurt as much. But… standing and walking, that makes it very bad. And sometimes, even when I'm not moving, it aches. Hot weather seems to make it worse too, I think. My wife used to say so, anyway. She always knew best.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like she was a wonderful woman. And thank you for that information – resting helps, standing and walking make it worse, and hot weather seems to aggravate it. Now, have you noticed any drainage from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? What do you mean, doctor? Like… water coming out of it? Sometimes it feels wet… maybe a little bit, but I thought that was just from washing it. Is that what you mean? I don't know if it's water, or… something else.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, and it's good you asked for clarification. Yes, I meant any fluid coming from the sore – pus, blood, or even just clear fluid. It’s helpful to know what it looks like, if anything is coming out. You mentioned feeling wetness—can you describe the color or smell, if any?
PATIENT: Smell… well, it doesn't smell good, I can tell you that. Not like flowers. A little bit… sour, maybe? Not a strong smell, but it's there. And the color... Sometimes it looks a little… yellow? Not bright yellow, more… pale. And sometimes a little red, if I bump it, even just a little. I try to keep it covered with a clean bandage, but it's hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, pale yellow fluid with a slightly sour smell, sometimes with a bit of red if irritated. Thank you for being so detailed, Mr. Stoegbauer. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes in your leg or groin recently?
PATIENT: Swollen… what did you say? Lymph… nodes? I don't know what those are, doctor. My leg feels okay, no swelling, and no fever, no chills. I just feel tired sometimes, but that’s just old age, I think. I haven't been sick or anything. Just this foot. It is the foot that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or swollen lymph nodes. And you've mentioned feeling tired, but generally feeling okay otherwise. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with circulation?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The doctor… a long time ago, he told me I have… the sugar sickness. Diabetes, that is what he called it. And my legs… they get cold sometimes, even in warm weather. The circulation, you said? That is what the other doctor told me. He said to keep moving, but it’s hard with this foot!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of diabetes and some circulation problems. That's important information. And do you currently take any medications for these conditions, or for anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a pill every morning. A little white one. For the sugar, the doctor said. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take another pill. A pink one. I don't remember the names, I have so many pills now! My daughter helps me keep track of them. She comes over every week. She is a good girl.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you have support from your daughter. Okay, so a white pill for diabetes and a pink pill for joint pain. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with anything like that. I eat everything, pretty much. And I take the pills, like the doctor tells me. Never had a reaction, never had a problem. I am a simple man, Doctor. Not much bothers me. Just this foot, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for all of this information, Mr. Stoegbauer. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. If you don't mind, could you please remove your sock and shoe?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. It is not a pretty sight, Doctor. I am sorry. It's been bothering me for so long now.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take a look. I see some redness and swelling around the sore, as you mentioned. The skin appears broken, and there's some dried fluid present. I'm going to gently palpate the area to check for any tenderness or warmth. Does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That hurts, Doctor. A little bit sharp, a little bit… throbbing. It hurts even when you just touch it lightly. It's been like that for weeks now. I try not to bother it, but it's hard to avoid. Even the sheets rubbing against it, it hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand. It definitely seems tender to the touch. I'm also checking the pulses in your foot and leg to assess your circulation. Your pulses are present, but somewhat diminished, which is not unexpected given your history of circulation problems. I’m also checking the sensation in your foot. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that… yes, and that too. But it’s… not as strong as it used to be. It feels… a little bit numb, maybe? Especially on the outer side of my foot. Like a pins and needles feeling sometimes. It has been getting worse slowly, I think. I haven’t said anything because I didn’t want to bother you.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished sensation and some numbness, especially on the outer side of your foot. Thank you for letting me know, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s important you told me that. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing during the exam, this could be a diabetic foot ulcer, complicated by possible neuropathy and some peripheral artery disease. To confirm this, I’d like to order some tests, including a blood sugar check, a vascular study to assess blood flow in your legs, and possibly a swab of the sore to check for infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… blood sugar… vascular… You mean… take more blood? And… check my legs? I don't like the sound of that, Doctor. But… if it will help my foot, then yes. Yes, I will do the tests. Whatever you think is best. I just want this pain to go away. My daughter can help me get there, I think. She drives me to the doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you, and having support is excellent. Yes, we’ll need a small blood sample to check your blood sugar levels. The vascular study is non-invasive – it uses sound waves to map the blood flow in your legs, no needles involved. And we'll do a quick swab of the sore with a cotton swab to send to the lab to see if there's any infection present. While we’re waiting for the results, it's very important that you keep weight off of your foot as much as possible. I’m going to give you a prescription for a special shoe and offloading insole. It will help to reduce pressure on the sore. I will also write a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – who can provide ongoing care and wound management. We'll also discuss better blood sugar control, and I’ll write a new prescription for your diabetes medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Special shoe… podiatrist… new medicine… It sounds like a lot, Doctor. But… if it will help, then yes. Yes, that sounds alright. My daughter will help me remember everything, I am sure. She is very good at that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I really do. I just want to be able to walk again without pain. How long will it take to get better?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. And it’s good you have such supportive family. That makes a big difference. As for how long it will take to get better, that’s a difficult question to answer definitively. It really depends on how well we can control your blood sugar, how well the wound heals, and whether or not there's an infection present. Diabetic foot ulcers can take weeks or even months to heal, and it requires diligent care and follow-up. The podiatrist will be able to give you a more accurate timeline once they’ve examined the wound. I’m going to give you detailed written instructions on wound care, including how to keep it clean and dry, and what signs of infection to look out for. It's important to follow those instructions carefully. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You have explained everything very well, Doctor. A lot to remember, but… I will write it down. My daughter will help. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will see the podiatrist soon, yes?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’m happy to help. Yes, I’m going to have my nurse schedule an appointment for you with the podiatrist today. They will contact you directly to confirm the date and time. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if you notice any changes in your foot. Here are the written instructions I mentioned, and a list of the new medications. I will also send a summary of our visit to your primary care physician. Take care, Mr. Stoegbauer, and I look forward to hearing from you after your appointment with the podiatrist.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will see you again, then. Hopefully, with a better foot. .
