DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Way. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this pain I've been having. It's been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a little while now.” Can you tell me more about that pain?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It's mostly in my lower back. It comes and goes, but when it is there, it's a pretty dull ache. Sometimes it shoots down my leg a little, you know? Not always, but sometimes. I mostly notice it when I've been standing for a long time or if I bend over to pick something up.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back pain that sometimes radiates down your leg, worse with standing and bending. And you describe it as a dull ache. About how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That's a good question. I guess… maybe three or four months now? It started out not too bad, just a little stiffness, and I thought I just pulled something. But it hasn’t really gone away, and it’s been getting a bit more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four months. And it's been gradually worsening. Has anything specific made it worse recently, or did it just slowly get more noticeable?
PATIENT: You know, I think it got worse after I helped my son move some furniture a couple weeks ago. He doesn’t have much help, poor guy, so I pitched in. It wasn't too heavy, but there was a lot of lifting and twisting. That really flared it up. It's been a little rougher since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the lifting and twisting with helping your son move seems to have aggravated it. That’s helpful to know. Does the pain feel different at different times of the day?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually, it's usually worse in the mornings. When I first get out of bed, it's really stiff and achy. It loosens up a little as I get moving, but it's still there. Then it tends to bother me more again towards the end of the day, especially if I've been on my feet a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, worse in the mornings and at the end of the day with prolonged standing. And it loosens up a little as you move around. Have you noticed anything that makes it feel better?
PATIENT: Well, sitting actually helps some. Not all the time, but when it’s really bad, just resting and sitting for a bit takes the edge off. And, honestly, a warm bath feels pretty good. Doesn't make it disappear or anything, but it's comforting.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting and warm baths provide some relief. Have you tried any over-the-counter medications for the pain – anything like ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: Yeah, I've taken some ibuprofen a few times. It helps a little, but it doesn’t really get rid of it completely. I don't like taking too much, you know? I’m not really a pill person, if you get what I mean. It just takes the sharpest edge off, really. I haven't tried anything else.
DOCTOR: I understand. You prefer not to rely on medication if you can avoid it. Okay. Before we move on to an examination, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with diet and exercise for years now. Other than that, I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to stay active. Mostly just walking, nothing too strenuous. I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and no known allergies. That’s good to know. And you mentioned walking for exercise – that’s excellent. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual childhood stuff, like getting tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was ages ago. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant surgical history. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Do you have a family history of back problems, arthritis, or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mother had some trouble with her back when she got older, arthritis, I think. She was always complaining about it. And my older brother, he had a slipped disc a few years back and needed some physical therapy. So, yeah, there's a little bit of back trouble in the family, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of back problems and arthritis. That's helpful to know. Lastly, can you tell me about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? What do you mean exactly? Like, what do I do for fun?
DOCTOR: I mean things like smoking, alcohol use, and your general activity level. Also, what kind of work do you do, if you're currently working?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, I get it. Well, I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. As for work, I’m retired now, but I used to be an Operations Research Analyst. Lots of numbers and problem-solving. It kept me pretty sedentary towards the end, to be honest. But like I said, I try to stay active now. Mostly walking, and I help around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional alcohol use, and a history of a sedentary job. That all gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination of your back, if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I'm comfortable with that. Just let me know if anything feels really uncomfortable, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will. Okay, if you could please lie down on your stomach on the examination table, that would be great. I'm going to start by gently palpating your lower back to check for tenderness or muscle spasms. I’ll also be assessing your range of motion. Alright, can you tell me if you feel any pain right here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that's a little tender. Right about there. Not sharp, but definitely uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, like I was telling you about. And a little bit to the right of your hand, too. Yeah, definitely more on the right side.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the right side of your lower back. And what about here?
PATIENT: No, that's okay. Not as bad there. Still a little uncomfortable, but much better than right where you were touching before. It feels… tight, though. Like a knot or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, tightness and a possible muscle knot on the right side. Now, could you lift your right leg straight up, keeping it as straight as possible?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That's a little uncomfortable, too. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a stretching sensation in my back and down my leg. Not too bad, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort with straight leg raise on the right side, radiating down the leg. And how about your left leg?
PATIENT: That's better. No pain with that one, just a little bit of stretching. Like I said, it's mostly the right side that's bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with straight leg raise on the left side. Now, can you try to touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Ooh… That’s a struggle. I can’t quite reach, and it hurts a little bit in my lower back when I bend forward like that. It’s not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with forward flexion, and discomfort with the movement. And finally, just walk a few steps for me, please. Alright. That's all for the physical exam. It appears you have some muscle tenderness and limited range of motion in your lower back, primarily on the right side. I also noted some discomfort with straight leg raise on the right, which suggests possible nerve involvement.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… complicated. So, what does that mean? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but it does mean we need to investigate a little further to figure out the cause of your pain. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain – a pulled muscle in your lower back – with possible nerve irritation. However, to be sure, I’d like to order some imaging – an X-ray – to rule out any other potential causes, like a fracture or arthritis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… smart. If it rules things out, that's good. Yeah, I'm comfortable with an X-ray. So, what happens next? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The X-ray itself shouldn’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand or lie on a table while the technician takes a few pictures. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend a course of conservative treatment. That includes over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen – as you’ve already tried, but continuing them as directed. I'm also going to recommend some gentle stretching exercises to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. I can give you a handout with some examples. And, most importantly, avoiding any activities that aggravate your pain. I’ll also write you a referral to physical therapy. A physical therapist can develop a personalized exercise program for you and teach you proper lifting techniques to prevent future injuries. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… a lot better than surgery, that’s for sure. . Stretching and taking some pills… I can manage that. And physical therapy sounds good. A handout would be great. It's just… it's hard to remember everything. So, to be clear, that's X-ray, pills, stretching, and physical therapy?
DOCTOR: Exactly. X-ray to rule out anything serious, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, gentle stretching exercises – I’ll get you that handout right now – and a referral to physical therapy. I'm also going to write a note for your primary care physician, letting them know what we discussed and the plan we’ve put in place. And I want to emphasize: if your pain gets significantly worse, if you develop any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet, or if you have any trouble with bladder or bowel control, please go to the emergency room immediately. Those could be signs of a more serious problem. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. That was very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. The handout would be great. I'll try to follow everything you said. And… thanks again for listening to me. It's been bothering me for a while, and it's good to finally have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. I understand how frustrating chronic pain can be. Here is the handout. Please take it slow and listen to your body. Don’t push yourself too hard. The X-ray order will be sent to the radiology department, and they’ll call you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also get the referral to physical therapy processed right away. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to see how you’re doing and review the results of the X-ray. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, two weeks sounds perfect. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I think I'm all set for now. I’ll schedule the X-ray and the physical therapy. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day too. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
