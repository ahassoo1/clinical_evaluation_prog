DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you. I… have been having trouble. With… the words. They do not come so easily anymore. It is… frustrating, yes. I forget what I want to say, even when I know I know it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Trouble with words, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… difficult to explain. Not that I cannot speak, you understand. But… the right word… it hides sometimes. Like a shy… little bird. And then I… stumble. It has been… some months now, I think. Perhaps longer. Time… it slips away, yes?
DOCTOR: Some months, you said. And is this difficulty constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. More often now, though. In the beginning… just when I was tired, maybe. Or… stressed. But now… even when I am relaxed. Like… this morning, for example. I knew what I wanted to say to you, but… it took a moment. A long moment, perhaps. It is not… every word, you understand. Some words are… fine. Others… they are… elusive.
DOCTOR: Elusive, alright. And does this impact your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes. It does… make things difficult. I… work with numbers, mostly. Compensation, benefits… things like that. It is important to be precise. To… explain things clearly. And when I… cannot find the correct word… it is… frustrating for everyone. Also… I enjoy reading. But sometimes… I have to… stop. Because I… forget what I just read. It is… upsetting, yes. I used to have a very good memory.
DOCTOR: Upsetting, I can understand. Okay. And has anyone else noticed this difficulty with your words or memory?
PATIENT: My… wife. She… passed away last year. She… noticed it, yes. She would… gently correct me. Or… finish my sentences. She was very patient. I… do not have anyone else who… notices, I think. I try not to… burden people with it. It is… a small thing, yes? Though it is… becoming less small, perhaps.
DOCTOR: A loss like that is never small, Mr. Gyamfi. And this…difficulty has been ongoing since before your wife passed, or did it become more noticeable afterward?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, you are right. It is… not small. It started… before. Perhaps six months before. But it… became worse after. Everything… became worse after. It is… difficult to separate the two, yes? The… forgetting, and the… sadness. They… blend together. I… apologize. I do not mean to… ramble. It is… just a difficult subject.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s perfectly understandable. Let's try to focus on the cognitive changes for now. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the word-finding difficulties?
PATIENT: Cognitive… changes? I… do not know what that means, exactly. Other… symptoms? Let me… think. I… sleep well, usually. Although… sometimes I wake up feeling… confused. Not… lost, exactly. Just… disoriented. And… I have been… less interested in things. My hobbies. Reading, as I said. I used to enjoy… gardening. But… I do not have the energy for it anymore. Is that… a symptom? I am… not good with medical terms.
DOCTOR: Disorientation upon waking, and a loss of interest… Yes, those are relevant. Have you noticed any difficulties with things like judgment or problem-solving?
PATIENT: Judgment… and… problem-solving? That is… a difficult question. I… work with numbers, yes? I have not… made any mistakes at work. Not that I am aware of. But… sometimes I… have to ask my colleagues to… double-check my work. Just to be… sure. It is… a precaution, really. I used to be able to do it all myself. I… do not know if that is… a problem with judgment. Or just… being careful. I am… old, you see. Things… slow down.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any family history of memory problems or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological… conditions? I… do not know. My… mother had some problems with her… balance, towards the end of her life. She… fell a few times. But… it was just… old age, we thought. My father… he was very healthy. Very… strong. He lived to be… eighty-five. I do not… know of any other… memory problems in the family. It is… not something we talked about much. I… apologize. I am not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re providing information, Mr. Gyamfi. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, the medications. I take… something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it is called. And… a vitamin D supplement. My doctor said I was… low. Allergies? No. Not that I am aware of. I… eat almost anything. Although… I do not eat shellfish. It… doesn’t agree with me. A long time ago, I had a… reaction. But that was… many years ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to perform a brief neurological exam. It won't be unpleasant. Just a few simple tests to assess your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds fine. A… neurological exam. I… trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you… think is best. I… just want to know what is… happening. It is… unsettling, not knowing. Yes. Please. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. Good. And now your legs. Both seem… normal. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and extend your arms. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes. I… can. Like… this? It is… a little difficult. I am… not very flexible, you see. But… I managed it. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: Good. And now the other hand. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you to repeat a few simple phrases after me. Remember them as best as you can. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes. Ready. I… will try my best. My… memory is not what it used to be, you see. But… I will try. Please… proceed.
DOCTOR: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." Repeat that for me, please.
PATIENT: "The… quick brown fox… jumps over the… lazy dog." I… believe that is correct? It… feels strange. Saying… things like that. I do not… often say things like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Now, repeat this phrase: “Every good boy deserves fudge.”
PATIENT: "Every… good boy… deserves… fudge." I… apologize. It… is not coming easily. “Every good boy… deserves… fudge.” Is that… correct? It feels… awkward. I… do not know why.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation. Do you know what today's date is?
PATIENT: Today's date? Oh… dear. That is… a difficult question. Let me… think. It is… August. Yes. I… believe it is the second. August… the second. 2025? Is that… correct? I… am not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Where… are we? Oh… dear. This is… embarrassing. We are… in a doctor’s office. Yes. Your office, Doctor. In the… city? I… believe it is in the city. It… looks like a doctor’s office. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gyamfi. That will be all for the physical examination. Based on your history and the findings of this brief assessment, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of cognitive impairment. However, further testing is needed to determine the exact cause. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, and I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Cognitive… impairment? Oh… dear. That… sounds… serious. Blood work… and a neurologist? I… do not understand. Is it… bad? Is it… something I should be… worried about? I… just want to know what is… happening.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Mr. Gyamfi. Cognitive impairment can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which are treatable. The blood work will help rule out things like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. The neurologist will conduct a series of tests to assess your memory, language skills, and other cognitive functions. It's best to get a diagnosis as soon as possible so we can develop an appropriate treatment plan. I will have my nurse draw the blood samples now. And I will prepare the referral to Dr. Evelyn Reed, a highly respected neurologist in the city. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds acceptable. Whatever you… think is best, Doctor. Dr. Reed… yes. And the blood work… of course. I… just want to get this… sorted out. It is… unsettling, not knowing. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be in shortly to take the blood samples. I'll also have her print out the referral information for Dr. Reed. I will also send a summary of our conversation to Dr. Reed. Please schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible. We will review the results of your bloodwork when they come in. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
