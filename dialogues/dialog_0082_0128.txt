DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilliana. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Hmm. Well, my joints. They’re just… stiff, mostly in the mornings. It’s a bother, really. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. Just… always been that way, sort of?
DOCTOR: Alright, stiff joints, particularly in the mornings… and you say this has been ongoing for a while. It’s difficult to pinpoint when it began, you mentioned. That's alright, we can work through it. Can you tell me a little more about where exactly these stiff joints are located?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It's not just one place, you know? My fingers, I think… and my knees. Sometimes my shoulders, too. It's… all over, a little bit. Not bad all the time, just… when I wake up. It feels like they need a good oiling, if that makes sense? I don’t really know where it hurts the most, honestly. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. So, stiffness in your fingers, knees, and sometimes your shoulders, mostly upon waking. And it’s not a sharp pain, more of a general discomfort, like they need… lubrication, as you say. Have you noticed any swelling in those joints, or any redness or warmth to the touch?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I just try to move them around and get going, you know? Redness… no, I don’t think so. Warmth… maybe a little? But I’m a bit warm all the time, if I’m being truthful. It’s hard to say what’s normal for me. I’m not really one for checking myself for things like that. Does that make sense? I just get up and do what I need to do.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lilliana. It's perfectly alright if you don't routinely check those things. We’ll try to get a better sense of it here. Now, besides the morning stiffness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… oh dear. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but who doesn’t, right? And… my hands feel clumsy sometimes. I drop things more than I used to, maybe? It’s just… getting old, I suppose. I don't know if that counts as a symptom. It’s probably just me being silly. I mostly work with the children, and they’re quick, you know? I have to try and keep up.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't sound silly at all. Fatigue and feeling clumsy—dropping things—those are certainly things we should note. Do you experience any pain during the day, after you've been moving around for a while, or is it really only a morning issue?
PATIENT: Hmm… sometimes my knees ache a bit if I'm on them for too long. When I'm playing with the little ones, you know? But it’s not… terrible. I just try to shift my weight around. And my fingers sometimes feel… sore, after I’ve been doing a lot of little things, like buttoning coats or… well, everything with the children. It’s not a constant pain, more like a… a dull ache. But mostly, it's the stiffness in the mornings that bothers me the most. It just takes a while to get going, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional knee and finger aches during the day, especially with activity, but the main issue is the morning stiffness. Now, Lilliana, have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Let me think… My husband, God rest his soul, he always handled the… the paperwork. I don’t really remember. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that’s about it. Nothing… serious, I don't think. I've just always been… relatively healthy. I go to the shops, I work with the children... I don't really go to the doctor often. I don’t like being a bother, you know? I’m sure it’s just getting old, like I said.
DOCTOR: You're not being a bother at all, Lilliana. It’s good to know you had a broken wrist a few years ago. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t often need to see a doctor. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. No, I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe for my tonsils when I was a little girl? But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. My husband… he would have known. But he’s gone now, poor man. I honestly don’t think I’ve ever had a proper surgery. Just the wrist, and that wasn't very serious, as far as I recall. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Lilliana. It’s perfectly alright. You're not rambling. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, thinking about your family… has anyone else in your family experienced similar joint problems or any autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or lupus?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a tricky one. I come from a big family, all in Greece, mostly. I haven't seen them in years, really. My mother… she had arthritis in her hands, I think. But it was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about those things much. My sister… she had some aches and pains, but I don't know what it was. Everyone gets aches and pains when they get old, right? It’s hard to say if anyone else had something… serious. We weren’t very good at keeping track of these things. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Lilliana. We can only work with what we have. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I eat everything, really. I haven’t had any problems with medications, as far as I remember. My husband always made sure I took the right things. I’m sure if I had an allergy, I’d know about it. I’m a bit sensitive to the cold, maybe? But that’s not really an allergy, is it? I’m sorry if I’m not being very helpful. I’m just… not a very medical person, you know? I’m more of a… a children person.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Lilliana. It’s good to know you don’t have any known allergies. And you are absolutely right, you’re a children person, and that’s wonderful. Alright, then. If you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your joints for any swelling, warmth, or limited range of motion. Would that be alright?
