DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. I'm here for a physical… for a tryout. Sports team. Gotta make sure I’m still good enough to go, I guess. Want to get this over with quick if that’s alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. We can certainly work efficiently. A physical for a sports tryout – excellent. To get started, let's gather some information. First, can you tell me a bit about the sport you’re trying out for, and what level of competition this is?
PATIENT: It’s… archery. Local league, mostly. Nothin' too serious. I used to be pretty good, but it’s been a while. Just wanna see if the old muscles still remember what to do, you know? It's more for fun, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even for a recreational league, it’s wise to ensure you’re physically prepared. Archery requires quite a bit of core strength and upper body stability. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Last one was… honestly, I don’t remember. Years ago, probably. I usually just ignore stuff 'til it really bothers me. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Mr. Kingan, but quite common. We'll get you up to date. Okay. Let's start with any significant past medical problems you might have. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like that. I've been pretty lucky, I think. Maybe a bad cold now and then, but that's it. I eat okay, mostly. Try to, anyway. Don't smoke, don't drink much. Just get tired easily sometimes, you know, getting older.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I’ve always been careful. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree… but that was a long time ago. Didn’t even need surgery for that. Just a cast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom lived to be eighty-something, pretty healthy for her age. Dad… he had some heart trouble, I think. Not sure exactly what. He passed away years ago. I don't really know much about his medical stuff. We weren't that close. Is that enough? I’m not a doctor, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kingan. We work with the information we have. Knowing your father had heart trouble is helpful. Now, let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all.
PATIENT: Nothing. Not a single thing. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Maybe some fish oil now and then, but that’s it. Really. Empty stomach, usually. Old habit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Maybe a little sensitive to spicy food, but that's not an allergy, right? Just… makes my stomach upset. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound like an allergy, Mr. Kingan. Excellent. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, could you tell me about any pain you’ve been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… my shoulder's been a little sore lately. Just kinda achy, especially when I reach up high. Been trying to ignore it, like I said. Probably just getting old. I’ve been doing some yard work, too. Lifting stuff. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright, shoulder soreness. We’ll definitely take a look at that. And to finish up with the history portion, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Nope. Never have. Tried it once when I was a teenager, didn't like it. Makes me cough just thinkin' about it. Clean lungs, as far as I know. Besides the dust from the yard work, that is.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Kingan. That gives me a good overview. Now, let's move on to the physical exam. I’m going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then listen to your heart and lungs. We'll also assess your range of motion and strength, paying particular attention to your shoulder. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Let’s just get it over with. I’m ready when you are. Quick and easy, right? I gotta get back to… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. I’ll do my best to be efficient. Please have a seat on the table. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply as I listen. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let's take a look at your shoulder. Does it hurt when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's a little tender. Not awful, but definitely feels it. And when you move it like that... yeah, that's where it aches. It's not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like somethin's tight. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me if I can still shoot arrows? I’m gettin’ impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Kingan. It does seem there is some tenderness and limited range of motion in your shoulder. There’s no obvious deformity or swelling. I’m noting some mild discomfort with external rotation and abduction. Based on this initial assessment, it's difficult to say definitively whether you can participate without risk. There is likely some strain or inflammation in the shoulder. We need to rule out more serious issues before I can give you a clear recommendation. To get a better understanding, I recommend an X-ray of your shoulder to rule out any bone abnormalities. Also, given your blood pressure reading, a repeat measurement later today and potentially some ambulatory blood pressure monitoring would be helpful. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests… Look, Doctor, I just want to know if I can shoot arrows. I don’t have time for a whole lot of tests. Can’t I just… try it and see? I’ve been shootin’ for years. I know my limits. Is there any chance it’s just… a pulled muscle? I can ice it, take some ibuprofen… that usually works. And the blood pressure… I get nervous at the doctor’s, always have. It’s probably just that. Can we at least skip the X-ray? I really don't wanna.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and desire to avoid unnecessary testing, Mr. Kingan. However, as a physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. While it's possible it’s a simple pulled muscle, we can’t rule out other potential issues without further investigation. Ignoring a more serious problem could lead to further injury or complications. The shoulder is a complex joint, and there are several structures that could be involved. An X-ray is a relatively simple and non-invasive way to assess for bone fractures or dislocations. I’m hesitant to advise you to participate without knowing the underlying cause of your shoulder pain, especially given your age and the potential for a more significant injury. How about this?
PATIENT: What? What 'how about this'? I’m runnin' on limited patience here, Doctor. Just tell me.
DOCTOR: How about we start with a repeat blood pressure measurement here in the clinic, and I’ll give you some instructions for monitoring it at home over the next few days. I'll also provide you with some guidelines for managing your shoulder pain – ice, rest, over-the-counter pain relief. If your shoulder pain doesn't improve within a week, or if it worsens, then we can discuss getting the X-ray. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But if it doesn't improve, I'm not comin' back for an X-ray. I got things to do. Can we just get this blood pressure thing over with? And tell me what kind of ibuprofen to take. The regular stuff?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. We can proceed that way. I'll write down instructions for home blood pressure monitoring and shoulder care for you. Your blood pressure is now 135/82. Still slightly elevated, but better than before. We’ll want to keep an eye on it. As for ibuprofen, 200-400 milligrams every 4-6 hours as needed for pain, but do not exceed 1200 milligrams in a 24-hour period. Be sure to take it with food to avoid stomach upset. Here are the instructions. If your shoulder pain worsens or doesn't improve within a week, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss further options, including the possibility of an X-ray. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just... thank you. I guess. I gotta go now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
