DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Just here for a tryout physical. Trying out for a team, need to make sure I'm good to go. Don't want any surprises, you know? Quick in and quick out if possible, I got a schedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. A pre-participation physical – absolutely. We want to ensure you’re in the best possible shape for your tryout and identify anything that might need addressing. I understand you’re on a tight schedule, and I’ll do my best to be efficient. To begin, could you tell me a bit about the team you’re trying out for and what the physical demands of the sport are?
PATIENT: It's a… well, it's a Mongolian wrestling team. Pretty demanding, actually. Lots of grappling, strength, you know… the usual. It's not like running a marathon, but it takes a lot out of you. Lots of pushing and pulling, and staying on your feet. Hopefully that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Mongolian wrestling – very physically demanding, as you say. Lots of core strength, endurance, and stability required. Okay, let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not that I can recall. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, climbing a tree. Healed up fine. And… I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. No surgeries or anything like that. Honestly, I've been pretty lucky. You'll probably see it in the records, but it's been a while since I've been to a doctor, so… I'm not sure what else to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. We do have some records here, but it’s always best to confirm. And you're right, it's good to be proactive, even if you feel healthy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I've taken all sorts of medicines over the years for colds and aches, no problems. I think my mother would have known if I was allergic to something, and she always kept good track of things. She's… not around anymore, but she was very thorough.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know that you haven’t experienced any allergic reactions. And it’s good that your mother was so attentive to your health. Currently, are you taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just… regular food. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of meat and dairy, Mongolian style. But no pills, no powders, nothing like that. I don't really believe in all that stuff, honestly. Keeps it simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My family… we didn’t really talk about health stuff much. My grandfather, on my father's side, he had… something with his heart, I think. But he lived a long life, even with it. And my mother’s side… I don’t really know. A lot of them lived in the countryside, and we didn’t see them much. I don’t recall anyone having… diabetes or cancer, but I wouldn't swear to it. Sorry, I'm not much help on that front.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kingan. Family history can be difficult to recall, and it's common not to have all the details. We can proceed without it for now. Before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work, I train. I eat. I sleep. It’s pretty straightforward. I don't smoke, never have. I have a drink every now and then, but nothing excessive. I try to get enough rest, especially when I’m training hard. It’s not a wild life, if that's what you mean. Mostly just focused on getting ready for this tryout, to be honest. Is there something specific you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, and sounds like a very sensible lifestyle. I was just checking for things like tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and general activity level. Okay, let's proceed with the physical exam. We'll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a brief musculoskeletal assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with, I guess. The quicker the better, right? I got a training session later. Let’s just do it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kingan. I understand your time is valuable. If you could please sit here, we'll get started. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 90. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again…
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… normal to me, but I’m not a doctor, right? Just tell me if you hear anything weird. This is all just to make sure I can wrestle, isn’t it? Hopefully, it’s all good.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Everything sounds good so far, Mr. Kingan. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let's do a brief musculoskeletal assessment. Can you please rotate your shoulders for me?
PATIENT: There we go. Feels… okay. A little stiff, maybe. I've been training pretty hard. Lots of grappling, you know? Puts a strain on everything. Is that bad? It's not painful, just… tight.
DOCTOR: There is some mild tenderness in your rotator cuff, and your range of motion is slightly limited. This is not uncommon with wrestling, as you mentioned. It doesn't appear to be anything serious at this point, but we should be mindful of it. Now, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? Feels alright, I guess. No pain or anything. A little creaky, maybe. Old man stuff. I told you, I wrestle. It's not exactly a gentle sport. Is everything okay? Are we done soon?
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly asymmetrical, but no significant instability. Yes, we are almost finished. Just a few more quick checks. Can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that strong enough? I got a pretty good grip, if you need anything lifted. Wrestlers, you know? Lots of strength. Is this all? Honestly, I'm starting to get a little anxious. Training doesn't wait for doctor's appointments.
DOCTOR: Yes, your grip strength is good. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Overall, your exam is mostly normal. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you have some mild tenderness in your rotator cuff, likely from your training. Your reflexes and neurological function are normal, as is your grip strength. Your gait is slightly asymmetrical, but no instability was noted. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend monitoring it at home over the next week. If it consistently remains elevated, we may need to investigate further. And please be mindful of your shoulder, and don’t push yourself too hard if you experience any pain. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: So… I can wrestle? That’s the important part, right? Monitoring blood pressure… shoulder… Yeah, okay. I can do that. I got a friend who’s a physical therapist, I’ll ask him about the shoulder. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… thank you. I really appreciate you getting this done quickly. I gotta get back to training. Is there a form or something I need to sign? Or are we good to go?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are cleared to wrestle, Mr. Kingan, with the caveats we discussed – monitoring your blood pressure and being mindful of your shoulder. Here’s a summary of your exam and the instructions for monitoring your blood pressure at home. Please sign here indicating you’ve reviewed the findings and understand the recommendations. I’ll also give you a list of local resources for physical therapy, in case your friend is unavailable. I wish you the best of luck with your tryout! Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
