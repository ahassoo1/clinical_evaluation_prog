DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. As the chart indicates, I requested a general wellness panel. I just like to keep an eye on things, you understand? At my age, one doesn’t want any surprises. I feel quite well, thankfully, but preventative care is important, no?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. Preventative care is always a good idea. That’s very wise of you. So, just to confirm, you’re here for a general wellness check-up, feeling generally well, with no specific complaints at the moment?
PATIENT: Precisely, Doctor. No complaints to speak of, thankfully. Just wanting to make sure everything is… ticking along as it should, shall we say? I try to stay active, eat reasonably well, but one can never be too careful, can one? And my wife, bless her heart, insisted. She worries, you see. A good woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: A good wife is a treasure, indeed. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, let's go through a quick history then. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Nothing major, no. My father had some trouble with his heart in his later years, but I seem to have avoided that particular inheritance, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, perhaps forty years ago, but recovered fully. And a broken arm, building a house, naturally. Construction work isn't known for its gentleness, you see. As for high blood pressure… the doctor checked it a few times at the company physicals, said it was a little elevated once or twice, but never enough to require medication. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. No major medical problems, pneumonia as a youth, broken arm, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never required them, thankfully. I’ve had my share of scrapes and bruises from the work, mind you – a carpenter’s life isn’t always a gentle one – but nothing that required a doctor’s knife, no. I consider myself quite lucky in that regard. I’ve always been careful, and perhaps a little bit strong, which helps avoid such things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, quite a strong woman. She died peacefully in her sleep. My father, as I mentioned, had heart trouble. He was a smoker, unfortunately, and it caught up with him. I have two brothers, both healthy as far as I know, though we don't see each other often. One lives in Colombia, the other in Florida. Both are retired now. No history of diabetes that I am aware of, nor any major cancers, thankfully. Does that cover what you need, Doctor? It’s a little difficult to recall everything after all these years.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. No diabetes or major cancers in the family, father with heart problems, mother lived to 87. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would never allow it, and frankly, I’ve seen enough of the damage it causes. My father’s struggles were a sufficient deterrent, I assure you. And I work with my hands, strong lungs are rather important for a carpenter, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Only socially, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps a beer with friends on a weekend. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I enjoy a good meal and good company, and a little wine can complement that nicely. But I don’t drink every day, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. My wife keeps me in check, you see. She’s a sensible woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies whatsoever, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been quite robust in that regard. Penicillin, shellfish, pollen...nothing bothers me. My wife jokes that I could eat anything, but I do try to maintain some sense of decorum. Is there anything else you require, Doctor? I’m happy to answer whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that’s a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Please proceed. I understand the need for such things. A carpenter learns to appreciate a thorough inspection of his materials, you see, and I suppose my body is no different. I trust your expertise completely. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, shall we?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now let me just take a look at your ears... Ears look clear. And finally, let's open your mouth and say “ah.” Throat looks good. Everything appears normal on initial exam, Mr. Mombrun. Now, I'd like to order a basic blood panel, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels. Do you have any preferences for where to get the blood drawn?
PATIENT: That all sounds quite reasonable, Doctor. Thank you for the thorough examination. I appreciate your diligence. As for the blood draw… there’s a lab just down the street, on Elm Street. “City Labs,” I believe it’s called. They’re quite efficient, and they take my insurance. Would that be acceptable? And, if you don’t mind my asking, what exactly are we looking for with these tests? Just so I have a better understanding, you see. I’m a practical man, and I like to know the details.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. City Labs is fine. I’ll send the order there electronically. As for the tests, the complete blood count checks for things like anemia or infection. The metabolic panel gives us a picture of how your kidneys and liver are functioning. And the lipid panel assesses your cholesterol levels – we want to make sure those are within a healthy range to reduce your risk of heart disease. Basically, we're just getting a baseline to see where things stand and identify any potential issues early on. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in more detail. It should take a couple of days for them to come back. In the meantime, just continue with your usual routine, and if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that explanation is perfectly clear. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so well. No further questions at this time. I’ll head over to City Labs this afternoon. Thank you again for your excellent care. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you require any further information from me. I believe that concludes our visit, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun, that concludes our visit for today. I’ll have the lab results sent to you as soon as they’re available. Feel free to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day.
