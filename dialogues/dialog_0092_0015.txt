DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Why don’t we start with what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Um… my sinuses. They are… not good. I have… a problem with them. It’s been… a little while, I think. I do not remember exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re having trouble with your sinuses. “Not good” is helpful, but let’s try to get a little more specific. When you say a “problem,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… what does it feel like? It is… pressure. A lot of pressure, in my face. Here… <points to her forehead and cheeks> And… sometimes it hurts. Not a big hurt, but… annoying. Like a heavy feeling. It makes it hard to… think, maybe? I do not know. It is just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, pressure and discomfort in your forehead and cheeks. And it’s affecting your ability to concentrate sometimes. That gives me a better idea. Has this pressure been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Some days it is worse than others. When I… work, it is bad. The noise… and the dust, maybe? It gets worse then. Other days, when I am home, it is… okay. Not good, but not so bad. I do not know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Boham. It sounds like your symptoms might be related to your work environment. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse, like bending over, changes in weather, or specific smells?
PATIENT: Changes in the weather… yes. When it is cold, it is worse. Very cold. And… bending over, yes! When I bend over, the pressure… it really hurts then. Smells… I do not think so. Unless… dust? The dust at work, that makes it bad. I think. It is hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold weather, bending over, and dust at work seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure and discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes… my nose feels stuffy. Very stuffy. I have to… breathe through my mouth. And… I think I cough sometimes. A little cough. Not a big cough, but it is there. And… <pauses, frowning> I feel tired. Very tired. But I work long hours, so maybe that is just… the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, stuffy nose, occasional cough, and fatigue. All of those things can be connected. Now, have you had a fever, chills, or any recent illness like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Fever? I do not think so. I do not feel hot. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but it is very hot outside. Illness… I had something a few months ago, I think. A cough, and… a headache. But it went away. I do not remember exactly when. It was before the really hot weather.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies or asthma?
PATIENT: Allergies? I do not know. No one has told me I have allergies. Asthma… no. I have never been told that either. I… I do not really go to the doctor much. My husband, he does. I just… I try to work through it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Boham, it's not bad that you try to work through it, but it's important to get these things checked out. Okay, so no known allergies or asthma. Have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Um… No. Not that I remember. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I think. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else… I don’t think. I have been… pretty healthy. Except for this sinus problem. It is just… annoying. And tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child. And generally healthy aside from the sinus issues. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – who suffer from allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she coughed a lot when she was old. A big cough. But I do not know if it was allergies. And my brother… he has some problems with his breathing sometimes. He gets… winded easily. But I don’t know what it is. We do not talk about… doctor things. It is not polite, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. No medications. I do not like taking pills. And… no allergies to pills, I think. I have never taken any, so I do not know. I sometimes take something for the pain, when it is bad. But just… ibuprofen, I think. The regular kind. You can buy it at the store.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen occasionally for pain. That's good to know. And no known medication allergies. Now, before we do a quick examination, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Yes. I… I work with a drill. A big drill. For oil. It is… noisy. Very noisy. And dusty. A lot of dust. I have worked there for… many years. I do not know exactly how long. A long time. It is hard work. Long hours. But… it is a good job. We need the money.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's very helpful information. Okay, Ms. Boham, I’m going to listen to your lungs and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. It will just take a few minutes. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Thank you. I will try to relax. It is… a little scary, going to the doctor. But you seem… nice. <sits back slightly, looking a little apprehensive>
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay. Your lungs sound clear, but I do hear some congestion in your sinuses. Your ears look normal. Your throat is a little red, but nothing major. I do see some nasal passages that are a little swollen and irritated. <pauses, making notes on a chart> Do you feel any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Yes. A little bit. Right there… <points to her forehead, above her eyebrows> And… here too. <points to her cheeks, near her nose> It feels… tender. Not a big pain, but… uncomfortable. Is that bad? It hurts more when I bend over. Like you said.
DOCTOR: Okay, that tenderness and pain when bending over is consistent with what we’re seeing. It sounds like you have sinusitis, an inflammation of your sinuses. Given your work environment and the congestion I heard, it's likely an allergic or irritant reaction combined with a possible secondary infection. <pauses> We can do some things to help relieve your symptoms. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Sinus… what was it? Sinusitis? Is that… bad? Will I need… surgery? I do not want surgery. I just want it to… stop hurting. What can we do to make it stop? Is it because of my job?
DOCTOR: Sinusitis means the lining of your sinuses is inflamed, or swollen. It’s often caused by a cold or allergies, and in your case, it seems likely the dust and noise at work are contributing factors. No, it doesn’t sound like you need surgery at this point. Most cases of sinusitis can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. <pauses> I want to start with a nasal saline rinse a couple of times a day to help clear out the congestion. I'm also going to prescribe a nasal steroid spray to reduce the inflammation. And I recommend continuing to take ibuprofen for the pain. <pauses> We can also discuss some ways to minimize your exposure to dust at work, like wearing a mask. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. A spray and the rinse… I can try that. The mask… I do not know. My boss… he might not like that. But I will ask. What about… the tiredness? Is the spray going to help me sleep better? I am very tired all the time. And is it… contagious? Will I get my husband sick?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question. The nasal spray won’t directly help you sleep, but relieving the congestion should make it easier to breathe and potentially improve your sleep quality. To address the tiredness, let’s make sure you're getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and eating a balanced diet. <pauses> Regarding contagiousness, sinusitis itself isn’t typically contagious, but the underlying cold or viral infection could be. It's a good idea to practice good hygiene - wash your hands frequently, avoid close contact with your husband when you’re feeling unwell, and avoid sharing personal items. I’m going to write you a prescription for the nasal spray. It’s important to use it as directed. We can also discuss some over-the-counter options for allergy relief if the spray isn’t enough. Would you like a printed copy of the instructions, as well?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Instructions… printed. I forget things easily, you know. And… I do not understand computers very well. My husband… he helps me with those. I just want to feel better. And sleep. Mostly sleep. Do you think this will help me sleep?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. Here are the instructions for the nasal spray. It explains how often to use it, how to properly administer it, and potential side effects. <hands Ms. Boham the paper> Relieving the congestion should definitely help you sleep better. If the spray and rinse don’t provide enough relief after a week, let me know, and we can consider other options, such as an antihistamine or, if necessary, a referral to an allergist. <pauses> I’m also going to give you a work note explaining your condition, just in case your boss asks about it. It will recommend minimizing dust exposure as much as possible. <pauses> Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A work note? That is good. Thank you. <takes the note and the instructions> No… I think that is all. I am… a little overwhelmed. So many things to remember. But… I will try my best. You have been… very kind, Doctor. Thank you for listening. <smiles weakly> Is there anything I need to pay now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. I’m glad I could help. It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, especially with a lot of new information. Take it one step at a time. Regarding payment, since you are uninsured, the clinic offers a sliding scale fee based on income. The receptionist will be happy to assist you with that. <pauses> I’ll have the nurse check your blood pressure before you leave. If you don't see improvement in a week, or if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call and schedule a follow-up appointment. Here is the number. <hands Ms. Boham a small card with the clinic number> Take care of yourself, Ms. Boham. And please get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. <nods gratefully> I will try. <starts to gather her belongings> I appreciate your help. Goodbye.
