DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It's lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is… is Carlotta okay? My name is Manuel. Yes, Manuel Carlotta. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… my wife… she wants… a baby. We are… old. She says we should talk to someone, before… you know. Before it is… too late. Is that right? I forget things easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, Manuel, that's perfectly alright. It's very thoughtful of you and your wife to come in and discuss this. And it’s completely normal to feel a little unsure or forgetful. It’s good you’re addressing this now. So, to be clear, you and your wife are considering trying to have a baby, and you'd like to talk about the medical aspects of that, given your ages?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Ages… she reminds me all the time. I am… seventy, yes? And she is… not so far behind. We have been married a long time, but never… a baby. Now she thinks… maybe? But I worry. Is it… safe? For her? I don’t want to… cause trouble. And will it… work? I make small things with my hands… metal and plastic… but a baby… that is big work!
DOCTOR: It's very responsible of you to think about both her safety and the feasibility of this, Manuel. Those are very valid concerns. Seventy is… a bit later in life for starting a family, yes. There are definitely some increased risks we need to discuss. Before we go further, let me just pull up your medical records here on the computer… … Okay, I see you've been a patient at this clinic for a few years. That's helpful. Do you mind if I ask a few questions about your overall health, and your wife’s as well?
PATIENT: Questions are… good. I forget things, so maybe you can remind me. Overall health… I try to walk every day. Not far, but I walk. I eat… mostly what my wife makes. She is a good cook. I don’t get sick much. A little cough in the winter, but nothing serious. My wife… she is… stronger than me. She still gardens, lots of flowers. But she gets… tired sometimes. And her knees… they bother her. She takes pills for that, I think. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Manuel. Walking is excellent, and it’s good your wife stays active as well. The fact that she takes pills for her knees is important, yes. It tells me we need to understand what’s going on there. And the fatigue is something we’ll want to explore, too. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about any medical conditions either of you have been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… what does that mean? Like… a bad thing? I think… my wife, she has… pressure. High pressure, the doctor said. She takes a pill for that too, I think. And… sometimes, she feels… sad. Very sad. The doctor gave her a little white pill for that. Me… I don’t think I have anything. I had a cough last winter, but that went away. Oh! And my back… it hurts sometimes, but I’m old. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: “Diagnosed” just means a doctor has identified a specific medical problem, Manuel. It doesn’t automatically mean anything bad, just that we need to be aware of it. High blood pressure is very common, and good that she’s taking medication for it. And it’s also good she's getting support for feeling sad – that's important. And yes, back pain is common as we get older, but we'll want to understand how much it's affecting your daily life. Just to be thorough, have either of you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Let me think. My wife… she broke her arm a long time ago, when she was young. She fell from a tree, trying to get mangoes. She was always a climber, that one! They took her to the hospital, but it healed okay. She still talks about the mangoes. Me… I think… no. I have never been in the hospital. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was a baby? But I don’t remember that. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Manuel. A broken arm a long time ago isn't a major concern here. And no hospitalizations for you, that’s also good. Now, before we talk about trying to conceive, I’d like to ask about any medications you or your wife are currently taking, and any allergies either of you have. Do you happen to know what medications she takes for her blood pressure and sadness?
PATIENT: Medications… my wife keeps all the pills in a box. A little blue box. I don’t really look. She tells me when to bring her water with the pills, but I don’t know the names. She has… a white pill for sadness. A small one. And… a pink pill for the pressure, I think. Maybe yellow? I’m sorry, Doctor. I really don’t know. She doesn’t like me to touch her pills. She says I’ll mix them up. Allergies… she likes flowers. Does that count? I don’t think either of us are allergic to anything. I get a little itchy sometimes when I touch metal, but that's from my work.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Manuel, it's perfectly understandable. It’s not essential that you know the names, but it’s important for me to have that information. Perhaps your wife would be willing to bring the pill bottles with her next time she comes in?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that’s a good idea. She will probably want to come. She is the one who wants this. I will tell her to bring the pills. She likes to be prepared. She always has a bag… with everything. Is… is there anything else you need to know? I get tired of forgetting things. It makes me worried.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Manuel. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried, and it's good you're being so open with me. We've covered a lot already. Just a couple more questions, if you don’t mind. Could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what does that mean? I wake up, I eat breakfast with my wife. I go to my workshop and make things. Metal birds, plastic flowers, sometimes small boxes. I come home, we eat dinner. We watch the news. Sometimes we talk. We go to bed. It’s… quiet. We don’t drink much. Maybe a little juice with dinner. We don’t smoke. Never have. Is that… a lifestyle?
DOCTOR: That is a lifestyle, Manuel. A very peaceful and healthy one, it sounds like. No smoking and minimal alcohol are excellent. And staying busy with your workshop is wonderful. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. Like when I was a little boy? They poked and prodded. I don’t like being poked. Is it necessary? Will it… tell you if it’s safe? For my wife? I just want to make sure she won’t get hurt. I am old, so maybe it is too late for me, but she… she is good. I want her to be good.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Manuel. It’s perfectly alright to feel hesitant. The exam is important, yes, to get a better sense of your overall health and see if there are any potential concerns before we discuss options. It won’t be painful, I promise. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. No poking, I assure you. It’s also important for me to examine your wife as well, to assess her health and address any concerns she might have. We can do both exams today, or schedule separate appointments if that would be more comfortable for both of you. It’s important for me to have all the information to ensure the safety of both of you. Would you be willing to let me do a quick exam, just to be sure?
PATIENT: Okay. If it’s for her. If it will make her safe. But… be gentle. I am old bones, easily broken. And… quick, you said? I don’t like being here for too long. It makes me forget things even more. But… my wife, she’s coming next week, yes? She will want to be examined too. She is more… brave than me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Manuel. Gentle and quick, I promise. And yes, it’s very important your wife is examined as well. I’m glad she'll be coming in next week. Alright, let's get started then. If you could just sit back and relax. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath for me, please... and exhale slowly. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be due to being anxious. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. We'll want to monitor that. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Just… funny. It feels… empty. Like a drum. Old man’s belly. I don’t eat much anymore. My wife worries about that too. She always tries to give me more food. Ooh… maybe there. A little bit. Like a… a rumble. Sometimes. When I eat too much. But it goes away. It’s probably just gas. Old man’s gas.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Manuel. A little bit of tenderness and occasional rumbling is common. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. Alright, that's all for the physical exam for now. Thank you for being so cooperative. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it seems you're generally in reasonably good health for your age, but we do need to monitor your blood pressure and I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications to help with that. Now, to get a clearer picture of your wife's health, I'd like to ask you some questions about her medical history, if that’s alright. Do you know if she has any chronic conditions like diabetes or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes… is that when you get too sweet? My wife likes sugar in her tea. But I don’t think she has that sickness. She likes flowers and gardening, not sweets. Cholesterol… what is that? Is that a bad thing? She cooks with oil, I think. She makes good food, but lots of oil. She says it gives it flavor. She went to the doctor a few times for her knees. She says they are old too, like me. And… she gets sad sometimes. She takes a little white pill for that. But she’s strong, Doctor. Very strong. She always takes care of me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Manuel. Diabetes is when your body has trouble controlling sugar levels, but it sounds like your wife doesn't have that. Cholesterol is a type of fat in your blood, and too much can cause problems. It's good she's been to the doctor for her knees, and that she's getting support for her sadness. Now, do you know if she’s ever been hospitalized for anything, or has any allergies?
PATIENT: Hospital… she told me once, a long time ago, when she was young. She fell from a tree, trying to get mangoes. She broke her arm, I think. They took her to the hospital, but she healed okay. She still talks about the mangoes. She was always a climber, that one. Allergies… hmm. She likes flowers, lots of flowers. She smells them all the time. But I don’t think she’s allergic to anything. She never complains. Maybe a little sneeze sometimes, when the pollen is high. But that's just… spring.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Manuel. A broken arm a long time ago isn’t a major concern, and no known allergies is also good. Alright, to summarize, both you and your wife seem to be generally in reasonably good health for your age, but we need to monitor your blood pressure, and it's important to address her fatigue and sadness. We also need to be mindful of her knee pain. Now, I want to talk about the possibility of trying to conceive. It’s important to understand that there are increased risks associated with pregnancy at your ages, for both of you. It’s also important to be realistic about the chances of success. Would you like to discuss those risks and chances in detail?
PATIENT: Risks… chances… yes. She wants to know. I want to know. But… I’m old. Is it safe for her? I don’t want to… hurt her. And… if it doesn’t work… will that make her sadder? She has wanted this for a long time. But I don’t want to… disappoint her. Tell me… what are the risks? Be honest, Doctor. I need to know. And… what are the chances? Is it… possible?
DOCTOR: Of course, Manuel. Honesty is very important. You’re right to be concerned, and I commend you for thinking about her well-being first. For your wife, the risks of pregnancy at her age include a higher chance of miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy , gestational diabetes, preeclampsia , and complications during delivery. There’s also a slightly higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities in the baby. For you, if conception is successful, there's an increased risk associated with the physical strain and emotional stress of supporting your wife through pregnancy. As for the chances of success, it's significantly lower than for younger couples. It’s difficult to give an exact number, as it depends on many factors, including your wife’s overall health and fertility. However, with assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization , the chances can be improved, but those come with their own risks and costs. It’s important to understand that even with IVF, there’s no guarantee of success, and it can be a physically and emotionally demanding process. We would need to do some tests to assess your wife’s fertility and determine if she’s a good candidate for IVF or other treatments. Would you like to discuss those tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Tests… IVF… it sounds… complicated. And expensive. I don’t have much money. I make small things with my hands, it’s not a lot. My wife… she would do anything for a baby. But I don’t want to put her through too much. I don’t want her to be sad if it doesn’t work. And I don’t want to… drain all our money. What kind of tests? Are they painful? And… how much does IVF cost? Be honest, Doctor. I need to know everything before we decide. I just want to do what’s best for her. Even if that means… not trying.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask all these questions, Manuel. It's important to be fully informed before making any decisions. And it’s very admirable that you’re prioritizing your wife’s well-being. The tests would involve a blood draw to assess your wife's hormone levels and ovarian reserve, and a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate her uterus and ovaries. The blood draw is relatively painless, just a small prick. The ultrasound is non-invasive, but it might be slightly uncomfortable. As for IVF costs, it's significant. A single cycle typically costs between $12,000 and $15,000, and that doesn't include the cost of medications, which can be several thousand dollars more. There are some financial assistance programs available, but eligibility requirements vary. However, before we even consider IVF, I would recommend starting with a basic fertility evaluation to see if there are any underlying issues that need to be addressed. This would involve the blood tests and ultrasound, and possibly a semen analysis for you, just to rule out any problems. If the results of the evaluation are normal, and your wife is otherwise healthy, we can discuss other options, such as intrauterine insemination , which is less expensive and less invasive than IVF. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to pursue fertility treatment is a personal one. I want to provide you with all the information you need to make the best choice for you and your wife. Would you like me to explain these tests and treatment options in more detail?
PATIENT: I… I think we should do the tests. The basic ones. To see… if there's a chance. Before we spend all our money. And… before we get too hopeful. Yes. Let’s do the tests. And… tell me everything. Explain it all. Even if it’s bad news. I need to know. We both need to know. And… if it’s not meant to be… then we’ll accept it. But we need to know for sure. Before we make any decisions.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Manuel. That’s a very sensible decision. I’m glad you’ve decided to proceed with the basic fertility evaluation. I’ll explain everything to you in detail, and we’ll go through the results together. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw some blood samples from both you and your wife, and schedule a pelvic ultrasound for her. It will take a few days to get the results back, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call.
