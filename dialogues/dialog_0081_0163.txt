DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s quite a pleasure to meet you. I’m here, rather reluctantly I must admit, at the behest of my daughter. She’s concerned about…well, about my eating habits, shall we say. I’ve been attempting a new diet, and she’s taken a rather firm stance against it. It involves a great deal of…restriction. Perhaps you've heard of the ‘Breatharian’ diet? I understand it’s…unconventional.
DOCTOR: The…Breatharian diet, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. The notion, as I understand it, is to gradually wean oneself off solid food, and eventually, all food, deriving sustenance solely from…well, from prana, or life force, and sunlight. A rather ambitious undertaking, even for a man of my…profession. Special effects, you see. One develops a certain…tolerance for the improbable. But my daughter insists it's not a sensible approach. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel rather…lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Right. Special effects… I see. And how long have you been…attempting this diet, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it began approximately six weeks ago. A gradual process, as the proponents advise. Initially, simply reducing portions, then eliminating processed foods, then meat…and so on. The last…solid meal I consumed was, I believe, a rather excellent piece of roasted cod on the 18th of June. Yes, the 18th of June. I recall the precise date, as it coincided with a particularly successful test of a new miniature explosion effect. A rather trivial detail, perhaps, but I do have a good memory for such things.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, you say. And you’ve experienced…lightheadedness, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Precisely. It began rather subtly, a slight dizziness upon standing, a sort of…fogginess in the mind. But in the last week or so, it's become more pronounced. And, if I'm entirely honest, Doctor, my energy levels are…dwindling. One used to be able to work for hours on end, meticulously crafting these effects. Now, I find myself needing rather frequent rests. And, while I maintain a perfectly optimistic disposition, I confess to a certain…weakness. A rather disconcerting sensation, for a man of my age and constitution.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. We need to get a better understanding of what's going on. Let's start with a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. And then we’ll do some basic neurological checks. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Quite acceptable, Doctor. Indeed, a thorough examination seems prudent. My daughter would be most insistent upon it, even if she weren't here to directly voice her concerns. She has a rather…determined nature, that one. Proceed at your leisure. Though, if I may inquire, what exactly are you hoping to ascertain from these…checks? I'm not entirely averse to medical procedures, but a layperson’s understanding is rarely comprehensive, you see.
DOCTOR: We’re looking for signs of dehydration, malnutrition, and any potential neurological effects of severely restricting your diet. Your body needs nutrients to function, Mr. Vantine. It's not simply a matter of… willpower, or life force. Now, if you'll please, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me.
PATIENT: Quite right, Doctor. A perfectly sensible assessment. I confess to a certain…theoretical fascination with the body’s mechanics, though practical application has always eluded me. I’ve always been rather more adept at simulating life, rather than maintaining it, you see. Proceed as you wish. And please, do not hesitate to inform me if you detect anything…untoward. Although, I assure you, my pulse is generally quite steady. I’ve always prided myself on my composure, even during rather stressful pyrotechnic demonstrations.
DOCTOR: 90 over 60. And your pulse is…68, a bit weak. Breathing is a little shallow, but clear. No murmurs or crackles that I can detect. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to tap on your tendons, and you just relax.
PATIENT: Perfectly satisfactory, I presume? Although, a slightly shallow breath is hardly unusual for a man of my age. I’ve always been rather prone to…overthinking, you see. It tends to constrict the diaphragm. Proceed with your examination, Doctor. I shall endeavour to remain…relaxed. Although, I must confess, the prospect of being tapped with a hammer does not inspire a sense of profound tranquility.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are…diminished, Mr. Vantine. Significantly diminished. Alright. And finally, I’d like to check your skin turgor. Notice how slowly it returns to normal. That’s another sign of dehydration. Now, I'm going to need to order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a CBC, and a vitamin D level. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A rather concerning assessment, it seems. Diminished reflexes…slow skin turgor…one begins to suspect my daughter was not entirely unjustified in her anxieties. Blood work, you say? Perfectly acceptable. Though I must inquire, Doctor, what precisely will these…panels and levels reveal? Is it a simple matter of restoring hydration, or are we venturing into more…serious territory? I confess, the notion of ‘serious territory’ does not appeal. I have a rather important miniature explosion sequence planned for next month, you see. It requires a certain…level of vitality.
DOCTOR: These tests will tell us if you are deficient in any electrolytes, if your kidney function is impaired, and if you’re anemic. It will also rule out any other underlying medical conditions. As for the “serious territory,” Mr. Vantine, your body is already showing signs of significant stress. Continuing this diet will only exacerbate those problems. We need to get you eating something, and I mean real food. Now, while we wait for the lab results, I'm going to recommend a course of oral rehydration solution and a bland diet—soups, crackers, maybe some toast. I'll also order a vitamin D supplement. I’ll send the lab orders to the front desk. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment for the blood draw.
PATIENT: Oral rehydration solution…soups…crackers…a rather…drab prospect, Doctor. Though, I concede, the alternative appears considerably less appealing. Anemia…kidney impairment…one begins to comprehend the gravity of the situation. It seems my daughter's anxieties were…justified, after all. I suppose a miniature explosion sequence can be postponed. Very well, Doctor. Proceed as you deem necessary. I shall endeavour to comply with your…recommendations. Though, if I may inquire…is there any chance of incorporating a small, aesthetically pleasing garnish into the soup? Perhaps a sprig of parsley? A little visual appeal, you understand, can work wonders for morale. .
