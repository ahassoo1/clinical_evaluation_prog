DOCTOR: Hi Wynell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Hernandez, was it? Yes, well, it’s… about this whole business, really. They sent me over here. Honestly, all this fuss. I don’t see what all the bother is about. People trying to tell me what to do with my body. It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand it can be frustrating when you feel like others are involved in your healthcare decisions. Just to clarify, the referral note mentions some concerns regarding recent weight loss and changes in your overall condition?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, that. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been keeping track. I eat when I’m hungry, don't I? Maybe I haven’t been as… robust as I used to be. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. It’s not like I’m wasting away, you know. I still get around. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. "Mostly" is good to know. And it's perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly how much you’ve eaten in a typical day for the past month or so?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You want me to measure my food now? Doctor, I am 83 years old! I don't have time for all this… fuss. I have better things to do than weigh every morsel. A piece of toast in the morning, perhaps. A little something for lunch… a sandwich, maybe. And dinner… well, whatever feels right. Sometimes soup. Sometimes not. It varies! Honestly, it's not something I pay attention to.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. You’re right, keeping track of everything can be a lot. Let's try a different approach then. Have you noticed any changes in how you feel?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, there’s always changes. My knees ache more, of course. And getting up and down… that's not what it used to be. But that’s just… life, isn’t it? I don't feel sick, if that's what you're asking. Just… older. Tired sometimes. But who isn’t these days?
DOCTOR: That's good to know you don't feel acutely sick. And yes, aches and fatigue are very common. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels throughout the day?
PATIENT: Energy levels… Hmm. Well, I used to be able to garden all day, you know? Really dig around in the dirt. Now? I can maybe putter around for an hour or so. And then I need a good long sit-down. It’s not like I’m running marathons, Doctor. But I still manage. Mostly. I don’t want people thinking I’m helpless.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Wynell. You’re very capable, and it sounds like you've always been active. We just want to make sure everything is okay. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're asking about… that? Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I’m here because someone wants to poke and prod at me, not discuss… personal matters. It’s just… you know. Things happen. Old age, again. It's not a topic for polite conversation.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to feel that way, Wynell. It's a sensitive topic, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. It's a routine question, but certainly not one we need to delve into if you'd prefer not to. Let's move on then. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss, even if you haven’t been tracking your eating?
PATIENT: Unintentional… weight loss? Honestly, Doctor, I told you, I haven’t been keeping track! How would I know if it was unintentional? Maybe my clothes feel a little looser. Maybe not. I haven’t stood on a scale in… goodness, I don’t even remember when. All this fuss over a few pounds!
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your frustration, Wynell. Let’s try something else. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Well, sometimes. After I’ve been sitting for a long time. It’s nothing a good elevation can’t fix. My mother used to say it was just the water. And frankly, Doctor, I tend to believe my mother. She knew a thing or two.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Wynell, to get a better understanding, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, Doctor, I thought we were just going to have a conversation. All this… physical business seems a bit much. I didn’t come here to be examined like some… specimen! I’m a person, not a… a project!
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Wynell. You're not a specimen, and I apologize if it feels that way. A quick exam would just help me rule out anything serious and get a better picture of what's going on. It's routine, and it doesn't have to take long. We can focus on what you're comfortable with. Would you be open to me listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But no poking and prodding! Just… listen. And take my blood pressure. But that’s it! I’m not letting you touch my feet. Not today. And don’t expect me to stand on that scale, either. Honestly, all this fuss… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. No feet, no scale – perfectly fine. Just listening and blood pressure it is. If you could just take a nice, deep breath for me… Breath sounds are a little quieter than I’d like, but otherwise everything sounds okay. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated? Oh, goodness. See? This is what happens when you bother an old woman! All this talk about weight and breathing and blood pressure… it's enough to raise anyone’s pressure. I told you I was fine. Honestly, I think I just need a nice cup of tea and a good rest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. And you're right, getting a cup of tea and resting is a great idea. A blood pressure of 140/90 is a little higher than ideal, but it can fluctuate depending on stress and other factors. Since it’s elevated and you mentioned feeling tired, I’d like to run a few simple blood tests just to rule out anything concerning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, now you want blood? Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. All this poking and prodding and testing… It’s just… too much. I came here because someone told me I had to. Not because I felt like being put through the wringer! I’m not sure I want to go through with all this.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel overwhelmed, Wynell. It sounds like this whole process has been frustrating for you, and I apologize for that. You're in control here, and you can absolutely say no to anything you're not comfortable with. The blood tests would just give us a little more information to help figure out what might be causing your fatigue and the slightly elevated blood pressure. It could be something simple, or it could be nothing at all. But knowing what’s going on can help us make sure you stay healthy and feel your best. If you're not comfortable with the tests, we can certainly skip them. But if you are willing, it would be a helpful step. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You make it sound so… reasonable. But honestly, Doctor, I’m just tired. Tired of being poked and prodded and asked questions. Tired of worrying about things I don't understand. I suppose… I suppose if it will finally get everyone off my back, I’ll let you take a little blood. But just a little! And no, I do not want to know the results. Honestly, I don’t want to be told I’m falling apart. Just… do it and let me go home.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wynell. Just a little blood, and you won't be told anything you don't want to know. I promise. We'll just need a couple of vials. It will be a quick pinch. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. And then, we'll get you home. All done. A little pressure here for a few minutes. And then you're all set. I'll have the results sent to your primary care physician, and they'll contact you if anything needs attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when can I go home? Honestly, I need a cup of tea. And a long nap. Tell everyone I’m perfectly fine. And please, don’t bother me again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. You can go home now, and absolutely no further bother. I'll make a note in your chart to respect your wishes. Here’s a bandage for your arm, and I'll have the receptionist help you with any transportation arrangements. Please, get that cup of tea and take that nap. And if you experience any unexpected symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact your primary care physician. .
