DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my blood. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I should know my… what do you call it… blood type? Something about needing to know, just in case. I don’t rightly remember ever having it checked, and I’m a bit… scattered these days, you see. It just slipped my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Knowing your blood type is a good idea, especially as we get older. It's helpful for emergencies. So, it sounds like you'd like to have your blood type checked today?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. If you wouldn’t mind. I used to be so good with things like this… working on the rigs, you had to keep track of everything. But now… it all feels a bit fuzzy. Is it a painful thing? I don’t like needles much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all. It’s just a quick prick of a needle, a small blood draw. We'll use a very small needle and it's usually over very quickly. It’s a routine test. Before we do that though, I’d like to ask a few questions, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Questions are fine. Just… go easy on me if I don’t remember things right away, alright? My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Ask away, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. We'll take our time. First, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. Not that I know of, but… oh! I did have a bit of a rash once, years ago, after eating some shellfish. But that was a long time ago, and it wasn’t too bad. Just a little itchy. Other than that, I think I’m pretty good. I haven't had much trouble with anything, really. Though, my daughter is always telling me to be careful with what I eat... She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a possible shellfish allergy, but mild and in the past. We’ll make a note of that. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, the doctor gave me something for my… what’s it called… the water on my knees, a few years back. A little pill. I take it when they bother me too much. And… oh! I take a vitamin D pill in the winter. My daughter says I don't get enough sun. That's about it, I think. Nothing else regularly. Do you need to know the name of the pill for my knees? I don’t recall it offhand.
DOCTOR: It would be helpful if you could recall the name, but don’t worry if you can’t right now. We can look it up later if needed. So, a medication for your knees, as needed, and vitamin D in the winter. Now, have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... major illnesses… Well, I had a bad bout of the flu when I was younger, but nothing serious. Oh! And I broke my wrist, years ago, when I was working on the rigs. Fell off a ladder. Had to have it set, of course. That was… a long time ago now. And… oh dear, my memory is just dreadful. I’m sure there was something else, but I can’t quite grasp it. I really apologize. My daughter says I should write these things down, but I never seem to get around to it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Darl. It's perfectly normal to forget things over time. We'll get what we can. So, broken wrist, and a bout of the flu. Now, do you have a family history of any significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had… something with her heart, I think. It wasn't quick, but she was frail towards the end. My father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. He didn’t have much trouble, as far as I recall. And my brother… he had a bit of trouble with his sugar, later in life. But that’s about all I remember, truthfully. We weren’t a family that talked much about these things. It was… different back then. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Heart issues with your mother, and some sugar issues with your brother. Okay. Now, just a few more quick questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. Didn’t like the smell of it, and my husband… he didn't either. He worked hard to keep his lungs clear, being a diver. No, not me. Never touched a cigarette. A glass of wine with dinner now and then, perhaps, but never smoking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Like I said, just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing more than that, Doctor. I’m not much of a drinker, truthfully. Always preferred a nice cup of tea. My daughter keeps a bottle of sherry around for special occasions, but I rarely have any. It’s a bit strong for my liking, to be honest. Mostly I stick to tea. And water, of course. You have to keep hydrated, you know. Especially in this heat.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you have any questions for me before we move on to a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. What does that involve? I hope it’s nothing too strenuous. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment... Just tell me what you're going to do, and I'll try my best to cooperate. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… don’t like surprises, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. It's just a basic check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and feeling your abdomen. We'll just take a quick look at your overall health. Nothing strenuous at all. I'll explain everything as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Explaining as you go is good. That helps a lot. Alright, Doctor. Let’s get it over with then, shall we? I do have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon with my daughter, so if we could be relatively quick, that would be wonderful. Not to rush you, of course… but you know how daughters are.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick as possible while still being thorough. If you could just sit on the table for me, that would be great. First, let's take your blood pressure. Can you extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. There we go. My arm’s not quite as steady as it used to be, but I'm doing my best. Don't mind if I grip the side of the table, alright? Just in case. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 145 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Breathing normally. Easy enough. My heart’s been fluttering a bit lately, actually. Not often, but… sometimes when I get excited, or when I’ve had too much tea. Is that… something to worry about? I haven’t mentioned it to my daughter yet. She’d fuss something awful.
DOCTOR: I do hear a slight irregularity with your heart rate, as you mentioned. It's not majorly concerning at this moment, but it’s good you brought it to my attention. We should definitely investigate further. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Gently is good. My stomach… well, it's a bit sensitive sometimes. Gets a bit bloated, especially after I eat. Nothing terrible, but I can get a bit of discomfort. Just let me know if you need me to say anything. There… that spot, just there, on the right side. A little tender, but not awful. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some mild tenderness there. It could be a number of things. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Everything seems relatively normal there. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Namely, a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds like… a lot of tests. But if it’ll help figure out what’s going on with my heart, and my tummy… then alright, dear. Do what you think is best. An EKG… is that painful? I really don’t like anything poking and prodding. And the blood… I always feel faint when they take blood. Is there anything I can do to prevent that? Maybe lie down? I really appreciate you explaining everything. I get so flustered easily.
DOCTOR: No, the EKG is not painful at all. It just involves placing some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart's electrical activity. No poking or prodding involved. And we can definitely have you lie down while we take the blood to help prevent you from feeling faint. It’s very common to feel a little lightheaded, so don't worry, we'll take all the precautions we need. We'll draw the blood right away, then get you scheduled for the EKG. I’ll also have the nurse take your weight and height for me. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Lie down for the blood… that sounds much better. And the stickers… alright, I can manage stickers. Weight and height… oh dear, I don’t think I want to know my weight, truthfully. But if you need it, I suppose. Alright, let’s get it over with then. The sooner we know what’s going on, the better. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Darl. That's what I'm here for. Now, let's get you comfortable on the bed over there, and I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood. Just relax, and try to take some deep breaths. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll be back in a moment once you’ve had your blood drawn to discuss the next steps.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breaths… deep breaths. This is going to be alright… this is going to be alright. Just a little prick… and then it will be over. Please, be gentle with me, nurse.
