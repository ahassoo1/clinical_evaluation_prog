DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Todoroovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh... well, it’s about this… performance thing. They need me to get checked out, I think. Some kind of clearance. Honestly, it's a bit of a blur how I ended up here. Long day, you know? Is that what this is for? A check-up for acting or… something?
DOCTOR: “Performance thing,” right. And this is for… a job, I presume?
PATIENT: Job… yes, I think so. It's… ushers, mostly. Or ticket takers. Sometimes lobby attendant. It’s… not a steady thing, you understand. Lots of different places. Been doing it a long time. It feels like forever, honestly. I just need them to say I'm… fit enough, I suppose? I don’t really remember what they said exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, they need a basic fitness assessment. Let’s start with your medical history then. Have you been diagnosed with any health conditions?
PATIENT: Health conditions… Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I… I don’t really remember being diagnosed with anything. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a while back, but that was… years ago. Nothing serious, I don't think. And my back… aches sometimes. It just feels old, you know? Divorced wife kept saying I needed to see someone, but… well.
DOCTOR: "Aches sometimes" isn’t very specific, Mr. Krahn. When did this knee trouble start?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a long time ago. Maybe… early nineties? I was doing a lot of… standing then. Lots of events at the theater. Heavy lifting with posters and… things. It just sort of… gradually started bothering me. Not a sudden thing, more like a slow wear and tear. And… honestly, I probably ignored it for too long. I was younger, you know? Thought I could push through anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And has this knee pain been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely. There are days where I barely notice it. And then… other days, especially if it’s cold or… if I’ve been on my feet a lot, it really flares up. I’ve tried a few things over the years… liniment, stretching… nothing really makes a huge difference. Mostly just… try to take it easy when it's bad.
DOCTOR: “Take it easy” isn't a treatment plan, Mr. Krahn. Have you ever had any surgery on your knees?
PATIENT: Surgery…? No… no, I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure I haven’t had any surgery. My wife… she would have remembered. She always remembered everything. Never let me forget a doctor's appointment. I'm quite certain. No surgery, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your back pain?
PATIENT: The back… it's just… old age, I think. It stiffens up in the morning, you know? Hard to get moving. Then it loosens up a little bit during the day, but… if I bend over too much, or lift something heavy, it really aches. It's not… debilitating or anything. Just… annoying. It’s been happening for… oh, I don’t know… the last few years, maybe?
DOCTOR: Do you have any trouble with bowel or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. That’s… a very personal question, isn’t it? No. No, I don't have any trouble with that. Everything… functions as it should. I think. I haven't… noticed anything different.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. Never been much of a smoker. Tried it once, didn't like it. A little bit of wine with dinner sometimes… very little. Just a small glass. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never understood the appeal. I'm a fairly simple man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Oh, good. A physical exam. That’s… sensible. Yes, yes, the scale. I’m probably a little lighter these days, to be honest. Not eating as much since… well, never mind. Just hoping I pass this clearance thing.
DOCTOR: 118 pounds… That’s… low, Mr. Krahn. Have you experienced any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh. Is that low? I hadn't really noticed. I suppose I haven’t been eating as much… since my wife. Everything tastes a bit… bland, you know? Not intentional weight loss, just… not much appetite. Maybe a little less than usual.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s proceed with the exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Alright. Deep breath… like this? Is that okay? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Everything feels a bit… formal.
DOCTOR: Breathe normally. Any pain here?
PATIENT: A little… sometimes. It’s just… indigestion, I think. It comes and goes. Nothing serious. Mostly just after I eat. It feels… bloated. A little uncomfortable. But I can usually manage.
DOCTOR: And how about your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes…? Oh. I… I don't know. Are you going to… test them? What do you mean? I’m not very good at those little hammer things, if that's what you mean. Always been a bit clumsy, honestly.
DOCTOR: I’m going to test your knee reflexes, Mr. Krahn. Please sit on the edge of the table and let your legs dangle freely.
PATIENT: Oh… that little hammer thing. Right. Okay. I’m sitting… dangling my legs. Not very strong, I warn you. Never been very coordinated. Is that… is that supposed to make my leg kick?
DOCTOR: Minimal response on both sides. Now, I'm going to check your feet. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Shoes and socks off. They're not very pretty, I must warn you. Been a long winter. And… I don’t get out much anymore.
DOCTOR: Decreased sensation in both feet. Weak pulses. Are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your feet or hands?
PATIENT: Numbness… tingling? Oh, sometimes. Just a little bit. Especially at night. I thought it was just… sleeping in a funny position. Or the cold. It comes and goes, you know? Nothing I ever really worried about. It’s just… a bit of pins and needles.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the physical exam, I am concerned about your nutritional status and the possibility of peripheral neuropathy. You’re significantly underweight, have decreased sensation in your feet, and weak pulses. This requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Peripheral… what now? I… I don’t understand. Is that… bad? Further investigation? What does that mean? I just wanted a quick check-up for this acting thing… I didn’t realize it would be so… complicated. What am I supposed to do?
DOCTOR: It means we need to rule out some serious medical conditions. I'm going to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. We also need to check for an infection. I'm also recommending a neurological consultation. It's possible there's a nerve problem that needs to be addressed. You’re not fit for this job until we have the results of these tests. I’m going to write you a referral, and a list of labs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… neurological… referral…? I… I don’t think I can keep track of all that. Is this… expensive? I don't have much money, you see. And my wife… she always handled these things. I'm just an old usher, Doctor. I just wanted to pass a simple check-up. Is there anything simpler we can do?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand this is overwhelming, but these tests are necessary. I cannot clear you for this job without ruling out serious medical conditions. As for the cost, I'm not a billing specialist, but you can ask the lab about payment options. There’s also a local charity that provides assistance with medical expenses; I can give you their contact information. I'm going to write everything down for you. I strongly advise you to schedule these appointments as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m just… overwhelmed. You’re right. I’m just overwhelmed. Write it down, please. Just… write it down. I'll… I’ll try to figure it out. But honestly… I don’t even know where to start. Maybe… maybe I should just forget about this acting thing. It seems like too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Here. This has the lab addresses, the neurologist’s contact information, and the charity's number. I need you to take this seriously. These tests are important. If you have any trouble scheduling appointments, you can call my office. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Even though… even though it’s a lot. I appreciate you… trying to help. It’s just… a lot to take in. I think I’ll just go now. Thank you. .
