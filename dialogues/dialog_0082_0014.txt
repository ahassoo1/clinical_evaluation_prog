DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... well, my wife, bless her heart, she said I needed to come in. Something about… papers? For time off, or something like that. I’m not quite sure, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s about… work, I think. Religious work, that is.
DOCTOR: Religious work, alright. That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Limtiaco. No need to worry about specifics right away. So, it sounds like you’re here for documentation related to some time off from your religious duties?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Time off… or maybe I can’t do the work right now. Something’s… changed. It’s hard to explain. My wife handles most of the paperwork, you see. She said something about FMLA… does that ring a bell? I just… need whatever papers I need to give to them, so things don’t get too complicated.
DOCTOR: FMLA… Family and Medical Leave Act. Yes, that makes sense. It sounds like you’re wanting to explore a leave of absence from your religious work. To get started, could you tell me a little bit about why you might need this leave?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s the tricky part, isn’t it? It’s… well, I’ve been feeling… not myself lately. A bit tired, mostly. And things just aren’t as clear as they used to be. It makes it hard to… lead services, or even just remember what I want to say. I don’t know why it’s happening, to be honest. It just… is. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I suppose. My wife worries, naturally. She says I shouldn’t be pushing myself so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some difficulty with clarity… and it’s been worsening over the past few months. Has this difficulty with clarity affected other areas of your life, besides leading services?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I sometimes forget where I put things. Keys, mostly. And names… names escape me sometimes. Nothing major, you understand. Just… little things. My wife reminds me of things all the time. She’s very patient. And I get… a little confused sometimes. Not lost, exactly, but… disoriented. It’s hard to explain. It’s like… a fog rolling in. It doesn't happen all the time, thankfully. But it's more frequent now than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory difficulties, and a feeling of occasional disorientation. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or sleep?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I don’t think so. I still enjoy my meals, blessedly. My wife makes a wonderful poisson cru, you know. Sleep… that’s a little trickier. I can sleep, but I wake up a lot during the night. Just… restless. I’ll get up and read for a bit, then try to go back to sleep. It doesn’t always work. Not a big problem, but it does leave me feeling tired, of course. Mostly just a little… unsettled when I wake up. Hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Okay, restless sleep with frequent awakenings. Have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… not really. I get a little tension sometimes, but nothing a good rest doesn't fix. Dizziness… now that you mention it, yes, a little bit. Not often, but… when I stand up too quickly, sometimes the room spins for a moment. It passes quickly, though. Vision… hmm. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was fine then. I haven’t noticed anything drastically different, but things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, perhaps. Just… old age, I suppose. I'm 67, after all.
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s… a bit of a blur, to be honest. I've seen doctors over the years, of course. Regular checkups, you know. Nothing major until recently. I had my prostate checked a few years back, everything was fine then. And I had a little bout of the flu a couple of winters ago, but nothing serious. Honestly, my wife keeps better track of all that than I do. She handles the appointments, the medications… everything. I just try to stay active and eat well. I wish I could be more specific, but my memory… it just doesn’t hold onto those details. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. We can certainly work with that. It's common for patients to not remember every detail of their medical history. Do you happen to know if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always double-checks before I take any new medication, bless her heart. She’s very careful. I can’t think of anything specific I’m allergic to, no. Nothing at all. I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow, to be honest. But again, my wife is the one who really keeps track of these things. She’s very thorough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m going to quickly check your electronic health record to see what information we have on file. Just one moment. It looks like you have been seen a few times for routine checkups, as you mentioned. The last one was about a year ago. It doesn’t look like there’s anything significant noted. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you’re willing. Just to check your vital signs and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam… alright. Just let me know what you need me to do. I hope I don’t make too much trouble for you. My balance isn’t what it used to be, as I mentioned. But I’ll do my best. Just take it easy on an old man, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. We’ll take it slow and easy. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85, and your pulse is 72. That's a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear, good air entry bilaterally. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Finally, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. I’ll ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Questions, alright. I suppose that’s alright. I hope I don’t do too badly. My mind… it's a bit foggy these days, as I’ve explained. But I’ll try my best. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready… I think. Just be patient with me, alright? I might need a little extra time to think.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Limtiaco. Take all the time you need. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today’s date… let me see… it’s… August, isn't it? Yes, August. The second… the second of… 2024? No… 2025? Yes, I believe it’s August 2nd, 2025. I think. It's hard to keep track, you see. My wife usually reminds me.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we… Oh! We're in the doctor's office, aren't we? Your office. Yes, I remember now. It's a nice office. Clean and bright. I think it's in… the city? I’m not very good with directions, you see. My wife usually drives me here. She knows where everything is. It's… a medical clinic, somewhere in town. That's about all I can tell you, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me. I’ll say them, and then I’ll ask you to remember them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. I think I remember them. It’s a bit like a game, isn’t it? Hopefully, I won’t forget them. My mind… it wanders sometimes, you see. But I’ll try my best to hold onto them. Apple, table, penny. I’m repeating them to myself… Apple, table, penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. First, what year is the Declaration of Independence signed?
PATIENT: The Declaration of Independence… Hmm. That’s a… a long time ago, isn’t it? I’m not very good with dates, you see. It was… sometime in the 1700s, I believe. Was it 1776? Or maybe 1788? I’m really not sure. I’m afraid my history isn't very good. It was a long, long time ago, that’s all I know. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem. Now, can you tell me who is the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: The current president… Hmm. That’s… that’s a difficult one. Is it still… Mr. Biden? Yes, I think it’s Mr. Biden. He’s been on television a lot lately. But I’m not always sure. Things change so quickly, you see. It’s hard to keep track. Yes, I believe it's Mr. Biden. But please, don’t rely on me for accurate information! My wife keeps me updated on current events. She's much better informed than I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s return to those three words I asked you to remember earlier. Can you tell me what those three words were?
PATIENT: Three words… three words… Oh dear. It’s gone. It slipped my mind completely. I… I can’t remember them. I’m so sorry. I was concentrating so hard just a moment ago, and now… it’s just a blank. I really wish I could remember them. It's frustrating, you see. Apple… table… something… It's right on the tip of my tongue… but I can’t quite grasp it. I’m afraid my memory is just not what it used to be. I apologize. I really do.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's not a test, and these types of things are very common with age. Based on the history you’ve provided and the findings of the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including memory loss and some confusion. The cognitive assessment results support this observation. While these symptoms can be caused by a variety of factors, including normal aging, it's important to investigate further to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They can perform more in-depth testing and provide a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. What do you think about that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’ve been feeling… not myself lately, and it’s good to have a better understanding of what’s going on. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. My wife already does so much for me. But if it’s important, then I’ll go see a specialist. I just hope it’s nothing too serious. What kind of testing would they do? And will it be expensive? My insurance… it can be complicated sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. We'll take it one step at a time. A neurologist will likely perform a more detailed neurological exam, including assessments of your reflexes, coordination, and balance. They may also order some imaging tests, such as an MRI or CT scan of your brain, to look for any structural abnormalities. They might also order blood tests to rule out any vitamin deficiencies or other medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. As for the cost, I'll have my staff check your insurance coverage and provide you with an estimate before you schedule the appointment. They can also help you navigate any potential financial concerns. In the meantime, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help improve your cognitive function. Things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and staying mentally active can all be beneficial. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… helpful. Checking my insurance and discussing lifestyle changes… that’s good. I’m happy to hear about things I can do myself. I do enjoy a good walk, when the weather is nice. And my wife makes sure I eat my vegetables. She’s very good at taking care of me. I’m willing to try anything that might help. What kind of mental exercises would you recommend? I used to enjoy reading, but it’s getting harder to concentrate these days. Is there anything else I should be doing?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Limtiaco. Staying active and engaged is a great start. For mental exercises, things like puzzles, crosswords, Sudoku, or even learning a new skill can be beneficial. Engaging in social activities and staying connected with friends and family is also very important. Even simple things like having regular conversations and reminiscing about past experiences can help keep your mind sharp. Since reading is becoming more difficult, perhaps audiobooks could be a good alternative. And if you enjoy music, listening to your favorite tunes and singing along can also be a great way to stimulate your brain. It’s important to find activities that you enjoy and that challenge you mentally. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss the results of the neurological evaluation and to monitor your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll let my wife handle scheduling the appointment with the neurologist. She’s much better at these things than I am. Thank you again for everything.
