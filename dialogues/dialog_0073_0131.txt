DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Korrell. It’s Ms. Sladen, actually, but that’s alright. I’m here ‘cause the nurse said my blood pressure was a little high when I was getting weighed and everything. She said I should come in and talk to you about it. It's been a bit up and down, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, Ms. Sladen. Blood pressure. “A bit up and down,” you say. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really feel different, if that makes sense. But when I went to get my flu shot last year, the nurse mentioned it was a little high then too. And sometimes when I'm at the pharmacy getting stuff, they check it, and it’s been… not perfect. I don't check it myself at home or anything. I just kinda go with what they tell me. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Sladen. It sounds like it's been monitored sporadically, and occasionally noted as being elevated. We need to get a better handle on what's happening. Do you have any idea what your numbers were on those occasions – at the flu shot, or the pharmacy?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, no, not a clue. They just said it was “a little high” or “borderline” or something like that. I’m terrible with remembering numbers, honestly. I wish I could tell you! I didn’t really think much of it at the time, y'know? Just figured it was nerves or something.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's not terribly helpful. We'll need to get some baseline readings today, then. And we'll want to explore some other factors. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My mother, she had high blood pressure towards the end of her life, yeah. She was on some medication for it, I remember that much. And my grandfather on my father’s side…he had a heart attack, but that was a long time ago. He smoked, if that makes a difference. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Family history is important. And smoking is definitely a factor. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or do a lot of exercise?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but nothing heavy. And… exercise… Well, that’s where things get tricky. I try to walk when I can, but honestly, with work and everything, it’s not as much as I’d like. It’s more like… short walks, a few times a week. Nothing serious. Mostly I’m on my feet all day at work, if that counts.
DOCTOR: On your feet all day, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I work with a home healthcare agency. Mostly helping folks with daily stuff – getting dressed, making meals, light cleaning, that kinda thing. Lots of walking around other people’s houses, you know? It's physical, for sure, but it’s not like hitting the gym or anything! More like… constantly moving, than proper exercise. Does that make a difference? I’m not sure what counts as exercise, really.
DOCTOR: It can, Ms. Sladen. It's good to be active, but structured exercise is often more beneficial. Alright. Let's take some vitals and do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, then we'll talk about some potential next steps. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything the doctor’s given me before. I mean, I take a little something for my arthritis sometimes, but that’s it. Nothing serious. You can check my record, I'm pretty sure it’s all there. Let's get this over with, I'm ready!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your overall condition. Then we'll get some more specific numbers. Your blood pressure is currently 148 over 92. Pulse is 78. A little elevated, as the nurse indicated. I’m listening to your heart now… sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. My feet were a little sore yesterday after being on them all day, but no swelling or anything like that. Sometimes they ache a bit, but that's just from work, I think. It's just my arthritis acting up sometimes, you know? This is all starting to feel a bit serious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: No swelling. Okay. Your arthritis could contribute to some of the foot discomfort, yes. We’ll need to explore everything. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax. Sounds normal. No tenderness. Are you experiencing any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I think I've stayed pretty much the same weight for the last year or so. Maybe a pound or two up or down, but nothing significant. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Nothing fancy, mostly just what's easy and convenient, to be honest. It's hard to eat healthy when you're running around all day. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant weight changes. We've covered quite a bit already. Given your blood pressure readings, family history, and the fact that it’s been intermittently elevated, I'd like to run some blood work and get an EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. It's standard procedure, Ms. Sladen, just to be thorough. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… sensible, I guess. If it’ll help figure out what’s going on, then sure. Blood work and… what was it? An EKG? Is that the one with the sticky things? It doesn't sound very pleasant, but if you think it's best, then let's do it. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the one with the sticky things. It's painless, Ms. Sladen, just a little uncomfortable. The blood work will just be a standard panel to check your kidney function, cholesterol, and a few other things. I'll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab downstairs. They'll take care of everything. I’ll need you to fast for 12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks except water. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Twelve hours! Oh, goodness. That's a long time to go without eating. I usually have a little something in the morning before work. And… water only? Not even coffee? Okay, okay. I can do it. I'll just… I guess I'll have to plan around it. And the lab is downstairs, you said? That's good, at least it's convenient. Will they tell me the results, or do I come back to you? I'm already feeling a bit lightheaded just thinking about skipping breakfast!
DOCTOR: No coffee, I’m afraid. It can skew the results. They’ll give you instructions, but the results will be sent to me, and I’ll contact you when I have them – usually within a few days. I will review them and call you with the next steps. I understand it’s inconvenient, Ms. Sladen, but it’s important to get a clear picture of what's happening. In the meantime, I recommend a low-sodium diet, and try to incorporate some regular, moderate exercise if possible. Start slowly, just a little bit each day. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Low sodium, okay. I think I can manage that. I don’t really add much salt to my food anyway. And I'll try the exercise… maybe just walking a little further each day. It all sounds a bit…daunting, honestly. But if it'll help, I'll do it. So, I just go downstairs to the lab whenever I'm ready, after not eating for twelve hours? And you'll call me with the results? Is there anything else I need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. Go to the lab downstairs whenever you’ve fasted for 12 hours. They’ll take care of the blood work, and I will call you with the results. I will also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results and create a more comprehensive plan. We'll review the blood work and discuss any lifestyle adjustments you may need to make. For now, try not to stress too much, Ms. Sladen. We’re just gathering information. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Korrell. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll go downstairs and get the blood work done, and I'll look forward to hearing from you. It's a little scary, but I’m glad we're figuring things out. I guess I'll see you in two weeks then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Sladen. You’ll receive a call from my office to schedule your follow-up appointment. Try to rest and take care of yourself. Have a good day. .
