DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble, you see. It’s hard to… to go. Like I have to push, and it takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t even… complete. It’s been going on for maybe a week now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Difficulty with urination – needing to strain, taking a long time, and feeling like you don’t empty your bladder completely. And you said this has been happening for about a week?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week, maybe a little longer. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, you know how it is. It’s not painful, exactly, just… frustrating. And I’m going more often, too. Not much each time, but more times in the day. It's a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, frustrating and more frequent urination, but not a large amount each time, and no pain. That’s helpful to know. Let’s try to get a bit more detail. When you do go, do you feel like you’re able to start the stream easily, or do you have to wait a bit?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. It takes a moment. Not a long moment, but not instant, either. I have to… think about it, I guess. And then push a little. It’s not like a strong, steady stream right away, it’s more… starts and stops. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, a delay in starting, needing to push, and then a stream that’s not continuous—starts and stops. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine, or any blood?
PATIENT: No, no blood. The color seems normal, as normal as it gets, you know? It's not dark or cloudy or anything like that. Just… yellow. I always drink plenty of water, so it's usually pretty pale yellow. I can’t say I've really looked closely, to be honest, but I haven’t noticed anything different.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No change in color, and you stay well hydrated, which is good. Now, have you been having any fever, chills, or lower back pain with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. My back… well, I have a little ache sometimes, but I’m an older woman, Doctor! I think that’s just age. It's not a new pain, it’s just my usual back grumbles. It doesn’t feel connected to the… waterworks problem, if you understand what I mean. It's just there.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s helpful to know that’s a pre-existing ache. Alright, Ms. Yadao. I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not diabetes. I've had the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, they told me years ago, but I take my pills, and it's usually alright. Had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major, really. And I get my yearly checkups, you know. Well, usually yearly. I missed one last year because of the… well, you know. Everything going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and gallbladder removal years ago. You do generally keep up with checkups, which is great. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me think… just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. When it’s acting up. It’s nothing regular, though. I only take it when my joints are really bothering me. And sometimes I take a little something for sleep, but that's just when I can’t get to sleep, you know? It’s not every night. I can write it all down for you if you’d like? I always keep a list.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Here we are. The blood pressure one is Lisinopril, I think it's called. And for the arthritis, it's Naproxen. I only take it when needed, as I said. And the sleep one is… Melatonin, I believe. It's just a small dose. And allergies… no, I don't think so. I haven’t had any reactions to anything. I eat everything, I’m Lithuanian, you know! We eat a lot of things. No allergies to food or medicine that I’m aware of. Though, I do get a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat something spicy. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn’t an allergy. Okay, Lisinopril, Naproxen as needed, and Melatonin. No known allergies. That’s very good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your history, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes! When I was younger, I had a hysterectomy. A long time ago now, maybe fifty years? Something like that. And… I think that's it. Just the gallbladder and the hysterectomy. I don't remember having any other surgeries. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I think that's everything. Is that alright with you, Doctor? The exam, I mean? I’m not afraid, but I do get a little cold easily.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Hysterectomy long ago, and gallbladder removal. And it’s perfectly fine if you feel cold – we can use a blanket if you need one. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a quick pelvic exam to check for any tenderness or other issues. It won't take long. Would you like to use the restroom before we start?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very thoughtful of you, Doctor. I think I will use the restroom, if you don't mind. It’s probably best, you know. Just to be sure. Where is it?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s right down the hall, first door on the left. I'll be right here when you're finished. Take your time.
