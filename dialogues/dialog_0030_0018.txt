DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Westly. It’s… a pleasure to meet you too, I suppose. Now, let me see… I’m here about… well, I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot, actually. More than usual, you understand. It’s been… a bit bothersome. I can’t quite recall when it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Westly. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the exact timeframe. We'll figure it out together. So, you’re experiencing increased urinary frequency – going to the bathroom more often than usual. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sums it up nicely – increased frequency. It’s… all day, really. Not just at night, though that’s been a bit more noticeable lately as well. I find myself… waking up to go. And during the day, I’m constantly aware of needing to… well, you understand. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… frequent. And a good quantity, each time, if you follow. It’s not a trickle, certainly.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's increased frequency both day and night, with a good volume each time, and no pain. That’s helpful to know. Are you experiencing any urgency – a sudden, strong need to urinate?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think. Sometimes, yes, I suppose. It’s not always a sudden urge, but there are moments… when I realize I need to go, rather quickly. Not a desperate, clutching sort of thing, but… a firm reminder, shall we say? It’s not constant, though. More… sporadic. It’s difficult to explain precisely.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, you’re explaining it perfectly well. Sporadic urgency is good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… urine? That's… another good question. I haven’t been paying that close attention, I must admit. It appears… normal, as far as I can tell. The usual color, I suppose. Not cloudy, certainly. And no… blood, I don’t think. I haven’t noticed anything alarming, if that’s what you mean. It’s all a bit… vague, truthfully. I'm sorry I can't be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing just fine, Westly. It's very common to not be specifically looking for changes in urine. Just trying to gather as much information as possible. Let’s move on to other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… no, I haven’t. Not recently, anyway. And abdominal pain… no, not really. Perhaps a little… discomfort, sometimes, but nothing I’d call pain. More of a… dull ache, occasionally, low down. But it comes and goes, and it’s not severe. It’s not keeping me up at night, or anything like that. Just… present, from time to time. I believe that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, chills, or significant abdominal pain, just occasional mild discomfort. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have a history of diabetes, prostate problems, or any urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… yes. Let me see… Diabetes… I don't believe so, no. The doctor checked me years ago, and everything was… fine. Prostate problems… I’m a single man, you understand, and haven't had any… issues in that regard, thankfully. Urinary tract infections… now that… I believe I had one, perhaps, a long time ago. Years and years ago. It was quite unpleasant, I remember. But I don’t recall ever being treated for it repeatedly. It was a single incident, I think. Honestly, the details are… hazy.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known diabetes or prostate problems, and a possible single UTI in the distant past. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, many decades ago. A simple procedure, as I recall. And… I was hospitalized for a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, during a particularly cold winter. It wasn’t severe, thankfully. I recovered fully, though it was… unpleasant for a time. Other than that… I can’t recall any major surgeries or hospitalizations. My health has been… generally good, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a bout of pneumonia. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, let me see. I take a small dose of lisinopril, for my blood pressure. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And… I occasionally take ibuprofen for aches and pains, if needed. Nothing regular, just when I have a particularly bothersome… ache. And… no supplements, no. I don’t really believe in those sorts of things. That’s all, I think. Just the lisinopril and occasional ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a serious reaction to any medication, thankfully. No food allergies either. I used to have a bit of a sniffle when around cats, but that was years ago, and I haven’t been around one in quite some time. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, no. I’m quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I’m retired now, you see. Used to be an environmental engineer, quite busy, traveling a lot. Now I mostly enjoy reading, tending to my small garden, and taking leisurely walks. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol very occasionally – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion. I wouldn’t say I exercise rigorously, but I try to stay active. I eat a reasonably healthy diet, mostly vegetables and lean protein. It’s… a quiet life, but I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Westly, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief abdominal exam. Then I will perform a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, of course. That sounds… reasonable. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… all quite standard, I suppose. However… A… digital rectal exam? That sounds… rather intrusive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I… I’m not particularly comfortable with that, if I’m honest. Could we perhaps explore other options first? I'm not sure I understand why that's required, given my description of my symptoms.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Westly, and I apologize for not explaining the necessity more clearly. Given your age and symptoms – increased urinary frequency, especially at night, and the occasional lower abdominal discomfort – a digital rectal exam is an important step to assess your prostate. The prostate can enlarge with age, putting pressure on the bladder and causing these symptoms. It also allows me to check for any abnormalities. I want to assure you that it’s a quick procedure, and I will do everything I can to make you feel as comfortable as possible. However, it's a standard part of evaluating these symptoms and helps us determine the best course of action. If you are still strongly opposed to it, we can proceed with initial testing, such as a urine analysis and a PSA blood test to screen for prostate issues. However, this may lead to further investigation, potentially including the exam at a later time. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A PSA blood test… that sounds… less invasive, certainly. And a urine analysis as well. Perhaps if those results are… inconclusive, we can revisit the other option? I truly am… uncomfortable with the idea, Doctor. It’s not a matter of distrust, you understand. It’s simply… a personal aversion. If we can gather some initial data without resorting to that… I would be most grateful. I appreciate you explaining it so thoroughly, though. It’s reassuring to know you’ve considered my concerns.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Westly. Your comfort is my priority. We can absolutely start with a urine analysis and a PSA blood test. That’s a very reasonable approach. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood for the PSA test right away. And we’ll collect a urine sample here in the office. It’s best to provide a “first morning void” – that is, the first urine you pass in the morning. Once we have those results, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… excellent, Doctor. A urine sample and a blood test. I can manage that. First morning void, you say? Yes, I can remember that. Thank you for accommodating my… hesitations. I feel much more comfortable with this plan. Shall we proceed with the urine sample now, or…?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Westly. We can collect the urine sample now. I’ll provide you with a private restroom. Just collect a few ounces in this cup, and then bring it back to me. I’ll have my assistant bring it to the lab. There’s a restroom just down the hall to your right. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Down the hall to the right, you say? Very well. I shall return presently.
DOCTOR:
