DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Popova, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Aldine Popova. But everyone calls me Aldine. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor... Sink, is it? You’re Kristinia, right? I remember seeing the name on the door.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Sink. And please, let’s try to be concise. My schedule is… quite full. Now, Aldine, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, dear. Didn't mean to ramble! It’s this headache, see? Right at the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not awful, but… persistent, you know? Like a dull ache, always there. It doesn’t come and go much.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. For how many days exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Started… maybe last Tuesday? So, that makes it… five days now, I reckon. Yes, five days. Started kinda slow, just a little niggle, then built up to this steady ache. It's not throbbing, just… there. Like someone’s tightened a band around my head, at the very back.
DOCTOR: And is anything making it worse?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' specifically. It doesn’t get worse when I move, or when I’m lookin’ at the light, or anythin’ like that. It's the same most of the time. Though… maybe a little worse when I'm bendin' over, doin' nails, you know? But that could just be the position, I suppose. It's hard to say. I do a lot of detailed work, so I’m always lookin’ down.
DOCTOR: You do nails?
PATIENT: Yes, dear! Been a manicurist and pedicurist for… goodness, nearly sixty years now! Still enjoy it, keeps my hands nimble. Run a little shop downtown. Always busy, especially with tourists. Though, I'm gettin' a bit old for bendin' over all day, to be honest. But this headache… it’s startin’ to make it harder.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No dizziness, no blurry vision. No fever, not that I’ve noticed. And definitely no stiff neck, I can turn my head just fine. No nausea or vomitin’ either. Just… the headache. It’s a bit of a bother, though. Sometimes it makes it hard to concentrate when I’m doin’ a nice French manicure, you know? Gotta be precise!
DOCTOR: Any changes in appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is still good! I love my food, always have. My wife, Beatrice, she's a wonderful cook. Keeps me well fed, that woman. As for weight...well, I've always been a slim fella. Maybe lost a pound or two, but nothing significant. I'm thinkin' it's just age, you know? Things shift a little as you get older. Still, I eat plenty. Beatrice wouldn't allow it any other way!
DOCTOR: Right. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, dear, I don't. Never really been one for pills. I believe in lettin' nature take its course, mostly. A little rest, a good meal, and Beatrice's remedies. She makes a lovely ginger tea for colds, that’s about it. I haven’t taken anything for this headache, just tried to ignore it, hopin' it would go away. But it hasn’t, you see. It’s just… there. Still, I don’t take anythin’ regularly. Never have.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years, travelled a bit, and never had a reaction. Beatrice always checks labels, though, just to be sure. She's very cautious, that woman. She worries about me, you see. But no, no allergies. I can eat peanuts, shellfish, everything. Never had a problem. I'm a pretty simple man, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick examination, then. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'm going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll do a brief neurological exam.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Sounds good. Whatever you think is best. Just a little slow, these old bones don’t move like they used to! Lead the way, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Hope it doesn't take too long, Beatrice is expectin' me for tea. She makes a lovely Earl Grey.
DOCTOR: Please lie down. I'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Here I go. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. Old habits die hard, I always like to know what's happenin'! Hope this cuff isn't too tight, my arms are a bit… thin, you see.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Not bad. Heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Relaxed as I can be. I’ve always been a bit of a nervous fella, but I'm tryin' to stay calm. Just tell me what you need me to do. Hopefully, these old reflexes are still workin'!
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, but present. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Any facial weakness?
PATIENT: No, dear, nothing at all. I can smile just fine. And I can frown too. Never had any trouble with my face, always been able to express myself. Beatrice says I'm a bit of a character, you see! I can raise my eyebrows too, if you like. Is that what you’re lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Everything appears… normal. Given your age, some diminished reflexes are not unexpected. The headache is the concerning symptom. It's likely a tension headache, given the lack of other neurological symptoms. However, given your age, we should rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a CT scan of your head, just to be safe.
PATIENT: A CT scan, you say? Oh dear. Is that… is that serious, Doctor? I've never had one of those before. Not feelin’ too keen on radiation, if you don’t mind me sayin’. Is it really necessary? I mean, it’s just a headache, isn't it? Maybe it’ll just go away on its own. I’d rather not, if I'm honest. Beatrice wouldn't be too pleased either. She worries so. What exactly are we lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, I understand your concerns. It is likely a simple tension headache. However, at your age, it’s important to rule out other, more serious causes. A CT scan will allow us to visualize your brain and identify any potential issues, such as a bleed or a tumor. It's a precautionary measure, and the radiation exposure is minimal. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We need to rule out anything serious before assuming it's just a headache. I can explain the procedure in more detail, if you'd like. It’s painless, but you will need to lie still for a short period of time.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. If you think it’s necessary, then I suppose so. Better safe than sorry, you said. Just… promise me it won’t take too long. And that the radiation isn't much. Beatrice will be worried sick if I'm gone for too long. And tell me exactly what I need to do. Lie still, you said? Can I listen to the radio? I like a bit of calypso to calm my nerves. And… will I need someone to drive me home? I usually let Beatrice do the drivin’.
DOCTOR: The scan itself takes about 15-20 minutes. The radiation exposure is very low—less than what you receive on a cross-country flight. You won’t need to do anything special, just lie still. You can listen to the radio. And yes, you will need someone to drive you home. The sedative we administer to keep you still will impair your ability to drive. I’ll write you a prescription for the sedative. And I’ll give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan. I'll also give you the number of the radiology department. You’ll need to schedule the appointment yourself. It's best to do it as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, right. Questions. A sedative… hmm. Will it make me feel… groggy? Beatrice is makin' Earl Grey for tea, you know. I wouldn't want to spoil it. And... can I eat before the scan? I usually have a little biscuit with my tea. And… what if they find somethin' serious? What happens then? It's just… a bit overwhelmin', all of a sudden. I was just hopin' for a bit of advice about a headache, and now… all this.
DOCTOR: The sedative will make you feel drowsy, but not completely incapacitated. You'll be able to drink tea, but it’s best to avoid a large meal beforehand. A small biscuit is fine. As for finding something serious… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. That’s why we’re doing the scan, to rule things out. If anything is found, we’ll discuss the next steps in detail. Mr. Popova, I understand your anxiety. It’s natural to be worried. But right now, we need to gather information. The scan will give us that information. I’m going to write you a referral to a neurologist, just in case. It’s better to have a specialist involved from the beginning. Do you have any questions about the referral?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is this headache worse than you thought? I mean, it's just a headache, isn't it? I've had headaches before, nothin' a bit of ginger tea couldn't fix. And a bit of Beatrice's fussin'. Is it somethin' they can fix? Or… I don't want to be a bother, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. This is all a bit much, you know. All these tests, all these specialists. I just want to enjoy my tea with Beatrice. Can we just… wait and see? Maybe it'll just go away on its own? I really don't want to put Beatrice through all this worry.
DOCTOR: Mr. Popova, with all due respect, you are an 87-year-old male. It is my professional responsibility to rule out serious pathology, regardless of your desire to simply “wait and see.” A headache in someone your age requires investigation. Frankly, I’m surprised you haven’t sought medical attention sooner. The neurologist will assess your condition and determine the best course of action. The scan is standard procedure. I will not compromise your health simply to avoid causing your wife “worry.” I’m providing you with the referral and the scan order. It’s your decision whether or not to follow through. But I strongly advise you to do so. Do you have any further questions, or shall we consider this consultation closed?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. No, dear. I… I suppose not. You’re right, of course. You’re the doctor. Just… thank you. For tryin’. I’ll… I’ll schedule the scan. And see the neurologist. Tell Beatrice… tell her I'll be a bit late for tea. .
