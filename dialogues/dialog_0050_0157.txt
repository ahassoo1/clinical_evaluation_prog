DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the nurse said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. It's not that bad.
DOCTOR: “Not that bad,” you say. Well, Ms. Dudney, while you may feel perfectly fine, consistently elevated blood pressure – even if it doesn’t present with overt symptoms – is quite concerning. It places a significant strain on your cardiovascular system. The nurse provided me with some initial readings, but I’d like to get a more thorough understanding. To begin, can you tell me when you were first informed of having high blood pressure?
PATIENT: About six months ago, I guess. My husband made me go to a check-up. He worries too much. It was just one high reading, probably the coffee. I drink a lot of coffee.
DOCTOR: “Just one high reading…” Right. And has a physician followed up with you regarding this initial finding?
PATIENT: No. I just... kept going to work. I don't have time for doctor appointments. I told my husband it was nothing and he dropped it. He's usually pretty good about letting things go if I say so. Besides, I feel fine. Really.
DOCTOR: "Feel fine" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Dudney. And dismissing a potential health issue simply because you are currently asymptomatic is… frankly, unwise. To clarify, have you had any other blood pressure checks since that initial appointment six months ago?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, I work. I don't sit around getting checked for things that aren’t bothering me. Is this going to take long? I have a site inspection this afternoon.
DOCTOR: We will be as efficient as possible, Ms. Dudney. However, a proper assessment is paramount. Before we proceed with a physical examination, I need to gather a more complete medical history. Let's begin with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I eat okay, I guess. My grandma lived to be ninety, so genetics are good. I don’t see what the problem is. Are you going to poke me with a lot of needles?
DOCTOR: Your grandmother’s longevity is…encouraging, but does not negate the potential risks associated with hypertension. And yes, there may be some bloodwork involved. It's standard procedure. Now, regarding medications…are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And ibuprofen when my back hurts from bending over blueprints all day. That's it. Honestly, this feels like a waste of time. I'm a perfectly healthy person.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, with all due respect, “feeling” healthy and being healthy are not necessarily synonymous. Ibuprofen use, even intermittently, can sometimes impact blood pressure, and we need to account for all factors. Let's move on to your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, or high blood pressure in your immediate family – your parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: My dad had...something with his heart, I think. He smoked a lot. Died when I was pretty young. My mom was fine. Never sick a day in her life. She was Navajo, like me. Does that matter? I thought doctors didn’t ask about that sort of thing anymore.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Ms. Dudney. While it’s true that historical biases existed within medical practice, dismissing familial predispositions would be negligent. There are certain health conditions that are more prevalent within specific populations, and it's important to be aware of these factors. Your father’s history of heart issues is significant, regardless of the cause. Do you know what specifically he was diagnosed with?
PATIENT: No. I wasn't old enough to remember. My aunt took care of everything when he passed. She didn’t talk about it much. Look, I really need to get going. Is there anything I need to do or are you just going to ask questions all day? I have work to do. And honestly, I'm not seeing what this has to do with anything. I build things. I don’t sit around worrying about numbers.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand you are busy, but I am attempting to gather information vital to your well-being. Dismissing a potentially serious condition based on a subjective feeling of health and a desire to return to work is…concerning, to say the least. Before we proceed further, I need to conduct a basic physical examination – blood pressure check, heart and lung sounds, and a brief neurological assessment. This will take approximately fifteen minutes. If you absolutely refuse, I will document your refusal in your chart, but I strongly advise against it. Do you consent to a basic physical examination?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Fifteen minutes, you said? Don’t take any longer. I have a schedule.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat and remove your left arm from your sleeve. Your blood pressure is 162 over 98. Elevated, as the nurse indicated. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear. Reflexes are normal. No obvious neurological deficits. Now, I would like to briefly review your social history. Do you smoke, consume alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I drink coffee, like I said. And sometimes a soda with lunch. I don't need bad habits adding to whatever you think is wrong with me. I need to be sharp for work. Building things requires focus. I’m a very responsible person.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes, I gather. However, even moderate caffeine intake can contribute to elevated blood pressure. To complete the assessment, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. Look, are we done yet? This is getting ridiculous. I build bridges, I don’t get sick. I really need to go. I’m wasting valuable time here. Is there something seriously wrong with me, or are you just trying to find something to bill my insurance for?
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, your line of questioning is inappropriate and frankly, unproductive. I am attempting to provide you with competent medical care, not generate billing revenue. Based on the information gathered, your blood pressure is consistently elevated, despite your subjective feeling of well-being. This requires further investigation. I recommend a complete blood panel, a lipid profile, and an electrocardiogram to assess your cardiovascular health. We also need to rule out any secondary causes of hypertension, such as kidney disease or thyroid issues. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever tests you need to do. Just get it over with so I can leave. But I'm telling you now, it's going to be normal. Perfectly normal. I don't have time for this. Just tell me where to go and let's get this over with. I have a site inspection, and my crew is waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. They will draw blood for the complete blood panel and lipid profile. Then, the EKG technician, Sarah, is in room three. She will perform the electrocardiogram. Once the results are available – typically within 24 to 48 hours – we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan, if necessary. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home with an over-the-counter monitor. And I recommend reducing your caffeine intake. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. None at all. Just tell me where to find Sarah. And make it quick. I really, really need to go. .
DOCTOR: Room three. Sarah will be expecting you. And Ms. Dudney… please take this matter seriously. Ignoring potential health issues rarely leads to a positive outcome. .
