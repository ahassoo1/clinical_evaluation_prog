DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A confirmation that I’m able to fly. It's for… travel arrangements, a bit complicated, but that's the long and short of it. I’d like to get it sorted as quickly as possible, if we could.
DOCTOR: Alright, a letter of medical fitness to fly. Certainly. I can definitely help with that. Just to be clear, is this for a specific airline or do they not require anything particular?
PATIENT: No, it’s not for a specific airline. It’s… a private trip. They just need a letter from a doctor stating I’m cleared for travel, no specific requirements beyond that, as far as I know. It's for my sister; she wants to be absolutely certain before I go. She worries.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of her. We want to make sure everyone feels comfortable. To write this letter, I’ll need to get a little bit of your medical history first, just to be thorough. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was… my husband, he passed away last year. A heart condition. I had a check-up after, everything was normal then, but… honestly, I haven't been back to a doctor since. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I take a daily vitamin. Is that enough information? I'm happy to provide more detail if you need it. I remember things very clearly, if that helps.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it's good you had a check-up after. “Usual aches and pains” are common, certainly. Just to be precise, can you tell me a little more about those aches and pains?
PATIENT: Thank you. It was… a shock. The aches and pains? Mostly just my knees, they bother me a bit when it’s cold or I’ve been on my feet all day. And sometimes my back, especially if I lift something heavy. Nothing debilitating, really. I just take ibuprofen now and then. It’s probably just age, or the stress of everything, to be honest. I don't recall any specific injuries that caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back pain, relieved by ibuprofen. And you haven’t experienced any specific injuries to either?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Nothing like that. Just… gradually started aching a few years ago. It comes and goes. I haven’t had any issues that needed treatment beyond the ibuprofen, if that makes sense. No swelling, no redness, nothing like that. It’s just… discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And just to cover all bases, are you currently experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I feel… tired sometimes, but that's just life, isn’t it? No fever, no chills, no sweating at night. My weight has been… stable, I suppose. A little heavier since my husband passed, if I'm honest, but nothing concerning. No sudden changes. I eat reasonably well, I think. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken antibiotics, pain relievers, you name it. I don't even have any seasonal allergies, surprisingly. I haven't needed an EpiPen or anything like that, ever. It's a boring answer, I know.
DOCTOR: Not boring at all! It’s very good to know. Now, just a few more questions to get a full picture. Do you currently take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the daily vitamin you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, just the one vitamin. Nothing else. I’ve always tried to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I eat a fairly healthy diet, so I don't really feel the need for a lot of supplements. Just the basic multivitamin to cover my bases, that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very straightforward. Now, a quick family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And her sister… my aunt… she had diabetes. My father was healthy as a horse, actually. Never sick a day in his life. And my husband’s side… his mother had arthritis, but that’s about it, I think. Nothing major. It’s a small family, so I don’t know a lot of detail. It's a bit hazy, if I'm honest, I mostly just remember my mother and father.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it won’t take too long, I have… arrangements to make. But yes, please, go ahead. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Let's get this letter sorted.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t be extensive. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure, and check your reflexes. Then we can discuss the letter. Please have a seat on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Everything sounds and feels normal so far. Do you have any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that's fine. Not a bit of pain. That all feels… normal. Good, good. I was worried it would be a whole ordeal. Thank you for being quick about it. I really appreciate it. Is this enough for the letter, do you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, I believe so. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, there’s no medical reason to prevent you from flying. I'm happy to write the letter confirming your fitness to fly. Just to be absolutely clear, and for my records, are you experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness at this moment?
PATIENT: No, absolutely none of those. I feel perfectly fine, actually. A little relieved, if I’m honest. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness. Just… normal. Thank you, Doctor. This is a great weight off my mind. Can I get a copy for myself? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll print two copies – one for you and one for my records. It will state that, based on your medical history and today's examination, you are medically cleared for air travel. Here you are. Please review it and let me know if there are any discrepancies. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Perfect. This is exactly what I needed. Thank you so much, Doctor Finco. You've been very helpful. No, I think that's all. Just… thank you. I appreciate your time and your efficiency.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. Have a safe and pleasant trip, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. .
