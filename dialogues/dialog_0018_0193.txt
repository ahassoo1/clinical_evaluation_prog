DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I am Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Stilaire. The pleasure is all mine. I am here because... well, it is a little embarrassing to talk about, but I have a lot of gas. More than usual. It started maybe two weeks ago, and it is... disruptive. It is not painful, just... a lot of it.
DOCTOR: I understand. There’s no need to be embarrassed, Mr. Goodstein. Digestive issues are quite common, and we can certainly explore what might be causing this. "Disruptive" is a good way to put it – it’s important to understand the impact it’s having on your life. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, it happens all the time. After I eat, usually. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Sometimes even when I haven’t eaten much. And... it smells. Very strong. I work at the burger place, you see, and... well, it is not a good combination. I try to... excuse myself, but sometimes it is too quick. It makes me a little anxious, if I am honest. I don’t want to bother the customers.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds quite distressing, and I appreciate your honesty about the anxiety it's causing. The fact that it's happening regardless of what you eat is certainly a key piece of information. To help me narrow down the possibilities, let's go through a few questions, if you don’t mind. First, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – diarrhea, constipation, or anything different than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, I can answer that. No, not really. Everything is… regular. Usually one time each day. Solid. Not soft, not hard. Just… normal. Always has been. I drink a lot of water, maybe that helps. I don't take anything for it, if that makes sense. No pills or anything like that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Goodstein. Maintaining regular bowel movements is positive. And it's helpful that you aren't taking any medications for it currently. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the gas – things like bloating, abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Let me think... bloating, yes, sometimes. Especially after I eat. It feels... full, you know? Like a balloon. Not painful, just uncomfortable. No nausea, no weight loss. My appetite is fine, I eat the same amount as always. I do get a little heartburn sometimes, but I thought that was just from the burger place. Lots of fried food, you see. Does that make sense? I have not noticed anything else, truly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Goodstein. The nature of your work could certainly contribute to occasional heartburn. The bloating alongside the gas is also helpful information. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I have only been to the doctor for checkups. The usual things. Blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but the doctor said it is okay, just watch the salt. And I had the flu once, a few years back. But nothing with my stomach, ever. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. My mother had some trouble with her gallbladder when she was older, but that was it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Knowing you haven’t been diagnosed with any prior digestive conditions and that your only medical concern is occasionally elevated blood pressure is important. And the family history of gallbladder issues with your mother is noted. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, absolutely not. I do not smoke. I do not drink alcohol. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I like to keep things… simple. I eat, I work, I sleep. Sometimes I watch television. It is not a very exciting life, but it is a good life. I try to get enough rest, but the work can be tiring. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: It does indeed, Mr. Goodstein. Thank you for being so open and honest with me. It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle overall. Now, before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I trust your judgment. If you think it will help, please go ahead. I don't feel any pain, but I am happy to let you examine me. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. I am a little nervous, but I understand it is important.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Goodstein. You are doing great. I will explain everything as I go. Breathe normally for me, please. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. It feels... normal. Like when the nurse took my blood pressure. No pain, no sharp feeling, just… pressure. You are very gentle. I appreciate that. It is a little strange, but not unpleasant. Are you finding anything? I hope it is not something serious.
DOCTOR: Good news, Mr. Goodstein. Your abdomen is soft, and I didn’t detect any tenderness, masses, or guarding. Your bowel sounds are present and within normal limits. This is reassuring. Based on everything you've told me and the physical exam, it seems unlikely that this is a sign of a serious underlying condition. However, given the persistence of the symptoms, I'd like to order a few simple tests to help us get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable with a stool sample to check for infection or inflammation and a blood test to rule out celiac disease and other potential causes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. If tests will help, I am happy to do them. A stool sample… that is not very glamorous, but I will manage. And a blood test is no problem at all. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, and I trust your judgment. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Goodstein. You're a very good patient. We’ll get those ordered right away. For the stool sample, the nurse will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. And for the blood test, we’ll just need a small sample taken here in the clinic. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend a trial of a low-FODMAP diet for two weeks. FODMAPs are certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest and contribute to gas and bloating. The nurse will provide you with a handout detailing the foods to avoid and those that are safe to eat. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, such as if you develop severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody stools, or weight loss, please contact the clinic immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A low-FODMAP diet… that sounds a little complicated, but I can try. I will ask the nurse to explain it to me again, if necessary. And I understand about contacting the clinic if things get worse. So, the stool sample, the blood test, and the diet. That is what I need to do. I think I can handle that. Thank you for your time and your help, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we are doing something to figure this out. It has been a little embarrassing, but you have been very kind and understanding.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It’s my pleasure to help, and please remember there’s no need to feel embarrassed – digestive issues are incredibly common. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and the nurse will come in shortly to provide you with the collection kit and the dietary handout. We will contact you with the results as soon as they become available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any other questions for me today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that is everything. You have answered all my questions and explained everything very clearly. I am very grateful for your help and your kindness. Thank you again. I will see you when the test results are back. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and we’ll be in touch soon. .
