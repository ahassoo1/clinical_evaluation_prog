DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It’s a… a squeezing feeling, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing feeling in your chest. That definitely warrants a look. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started maybe… three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I think. Yes, July 10th. My daughter, Isabella, was visiting, and I was helping her with the garden. Lots of bending and lifting. It didn't hurt then, exactly, but the next day… a little ache. It got worse after that, slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started gradually after some activity with your daughter on July 10th. And you describe it as a squeezing ache. Where exactly in your chest do you feel it?
PATIENT: Right here, Doctor. It's not on the sides, mostly right in the middle. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it goes up into my jaw a little. Not bad, just… a dull feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, center of the chest, below the breastbone, and occasionally radiating up into your jaw. Is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. It's not always there. When I'm resting, it’s usually okay. But if I walk too much, or… climb stairs, it comes back. And it gets worse if I get excited, you know? Like, if Isabella tells me good news! It's silly, but it does.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, that's good information. So it's brought on by exertion, like walking or stairs, and also with emotional excitement. How long does the pain usually last when it comes on?
PATIENT: Um… usually five, maybe ten minutes? It doesn't last a long time. I usually just sit down and take some deep breaths, and it goes away. But it scares me, Doctor. It feels… heavy. And I worry it will not go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion, and it’s good you're paying attention to this. Five to ten minutes with exertion or excitement, relieved by rest and deep breaths… Okay. Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… cold weather makes it a little worse, I think. Not much worse, but… yeah. And if I eat a big meal, especially something heavy, it feels tighter. Not right away, but a couple hours later. Isabella says I should eat more vegetables! She’s always telling me that.
DOCTOR: Daughters often do! Okay, so cold weather and heavy meals seem to be associated with it as well. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I get a little short of breath. Not like, really bad, but… I have to stop and catch my breath if I’m walking up a hill. And… my left arm feels a little… heavy sometimes, too. Not always, just… now and then. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion and some heaviness in your left arm occasionally. That’s helpful information. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, sweating, or dizziness with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. And I haven't felt dizzy. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a little sweaty, but that’s just because I get warm easily, you know? I always run warm. No, nothing like… really bad sweating. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill, but I didn’t like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. He was not happy! But I try to eat healthy, and I walk a lot. No diabetes, no. And I don’t think I have high cholesterol. I had a test a long time ago, and it was okay. Isabella always reminds me to go to the doctor, though. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but you stopped taking medication for it. And you haven't been formally diagnosed with diabetes or high cholesterol. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can eat anything. Isabella is very allergic to cats, but I love cats! She cannot visit if I have a cat. I used to have a cat named Coco… beautiful cat. But no, I don’t have any allergies. Never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Just… sometimes I take a little chamomile tea before bed if I’m feeling nervous. But that’s it. Isabella always tells me I should take a vitamin D supplement, but I haven’t gotten around to it. She buys me everything!
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just chamomile tea occasionally. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? It was okay, nothing bad. And when Isabella was born, I had to stay in the hospital for a few days. But that was a long time ago. No other surgeries, no. And I haven’t been in the hospital since Isabella was born. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about twenty years ago and hospitalization for Isabella’s birth. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – who has had heart problems, like heart attacks, strokes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes… my father had a heart attack when he was… oh, maybe seventy years old. He smoked a lot, you know? And my mother had high blood pressure, like me. She took pills for it her whole life. And my brother, he has high cholesterol. He takes a statin, I think it’s called. Yes, heart problems run in the family, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart attack in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and high cholesterol in your brother. Thank you, Sherion, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just let me know if it will be cold. I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure you’re comfortable. Your heart sounds regular, but I am hearing a slight murmur. It's not alarming at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90 on the right arm and 142/92 on the left. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Pulses are present and regular in all extremities, but slightly weaker in your feet. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No swelling or discoloration. Okay, Sherion, everything seems generally okay, but we do have a few things to investigate further. I want to order some tests to get a better picture of what’s going on. I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out any other underlying issues, and a chest X-ray to rule out any lung problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. An EKG and a blood test and a… chest X-ray. I just want to know what’s wrong. I don’t like being worried. And… will these tests tell me if it’s my heart? I worry about my heart, you know? Like my father.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Sherion, and that’s exactly what these tests are for – to give us a clearer picture and rule things out or confirm what might be going on. The EKG will look at the electrical activity of your heart and can detect any irregularities. The blood test will give us information about your cholesterol, sugar levels, and other markers that can indicate heart problems. And the chest X-ray will help us see if there’s anything going on with your lungs or heart size. It’s important to remember that these tests are just information. They don’t necessarily mean there is something wrong. But they’ll help us make an informed decision about the best course of action. I'll have the nurse draw the blood for the test now. And we'll schedule the EKG and chest X-ray for later this week. While we wait for the results, I want you to continue to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Blood tests and EKG and… chest X-ray. And watch for bad pain. Yes. Um… how long will the tests take? And… will they hurt? I don't like needles. And… will I have to wait a long time for the results? I just want to know… soon.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Sherion. The blood draw will only take a few minutes. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn’t be painful. The nurse is very good at it, and it will be over quickly. The EKG is completely painless. They’ll put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, and it records your heart’s electrical activity. It takes about ten minutes. The chest X-ray also doesn’t hurt. You’ll stand in front of a machine, and it takes a quick picture of your lungs and heart. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for everything to come back from the lab. I’ll call you as soon as I have them, and we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them. I understand you want to know soon, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. In the meantime, try to stay calm and focus on taking care of yourself. Get plenty of rest, eat healthy, and avoid strenuous activity. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. And patient. I worry a lot. I will try to stay calm. And I will let you know if the pain gets worse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It’s my job to help you, and I’m glad I could reassure you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And we'll get those other tests scheduled for you as soon as possible. Take care, Sherion. And remember to try to relax. .
