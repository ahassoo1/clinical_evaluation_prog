DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Bacy, you say? Yes, good, good. I… moved here. New place. Needed to find a doctor, you know? Medicare and all that. Just a check-up, I think. Old age, maybe? I don’t really… remember what they told me to do. So much paperwork these days.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Szmyd. New to the area and getting established with healthcare can be a bit overwhelming. A general check-up is a great place to start. And don’t worry about the paperwork – we'll take it slow. To help me get a good picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little more about what's been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately? Hmm. Everything feels… slow. Like my body is not mine anymore. And my hands… they shake a little. Not all the time, just when I… well, when I try to do things. I used to be very good with my hands, you know? Makeup. Theatre. Very precise work. Now… not so much. It's annoying.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’ve noticed a general slowing down and some tremors in your hands, particularly when you’re trying to do fine motor tasks, like you mentioned with makeup or theatre work. And this is relatively new?
PATIENT: New? Yes, I think so. Hard to say exactly when it started. Everything blurs together after a while, you know? Maybe six months? A year? It’s not like it happened overnight. Just… crept up on me. It’s mostly when I try to… concentrate. Like making a straight line. Or putting eyelashes on. Very difficult now. Very frustrating. I used to be the best.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over the past six to twelve months, with the tremors being more noticeable when concentrating on tasks requiring precision. That’s helpful to know. Besides the slowing down and tremors, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… I get tired. Very tired. Even after sleeping. And sometimes… I forget things. Not big things, you know? Just… names. Where I put my glasses. What I was going to say. Little things. My ex-wife used to complain about that all the time. She always remembered everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue despite adequate sleep and some difficulty with recall – names, misplaced items, things like that. Do you find these memory lapses are interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Interfering? Yes, a little. I try not to go out much anymore. Too much to remember. Faces, names… It’s easier to just stay home. Watch television. It’s… simpler. And I get confused sometimes. Not all the time, but… driving, for example. I almost got lost last week. Just going to the grocery store.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. Getting lost, even on familiar routes, is something we need to take seriously. And the fatigue and memory issues are also important pieces of the puzzle. Before we move on to your medical history, let’s quickly review your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. The doctor back in… where was I? Never mind. He gave me something for my… blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. I take it every morning. And sometimes, when my… joints ache, I take something over the counter. Ibuprofen, I think. That’s it. I used to take a lot of vitamins, but I stopped. Too much trouble remembering.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re taking lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Do you know the dosage of the lisinopril?
PATIENT: Dosage? No, no. I don’t… I just take the pill. The doctor told me one a day. That’s all I remember. Little white pill. I put it with my breakfast. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the numbers. Too complicated. I leave that to the doctors.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can certainly look that up in your records if you’d like. Before we do that, let’s talk about any allergies you might have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never been allergic to anything. Well… dust. Makes me sneeze. But that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… dust. My ex-wife always complained about the dust. She was very… clean. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a mild sensitivity to dust. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis, yes. That’s why my… joints ache. The doctor told me a long time ago. Something about… wear and tear. He gave me some pills, but they didn’t help much. And… I think I had high blood pressure for a while. That's why I take the white pills now. Other than that… not really. I used to be very healthy. Very active.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of osteoarthritis and hypertension. And you’ve been managing the hypertension with lisinopril. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm once. Fell off a ladder. Fixing the roof. That’s it, I think. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just the appendix and the arm. A long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in childhood and a previous fracture. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult question. My… mother, she died young. Something with her… heart, I think. Very sudden. My father, he lived a long time. But he wasn’t very healthy. Always coughing. And my sister… she had something with her… mind, I think. Got very confused. Old age, maybe. I don’t really remember much about it. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Szmyd. That gives me a better understanding. Now, to get a complete picture, let me ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never smoked. Tried it once when I was young, but didn’t like it. Made me cough. Drink alcohol? Sometimes. A little wine with dinner. Not every night. And… recreational drugs? No. Never. I’m a performer, you know. Need to keep my mind clear. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your current living situation?
PATIENT: Living situation? I live alone. Small apartment. Near the grocery store. It's… quiet. Not much going on. I used to live with my… ex-wife, but that didn’t work out. She liked things very organized. I’m not very good at organizing.
DOCTOR: Okay, living alone in a small apartment. Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Szmyd. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… don't poke too much. My joints ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… excellent. And again… Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulses are regular but slightly weak. Reflexes are diminished, but within normal limits. Now, let’s check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Follow your finger? Yes, yes, I can. It’s… a little blurry. Everything is a little blurry these days. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that you’re experiencing some blurry vision. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to stand on one leg for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Stand on one leg? Oh… Woah! Easy there… Not very good at that anymore. My balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Szmyd. It's good to know. Now, let’s just quickly check your hands. I’m going to see if I can feel any tremors. I do notice a slight tremor in both hands, more pronounced when you extend your arms. And some stiffness in the joints. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I'm concerned about a few things. Your symptoms – the slowing down, tremors, fatigue, forgetfulness, and blurry vision – are suggestive of a possible neurological condition, and the diminished reflexes are also something to investigate.
PATIENT: Neurological condition? Oh dear. What… what does that mean? Is it serious? Am I… losing my mind?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Szmyd. It’s natural to be worried when you hear something like that. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’re losing your mind, not at all. There are many possible explanations for these symptoms, and we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The most likely possibility, given your age and symptoms, is Parkinson's disease. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, such as essential tremor, or even vitamin deficiencies. To rule those out and get an accurate diagnosis, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. I also recommend a neurological consultation with Dr. Anya Petrova, a specialist in movement disorders, and an MRI of your brain. The MRI will help us visualize the brain and look for any structural abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI… and a specialist… Oh. This is… a lot. Blood tests, yes, I can do blood tests. Specialist… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. But an MRI… is it… painful? And expensive? My ex-wife always worried about the bills.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Szmyd. The MRI is not painful at all. You’ll lie inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create images of your brain. It's a bit noisy, but we can provide you with earplugs. It typically takes about 30-45 minutes. Regarding the cost, we will submit the tests to Medicare, and we have a billing department that can help you understand any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We’ll do everything we can to make it as affordable as possible. For now, let's focus on getting the blood tests scheduled. I’ll write you a requisition form, and you can take it to the lab at the hospital. They’ll draw a few vials of blood, and the results should be back in about a week. We can then schedule the neurological consultation with Dr. Petrova. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: A week… okay. Blood tests first, then the specialist. And you’ll help with the bills? That’s… good. Very good. Yes, let’s do the blood tests. Just… please, tell me what’s going on. Even if it’s… bad. I don’t want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Szmyd. I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll discuss the results of the blood tests and the neurologist’s findings as soon as we have them. And we’ll go over all your options together. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin, just to ensure you’re getting all the nutrients you need. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A multivitamin… okay. No, no questions. Just… thank you. Thank you for listening. And for not… laughing at me. I think that’s all for now. I should… go home, I guess. And try to rest.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Get some rest, and I'll see you in a week. We’ll take it one step at a time. .
PATIENT: .
