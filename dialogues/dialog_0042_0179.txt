DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherrell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… difficult to explain. I am having trouble… finding the right words. It has been happening for… some time now. Not all the time, but… often enough that it worries me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to take your time. We'll figure this out together. When you say "trouble finding the right words," can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm. It is… like the word is on the tip of my tongue, you know? I know what I want to say, what I mean… but the word… it will not come. Sometimes, I use the… wrong word. Not often, but enough. It is… frustrating. And… a little scary, to be honest. My wife… she would always know exactly what I meant. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds incredibly frustrating, and I can certainly understand why it's causing you worry, especially with the loss of your wife. It's natural to feel unsettled when things change, and difficulties with communication can be particularly distressing. So, this trouble with finding words… when did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. It was… after she passed. Maybe… six months, seven months ago? It started slowly. I would… stumble over a word here or there. I thought it was just… grief, you know? Being tired and sad. But it has not gotten… better. It has stayed the same, or… perhaps a little worse. I do not remember exactly. Time… it feels strange now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and it's common to experience cognitive changes during periods of intense emotional stress. The fact that it's persisted for six or seven months, though, is important to note. Now, can you tell me a little more about when you notice this happening?
PATIENT: When…? Hmm. It seems to happen… more when I am tired. Or… when I am trying to explain something complicated. Simple things, like ordering food, I can usually do fine. But if I am trying to… describe something, or explain how something works… that is when I struggle the most. Also… if I am talking quickly. If I slow down, it is a little easier. But… it is still difficult. Sometimes, it just happens randomly. I cannot predict it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like fatigue, complex tasks, and speaking quickly seem to be triggers. And it can happen spontaneously as well. That’s helpful information. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your thinking or memory besides this difficulty finding words?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think… I do… forget things more easily now. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, for example. Or… the name of a neighbour. But nothing… serious, I don’t think. I used to be very good with numbers, for my work, but… I have not done much work lately. So it is hard to say if my memory is worse. Sometimes… I feel a little… confused. Like I am… not quite all there. But that could just be the tiredness.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these changes, and it's perfectly alright that you're not certain about the extent of them. Fatigue can certainly contribute to both memory lapses and feelings of confusion, so we need to consider that. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, or have been treated for in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I had… a problem with my heart, many years ago. But that was… fixed. I take medicine for my blood pressure. That is all. I have Medicare, so they check me regularly. They have not said anything about… my brain, or my thinking. Just the blood pressure. My wife… she had… something with her memory, towards the end. But that was… different. Very different.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. It’s important to know about your history with heart issues and your current blood pressure medication. And it's helpful to know about your wife's condition, even though it sounds like it was a different situation. I'm going to access your electronic health record now to review your medication list and past medical history in more detail. This will give me a clearer picture of your overall health. Just give me a moment.
PATIENT: That is… fine. Take your time. I have nowhere to be. I hope… it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. I've reviewed your records. It confirms you've been consistently monitored for hypertension and are currently taking Lisinopril. No significant changes or concerning events noted in the recent past. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It’s a series of simple questions and tasks that will help me evaluate your memory, attention, and language skills. It won't be painful or uncomfortable, and it shouldn't take too long. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… that is… alright. If you think it will help… then yes. I just… I hope it is not too difficult. My wife… she did not like tests very much. But if you think it is necessary… then I will do it.
DOCTOR: That's very kind of you, Sherrell. It’s perfectly alright to feel a little apprehensive, and it’s not nearly as difficult as it might seem. We'll take it at your pace, and I’ll explain everything as we go along. Okay, let's start with something simple. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Today…? Let me think… It is… August. Yes, August. And… the second. August the second. Is that right? 2025. I believe it is 2025.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Sherrell. August 2nd, 2025. Very good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a difficult question. I do not… I do not remember very well. Is it… New York? No… that is not right. It is… a big city. A very big city. I have been here before… but I do not recall the name. I am sorry. I should know this.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It’s not a test of general knowledge. We’re just trying to get a baseline understanding. You’re doing fine. Let's try something a little different. I'm going to say three words, and I'd like you to repeat them back to me. Please try to remember them, as I'll ask you to recall them later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes… I am ready. Please say the words. I will try my best to remember them. But… my memory is not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three words are: table, penny, orange. Please repeat those words back to me.
PATIENT: Table… penny… orange. Table, penny, orange. Did I say them correctly?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly correct, Sherrell. Now, let's move on to something a little different. Can you tell me what year you were born?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a very long time ago. Let me think… I was… a young man during the war. The second war. I believe… 1978? No… that is not right. Perhaps… 1975? I am not sure anymore. It has been so long. I apologize. My memory is… failing me.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. It’s perfectly understandable that you might not recall the exact year. Let's not worry about it for now. Now, I’m going to ask you to perform a simple task. Can you please tell me the months of the year, starting with January?
PATIENT: January… February… March… April… May… June… July… August… September…? Is that right? And… October… November… December. I believe that is all of them. Did I miss any?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherrell, that’s perfect. You remembered all twelve months correctly. Very good. Now, let's move on to one final question. Can you please try to recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… three words… I remember… something about… a colour… orange, yes. And… a small coin… a penny. And… I am sorry… I cannot remember the third word. It is on the tip of my tongue, but… it will not come. I apologize. My memory is… failing me. It was… table, yes? I think it was table…
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherrell. You remembered two of the words correctly—orange and penny—and you were close on the third one—it was table. Okay, that concludes the brief cognitive assessment. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Based on your responses, you are experiencing some difficulties with short-term memory and recall. It's not a definitive diagnosis, but it does warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions about the assessment, or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Further investigation…? What does that mean, Doctor? Is something… seriously wrong? Is it… like my wife…? I am… worried. I do not want to… lose my mind. I just want to… remember things. Is there something I can do? Medicine? Exercises?
DOCTOR: Sherrell, I understand your concerns, and it's perfectly natural to feel worried. Let me assure you, what you’re experiencing is not necessarily the same as what your wife went through. Everyone’s situation is unique. Right now, we don't have enough information to make a definitive diagnosis. What this assessment tells us is that we need to investigate the cause of these memory difficulties. It could be several things, such as medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, stress, or early signs of cognitive impairment. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin levels, thyroid function, and other potential issues. I would also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any structural problems. In the meantime, there are some things you can do to help support your cognitive health. We can discuss strategies to improve memory, such as keeping a journal, doing puzzles, and staying socially active. I can also refer you to a specialist, a neurologist, for a more in-depth evaluation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a scan…? That sounds… complicated. But… if it will help, then yes. I want to know what is happening. I do not want to… be a burden to anyone. A neurologist…? Is that… a good doctor? Will they… tell me if there is something… very wrong? What about the exercises? What kind of puzzles? I used to enjoy crosswords, but… I find it difficult to concentrate now.
DOCTOR: Yes, the blood tests and scan are just routine procedures to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. They’re not usually painful, and the results will give us valuable information. A neurologist is a specialist in disorders of the brain and nervous system. They’re very good doctors, and they'll be able to provide a more in-depth evaluation and diagnosis. They will explain the results to you clearly and discuss the best course of treatment, if needed. As for exercises, there are many things you can do to support your cognitive health. Crosswords are excellent, even if you find it difficult to concentrate now. We can start with simpler ones and gradually increase the difficulty. Other options include Sudoku, word searches, and memory games. Even things like reading, writing, and staying socially active can help. I’ll write you a referral to a neurologist and a list of resources for cognitive exercises. I’ll also order the blood tests today. The lab results usually take a few days. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… good. A good plan. Thank you, Doctor. You have… been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Will the neurologist… remember my wife? Or… will I have to explain everything all over again? It is… difficult to talk about.
DOCTOR: Sherrell, it's perfectly understandable that you're worried about having to repeat your story. I will make a note in your referral to the neurologist about your wife and your concerns. They are very compassionate doctors and will be sensitive to your feelings. They will likely ask you some similar questions, but they will do so with kindness and understanding. I can also provide the neurologist with a summary of our conversation today, so they have a good understanding of your history and concerns before you even meet with them. We want to make this as easy and comfortable as possible for you. Remember, you are not alone in this, and we will support you every step of the way. It’s okay to feel vulnerable, and it’s okay to ask for help. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You have answered all my questions, Doctor. Thank you… again. I feel… a little better now. Perhaps… a puzzle might be a good idea. Something small… to keep my mind busy. .
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Sherrell. I'm glad I could help. And yes, a puzzle is a great idea! Start small, and don’t put too much pressure on yourself. I’ll have my nurse come in and give you the referral for the neurologist and a list of resources. She will also schedule your blood tests. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Sherrell.
