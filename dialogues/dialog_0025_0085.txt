DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. It’s just not right. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it’s bothering me. It's a discoloration, you see. Not a rash, not a bump... just… off-color patches. It’s rather unsightly, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Unsightly," hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, “unsightly.” Is that not a perfectly acceptable descriptor, Doctor? I do try to be precise. It’s on my arms mostly, and a bit on my chest. It's not painful, thankfully, but it looks…old. Like someone took a sepia filter to my skin. And I assure you, I’ve never spent much time in the sun. My husband always said I was too sensible for that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Sensible is good. Now, let's get some details. “Sepia filter,” alright. Can you tell me exactly when you first noticed these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think. It was… around the first week of July, I believe. Yes, definitely after the Fourth. We had company over, and I remember noticing it in the bathroom mirror while getting ready for bed. It wasn't terribly noticeable then, just a slight… dullness. But it’s definitely gotten more pronounced since then. I keep very good track of these things, you know. My grandmother always said a woman should be aware of changes to her body. It's…responsible.
DOCTOR: Responsible, yes. And you said it’s on your arms and chest. Is it anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… yes, a tiny bit on the backs of my hands, I suppose. It’s very faint there, you’d almost miss it. And… possibly a small patch on my upper back. My husband helps me with sunscreen, you see, and I hadn't really examined that area closely until now. He's good, but… sometimes he misses spots. It's not his fault, of course. He's not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you mean? Like… a new hobby? No. A new job? Absolutely not. My husband and I are very… settled. We’ve lived in the same house for twenty years. We've always used the same laundry detergent, the same soap… everything is very consistent. I can’t abide change, it upsets the balance, you see. Though… Mrs. Henderson next door did switch to a new brand of garden fertilizer. Perhaps something’s in the air? It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Silly?
PATIENT: Well, I do find it rather unlikely that fertilizer is responsible for discoloration on my skin, Doctor. But one must consider all possibilities, shouldn't one? I mean, things do happen. It’s simply… logical to rule things out. I’m a very logical person, you see. It’s terribly important to be methodical. My husband, bless his heart, isn’t nearly as observant as I am. He’d never notice a subtle shift in skin tone. It’s rather…frightening, actually, how easily things can be missed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bartock. Let’s take a look. Just lie back on the table, and we'll have a closer examination. Don't worry, I'm sure it's nothing serious, but it's best to be thorough. Remove your sweater, please.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. Very well. I suppose that’s… practical. I do hope you have thoroughly sanitized that table, Doctor. One can never be too careful, you know. And do try not to be too… brisk. I'm rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the patches. They are hypopigmented, irregular borders… and they appear to be more prominent in areas of sun exposure, despite your statement. No raised lesions, no warmth, no tenderness. Skin texture is normal. Have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Oh, traveled? Goodness, no. Not since our cruise to Alaska five years ago, and that was perfectly uneventful. My husband and I are homebodies, as I mentioned. I simply don’t do travel. Too many germs, too much disruption. And frankly, I find it rather… vulgar to parade oneself around exotic locales. I prefer the peace and quiet of my garden. Are you suggesting these patches are some sort of…foreign affliction? That's rather alarming, Doctor. I do hope I haven't contracted anything unsavory.
DOCTOR: No, I am not suggesting that. It’s just… important to rule out all possibilities. Are you currently using any new lotions, creams, or soaps?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! I’ve used the same lavender-scented lotion from Miller’s Apothecary for… well, I honestly couldn't tell you how long. It's a family favorite. And as I said, the same soap, the same detergent. I’m quite particular about these things. Change is… unsettling, you see. It introduces variables. I don't do variables. Are you implying my hygiene practices are somehow… lacking, Doctor? Because I assure you, they are not.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, I'm not implying anything of the sort. It seems you’re very diligent with your routine. Given your history, and the appearance of the lesions, it could be pityriasis alba. It's a mild form of eczema, often seen in fair-skinned individuals, although it can occur in others. It’s not contagious, not serious, but can be cosmetically bothersome. However, we should rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a fungal scraping and a skin biopsy, just to be certain.
PATIENT: A… scraping? And a biopsy? Oh, my goodness. That sounds… rather invasive, doesn’t it? What exactly are you hoping to find? And is it… painful? I’ve always been rather squeamish. And what if it is something… unpleasant? I do hope it’s not something… contagious. My husband, you see, has a rather delicate constitution. Are you certain this is necessary, Doctor? Couldn't we simply try a different lotion? Perhaps a chamomile-scented one?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bartock, a fungal scraping is a very quick, painless procedure. We simply collect a small sample of skin cells to rule out a fungal infection. The biopsy involves taking a tiny sample of skin, and yes, it requires a local anesthetic. It will sting briefly, but it’s much more discomfort than pain. Given your insistence on consistency and your concerns about variables, it's imperative to have a definitive diagnosis before making any changes. Trying a different lotion without knowing the cause could potentially worsen the condition. I understand your apprehension, but this is standard procedure, and it’s the most responsible course of action. We will send the samples to the lab for analysis, and I’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any allergies to local anesthetics?
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. I suppose… if you insist. But a tiny sample, you promise? And I do hope the lab is reputable. I wouldn't want my skin cells being… mishandled. As for allergies… let me think. I had a slight reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but that was decades ago. And I recall my grandmother mentioning a sensitivity to… novocaine, I believe. Though that was before my time, really. Very well. Let's get it over with. But please, be gentle. And do let me know if you need me to… breathe deeply or anything of the sort. I do tend to get flustered easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll mark the allergy to novocaine. And I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. Nurse will be in shortly to prep the area and administer the anesthetic. Just try to relax, Ms. Bartock. It will be over before you know it. .
