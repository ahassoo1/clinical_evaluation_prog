DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, good morning. Look, I just… I want to get pregnant, okay? And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he’s gone now. And I don’t want any trouble. I’m not getting any younger, you know? I just want to know what I need to do to make sure everything… works. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, “easy” is rarely a term one associates with reproduction, Ms. Villarreal. However, we can certainly assess your situation. You are 43, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, 43. And perfectly healthy, I might add. I always took care of myself. Ate right, exercised… not that it matters now, I suppose. But yes, 43. Can we just… skip the small talk and figure out what tests I need? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: "Perfectly healthy" is a subjective assessment, Ms. Villarreal. We will require a thorough history and some basic investigations, regardless. Let’s begin with your menstrual history. When was your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? My period? Look, it’s been… a while. Since my husband passed, things have been… irregular. Honestly, I barely even noticed. Is that important? I just… I don’t keep track of that stuff. It’s not like I was planning anything, you know? Can we just check if everything else is okay? Blood tests or something? This is… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Irregular cycles at your age are important, Ms. Villarreal. Quite important. It impacts our ability to assess ovarian function. However, we can proceed with a baseline blood work panel to evaluate hormone levels, complete blood count, and metabolic markers. And, naturally, a pelvic exam. It is standard procedure, and, frankly, necessary. We need to rule out any anatomical or physiological barriers. Do you have any known allergies to latex or betadine?
PATIENT: Latex… uh… I don’t think so. Betadine? What is betadine? Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those things. I just… let the nurses do whatever they do. I’m not allergic to anything major, I don’t think. Look, can’t you just give me something to… boost my chances? Some vitamins or a pill? Is that possible? This whole thing is just a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, this is not a vending machine. We do not simply give things. We assess, we diagnose, and then we treat based on findings. A "pill" without knowing the underlying cause of potential difficulty is… irresponsible. We will proceed with the blood work and the pelvic exam. I'll need a urine sample as well, for a pregnancy test – despite your stated desire, it's prudent to rule out the obvious. The nurse will guide you to the restroom. Afterwards, we'll discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Urine sample… fine. Just… get it over with. Look, I just don’t understand why everything has to be so complicated. I just want a baby. Is that too much to ask? And honestly, I don’t have time for a lot of explaining. So, no, I don't have any questions. Just… where’s the restroom? And please, try to be quick. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: The restroom is down the hall to your left. The nurse will provide the necessary collection cup. I assure you, we will be as efficient as possible. However, a thorough evaluation is paramount. I expect a clean catch sample. And Ms. Villarreal, please refrain from interrupting the nurse; she has other patients to attend to. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have charting to complete.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. Clean catch… honestly. .
