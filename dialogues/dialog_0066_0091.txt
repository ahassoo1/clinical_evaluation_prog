DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Condray. Is nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feeling very, very thirsty. All the time thirsty, you know? And I does be hungry all the time as well. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I need more. Is very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds concerning. Feeling thirsty all the time and being constantly hungry, even after eating… that’s definitely something we should look into. Let me just pull up your information here. Bianca Zicarelli, 63 years old. Alright. Can you tell me a little bit more about the thirst?
PATIENT: Yes, that is my name. Thank you for writing it down. About the thirst… well, it just never go away. I drink water, and I drink juice, sometimes even a little bit of sweet drink, but it don’t seem to help much. I does have to drink much more water than I used to. And even then, my mouth feel dry. Is like something taking all the water from me. It happen most days, but sometimes is worse than others. I not sure what cause it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a persistent thirst, needing much more fluid than usual, and it doesn’t completely go away even with drinking. And it varies in intensity. That’s helpful. And you mentioned being hungry all the time, even after eating. Has your appetite changed significantly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My appetite… is always there. Like a little child asking for food all the time! Even if I just finish a big plate of rice and beans and chicken, maybe with some salad, I still feel like I could eat more. Is not that I want to eat more, is just… the feeling is still there. Is very unsettling. I does try to stop myself, you know, because I don't want to overeat, but is hard. And it not like I does get full, even after a lot of food. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bianca. That sounds really frustrating, feeling like you're never quite satisfied, even after eating a good meal. That's definitely something we need to investigate. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – how often you go, or the amount of urine you’re passing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, I does be going to the bathroom more often, I think. Maybe… two or three more times a day than I used to. And I does feel like I does pass a good amount of urine each time, you know? Like a bigger stream than before. I not sure if it is just because I does be drinking more water, but is something I noticed. My husband, he did mention it too, that I does be going to the bathroom a lot. Is not painful, just… more frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency and volume of urination, and your husband has noticed it as well. That’s important information. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the thirst, hunger, and increased urination?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, sometimes I does feel a little bit tired, you know? Not like sick tired, just… more weary than I used to be. And my vision… sometimes it does feel a little blurry. Not all the time, but especially when I does be looking at things far away. And maybe… sometimes I does get a little bit of headaches. Not bad headaches, just… a little pressure in my head. Does that sound important, Doctor? I not sure if these things is related.
DOCTOR: Yes, Bianca, those things could be related, and we need to consider them. Fatigue, blurry vision, and headaches… all those can be connected. Now, let’s go over a little bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I does have a little bit of high blood pressure. The doctor told me years ago, but I does try to watch my salt and eat healthy. I does take a little pill for it sometimes, when it get too high. But other than that, I never been diagnosed with anything else. No diabetes, no nothing. I does try to be a healthy woman, you know? I walk in the garden, I eat my fruits and vegetables, I does try my best. Is just lately this thirst and hunger is worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with diet and medication as needed. That’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never had any surgeries. And I never been in the hospital. I does try to stay out of the hospital! Just the regular check-ups with the doctor, you know? I always been a healthy woman, until this start happening. Is very strange. Is like my body is changing, and I not sure what is going on. Is this something serious, Doctor? Is something to be worried about? I does be a little bit anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Bianca. It's good that you’ve generally been healthy, but these symptoms definitely warrant investigation. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I does not have any allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing. I does take the blood pressure pills when I need to, and I never had any problems with them. My husband, he is allergic to some kind of shellfish, but I is not. I does be careful with what I eat, but I never had any bad reactions to anything. Is just this thirst and hunger is bothering me. And the tiredness, sometimes. Is like my body is fighting something, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. And you mentioned being on medication for your blood pressure when needed. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Is a little white pill, I believe. My husband, he does the shopping usually, so he knows the name better than me. I think… is something with an “A” in the name? But I not sure. I does just take it when my pressure get too high, you know? Not every day. Is a little confusing, sometimes, with all the pills and things. I can ask my husband when I get home, if you like. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Bianca. Don’t worry about remembering the exact name right now. We can get that information later. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – have diabetes, kidney problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother, she did have a little bit of sugar, I think. Not diabetes, maybe just a little bit of sugar in her blood. She did have to watch what she eat, but she lived a long life. And my father, he had a heart problem when he get old, I think. He did have to go to the hospital a few times for his heart. And my brother, he has high blood pressure, just like me. But other than that, I not sure if anyone else had any problems. Is a big family, you know? And I not always know everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had some sugar issues, your father had a heart problem, and your brother has high blood pressure. That’s helpful to know. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I does not smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I does not drink alcohol either. Not even a little bit of wine. I does not like the taste of it. My husband, he does drink a little bit of beer sometimes, but I does not. I does prefer a nice glass of water, or a little bit of juice. I does try to live a clean life, you know? I does believe in taking care of my body. Is just this thirst and hunger is worrying me. Is like something is wrong, but I not sure what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No smoking and no alcohol use. Alright, Bianca, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Based on what you've told me – the persistent thirst, the increased hunger, the frequent urination, the fatigue, and the blurry vision – I think it's important to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It could be a number of things, but one of the things we need to rule out is diabetes. Would you be okay with a blood test and a urine test?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is alright. If you think is best, then I will do whatever you think is best. I want to know what is wrong, you know? I does not want to be walking around with something bad happening in my body. So yes, please do the tests. Blood test and urine test, is that right? Is it going to hurt? I does not like needles much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Yes, a blood test and a urine test. Don't worry, the blood test will be a quick pinch – most people don't find it too painful. The urine test is just collecting a sample in a cup. We’ll start with the urine sample first. Just follow the instructions I’ll give you, and then we’ll get the blood draw done. After the lab results come back, we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. Urine test first, then blood draw. I can do that. Just tell me what to do, and I will try my best. I does be a little nervous, but I trust you, you know? You seem like a very nice doctor. Just tell me what to do with the cup. And how long will it take to get the results? Is it going to be a long wait?
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Bianca. I'll do my best to make you comfortable. Okay, for the urine sample, I’m going to give you a cup and ask you to collect a small amount – about two to four ounces – in a private bathroom just down the hall. Try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample about halfway through. There are instructions on the counter as well. It shouldn't take too long. As for the results, the lab usually takes about two to three business days to get everything back to me. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as I have them. Here's the cup. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. And don’t hesitate to let me know if you feel lightheaded or dizzy at any point.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you very much. I will try my best. Two to three business days, you say? I will wait for your nurse to call. Is a little nerve-wracking, but I trust you. I will go now and do the urine test. I will be right back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you get back.
