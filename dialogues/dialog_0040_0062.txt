DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Knabenshue. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Osga. Thank you for seeing me. I am here regarding the requirements at my place of work. It concerns the masks, and the other… protective things we’re now asked to wear. I’m hoping to discuss whether an exemption might be possible for me.
DOCTOR: Masks, right. Another one. Look, I'm a busy woman, so let's be quick, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I apologize for taking your time. I understand you have many patients. It's not that I am opposed to safety, you see. It is simply… I’ve experienced some difficulty with them. A feeling of… restriction, mostly. And sometimes, trouble breathing, if I’m being honest. Would it be helpful to explain what I do at work, so you understand the challenges?
DOCTOR: "Restriction?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It feels… confining. I work with people, often in close proximity, and I need to be able to… communicate clearly, and respond quickly if needed. The mask makes it harder to be understood, and harder to hear what others are saying. It’s important work, you see. Protective service work, like making sure folks are safe and have what they need. It requires a lot of… attentiveness. Perhaps it’s difficult to explain. I don't mean to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Protective services…right. So, you’re saying it interferes with your job?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. It does impact my ability to perform my duties effectively. It's not simply a matter of personal comfort, although that is a factor as well. But mainly, I worry about not being able to react swiftly in an emergency, or misinterpreting someone’s needs because I cannot see their face or hear them properly. I take my responsibilities very seriously, you see. I want to be able to help people to the best of my ability. Is there a form I need to fill out to request this exemption? Or perhaps a test I can take?
DOCTOR: A test?
PATIENT: I apologize, Doctor, if that sounded… presumptuous. I am not familiar with the procedures, you see. I was simply hoping to explore all available options. I understand if a formal test isn’t standard practice. Perhaps you could assess my breathing, or ask me some questions about my work and my medical history? I want to assure you that I am not attempting to avoid following safety guidelines. I simply want to find a solution that allows me to continue serving my community effectively while also protecting everyone’s health. I can provide details about my workplace, if that would be helpful. Or a list of the specific requirements regarding PPE.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Knabenshue, I’ve been practicing medicine for… a long time. And frankly, this is becoming quite common. People wanting “exemptions” because of… discomfort. Let's just get straight to it. Do you have any diagnosed respiratory problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I have never been diagnosed with any respiratory problems, such as asthma or COPD. I am generally quite healthy, physically. I do my best to take care of myself, you see. I try to eat well, and I get plenty of exercise when I can. I haven’t been seriously ill in many years. I can provide you with my medical records, if you would like. I have Medicare, and I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. I understand your concern, Doctor, and I appreciate you asking. I truly am not attempting to be difficult. It’s just… this feeling is new, and it interferes with my work.
DOCTOR: Any history of anxiety?
PATIENT: That is a… good question, Doctor. I have never been diagnosed with anxiety, no. But… I suppose I do sometimes feel a sense of… unease, when I’m in stressful situations. My work can be demanding, you see. And I am a sensitive person, I believe. I feel things deeply. I worry about the well-being of others, and I take responsibility for their safety very seriously. Does that count as anxiety, Doctor? I have never sought treatment for it, if that is what you are asking. I try to manage it on my own, through mindful practices and spending time in nature. I do not take any medication for it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s just do a quick listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath. And another one. Clear. Perfectly clear. Look, Mr. Knabenshue, it sounds like you’re perfectly healthy. Masks are uncomfortable, yes, but everyone manages. I'm not seeing any medical reason to grant an exemption.
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. That is…disappointing to hear, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my lungs. So, you believe my discomfort is… psychological, rather than physical? Is there anything I can do to… alleviate this feeling? Perhaps some breathing exercises, or a relaxation technique? I'm willing to try anything, you see. I truly want to continue working and serving my community, and I am hoping to find a way to overcome this obstacle. If you have any recommendations, or resources you could suggest, I would be very grateful. Perhaps even a referral to someone who specializes in… managing stress?
DOCTOR: There are plenty of resources online for managing stress. And frankly, I have other patients waiting. Look, the best thing you can do is… push through it. Everyone is uncomfortable in masks now. It’s just the new normal. I'm not seeing any medical basis for an exemption, and frankly, I don't have time to discuss this further. Here’s a list of some websites on stress management. Next patient.
PATIENT: I… I understand, Doctor. Thank you for your time. And for the list of resources. I appreciate it, even if it isn't the outcome I hoped for. I suppose I will try my best to… adapt. Thank you again, Doctor Osga. Have a good day. .
