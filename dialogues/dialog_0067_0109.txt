DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. My name is Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A dull ache at the back of your head, coming and going for about three days. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a bad pain, not like when I fall. More… annoying. It feels… tight, maybe? Like a band around my head. And sometimes… sometimes it goes down my neck a little. I used to work with the trains, you know? Lots of lifting, lots of… moving things around. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Brum. A tight, band-like ache that radiates down your neck, and it's been happening for three days. You used to work with trains and did a lot of lifting – that’s helpful information. To get a better understanding, could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever felt?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. The worst pain I ever felt was… when I broke my arm falling off the train car. That was a ten, for sure. This… this is nothing like that. Maybe… a two? Sometimes a three, when it’s really bothering me. Most of the time, it’s just a little thing. I can still work, still eat, still sleep. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, just… bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a two to three, generally, with occasional spikes. And it doesn’t interfere with your daily activities. Good to know. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… Worse? Hmm… standing for too long, I think. When I’m helping my grandson in the garden, after a few hours, it gets worse. And… when I’m worried. If something is bothering me, the pain gets tighter. Better? Laying down helps. And… when I take a little nap. That usually makes it go away for a while. I also tried rubbing it, but that doesn’t do much. Just feels… warm, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so standing for long periods and worry seem to worsen it, while lying down and napping help. Rubbing it doesn't provide much relief. Now, have you had any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Not really. I… I feel a little tired sometimes, but I’m an old man! I get tired easy. No blurry vision, no dizziness, no… what do you call it… trouble speaking? No, nothing like that. Maybe a little… stiff in my neck, but that could just be from sleeping wrong. No fever, no… anything else I can think of. I eat okay, sleep okay… mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms like blurry vision, dizziness, trouble speaking, fever, or significant neck stiffness. Just some general tiredness and occasional mild neck stiffness. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Doctor said I had high blood pressure, years ago. Gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t like how they made me feel. And… I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm, like I said. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk a lot, eat my vegetables… mostly. I don’t go to the doctor much. Don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in the past, but you’re no longer taking medication for it, and a broken arm from a fall. And you generally try to stay healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Just the arm, when I broke it. They had to put in… pins, I think. A long time ago. That’s it. Never needed anything else. I was lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working on the trains. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the surgery to repair your broken arm. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother, she had… trouble with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time before she passed. And my brother, he had… diabetes, I think they called it. He had to watch what he ate. Other than that… not much. My father was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. Mostly healthy people, my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your brother. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not really. I can eat anything, never had a problem. And… I don’t take much medicine, so I haven’t had any bad reactions. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I get bitten by a mosquito, but that’s just normal, right? No, no allergies. I’m pretty lucky.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. I try to avoid them if I can. Just… a little coffee in the morning. That’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Just a little coffee in the morning. Now, Mr. Brum, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Brum. I will be very gentle. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll take a look at your neck and shoulders. I’m also going to check your range of motion, and do a simple neurological exam, just to make sure everything is working properly. Your blood pressure is 150/90. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly surprising given your history. Pulse is 72, regular. I’m feeling some tenderness in the muscles at the base of your neck, on both sides. Okay, can you gently turn your head to the left, and then to the right?
PATIENT: Okay… A little tight on both sides, like I said. Feels… better when I move it, actually. Just stiff when I haven’t moved it for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see. There is some limited range of motion, and I do feel some muscle guarding. And now, I'm going to check your shoulders. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Not really. A little… ache, maybe, if you press really hard. But not much. I used to lift a lot of heavy things with my shoulders, you know? Maybe that’s it. Feels… normal, for an old man.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This won’t hurt. I’m going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are… a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And finally, I’m going to quickly check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay… I’m not as strong as I used to be, Doctor. Used to be able to lift anything. But I still have some strength.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Your grip strength is a little weaker than expected, but not significantly so. Okay, Mr. Brum, that concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing tension headaches, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck and shoulders. The fact that it's worsened by stress and standing for long periods, and relieved by rest and movement, is consistent with that diagnosis. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we’ll want to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Tension headaches… hmm. That sounds right. I do get tense sometimes, worrying about things. And standing for too long… that always makes it worse. So, what does that mean? Do I need… pills? I don’t want pills, Doctor. What can I do?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re hesitant about medication, and that’s perfectly reasonable. Fortunately, tension headaches are often very treatable without pills. First, we can focus on lifestyle modifications. I recommend regular, gentle exercise – walking is excellent. Stretching your neck and shoulders daily can also help relieve muscle tension. You can find some simple stretches online or I can give you a handout with some examples. Heat or ice packs can also provide relief. We also need to address the blood pressure. While it’s not dangerously high right now, it’s important to keep it under control. I recommend reducing your sodium intake and incorporating more fruits and vegetables into your diet. Would you be open to trying these measures for a few weeks and seeing if they help?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Walking I can do. Stretching… I can try. And I do like my vegetables. Less salt… that might be hard, but I can try. No pills, right? Just walking and stretching and… eating better?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Brum. No pills to start. We’ll focus on those lifestyle changes. I’m going to give you a handout with some specific stretches for your neck and shoulders, and some tips for reducing your sodium intake. I'd also like to see you back in one month to check your blood pressure and see how you're doing with the stretches and diet changes. If things haven’t improved, or if your headaches get worse, we can discuss other options, including medication or referral to a physical therapist. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that… covers everything. Walking, stretching, less salt… I can do that. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. One month, you said? I’ll remember that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I’m glad I could help. Yes, one month. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, dizziness, blurred vision, or severe headache – please call the office immediately. Here’s that handout, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Mr. Brum. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
