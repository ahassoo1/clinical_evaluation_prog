DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, to be honest. I’ve noticed my muscles getting weaker, slowly, over the last few months. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's not severe, but it's noticeable, and it’s getting a little bit harder to keep them open sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakening muscles and drooping eyelids… that does sound concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to be clear, when you say slowly over the last few months, can you give me a rough timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It probably started… maybe around February, March? It was very gradual at first, just feeling a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. I didn't really pay much attention to it then. But then, maybe a month or two ago, I started noticing it was getting harder to do things – lifting things, even just holding my head up for a long time. And the eyelids… those started drooping more recently, perhaps in the last month or so. It’s hard to say exactly. I don’t keep very close track of these things.
DOCTOR: Right, February or March… so about six months now. And the eyelids more recently, within the last month. Okay. And is this weakness all over, or are there specific muscles that seem more affected than others?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think… it’s more noticeable in my arms and legs, definitely. Like, carrying groceries is harder now. And climbing the stairs… that takes more effort. I haven't really noticed it in my face except for the eyelids, of course. My hands don't seem to be affected much, I can still write and type normally. I suppose it feels… overall, but more pronounced in my limbs.
DOCTOR: Okay, limbs more than anything else. And have you noticed any changes in your vision at all?
PATIENT: That's… actually, yes. Now that you mention it, I have. Things seem a bit blurry sometimes, and I’ve been getting double vision, particularly when I'm tired. It comes and goes, though. I just thought it was from working too much on the computer. Is that… is that connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: It could be connected, yes. Double vision and blurry vision along with muscle weakness… it does raise a few possibilities. Just to get a clearer picture, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Hmm. I've been feeling more tired than usual, like, really fatigued. But I just assumed that was stress from the divorce. And… well, I've had a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes, but it's not constant. Just occasionally feels like food gets stuck a little. Nothing major, honestly. I haven’t really thought much of it until now, when you started asking about things.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional difficulty swallowing. Thank you for sharing all of that. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, of course. And I broke my arm once, when I was about ten. But nothing serious, no major illnesses or surgeries. No chronic conditions, no allergies… I'm generally quite healthy, or I was, anyway. I haven't seen a doctor in years, to be honest. Just for check-ups.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My mother… she had some sort of… muscle problem, when she was older. I don't remember the details, really. She passed away a few years ago, and my father wasn't very forthcoming with information. He wasn't one for talking about health matters. I think it was something neurological, but I couldn’t say for sure. My father was generally healthy, as far as I know. He lived to be quite old. I don’t think there’s much of a history of serious illness on either side, really. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Gedalya. It's helpful to know what you do recall. And what about medications?
PATIENT: I don't take any regular medications. Not currently, no. Occasionally I’ll take something for a headache, ibuprofen or something like that, but that's it. Nothing prescribed, nothing long-term. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I haven't ever had any allergic reactions, not that I'm aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. I've had no problems with pollen or animals or anything like that. I'm quite lucky, I suppose. I’ve never really had to worry about allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and see what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m a little worried, to be honest, but I appreciate you taking the time to look into this properly. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s start with your reflexes. Relax your arm for me… good. And now your leg… excellent. [Verbalizing for documentation] Reflexes are a little diminished, bilaterally, in both upper and lower extremities, but not absent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. [Squeezes Dr. Smetak’s hand, applying moderate pressure] Is that okay? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but it feels… a bit weaker than usual, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. I don't feel like I have the same strength I used to.
DOCTOR: [Verbalizing for documentation] Grip strength is decreased bilaterally, approximately 4/5 on both sides. Now, can you push against my hands like you’re trying to stand up?
PATIENT: Okay. [Pushes against Dr. Smetak's hands, applying noticeable effort, but with some hesitation and visible strain] It’s… a little difficult. I'm trying, but it feels like I’m putting in a lot of effort for very little resistance. My legs feel… heavy. It’s harder than it should be.
DOCTOR: [Verbalizing for documentation] Leg strength is approximately 4/5 bilaterally, with some noted effort. Now, let's check your eye movements. Follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head. [Moves finger in an "H" pattern] Are you able to follow me smoothly?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. [Follows Dr. Smetak's finger with his eyes, but with a slight hesitancy and occasional jerky movement. He blinks frequently.] It’s… a little difficult to keep my eyes focused. And I think I’m seeing double sometimes, particularly when I look to the sides. [Pauses] Is that… is that normal? It feels strange.
DOCTOR: [Verbalizing for documentation] Extraocular movements are slightly limited, with noted nystagmus in lateral gaze. Patient reports intermittent diplopia, particularly in lateral fields. [Turns to Gedalya] Okay, Gedalya. Thank you. That’s enough for now. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your symptoms – the muscle weakness, drooping eyelids, fatigue, and double vision – are concerning and could point to several different conditions. One possibility is a neuromuscular disorder, such as myasthenia gravis. Another could be something affecting your nervous system. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially an MRI of your brain and a nerve conduction study. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to find out what’s going on. Blood tests, MRI, nerve conduction study… yes, please. I'm a little worried about what it could be, but I appreciate you taking this seriously and trying to get to the bottom of it. What's the next step? Do I need to schedule anything? And… roughly, how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get the orders for those tests sent to the lab right away. The lab will contact you to schedule appointments for the blood work and nerve conduction study. They usually have several time slots available. As for the MRI, we'll need to schedule that through the imaging center. My assistant, Maria, will be in touch with you shortly to coordinate all of that. It typically takes a few days to a week to get the blood test results back, and the MRI results can take a little longer, perhaps up to a week after the scan. Once we have all the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as difficulty breathing or swallowing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. A few days to a week for the blood tests, a bit longer for the MRI… I’ll keep an eye on things and contact you if things get worse. Difficulty breathing or swallowing… I understand. Maria will contact me… excellent. Actually, yes, I do have one question. You mentioned myasthenia gravis… is that… serious? I’ve never heard of it before. And… is there anything I can do now to help alleviate the symptoms, even just a little bit? I’m feeling quite anxious about all of this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Gedalya. Myasthenia gravis can be a serious condition, but it's also very treatable. It's an autoimmune disorder that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles, which causes the muscle weakness you’re experiencing. The good news is that there are medications available to help improve muscle strength and manage the symptoms. As for what you can do now, unfortunately, there’s not much you can do to directly alleviate the symptoms without treatment. However, there are a few things that can help. Try to get plenty of rest, avoid strenuous activities, and eat a healthy diet. It's also important to manage your stress levels, as stress can worsen your symptoms. Avoid any medications that can potentially interfere with nerve and muscle function – your primary care physician should have a list of those. And, most importantly, try not to worry too much, as anxiety can also exacerbate the symptoms. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we'll develop a treatment plan that's right for you. Do you have any other questions I can answer for you at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that's… reassuring to hear. Plenty of rest, healthy diet, manage stress, avoid certain medications… I can certainly try to do those things. And I’ll try not to worry too much. It’s easier said than done, but I’ll try. I think… I think that's all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll wait for Maria to contact me about scheduling the tests. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I’m here for you, so don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll get through this together. Have a good day, and please take care.
