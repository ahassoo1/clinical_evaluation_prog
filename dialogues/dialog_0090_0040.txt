DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain in my side again, mostly on my right. And… I seem to be getting a lot of water infections lately, too. It's been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: Right. Pain in your right side and frequent urinary infections. Okay. Let's start with this pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but when it's bad, it's quite uncomfortable. It feels deep inside, not on the surface. Sometimes it goes through to my back a little, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Dull, deep ache in the right side, sometimes radiating to the back. And how long has this been going on this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it's hard to say exactly. It feels like it's been a few weeks now, this latest bit. But I’ve had trouble with it on and off for… well, years, really. It just flares up sometimes, and then goes away for a bit. It’s difficult to keep track.
DOCTOR: Years, alright. And when it flares up, is there anything that seems to cause it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. Honestly, no, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be related to anything specific. I eat the same, drink the same… I haven’t changed anything in my routine. It just… happens. Maybe when I’ve been lifting something a little heavy, but even then, not always.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No clear triggers. And you mentioned frequent water infections. How often would you say you’re getting those?
PATIENT: Well, it’s probably about once every month or two, now. Before, it was much less frequent. Maybe once or twice a year. But lately, it’s become much more regular. It’s quite bothersome, and the doctor back home – before I moved here – said it might be connected to my kidneys.
DOCTOR: Alright. Once a month or two now, increasing in frequency. The previous doctor suspected a kidney connection. We'll need to investigate that. Now, let’s talk about those urinary infections themselves. What symptoms do you experience when you get one?
PATIENT: Well, the usual, I suppose. A burning feeling when I go to the toilet. And I have to go very often. Not much comes out, but I feel like I need to go all the time. Sometimes a little bit of blood, too. It's uncomfortable, and I feel a bit tired and achy when it's bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Burning with urination, frequent urges, some blood, and fatigue. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic kidney disease, the doctor told me. It’s been many years now. I don't remember exactly when I was first diagnosed, but it was before I moved here. I’ve seen doctors about it before, but… I’m still not entirely sure what it means, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease. Right. And do you recall how they diagnosed it?
PATIENT: I believe they did some sort of scan… maybe an ultrasound? And blood tests, definitely. I remember being very tired after the blood tests. I think they looked at the size of my kidneys… and they said there were… little bubbles on them? That's how they explained it, anyway. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't feeling well at the time, so I didn’t ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Scan and blood tests, cysts noted on the kidneys. I see some older records here confirming that diagnosis. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never had any surgeries. I'm not a fan of them, if I can avoid it. Just the usual things… vaccinations, broken bones when I was a child, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my wife passed away a few years back, and I don't have any children. I have a few cousins, scattered around the islands, but I haven’t seen them in a long time. As far as I know, nobody else in the family had problems with their kidneys. Though, we don’t talk about health much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known family history of kidney disease. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. A multivitamin, and some Vitamin D. My wife used to remind me to take them every day. It's a habit now. Nothing for my kidneys, or the water infections. I usually just drink a lot of water when I feel an infection coming on.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just vitamins. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I've never had any problems with allergies. I can eat anything, and I’ve never reacted badly to any medicine. That’s another thing I don’t worry too much about, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Okay, Mr. Espinueva, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Then we'll talk about some possible tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. If you could just lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Your abdomen is a little tender in the right upper quadrant, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, a little bit. It's not a sharp pain, but it's uncomfortable. It’s the same area as my usual side pain, really. It feels… dull and achy, like a pressure. It's not too bad, but I can definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation. Okay. I'm going to order a urine analysis to check for infection, and a complete blood count to assess your overall health. I’m also going to order a kidney function panel to see how well your kidneys are working and an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to find out what's causing this pain and why I keep getting these infections. I’m happy to have those tests done.
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab will need a urine sample. There's a cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample—that means start urinating, then collect a sample in the middle of the stream. Once we have the results back, we'll have a better idea of what’s going on. It will take a few days to get everything back. In the meantime, continue to drink plenty of fluids. If you develop a fever, severe back pain, or nausea, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Mid-stream sample, plenty of fluids, and go to the emergency room if I get a fever or severe pain. I can definitely do that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk, and they’ll give you instructions on how to submit the sample. Once the results are back, the nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and ordering these tests. I feel a bit better already, just knowing we’re getting to the bottom of it. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. You're very welcome. We’ll get everything sorted out. If anything changes or you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day. .
