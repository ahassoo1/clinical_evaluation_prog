DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. Auelua, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s…down there. Something’s kinda…leaking. It’s not right, you know? Not normal at all. Makes a mess, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Down there” – you mean vaginal leaking?
PATIENT: Vaginal? No, no, doctor. Not my vaginal. My…well, it’s his. My…friend. He's the one with the problem, not me! Honestly, you gotta listen better. It's coming from him. It’s embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Jimmi. You’re absolutely right – I should have clarified. You're bringing your friend in for an issue he's experiencing. Thank you for correcting me. It’s completely understandable that it’s embarrassing to discuss, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. Can you tell me more about this leaking?
PATIENT: Well… it’s kinda… yellow, I think. Or maybe greenish? It's hard to tell, really. He doesn’t talk about these things. Just complains it’s… wet. And smells kinda bad. Not a nice smell, you know? Like…old fish, maybe? He tries to keep it clean, but it just keeps happening. It's been going on for...oh, I dunno, a week or two, maybe longer? Time slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so yellow or greenish discharge, a foul odor – you described it as fishy – and it’s been going on for a week or two. Has he noticed any pain, burning, or itching associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmmm… He grumbles a lot, but I don’t know if it’s pain pain, or just…old man pain, you know? He aches everywhere. But I haven’t heard him specifically say it burns or itches. He just gets annoyed when he has to change his clothes. He's a proud man, doesn't like to show weakness. He tries to ignore it, but I can tell it bothers him. He’s been…more quiet than usual.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no specific reports of pain, burning, or itching, but a change in his usual demeanor. Has he had any fever, chills, or other symptoms like difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Fever… now that you mention it… he did feel warm the other night. I thought it was just the blankets, though. He always gets hot easily. And…no, he hasn't said anything about trouble going to the bathroom. He goes…regularly enough, I suppose. Old men and their routines, you know? He’s very particular about that part. Honestly, doctor, I’m not a nurse. I just noticed it and thought he should get it checked. It doesn’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Of course. You’re doing the right thing bringing him in. It’s good you’ve noticed these changes. Let’s get some more information. Does he have any medical conditions that you know of, like diabetes or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical conditions… He doesn't really talk about those things either. Let me think… He used to have trouble with his… waterworks, years ago. Something with the prostate, I think? He had a little procedure, a long time ago. But that was ages ago. And…he’s always complaining about his heart, but that’s just old age, isn't it? I really don’t keep track of all that doctor. It's a lot for an old woman to remember. He also says his knees are bad. Very bad. But I doubt that's related to… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of prostate issues with a past procedure, and complaints of heart problems and knee pain. And to clarify, these are things he's mentioned, not necessarily formally diagnosed conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s right! He says he has those things. But he doesn’t go to the doctor much. He says they just want to give him pills all the time. He prefers his herbal remedies, honestly. Something his mother used to make. He’s a stubborn man, very stubborn. And… he’s not one for sharing information, especially with doctors. Honestly, doctor, you're asking a lot of an old woman to recall things he won't even tell me! It’s like pulling teeth.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. It sounds like getting a full medical history might be challenging. That's alright, we'll do our best. Has he ever had any surgeries other than the prostate procedure?
PATIENT: Hmmm…surgeries… let me think… Oh! He broke his arm when he was a boy, climbing a mango tree. He said they had to set it. That was a long, long time ago. And… I think he had his appendix out when he was young, but I’m not sure. Honestly, doctor, it was before I even met him! I’ve known him a long time, but I wasn’t there for everything. My memory isn’t what it used to be. He keeps telling me that! It’s frustrating. I'm trying my best here, you know?
DOCTOR: You are doing wonderfully, Jimmi, truly. It's very helpful, and I appreciate you sharing what you remember. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to examine your friend, if he's comfortable with that. It will involve a physical exam, just to take a look and see what’s going on. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, he’s here. Sitting right over there. He’s a bit…grumpy this morning. Didn’t want to come at all. Said it was a waste of time. But I insisted. He’s been… difficult lately. He's probably embarrassed. He doesn’t like anyone looking at his… private parts. But if you tell me it’s necessary, I’ll try to convince him. He listens to me…sometimes. But be gentle, okay? He’s an old man, and everything hurts.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. It's important to understand what's causing this, and a quick examination will help me determine the best course of action. I will explain everything to him beforehand, and we'll proceed at his pace. Would you mind if I spoke with him directly now?
PATIENT: No, no, go ahead. He's… over there. Just… be patient with him. And maybe don’t mention the fish smell. It’ll just embarrass him even more. He’s a proud man, you know? And… tell him I said he needs to cooperate. He’ll probably ignore you, but it’s worth a try. Honestly, doctor, you have your work cut out for you. .
