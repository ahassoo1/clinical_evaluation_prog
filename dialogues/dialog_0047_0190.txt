DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. It’s not constant, but it’s concerning. I wouldn’t say I’m falling, exactly, but… off-balance, perhaps? It's been happening for a few weeks now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Unsteady on your feet for a few weeks, you say. “Off-balance” is a good way to put it. And it’s not constant?
PATIENT: No, not constant. Some days are better than others. It seems… worse when I’ve been working, I think. Though, honestly, the work is quite demanding, so it’s hard to say if that’s a factor or not. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. I struggle to recall specifics about when it started, or how often it happens. Is that… alright? Should I be remembering more?
DOCTOR: Well, it is helpful to have a clearer timeline, but memory lapses can happen. We can work around it. Demanding work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite demanding. I operate a rotary drill for an oil and gas company. It’s… a lot of standing, and quite a bit of vibration. It requires a good deal of focus, too. I’ve been doing it for… oh dear, I can’t quite recall how long. Several years, at least. It’s… rather physical, if that makes sense. And dusty, certainly. I hope that information is useful.
DOCTOR: Dusty, and a lot of vibration… that’s good to know. And several years doing this work. Alright. Now, aside from the unsteadiness and the memory issues, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not exhausted, but… sluggish. And sometimes I feel a little… lightheaded? It passes quickly, though. I haven’t noticed anything else particularly alarming. I do apologize if I'm being vague. It’s all a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Sluggishness and occasional lightheadedness. Alright. Do you have any headaches associated with the lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Headaches… not usually. Sometimes, if I’ve been working a long shift, I’ll have a dull ache at the back of my head, but I wouldn’t say it’s with the lightheadedness. More… afterwards, perhaps? Or if I don’t drink enough water. It’s hard to say. I tend to just… push through things, if that makes any sense. Is that a helpful answer? I’m truly trying to recall everything accurately.
DOCTOR: It's adequate. Alright. Let's move on to some basic questions. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Not that I recall, no. I try to be very careful, given the nature of my work. I had a rather nasty bout of something last winter, I believe, but that was… quite some time ago. Just a bad cold, I think. Nothing serious. I took some over-the-counter medication and rested, and it cleared up on its own. I really wish my memory was better, this is quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… No, not really. I usually bring my own lunch to work, mostly sandwiches and fruit. I try to eat healthy, though it’s difficult when you’re working long hours. I’ve perhaps been drinking less water lately, now that you mention it. It's easy to forget, especially when you’re focused on the job. Would that be… relevant? It’s a small thing, I apologize for mentioning such trivialities.
DOCTOR: It’s not trivial if it’s relevant. Alright. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… Now that you ask… perhaps a little. It’s very faint, and I assumed it was just from the noise at work. The drill is quite loud, naturally. It comes and goes, and I haven’t paid it much attention. It’s not a constant buzzing, or anything like that. Just a subtle… ringing. Is that a concern? I truly hadn’t thought it was worth mentioning until this very moment.
DOCTOR: A subtle ringing in your ears. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… My late husband… he was the one who usually handled those sorts of things. I believe I had… high blood pressure, at one point? The doctor prescribed some medication, and I took it for a while. But it was several years ago. I haven't been to a doctor in quite some time, truthfully. I'm afraid my memory is failing me regarding the specifics of the diagnosis or treatment. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And did you continue taking the medication as prescribed?
PATIENT: I… I believe so. For a while, yes. But after my husband passed… everything became rather chaotic. I'm afraid I stopped keeping track of things properly. I likely didn’t renew the prescription, or… I simply forgot. It's a shameful admission, I know, but… my mind wasn't in the right place. I can't reliably say whether I continued taking it consistently, or for how long. I deeply regret my negligence, but it was a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I had my appendix removed when I was a child, I believe. A very standard procedure, nothing complicated. And… I think I had a small cyst removed from my wrist, many years ago. But beyond that… I can’t recall anything significant. I truly apologize for the gaps in my memory. It’s incredibly frustrating for both of us, I imagine. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven’t been taking anything regularly, no. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s about it. And sometimes a multivitamin, but I haven’t taken one in a while, now that you mention it. I don’t typically rely on medication unless absolutely necessary. I prefer to… push through things, if that makes any sense. But I understand the importance of disclosing everything, and I apologize if I'm omitting anything. I'm truly trying to recall everything accurately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced any allergic reactions to anything, thankfully. I can eat all types of food, and I’ve never had a reaction to medication. I don’t have any known sensitivities, no. I truly apologize for the lack of information. I wish I had a better memory to offer you. Is there anything else I can provide that might be helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Snerling, given your history of possible high blood pressure, the recent fatigue, the ringing in your ears, and the unsteadiness, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. And I think some bloodwork is necessary. It’s likely nothing serious, but it’s better to rule things out. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Anything that might help determine the cause of this would be most welcome. Bloodwork and a physical exam… absolutely. I trust your judgment entirely. Please, proceed at your convenience. I apologize for being such a… complicated patient, but I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. …148 over 92. Elevated. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing seems clear, but heart rate is a little fast… 88. And now, I'll check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, let's do a quick balance test. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That… wasn’t very graceful, was it? I do feel a bit unsteady, as you can see. It’s much more pronounced when I close my eyes. Perhaps it's better if I don't attempt that again. It's... rather alarming, truthfully. I apologize for any inconvenience.
DOCTOR: It's alright. That confirms my suspicions. Your balance is indeed compromised. Now, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels. This should give us a clearer picture of what's going on. The lab will draw blood now, and then we can discuss the results when they come back in a few days. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: A few tests… yes, that sounds thorough. I suppose I just… what exactly are we looking for? Is this something serious, Doctor? I apologize for asking such a blunt question, but I’m naturally anxious. And… will the results take long? I do have work commitments, and I wouldn't want to… cause any disruption.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Snerling, we're looking for a variety of things. The blood count will tell us if you're anemic or have any signs of infection. The metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, and your electrolyte balance. The thyroid test is to rule out any thyroid issues, as that can cause fatigue and dizziness. As for whether it's serious… it’s too early to say. It could be something minor, like a vitamin deficiency. Or it could be something more significant, such as high blood pressure. We need the test results to determine the cause. As for the timing… the results should be back in about three to five business days. I’ll have the lab contact you directly when they’re available. Now, I’m going to give you a referral to a neurologist, just as a precaution. They can assess your balance further, and rule out any neurological issues. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: A neurologist… That sounds… rather serious, doesn’t it? I hadn’t anticipated needing to see a specialist. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Three to five business days… and the lab will contact me directly? Wonderful. I suppose that’s all I need to know for now. Thank you, Doctor. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and patience with my… limited recollections. I’m… quite anxious, but I trust your judgment. I suppose I’ll wait for the lab results then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse give you the referral information. And please, if your symptoms worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact the office immediately. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Have a good day, Ms. Snerling. And try to get some rest.
