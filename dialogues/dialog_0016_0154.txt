DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Maskal, is it? Yes, well, it’s… the waterworks, really. They bother me. A lot. It’s been happening on and off, but more on lately, if you understand. I don’t… I don’t rightly remember when it started, exactly. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Claudene. Maskal is correct. And I understand – “the waterworks” meaning you’re having trouble with urination. It's perfectly alright to not remember exact dates, we’ll figure it out. So, it’s been happening on and off, but more frequently recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. More recently. It feels… like a burning, sometimes. And I have to… go a lot. Even when I don’t feel like I need to, if that makes sense. It’s… a nuisance, to be frank. I mostly just want it to stop. Is that… is that enough information? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, you're not taking up too much of my time at all, Claudene. That’s very helpful, actually. Burning with urination and feeling like you need to go frequently, even when you don't, those are important details. Could you tell me a little more about the burning?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s not a constant burn, you see. It comes and goes. It’s usually when I… finish, if you understand. And it’s… not terribly painful, but it’s… irritating. Very irritating. Like… sand, almost. And sometimes there’s a little… discomfort afterward, too. Just a dull ache. I don’t… I don’t know if that helps. It’s hard to explain these things.
DOCTOR: It does help, Claudene, thank you. Burning with urination, and then a lingering discomfort afterward… that gives me a better picture. You’re doing a great job explaining things. Now, when you say “a little discomfort afterward,” can you describe that ache a little more?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s… low down, of course. In my… lower tummy. Not a sharp pain, not like a cramp. Just a… heaviness, almost. And it comes and goes, like the burning. It’s not there all the time. Sometimes it’s worse than others. I… I mostly just ignore it, to be honest. I’m not one for complaining. But it’s been… more noticeable lately, so I thought I should come in. Is this… helpful? I’m not sure I’m being very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Claudene. A low, dull ache, coming and going, and more noticeable recently… yes, that's very helpful. It sounds like you're quite stoic, which I admire, but it's good you came in when things changed. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Oh… changes in the… water? Let me think. Sometimes it’s… darker, I suppose. Not terribly dark, just… not as clear as it used to be. And… I think there was a little… speckling, once or twice. I didn’t pay much attention, to be honest. I just assumed it was something I ate. I drink plenty of water, you see. Always have. I don’t… I don’t know if that means anything. It’s all a bit of a blur, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Darker urine and some speckling… that’s good information. It's good you mentioned the speckling. And drinking plenty of water is excellent. To be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Fever… no, I don’t think so. No chills, either. My back… well, I’m an old woman, Doctor. My back always aches a little! It’s just… old age, you see. Not a sharp pain, just… a general stiffness. I don’t… I don’t know if that’s what you mean. I don’t get sick very often, to be honest. I’ve always been quite healthy. Well, relatively. I… I hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Claudene. You're not taking up too much of my time. And it’s helpful to know about the general back stiffness. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical conditions… Let me think. Well, my… my late husband, he had the sugar. Diabetes, I think it was. But I never did. I was always quite careful with my diet, you see. And… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure once, years ago. But the doctor said it was just stress. It went away on its own, mostly. I… I don’t really go to the doctor much, to be honest. I prefer to just… get on with things. Is that… a problem? I am quite forgetful these days, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a problem at all, Claudene. It's good to know you haven't been diagnosed with diabetes and that your blood pressure issue resolved. Being forgetful is very common, especially as we get older. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries. Let me think… Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… oh! And I had a… a bad fall, years ago, and they had to… fix my hip. That was a long time ago, though. Very long. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. I was… quite young then. And… I think that’s it. Just the tonsils and the hip. I am quite sure. Unless… unless my memory is playing tricks on me again. It does that sometimes, you see. Is this enough? I am getting a bit tired now.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Claudene. Tonsils and a hip repair—thank you. It’s perfectly alright if your memory isn’t crystal clear. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, to be honest. I take a little something for my… for my joints, sometimes. But that’s just over the counter. Nothing serious. I… I don’t like taking pills, if I’m honest. They make me feel… unwell. And… I don’t remember ever being allergic to anything. Is that… a problem? I hope I am not forgetting something important. My mind is not what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Claudene. No known allergies is good to know. And it’s perfectly fine not liking pills! Now, could you tell me a little about the medication you take for your joints?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s just… a little something I got at the drugstore. It’s for… for the arthritis. In my hands, mostly. It’s a… a tablet, I think. A small, white tablet. I can’t remember the name, to be honest. I just… ask for it at the counter. They always know what I mean. It doesn’t do much, to be honest, but it’s… something. I just take one a day, with my breakfast. I… I don’t really pay attention to the details, to be honest. It’s just… a little something to help with the aches and pains. Is that enough information? I am starting to feel rather flustered now. Perhaps we should be finishing up?
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Claudene. It’s alright that you can’t remember the name. Finally, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members who have had kidney problems, bladder cancer, or frequent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… Let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her… with her waterworks, I think. When she got older. But I don't know exactly what it was. Just… trouble. And my sister… she had some sort of… cancer, years ago. But not bladder cancer, I don't think. Something else. I… I don't really keep track of these things, to be honest. We weren't very close, my family. And… I'm afraid my memory is failing me. Perhaps this is enough? I am terribly tired now, Doctor. And I do have an appointment to get my hair done this afternoon. I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. That’s alright. Knowing your mother had some urinary issues and your sister had cancer is helpful. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well… I suppose so. If you must. I’m not very fond of doctors poking around, if I’m honest. But… if it will help, then… yes, alright. Just… be gentle, please. And… don’t take too long. I really must be going soon. Is there… is there anything I need to do? Should I lie down? I am getting rather anxious now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene. We’ll take it very slow and I will be as gentle as possible. You don’t need to lie down, just sit comfortably. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently feel your abdomen. Then, I'll check your reflexes. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Sounds are normal—no unusual noises. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Okay, I’m feeling your abdomen now. It’s soft, but a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. Not alarming, but something to note. Now I'm just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… tenderness, you say? Well, I do get a bit of a tummy ache sometimes, as I said. Probably just that. I’m not very good at describing things, you see. Reflexes… oh dear. I haven’t had my reflexes checked in years! I hope I don’t fail. I’m terribly anxious now, Doctor. Is this going to take much longer? I really must be going soon. My hair appointment… I can't be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, just checking your reflexes now. A little diminished, but not significantly. This is fairly common at your age, Claudene. Alright, everything seems normal overall, Claudene, but given your symptoms – the burning with urination, the frequent urge to go, the tenderness in your lower abdomen, and some darker urine – I think it’s best to do a urine test to rule out an infection. Would you be able to give me a sample?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine test? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It’s not very dignified, is it? But… alright. Where do I… do I go? Is there a special room? I’m not very good at these things, you see. And… will it take long? I really must be going soon. My hair appointment… I can’t be late! I’m starting to feel quite flustered now, Doctor. Perhaps we should just forget the whole thing? I’m sure it’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Claudene. It’s not undignified at all, and it's a very simple test. There’s a private bathroom just down the hall. I’ll give you a cup, and there are instructions inside. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. And we can definitely skip it if you’re not comfortable, but it will help us rule out a urinary tract infection, which is a common cause of your symptoms. Just go when you’re ready, and bring the cup back to me when you’re finished. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A cup, you say? Very well. I suppose… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. A urinary tract infection, you say? Hmm. Alright then. I’ll… I’ll go now. It’s just… down the hall, you say? Very well. Don’t go far, Doctor. I don’t want to get lost. And… do call me if you need anything!
