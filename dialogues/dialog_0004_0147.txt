DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, for the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a lump, low down in my stomach. It doesn't hurt, usually, but it’s… there. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A lump in your lower abdomen, you say. And it’s been present for a few weeks now. Can you be more specific about the location?
PATIENT: If you don't mind me asking, what exactly do you mean by “specific”? I’m not a doctor, so I don’t really have the… the words for it. It’s sort of in the middle, a little below my belly button. More to the left side, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It's...adequate, I suppose. More to the left side. Is it a soft lump, or does it feel quite firm?
PATIENT: It's...not hard, exactly. Not like a stone. It feels...squishy? Like pressing on a bit of… well, like a soft cushion. Not painful when I press it, though. Just… there. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Squishy. Right. And has the size changed at all since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I don't think so. It's hard to say for sure, honestly. Maybe a little bigger? It could just be my imagination, worrying about it. I haven’t been measuring it or anything.
DOCTOR: I see. Has anything caused it, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. Nothing that I can think of, no. No injuries, nothing like that. I haven't done anything different, no heavy lifting or… I don't know. It just sort of appeared, really. My wife thought maybe it was something I ate, at first, but it’s been too long now.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this lump?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, like I said. No… changes in my bathroom habits. No fever or anything like that. Just the lump. Honestly, if it didn't feel so… unusual, I probably wouldn't have bothered coming in. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any previous medical issues that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… nothing major, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a long time ago. I get the usual check-ups with my family doctor, but nothing serious ever came up. My wife keeps telling me I need to be better about preventative care, but… well, you know how it is. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… sufficient. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father had some issues with his stomach, I think, but I'm not really sure what. He passed away a few years ago, and my mother… she doesn’t really talk about it much. Nothing that she ever said sounded like this, though. No cancer or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. Just… general stomach problems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I try to stay away from them as much as possible, if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing daily or anything like that. I prefer herbal teas, honestly. My wife makes a wonderful chamomile.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything my mother ever put in front of me, and I’ve never had a reaction. I do get itchy sometimes, but that’s usually from the pollen, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to examine your abdomen now, if you don't mind. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need you to bend your knees.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to press on your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels painful. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. The lump is palpable – approximately 2cm in diameter. It’s soft, non-tender to palpation, and appears to be somewhat mobile. No rebound tenderness. Auscultation reveals normal bowel sounds in all quadrants.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can feel a little pressure, but no pain, really. Just… aware of it, I suppose. It doesn’t feel worse when you press. That’s… good, right? You said it's mobile? What does that mean, exactly? And what does “2cm” mean, for that matter? I'm sorry to ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: It's…adequate that it isn't painful. Mobile means it moves when I press around it; it’s not fixed to deeper tissues. Two centimeters is about the size of a marble. We'll take some bloodwork to get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: A marble, okay. That… doesn’t sound too bad, I suppose. Bloodwork? What are you looking for, specifically? I'm getting a little worried now, to be honest. Is it something serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We’re looking for signs of inflammation, infection, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions. It is likely nothing serious, but it's important to investigate to be certain. We will also need to do a urine test to rule out any urinary issues.
PATIENT: Okay, urine test, bloodwork… I understand. It's just… all this is a bit much, to be honest. I came in about a lump, and now it's inflammation and ruling things out… My wife is going to be worried sick. What happens next, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? Will I need any other tests?
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to come back – typically three to five business days. Depending on the results, we may need to consider an ultrasound or, less likely, a CT scan. We will proceed based on the findings. It is important to remain calm and not jump to conclusions until we have more information.
PATIENT: Okay, three to five days… and maybe more tests. An ultrasound, you said? What would that show? And if it is something serious… what are we talking about here? I know you probably don't want to scare me, but I’d rather know, honestly. It’s better to be prepared, right? My wife...she's a nurse. She’ll ask a lot of questions, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: An ultrasound would provide a more detailed image of the lump and the surrounding tissues. As for what we’re “talking about,” it’s premature to speculate without the test results. It could be a variety of things - a cyst, a lipoma, a hernia… or something else entirely. We will discuss all possibilities once we have the results. I will provide you with a detailed report, and your wife’s medical background will certainly be helpful.
PATIENT: Okay, a cyst, a lipoma… I'll have to look those up. It's just… waiting is the hardest part, isn’t it? And I don't want to worry my wife unnecessarily. Is there anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Heavy lifting? Exercise? Should I be watching for any specific symptoms? Maybe a fever, or… I don't know. Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting, and any movements that cause you discomfort. Monitor for fever, significant pain, nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your bowel habits. If you experience any of these symptoms, contact my office immediately. Otherwise, try to remain calm and we will address this once we have the test results. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything for now. You've answered all my questions, I suppose. Thank you for your time, and for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I'll get the tests done as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be in touch once the results are available.
