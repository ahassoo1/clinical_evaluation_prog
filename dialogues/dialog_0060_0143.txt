DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it's about… starting a family, I think. My… someone special and I, we’re thinking about having a baby. I thought it was… good to talk to someone first, make sure everything is okay? It’s a bit… confusing, all of it. I'm not so young anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it is prudent to consider these things. At your age, certainly. Sixty-six is… a bit advanced for starting a family, but we can certainly discuss it. So, let’s start with a little background. Have you ever fathered children before, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: No… no, I haven't. Never had the chance, I suppose. Life… things just didn’t work out that way. It’s… a bit embarrassing to say, really. But no, first time, if it… happens. Is that okay? Is it… even possible at my age? I don’t want to get anyone’s hopes up if it’s… silly.
DOCTOR: Well, “silly” isn’t the word I’d use. Uncommon is more accurate. It's certainly… less frequent. There are biological factors to consider, of course. We'll need to look at some tests to assess your overall health and… sperm quality. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. Let me think. I… I think so. A few years ago? Maybe. It was… at a different doctor’s office. I moved around a bit. I don't remember exactly when though. It was… a general check-up, nothing specific. Does that count? I don't have any records, I'm afraid. I'm not very good at keeping those things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's... less than ideal. We'll need to start from scratch then. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Any major illnesses or surgeries you've had?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Oh dear. Let me see. I had… the flu, many times. And… I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. A bad break. Needed a cast. And… I had my appendix out, a long time ago. That was… unpleasant. I don’t remember much else, truthfully. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to. Is that bad? I try to stay healthy. Eat good food, walk a bit… things like that.
DOCTOR: Well, an appendectomy is… relevant. The flu is… not. It sounds as though you’ve been… relatively lucky, health-wise. But "relatively" is the key word. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've taken some pills over the years… for headaches, mostly. And… some antibiotics, when I've been sick. I don’t recall any bad reactions, though. Nothing I remember, anyway. Sometimes, I feel a bit… dizzy after taking medicine. But that might just be me getting old. Is that a sign of an allergy? I really don't know. I haven’t paid much attention.
DOCTOR: Dizziness could be a side effect, or it could be something else entirely. It’s… difficult to say without more information. And frankly, relying on your memory for this is… less than reliable. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Family… oh, that’s tricky. I haven’t seen my family in a very long time. I… we didn't stay in touch. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He was a very quiet man. And my mother… she had… arthritis, I believe. Her hands were always sore. But… that was a long time ago. I don’t know much about my grandparents, or anyone else, really. We didn't talk about those things much. Is that important? Should I be trying to remember more? It’s… difficult. I feel bad that I don’t know.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, but… we can work with what we have. Alright. And finally, a potentially awkward question, but necessary. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. No, not… regularly. I take some pills for my waterworks, sometimes. I have trouble… emptying my bladder, you see. But just when I need them. And… I take some vitamin D, in the winter. Doctor told me to. But that’s it. Nothing else. Really. No special pills or anything. Just those two things, when I need them. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, thank you for being forthcoming. Now, I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and… examine you. It’s standard procedure. And we will need to run some blood tests to assess your overall health and sperm count. This is… non-negotiable, given your age and… the circumstances. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No… no objections. That’s… reasonable, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. A bit nervous, to be honest, but… if it will help, then yes, let’s do it. Please… be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure. And just so you know, it’s important to be realistic about this, Mr. Verrall. Starting a family at sixty-six is… a significant undertaking, with many potential challenges. We need to be prepared for all possibilities. I want to be upfront about that.
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. Realistic. Challenges. I’ve been thinking about that. I’m not expecting… miracles, Doctor. Just… wanted to see if it was possible. And if it’s not… well, at least I’ll know. Just… do your best, please. And thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Let’s listen to your heart. Heart sounds are… regular, but slightly diminished. No murmurs detected. Lungs are… clear to auscultation, but breath sounds are slightly shallow. Now, I'm going to need to palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay… abdominal… yes. Discomfort… I'll let you know. It’s… been a while since anyone poked around in there. Just… be careful, please.
DOCTOR: No tenderness to palpation. Liver and spleen are not enlarged. Now, I'm going to need to examine… other areas. This will be brief. It’s necessary to assess your overall physical health. I’ll keep it as quick and respectful as possible.
PATIENT: … Okay. Quick and respectful. Yes, please. Just… get it over with, I suppose. I… I don’t like being touched. It reminds me of… bad times. But… I understand it’s necessary. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. That concludes the physical exam. As I suspected, there are… some age-related changes, but nothing immediately alarming. Now, we’ll need to draw some blood for testing. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a hormone panel. And, of course, a semen analysis. I’ll give you a requisition form for the blood work, and instructions for the semen analysis. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully, as the results can be affected by… various factors. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: … Semen analysis… yes, I saw that on the form. It… feels a bit intrusive, to be honest. But… if it’s necessary. Intrusive… and embarrassing. But I suppose I’ve already reached this point. No… no questions, Doctor. Just… where do I go for the blood work? And… how long will it take to get the results? That’s all. I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: The lab is located at 123 Main Street. They’re open from 7am to 6pm, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. I must reiterate, Mr. Verrall, that given your age, the chances of success are… limited. It’s important to be realistic about that. But we will proceed with the testing, as you requested. Do you understand?
PATIENT: … Yes, I understand. Limited. Realistic. You’ve said it enough times, Doctor. I know. I’m not expecting miracles. I just… wanted to try. Just wanted to know if it was possible, even a little bit. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go to the lab. And I’ll wait for the results. .
DOCTOR: Very well. You're dismissed. .
