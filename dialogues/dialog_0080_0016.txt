DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… patient, Mr. Henderson. He's been on warfarin for a while now, you know, since his valve replacement. And lately… well, he’s been bruising like a peach. A tiny bump, and suddenly it’s a map of the world on his arm. It's... concerning, frankly. He's a bit of a worrywart, but this is a lot of bruising.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily, especially with minimal trauma, is definitely something we need to investigate with Mr. Henderson’s warfarin use. You said “lately” – how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It's been… oh, I'd say about three weeks, maybe a month. It started subtly, just a little more than usual. But in the last week or so, it’s become… noticeable. He mentioned it at his last check-up, but his primary doctor dismissed it as “getting older.” Honestly, those general practitioners… they don't always appreciate the nuances. It's a bit frustrating, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, it's good you brought it to my attention. Three weeks to a month of progressively worsening bruising – okay. Has he had any actual injuries – falls, bumps against furniture – that correlate with any of the bruising, or is it truly spontaneous, even with very minor contact?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's what's so odd about it. He's a careful man, Mr. Henderson. Doesn't go climbing trees, if you catch my drift. He mentioned knocking his shin against the coffee table a week ago, but the bruise there is… disproportionate. Like, a little tap and suddenly it's the size of my hand. And there’s bruising on his back, and his arms… places he hasn't even touched. It's… unsettling. He swears he hasn’t changed anything about his routine, his diet, anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is concerning. Disproportionate bruising with minimal trauma and unexplained bruising on areas without injury… that definitely warrants a closer look. Let’s go over his medications first, just to be absolutely sure. Besides the warfarin, is he taking anything else – over-the-counter supplements, herbal remedies, pain relievers – anything at all?
PATIENT: Well… He’s rather proud of his little vitamin regimen, actually. He takes a multivitamin, of course. And… let me see… He started taking some… ginkgo biloba, I believe it was, about two months ago. Said it was for his memory. A friend recommended it. And… ah yes, fish oil. He takes a capsule every day for his heart. He's very diligent about those things. Other than that… nothing comes to mind. He's not one for self-treating, generally. Though, I confess, he does enjoy a nightly glass of red wine. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, thank you for telling me. Red wine can interact with warfarin, and both ginkgo biloba and fish oil can have antiplatelet effects, potentially increasing bleeding risk. Okay, so we have warfarin, a multivitamin, ginkgo biloba, fish oil, and regular red wine consumption. Has he had his INR checked recently?
PATIENT: Ah, the INR. Yes, his primary doctor checked it at his last appointment – about two weeks ago, I believe. He said it was “within range.” Though, I’ve found those general practitioners aren’t always as meticulous with these things as a specialist would be. He did mention it was a bit high, like 2.8, but the doctor just adjusted his dose slightly and said it was nothing to worry about. Honestly, I find it frustrating when they downplay these things. It’s our reputations on the line if something goes wrong.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, and I appreciate you bringing all of this to my attention. An INR of 2.8, even if "within range" for some protocols, is on the higher side and, combined with the bruising and the supplements, is definitely raising a red flag. Let's do a quick physical exam to assess the bruising and look for any other signs. Then, I think we need to repeat the INR and potentially order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes for the easy bruising. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’m glad you’re taking this seriously. Honestly, I was beginning to worry I was overreacting, but… Mr. Henderson is a good man. And this just isn't right. Please, go ahead with the exam and the blood work. I’d like to understand what's causing this. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could have Mr. Henderson loosen his clothing, that would be great. I'll start with a visual assessment of the bruising, then listen to his heart and lungs, and quickly check his extremities for any signs of bleeding or swelling. I'll verbalize my findings as I go. Okay, I'm noting multiple ecchymoses on both forearms, ranging in size from approximately 2-8 centimeters. There’s tenderness to palpation in several areas, but no signs of active bleeding. Skin temperature is normal. Let’s take a look at his back now.
