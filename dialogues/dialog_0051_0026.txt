DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Glazewski, is it? Well, it's this tiredness. Just… worn out, all the time. It’s been going on for a bit now, and the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off? Something about my muscles, I think. I don't rightly recall all the details, to be honest. It’s just… debilitating.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ardelle, "numbers being off" can certainly cause tiredness. It’s good you had some lab work done; that gives us a starting point. You mentioned this has been going on for a “bit now”—could you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A bit… well, it feels like… several months, at least. Maybe six? Time just sort of… slips away when you're older, you know? I used to be able to do anything. Commercial diving, you know? Now… just getting out of a chair is a struggle some days. My husband, he helps a lot, bless his heart. He keeps telling me I should slow down, but… well, I've always been busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, time does seem to accelerate as we get older. And it sounds like you've lived a very active life – commercial diving is quite a feat! It’s understandable that feeling this fatigue is frustrating, especially with such a change from your usual activity level. So, about six months of increasing tiredness. Is the tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s mostly constant, I suppose. Though some days are worse than others. Like after… well, after any sort of exertion, really. Even just a bit of gardening. It's not like it used to be. And it’s not just tired, it's… achy. My muscles feel… weak, almost. Like they're going to give out on me. It's a nuisance, honestly. I don't like being dependent on others.
DOCTOR: I understand. Dependence is difficult. So, constant tiredness and muscle weakness and aches, worsened by exertion. Do you notice the aches in specific areas, or is it more general?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly my legs, I think. And my back, a little. Though it sort of… shifts around. Some days it's my shoulders, other days it's my thighs. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. It's not a sharp pain, more like a… dull throbbing. And sometimes… sometimes they just feel heavy. Like I'm wading through mud. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to think I'm just getting old.
DOCTOR: It's good you're being honest with me, Ardelle. Feeling like you're just getting old is a valid feeling, but it's important to rule out other causes for these symptoms. Shifting aches and that heavy feeling are helpful details. Now, besides the tiredness, weakness, and aches, have you noticed any other changes in how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! My husband says I've been a bit… forgetful lately. Though, frankly, I've always been a bit scatterbrained. But he says it's worse. And… I haven’t been sleeping as well. I wake up a lot during the night. Just… restless, mostly. I don’t have any pain when I sleep, just… can’t seem to stay asleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Forgetfulness and restless sleep. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite hasn't been very good, I must say. Everything just… tastes bland. And I think I’ve lost a bit of weight. Not much, but my clothes feel a little looser. My husband keeps trying to get me to eat more, but I just don’t have much of an appetite. It's not like I'm trying to lose weight, you understand. It just… isn't appealing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s good to know. Now, have you had any difficulty with your bowel movements or urination recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, Doctor, you're asking very personal questions now, aren't you? I suppose… no, not really. Everything's been… regular, as they say. No changes there. Though I do find myself having to get up more often during the night to… well, you know. Just old age, I presume.
DOCTOR: Those questions are personal, Ardelle, and I apologize if they made you uncomfortable. They’re important for getting a complete picture of your health. It’s good to know your bowel and bladder habits are regular. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. And I had a bit of a bad knee after a diving accident, but that was… oh, decades ago. And high blood pressure, I suppose. But the doctor put me on pills for that, and I've been taking them ever since. Honestly, I can't remember all the details. I’ve seen a lot of doctors in my time.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ardelle. We’ll take it slowly. So, gallbladder removal, a past knee injury, and high blood pressure managed with medication. Do you know the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now that I don't rightly know. It’s a little white pill. I think it has letters on it… maybe an “A”? I just take it every morning, like the doctor told me. My husband handles the refills, so I don’t usually pay much attention. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good with remembering names of things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. We can look that up. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I've always been able to eat anything I wanted, thankfully. No rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. My husband says I’m a fairly robust woman, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was young. And my brother had diabetes, but he didn't take very good care of himself. He smoked and drank too much. And… I think my aunt had cancer, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, it’s hard to remember. We weren’t very close as a family.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ardelle. It’s helpful to know what you do remember. So, a history of heart problems in your mother, diabetes in your brother, and cancer in an aunt. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke a pipe, but he quit years ago. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Just a small one. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I’m a respectable woman. I've always been very careful about my health.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ardelle. Now, do you live alone or with someone?
PATIENT: I live with my husband, Robert. He's a good man. We've been married for… oh, goodness, nearly 60 years now! He takes good care of me, bless his heart. He does most of the cooking and cleaning these days. I try to help when I can, but I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ardelle. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or how you’ve been feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I suppose… I’ve been feeling a little down lately. Just… not myself. Not as interested in things as I used to be. And I’ve been sleeping more during the day, even though I don’t sleep well at night. It’s hard to explain. Just… a general feeling of unwellness. I don’t think it’s anything serious, though. Just old age, probably.
DOCTOR: It’s good you shared that, Ardelle. Feeling down and increased sleepiness are important things to mention. We'll definitely explore those further. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. I suppose so. Just… don't poke around too much, alright? My bones are a little creaky these days. And be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140 over 85, and your pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits. Now, I’m going to quickly assess your muscle strength and coordination. Could you please try to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Here goes… There. Is that alright? It’s not as strong as it used to be, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. That’s helpful to know. Your grip is weaker than expected, but not dramatically so. Now, let's quickly check your range of motion. Can you please try to raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. There. It's a little stiff, you see? And it aches a bit. I haven't been able to do this easily for some time now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to check your feet for swelling or any signs of neuropathy. There is some slight swelling in your ankles and your sensation appears a little diminished in your feet. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and vitamin B12 levels. We’ll also check your hemoglobin A1c to screen for diabetes and your creatine kinase levels to assess for muscle damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. As long as it helps me figure out what's wrong. I just want to feel like myself again. And maybe get a good night's sleep for once.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. We’ll do everything we can. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend that you continue to take your blood pressure medication as prescribed. I also suggest that you try to get some gentle exercise, like walking, if you’re able, and that you maintain a healthy diet. Now, given your symptoms of fatigue, weakness, low mood, and sleep disturbances, I also want to screen for possible depression. Would you be comfortable answering a few questions about your feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Depression, you say? Well, I don't know about depression. I just… feel tired. And a little down, sometimes. But that's just old age, isn't it? Still… alright, Doctor. I suppose I can answer a few questions. But don’t expect any cheerful answers, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Ardelle. I’m not expecting cheerful answers. We just want to get a better understanding of how you’re feeling. I’ll ask a few simple questions. First, over the past two weeks, have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… not as much as I used to, no. Things just don't seem as… appealing anymore. Gardening doesn't hold the same joy. Even spending time with my husband… it's nice, but I don't have the same energy for it. I suppose that’s not a very good sign, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful that you're sharing this with me, Ardelle. It's not about "good" or "bad" signs, it’s about gathering information. Now, over the past two weeks, have you felt down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I wouldn’t say hopeless, exactly. But… down, yes. Definitely down. Some days I just feel… heavy. Like a weight is pressing on my chest. And it’s hard to get motivated. Hard to even get out of bed, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ardelle. Now, over the past two weeks, have you had trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or have you been sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you’re asking about my sleep again. It's just awful, Doctor. I wake up so many times during the night. Toss and turn, can't get comfortable. And then I'm tired all day, but I can’t sleep when I finally get into bed. It’s a vicious cycle. I think I do sleep more during the day, now that you mention it. Little naps here and there. But it's not restful sleep.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. Just a few more questions. Now, have you had a poor appetite or lost interest in eating?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My appetite is just… gone, it seems. Everything tastes bland, and I don't have much energy to cook anyway. My husband keeps trying to get me to eat, bless his heart, but I just can't seem to get interested in food. I think I’ve lost a bit of weight, too. My clothes feel looser, but I haven't weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. Okay, based on your responses and your overall symptoms, it’s possible that you are experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to remember that depression is a common condition, and it’s treatable. The blood work we're ordering will help rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. Would you be open to discussing these options further if the blood work supports a diagnosis of depression?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Depression… really? I always thought of myself as a strong woman. I've been through a lot in my life, and I've always managed to pull myself together. To think I might be… depressed… it’s a little disheartening. But… yes, Doctor. If that's what's going on, I suppose I'm willing to try something. I just want to feel like myself again. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Ardelle. It takes courage to admit that you might need help, and I commend you for being willing to explore treatment options. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting those blood work results back. I’ll also give you a handout with some information about depression, including symptoms, treatment options, and resources for support. And I’m going to give you a referral to a local therapist who specializes in geriatric depression. You’re not alone in this, and there are people who can help you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A therapist? Well… I don’t know about talking to a stranger about my problems. But… alright. If you think it would help, I suppose I can give it a try. Just… don’t expect me to open up right away, alright? And is this… covered by my insurance? My husband handles all the finances, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I completely understand your hesitation. It's perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about talking to a therapist. You are in control of what you share, and you can go at your own pace. As for insurance coverage, yes, the therapist I’m referring you to accepts Medicare, so it should be covered. I’ll provide you with her contact information and details about scheduling an appointment. Now, let’s recap. We’ve ordered blood work to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. I’ve given you a referral to a therapist who specializes in geriatric depression. And I’ve provided you with a handout with information about depression. I want you to follow up with me once you have your blood work results, and we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I think that covers everything, Doctor. I'm a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But thank you for taking the time to listen to me. And thank you for not dismissing me as just an old woman. I suppose I’ll just wait for the blood work results, then. And maybe… maybe look into this therapist. Robert will be glad to hear you mentioned Medicare. He worries about the bills. Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ardelle. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could listen. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please remember, you're not alone in this. I’m here to help in any way I can. I’ll see you once those results are back. Have a good day, and try to get some rest.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. You too. I suppose I’ll be going now. It was nice meeting you as well.
