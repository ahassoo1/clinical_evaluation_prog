DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you too. Well, I’m planning a cruise, you see – a rather lovely one to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They need a doctor to sign off on a few things, just to be sure I’m fit to travel. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s very sensible of them. A Mediterranean cruise sounds wonderful! So, it’s mostly a general check-up for travel clearance, then?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A general check-up. I don't have any particular concerns, thankfully. Just the standard form they sent, really. I’m a fairly healthy woman, all things considered. Though, I was widowed five years ago, and that took a bit out of me, but I'm doing much better now. I suppose they want to know about any history, and if I’m on any medicines, which I’m not.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And I appreciate you sharing that about your husband. Loss is difficult, and it's important to acknowledge those things. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a regular doctor for check-ups?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I used to see Dr. MacIntyre back in Inverness, before I moved here. He was a good man. I went for an annual check-up every year, and a dental visit too, of course. I haven't been to a doctor since I moved, though. It’s been about two years now, I suppose. I’ve been feeling well enough that I didn’t think it was necessary, but this cruise…well, they’re very particular.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable. It's good you were keeping up with things before, and it’s smart to get checked out before a trip like this. Do you recall any significant medical problems Dr. MacIntyre treated you for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not at all. I had the usual things, I suppose. A bad bout of the flu a few years back, and I broke my wrist when I was younger, a silly accident with a horse. Other than that… I had some trouble with my blood pressure once, but it came down with a change in diet and a bit of exercise. Dr. MacIntyre said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much, just to watch my salt intake. He did a lot of blood tests over the years, but I don’t recall anything being particularly wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. High blood pressure in the past, but well-controlled with lifestyle changes. That's excellent. And you mentioned blood tests – do you happen to know what they were testing for specifically, or have access to any records from Dr. MacIntyre?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Records…no, I don't think so. It was all so long ago, and I didn't keep much track of things. He did a general health screen every year, I believe – cholesterol, blood sugar, that sort of thing. And sometimes he’d check my thyroid, I recall, because my mother had some trouble with that. But I wouldn't know the specific numbers, I’m afraid. I just let him take care of it all. I always trusted his judgement. It’s a shame he retired, really.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s good you had a doctor you trusted. We can work with what we have, then. Let's move on to any current medications you're taking, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements. You mentioned you aren’t on any, is that correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Nothing at all. I take a cup of herbal tea sometimes, for relaxation, but it’s just chamomile, nothing medicinal. I try to eat a healthy diet – lots of fish and vegetables – and I walk most days. I believe in keeping things natural, if you understand. I don't like to fill my body with unnecessary things.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. That’s a very sensible approach. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken wrist you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, never. Not a one. I’ve been very fortunate, thankfully. The broken wrist was when I was a young girl, climbing a fence. A silly thing, really. And a few childhood illnesses, like measles and chickenpox, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious enough to require a hospital stay or surgery. I’ve always been a strong, healthy woman. I take good care of myself, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. And to finish up on your medical background, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother, as I mentioned, had some trouble with her thyroid. She was always a bit frail, and tired easily. My father was a strong man, a fisherman, but he had heart trouble in his later years. He smoked, you see, which I always thought was foolish. My brother is healthy enough, as far as I know, though we don’t see each other often. He lives in Canada. I suppose there’s a bit of a tendency towards heart problems on my father’s side, and thyroid issues on my mother’s. But nothing too dramatic, really. A fairly typical family history, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview. Thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all that's bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Nothing at all. That's why I haven't been to a doctor in so long, you see. I feel perfectly well. A bit of stiffness in my joints sometimes, after a long walk, but nothing a hot bath doesn't fix. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, but I wear glasses, as you can see. But that’s just age, I suppose. Nothing to worry about. I really am quite healthy, Doctor. I feel very fortunate.
DOCTOR: That's excellent news. Just to be thorough, and to complete the check-up for the cruise line, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I understand it's all part of making sure I'm fit to travel. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, go right ahead. I'm quite comfortable.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning, given that you mentioned some past issues. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. Now, could I take a quick look at your throat and ears?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm quite comfortable. I always try to stay hydrated, you see, which I suppose helps keep everything clear. I drink plenty of water. And I’ve always been careful to avoid catching a cold. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. I just want to make sure everything is in order before I go on this cruise. It's a rather special trip, you see.
DOCTOR: Everything looks clear in your throat and ears. No signs of infection or inflammation. Your ears have some normal wax build-up, but nothing concerning. Overall, you appear to be in good health. Your vital signs are stable, and your physical exam is unremarkable. However, your slightly elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. Given your history, I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home, and maintaining your healthy lifestyle – a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate hydration. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I am happy to do that. I do have a blood pressure cuff at home, actually, I bought it a few years ago when I was watching my salt intake. I haven't used it much lately, but I can certainly start again. And I will continue to eat healthy and get plenty of exercise, as I always do. I believe in taking good care of myself, you see. It’s just a matter of being mindful. And I appreciate you pointing out the blood pressure, just to be on the safe side. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Anything I need to do before the cruise?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. Given your overall health and the fact that you're not experiencing any symptoms, I don't see any reason to prevent you from enjoying your cruise. However, it’s always wise to be prepared. I recommend packing a basic first-aid kit with essentials like pain relievers, antiseptic wipes, and bandages. And make sure you have any necessary medications, even over-the-counter ones, with you. And, of course, stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun. I’m happy to sign off on the medical form for the cruise line. I’ll also provide you with a summary of our consultation, including the blood pressure recommendation, for your records. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds absolutely perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and attention. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and your reassuring manner. It's put my mind at ease. A summary of the consultation would be wonderful, and I'll be sure to pack a first-aid kit. I'm very much looking forward to this cruise, and I feel much more confident knowing I've had a check-up. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Any paperwork I need to sign?
DOCTOR: No, no further paperwork is needed. I'll print the summary and the completed cruise line form for you now. Here you are. This is a summary of our consultation, including the recommendation to monitor your blood pressure at home. And this is the completed medical form for the cruise line. I wish you a wonderful and safe cruise, Velda! If you experience any concerning symptoms while traveling, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. And if you don't mind, I'd appreciate a quick update when you return, just to hear how things went. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: That is very kind of you, Doctor. Thank you so much for everything. I will certainly keep you updated when I return. I truly appreciate your care and attention. You’ve put my mind completely at ease, and I'm feeling much more confident about my trip now. I hope you have a lovely day, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Velda. I'm glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful time!
