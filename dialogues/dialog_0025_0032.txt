DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… a rather delicate matter, you understand. Not something a man generally discusses so freely. It’s… a bit of a leak, shall we say? Been going on for a week or so now. Quite bothersome, really. And frankly, it’s undignified. I haven’t the slightest idea why it would be happening at my age.
DOCTOR: A leak, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A… discharge. I suppose that’s the proper term. It's not… a flood, thankfully. But enough to require… attention. And, well, my wife insisted I come. She’s a very practical woman, you see. Always has been. I don’t recall anything like this happening before. Not ever. Is this… common, at my age?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. We’ll get to the bottom of this. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in. It can be common as men age, but that doesn’t mean it should be ignored. First, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s… clearish. Not bloody, thankfully. And not particularly… pungent, if you understand. Though there is a bit of… odor, yes. A faint one. And it’s… slippery. Like… well, like water, almost. But not quite. I suppose that’s the best way to put it. Honestly, Doctor, it’s most unpleasant to contemplate, let alone describe. It's happening after… after using the facilities. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. So, clear, slightly slippery, with a faint odor, occurring after urination. Any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain… not exactly pain, Doctor. More… a bit of discomfort. A stinging sensation, perhaps. Very mild, though. Barely noticeable, really. I wouldn’t call it painful. And no, not during urination, specifically. It's just… afterwards. A bit of a burning feeling, like a slight irritation. It fades quickly, mind you. It’s not… debilitating, if that’s what you’re asking. Though it’s unsettling, naturally. I don't know if that's relevant. Is this something I should be worried about? My son, the engineer, says I should see a specialist. But I prefer to keep things local, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Discomfort and a stinging sensation afterwards. We need to rule a few things out. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none of that. No fever, no chills. And my abdomen feels perfectly normal, thank you. Perhaps a bit of a rumble after lunch, as usual, but nothing out of the ordinary. I feel quite… robust, actually. Considering my age, that is. I’ve always been a strong man. Worked the land my entire life. Though I suppose even a strong man can have… minor inconveniences. I just don’t want anything serious. My wife… she worries so. Is this something contagious, by any chance? I wouldn’t want to… pass anything on.
DOCTOR: Contagious is unlikely, given your description. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. I don’t believe so, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather… resilient. A bit of hay fever in the spring, perhaps, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Nothing serious, certainly. No reactions to any medications, to my knowledge. My wife handles most of that, you see. She keeps track of everything. I take a bit of something for my arthritis, now and then, but it’s… a common pill. I can't recall the name. Is that important? I don't keep up with these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned something for arthritis. Do you know the dosage or when you started taking it?
PATIENT: Dosage… oh dear. No, Doctor, I really don't. My wife handles all that. She puts the pills in a little container each week. I just take them as instructed. Started… oh, I suppose it's been five or six years now? Maybe longer. I started feeling a bit stiff in the knees, and she took me to the doctor, and he prescribed something. I trust her implicitly, you see. She’s very organized. I wouldn't know the dosage if my life depended on it. Perhaps she could… call you? Would that be acceptable? I’m just terrible with these details. It's always been her domain.
DOCTOR: That would be helpful, yes. Alright. Now, have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I’ve been remarkably healthy, all things considered. A few childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, the usual things – but nothing serious. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but it healed perfectly. That’s about it. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I’ve always been a strong believer in fresh air and hard work. And, well, good luck, I suppose. My wife says it’s genetics. Her father lived to be ninety-five. Though he did have a bit of trouble with his prostate, now that I think about it. Is that… relevant? Perhaps this is something hereditary? I do worry. It is unsettling, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, no hospitalizations, and a family history of prostate issues. Now, one last question for now. Are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, I take a bit of something for my blood pressure, now and then. My wife keeps track of it, you see. She says it gets a little high sometimes. And… oh, yes! I take a multivitamin every morning. Just a standard one, you know, to keep me going. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if I'm feeling a bit stiff, I take an ibuprofen. But that's only when I really need it. Is that all? My wife… she might have a better list. She’s very thorough. I tend to forget these things. I just try to stay active and eat a good diet. And take what she tells me to take. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Thank you, Mr. Krok. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, certainly. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle. I'm not as spry as I used to be. And… perhaps explain what you're doing as you go? I'm a bit old-fashioned, you see. I like to know what's happening. Though I'm sure you're very professional. My wife says you're the best in the area. Go ahead, then. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses. Now, I'll need to do a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess the prostate. It's a standard part of the examination for men experiencing these symptoms. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Oh dear. Well… if it’s absolutely necessary, Doctor. I suppose it is. I’ve heard… things. It’s not a pleasant prospect, is it? But… if it will help determine the cause of this… affliction, then I suppose I must endure it. Just… please be as quick as possible. And… discreet, if you would be so kind. My wife… she wouldn’t be pleased if I came home… distressed. Go ahead, then. But warn me before you… begin. I’m a bit sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your apprehension. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain each step as I go. Now, I’m going to ask you to lean forward slightly. Now, I’m palpating the prostate. The prostate is… slightly enlarged. It feels… firm, but without any acutely tender areas. No obvious masses. Alright, that's all for now. It wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: Well… it wasn’t pleasant, Doctor. But… I suppose it’s over now. Slightly uncomfortable, yes. And… a bit undignified. But I endured it. Slightly enlarged, you say? Is that… serious? Firm… what does that mean? Is it… cancer? My son, the engineer, says everything is cancer these days. I just want to know… is it something I need to worry about? And… what do we do now? I hope we don't have to repeat that again anytime soon. I'm rather shaken, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. I understand your anxiety. The fact that the prostate is slightly enlarged is common for men your age. However, the firmness is something we need to investigate further. It doesn’t automatically mean cancer, but we can't rule it out without additional testing. I’d like to order a Prostate-Specific Antigen blood test and a urine analysis. The PSA test measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate prostate cancer, but can also be caused by other conditions, like an enlarged prostate or infection. The urine analysis will help us rule out any infection. Based on those results, we may need to consider a referral to a urologist for a more thorough evaluation, possibly including a biopsy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a urine sample. More tests. And… a biopsy? That sounds… invasive. My son, the engineer, says biopsies are always… risky. Is there no other way? Are you certain this is necessary? I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, Doctor. I’m an old man, you see. I’ve lived a long life. I just want to get this sorted out with as little… disruption as possible. Is there any chance it’s just… an infection? That would be much preferable. And what about this urologist? Are they… good? My wife insists on the best, you understand. She’s very particular. I suppose if you recommend it… but I’d rather not if we can avoid it. Perhaps we could wait and see? Monitor the symptoms? I don't want to get ahead of ourselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. Waiting and seeing is an option, but it carries the risk of delaying diagnosis and treatment if it is something serious. While an infection is possible, the firmness I felt during the exam raises some concern. The PSA test is a relatively simple blood draw, and the urine analysis is just a sample. These tests will give us a better understanding of what's going on before we consider any more invasive procedures. I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma, a urologist in the city. She’s highly respected and has excellent patient reviews. I wouldn’t recommend someone I didn't trust. If the PSA level is elevated, or if the urine analysis shows signs of infection that doesn't resolve with treatment, then a referral to Dr. Sharma would be the next step. She'll discuss the risks and benefits of a biopsy with you if it’s deemed necessary. For now, let's focus on getting these initial tests done. I'll write you a requisition for the blood work and urine analysis. You can schedule an appointment at the lab whenever it's convenient for you. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A reasonable plan, I suppose. Blood tests and a urine sample. And… Dr. Sharma, if necessary. I trust your judgment, you see. You seem… competent. And I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll schedule the tests. But… please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I’m an old man, as I said. I just want to get this sorted out with as little… fuss as possible. And… if it is something serious… please be honest with me. I don’t want any sugarcoating. Just… the facts. My wife… she’ll want to know everything. She’s very practical, you see. Very direct. Alright, then. The tests. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. And your… discretion. I’m not used to discussing these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand. I will be honest with you every step of the way. And I respect your privacy. Here are the requisitions. The lab is just down the street. I'll have my receptionist schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, difficulty urinating, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Just… the tests. And the follow-up appointment. I suppose I should… try not to worry. But it’s difficult, you understand. Old age… it brings all sorts of… anxieties. I appreciate your… reassurance. And your… thoroughness. Thank you again. I think that will be all. I suppose I’ll… see you next week. Good day, Doctor. And thank you, once again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krok. Take care of yourself, and try not to stress too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. I'll see you next week. .
PATIENT: .
