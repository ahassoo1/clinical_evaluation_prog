DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just thought… a little encouragement from a real doctor might do the trick. My daughter thinks I worry too much. Says I need a “Get Well” card, believe it or not! From you. She says your words have… weight. Honestly, the girl has strange ideas.
DOCTOR: A… reassurance visit?
PATIENT: Reassurance? I suppose that's a fancy way of putting it. It's not like I'm sick sick. Just… unsettled. My husband, bless his heart, he doesn’t understand either. Always says, “Just think positive!” as if that solves everything. It’s very frustrating. A nice card, from a professional… that's all I’m after. You are a professional, aren't you? A proper doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Micucci, I am a doctor. Twenty-five years, to be exact. Though I usually deal with… more defined medical issues. Still, I suppose a second opinion on your worries isn’t a bad thing. Can you tell me what specifically is making you feel unsettled?
PATIENT: Oh, twenty-five years, that’s… a long time. Well, it’s my grandson, mostly. He moved to the city, you see. Kathmandu. Big city. Full of… people. And things. He’s trying to be a musician. A drummer. Can you imagine? All that noise! My daughter says I need to be supportive, but honestly, it just feels… risky. A good boy going off to… that. And what if he gets sick? No proper food, probably. Or friends. It’s just… a lot. I worry about everything, I suppose. I always have. It's just… easier when everyone stays close. Do you… write encouraging things on these cards? About good choices?
DOCTOR: Kathmandu… right. And you’re concerned about his well-being, his lifestyle… It sounds like this is causing you a significant amount of anxiety. Is this a new feeling, or have you always been prone to worry?
PATIENT: Oh, always. My mother was the same way. Worried about everything. The goats, the crops, the weather… always something. It's in the family, I suppose. But it’s worse now, with him so far away. I can’t just… go check on him, can I? It's not like the old days. Everything is so complicated now. And my daughter says I’m smothering him. Smothering! As if caring for your grandson is a bad thing. Honestly, the youth of today… they have no sense. So, can you write something nice, Doctor? Just… something to remind me he’ll be alright? And maybe, something about making good decisions? It wouldn’t hurt, would it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, it sounds like you’re experiencing a lot of stress related to your grandson's move and your concerns for his safety and well-being. While I'm happy to offer some reassurance, it seems like this anxiety is quite pervasive and has been a lifelong pattern. Before I write anything, perhaps we should briefly go over your general health?
PATIENT: Oh, health? Really, Doctor? I just want a card. I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. Strong as an ox, I am! Always have been. I walk everywhere, I cook for my husband, I even help with the garden sometimes. It’s this worrying that's the problem, not my… insides. Are you saying you don't just write cards sometimes? That a doctor can't offer a little bit of comfort without asking about… things? I thought you were a compassionate man, Doctor. Twenty-five years, you said? I’m starting to wonder… honestly. Just the card, please. A few kind words. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand your frustration. And I can write a note. However, as a physician, I also have a responsibility to ensure that your overall well-being is addressed. Anxiety can manifest physically, and it’s important to rule out any underlying issues. It would just take a few moments. A quick check of your blood pressure, perhaps?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Now you want to take my blood pressure? After twenty minutes of talking about my grandson? Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. You're making me more anxious! I came here for a simple kindness, and now you're trying to… poke and prod me? No. Absolutely not. I think I'll just… go. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. And I’ll ask my daughter to find someone else to write me a nice card. Someone who understands a little bit of… compassion. Good day, Doctor. Honestly. Twenty-five years… you’d think you’d have learned something about people by now. .
