DOCTOR: Hi Venard, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you as well, Doctor… Ranjan, was it? Honestly, it’s all rather a blur. Something about needing… paperwork. For my profession, you see. A certification, I believe they called it. It’s terribly inconvenient, all this revisiting things. I simply can’t keep track of these… requirements.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It sounds like you’re here for a medical clearance or certification requirement for work. That’s very common! I can definitely help with that. Just to be sure, and to get a good picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit more about what your profession is, and what specifically the certification requires?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a question. It’s… healthcare, naturally. A practitioner of sorts. Technical, they called it. Honestly, the details escape me. It involves… equipment. And… people, I suppose. As for the specifics of the certification… something about my ears and eyes? They said I needed to be… up to standard. It’s all rather demeaning, frankly. I was quite accomplished in my field, you know. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a healthcare professional involving equipment... and they’re requesting an eye and ear exam for the certification. That helps narrow things down. No problem at all, we can absolutely do those exams today. Just so I have a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Really, Doctor? Must we delve into such… personal matters? I assure you, I’m a perfectly healthy man. Perhaps a little forgetful, as you may have noticed, but otherwise quite robust. I haven’t been… ill in years. Though, my ex-wife… she was always convinced I had something. A nervous condition, or something of the sort. She was a rather… dramatic woman. Honestly, I doubt she even knew what a stethoscope was.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Venard. It’s not about doubting you, it’s just standard practice to get a full history to make sure everything is in good working order, and to rule out anything that might affect the certification. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, it helps to have a complete picture. We can keep it brief if you prefer. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – even something minor?
PATIENT: Minor conditions? Well… there was that time I had a rather nasty bout of… indigestion. After a particularly… rich dinner. And I believe I had the flu, once. Though, it wasn’t proper flu, you understand. More of a… cold. A very unpleasant cold. As for diagnoses… I don't recall any. My ex-wife, again, was always trying to get me to see doctors. Claimed I was “stressed.” Nonsense, of course. A little hard work never hurt anyone. Honestly, it’s all rather… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major medical conditions, occasional indigestion and a cold. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Now that is a question. I… vaguely recall something. When I was quite young, perhaps? A… tonsil removal, maybe? Or was it an appendix? It was decades ago, and frankly, not something I dwell on. Hospitalized… I believe I spent a night once, with a rather severe… backache. Pulled a muscle lifting… something. Equipment, I think. It was all rather undignified. Honestly, I loathe hospitals. The smell… and all those… people. It’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalization for a back muscle strain. We’ll mark those down as “possible” for now. Now, just a couple more questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have had any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh, goodness. That’s a whole other… ordeal. My parents are… were, rather distant. Never much for conversation. My siblings… I haven't spoken to them in decades. A rather… complicated relationship, you see. As for medical conditions… I honestly have no idea. They were always rather… private people. I believe my mother had… something with her stomach. And my father… well, he simply worked himself to death, I suppose. A very dedicated man. But serious conditions? I couldn’t say. It’s all rather… irrelevant, isn’t it? I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve said. It’s my own constitution, you see. Superior genetics.
DOCTOR: Alright, limited information on family history, mother with a possible stomach issue, father with work-related exhaustion. That’s alright. Now, let's move on to allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Really, Doctor? I’m a Norwegian man. We’re made of tougher stuff. I’ve eaten everything imaginable, from fermented shark to… well, you wouldn’t want to know. No, I have no allergies. And medications… I haven’t taken a pill in… decades. I believe I once took something for a headache. A very mild headache. But beyond that… no. I prefer natural remedies, you see. Fresh air, good food, hard work. That’s all one needs. Honestly, all these… chemicals. It’s quite unsettling. Are you quite finished with your… questioning? I should think we’ve covered enough personal details.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Venard. Just a few quick questions about your lifestyle, and then we can move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Good heavens, Doctor! Do I look like the sort? I am a man of… principle. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. A very small glass. And I used to smoke a pipe, years ago. A very sophisticated pipe. But I gave it up, you see. For my health. As for anything else… absolutely not. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book. Honestly, the thought… It’s quite appalling. I should think I’ve answered enough personal inquiries. Can we finally proceed with the examination? This is rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, Venard. We can proceed with the examination now. I just need to ask one last thing, and it is to confirm, do you have any history of dizziness, ringing in the ears, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Dizziness… occasionally, perhaps? When I stand up too quickly. Old age, you know. And ringing in the ears… now that’s… a curious thing. Sometimes, yes. A faint ringing. Like… distant bells. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure. And hearing loss… well, I suppose my hearing isn’t what it used to be. Everything seems a bit… muffled these days. But that’s simply a sign of age, isn't it? It's hardly a catastrophe. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to feel rather… interrogated. Can we please move on with this examination? I have a very important… appointment later. A very important… something. It's slipping my mind, naturally. But it's quite pressing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venard. We'll move on to the physical exam now. It will just involve a quick look in your ears and a basic hearing test. I'm going to have you sit up and face away from me. First, I'm going to take a look in your ears. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with, then. Honestly, I do wish these medical examinations weren't so… invasive. And frankly, I expect you to be gentle. My ears are quite sensitive, you know. And please, try not to poke too deeply. It's rather unsettling. I trust you've sterilized that… instrument? One can never be too careful, naturally. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick look… I see a bit of cerumen buildup in your left ear canal, which is quite common. The eardrum looks intact, but a little dull. Now, let’s take a look at your right ear. Similar findings in the right ear – cerumen buildup and a slightly dull eardrum. It may be affecting your hearing a bit. Alright, that wasn't too bad, was it?
PATIENT: It was… tolerable. Though, I do feel a slight… pressure. And a rather unpleasant tickling sensation. As for the pressure… it's not entirely unexpected, naturally. Cerumen, you say? A build-up? Honestly, I haven't paid much attention to the state of my ears. I have more important matters to concern myself with. What does this… build-up mean exactly? Is it serious? I trust it's nothing too debilitating. I have a very important engagement later, you see. And I simply haven't the time for… complications.
DOCTOR: It’s not serious at all, Venard. Cerumen – that’s earwax – is a natural protection for your ear canal. But sometimes, it can build up and block your hearing. It’s very common, especially as we get older. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing test. I'm going to put these headphones on, and I'll play some tones at different pitches. Just raise your hand whenever you hear a tone. It's a simple test, and won't take long. Okay, let’s start with your right ear. Let me know when you hear something.
PATIENT: Very well. Though, I must warn you, my hearing isn't what it used to be. I’m sure this test will be… inconclusive. And I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a very… pressing appointment later, you see. A rather important… something. It’s slipping my mind, naturally. But it’s quite urgent. Just… get on with it. And please, keep the volume at a reasonable level. I don't want to be subjected to any… unpleasant noises. Did you say something? I believe I detected a faint… hum. Very faint, indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm noting that response. We’ll repeat the test at different frequencies. Okay… and now the left ear. Okay, that’s all. Based on the results of the hearing test and the physical exam, it appears you have mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, likely due to age and the cerumen buildup. It doesn’t seem severe, but it’s enough to explain why you might be having trouble hearing certain sounds. I can remove the cerumen if you’d like, which should improve your hearing. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you like me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: Remove the… cerumen? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds rather… invasive. And frankly, I’m not entirely convinced this… hearing loss is a problem. I manage perfectly well, thank you very much. I simply… concentrate a little harder. And perhaps people don’t speak clearly enough these days. It’s hardly my fault. However… if it’s required for this… certification, then I suppose I have no choice. But I insist on a gentle touch. And please, no unnecessary poking. It’s quite unsettling. Very well. Proceed with the… removal. But do be careful. And hurry up. I have a very important… something to attend to later. It’s quite urgent, naturally. Though, I can’t quite recall what it is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venard. I understand your concerns. I’ll be very gentle, and it should only take a few minutes. I'll use a special tool and a gentle irrigation to remove the wax. It might feel a little cool, but it shouldn't be painful. I'm just going to put a few drops of this solution in your ear now… and then I'll gently flush it out with warm water. Okay, all done. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: It was… tolerable. Though, I do feel a slight… dampness. And a rather unpleasant tickling sensation. Honestly, I’m not entirely convinced this procedure was necessary. I simply can’t see the point of… poking around in one’s ears. However… if it’s required for this… certification, then I suppose I have no choice. Now, can we finally get to the paperwork? I have a very important engagement later, you see. A rather urgent… something. It’s slipping my mind, naturally. But it’s quite pressing. Is there anything else you need to… examine? Please, let’s just get this over with. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: No, Venard, that’s all I need for today. I’ll just write up a summary of your exam findings and a note for your certification. Based on my examination, you have mild high-frequency hearing loss in both ears, likely due to age and cerumen buildup, which we’ve addressed. You are otherwise in good health. Here’s the paperwork you’ll need for your certification. It includes a summary of my findings and a statement confirming you are fit to perform your duties. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Hmm. “Fit to perform duties.” Adequate, I suppose. Though, it doesn't exactly capture my… exceptional abilities. No, I believe that is all. Though, I must say, this entire process has been rather… tedious. And frankly, I’m still unsure what this “certification” is for. Very well. Thank you for your… assistance. Though, I doubt I’ll be returning anytime soon. I have a very important engagement later, you see. A rather urgent… something. It’s slipping my mind, naturally. But it's quite pressing. Good day to you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venard. If you remember what that engagement is, feel free to give the clinic a call if anything comes up. Have a good day, and be careful! .
