DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome. I’m Dr. Panjoj. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. I understand wanting to get this sorted quickly. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: It is… a sharp pain. Mostly on my left side. It started about three weeks ago, I think. Working, you know, with the fences. Lifting posts. It has not gotten better. It is worse when I bend.
DOCTOR: Alright, sharp pain on the left side, starting about three weeks ago with fence work – lifting posts. And it's worsened with bending. Good. That gives me a starting point. Can you describe where exactly on your left side the pain is located?
PATIENT: It is… low. Lower back. Not high up. More towards the side, where the hip is. Hard to explain, Doctor. It feels… deep. Not on the skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back, towards the side near the hip, and a deep pain, not superficial. That’s helpful. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly when I move. When I am sitting still, it is… dull. But any kind of lifting or twisting… that brings the sharp pain back quickly. It is very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's a dull ache when resting, and sharp with movement, especially lifting and twisting. Does anything relieve the pain, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Sometimes… when I lie flat. On my back. But I cannot lie still all day, Doctor. I have work to do. And the medicine… the pain pills the other doctor gave me… they did not help much. Just made me feel tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat offers some relief, but isn’t practical. And the pain medication wasn’t effective and caused fatigue. Let's get a bit more information. Have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. My legs feel… normal. I can walk. I can stand. It is just… the pain when I do things. It does not go down my legs.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s reassuring. Now, have you had any back problems before – any previous injuries, surgeries, or chronic pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing before this. I have always been strong. Worked hard my whole life. This is new. Very frustrating, to be slowed down like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior back issues. That’s good to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: I have Medicare. And… I try to eat well. Mostly meat and vegetables. I do not drink much alcohol, and I do not smoke. I have been a widow for five years now. That is… all. I do not have any other illnesses that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Medicare, healthy diet, no smoking or excessive alcohol, and you've been a widow for five years – I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let's briefly talk about any allergies you might have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have never had a reaction to anything. Nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No. Not anything regularly. I took those pain pills the other doctor gave me, but I stopped. They didn’t help and made me sleepy. That is all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay, Ms. Reihner. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination of your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As long as it does not take too long. I have work waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as efficient as possible. Please lie flat on your stomach for me. Okay, I'm just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles on either side. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Alright, Ms. Reihner, I'm noticing some tenderness and muscle spasm on your left side, which explains the pain you're experiencing. I’m also observing some limitation in your range of motion. Do you feel any pain radiating down your leg as I do this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain down my leg. Just in my back. Like a… tight band. That’s what it feels like. The pressure you are putting… it hurts, but it is the same hurt I have already. Not going down my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain radiating down your leg. That’s helpful. Now, can you stand up for me and slowly bend forward, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: It hurts, Doctor. I can't go very far. It feels… locked. Like something is stopping me. And it is painful. I need to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, stop when you feel discomfort. That's perfectly alright. Alright, thank you. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it seems likely you have a lumbar strain, a pulled muscle in your lower back. However, to rule out other possibilities, like a disc issue or other structural problems, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is that necessary, Doctor? I just want something to make the pain go away. Can you give me something for it? I have work to do. I do not have time for… pictures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Reihner. An X-ray will help us to be sure what we’re dealing with and ensure there’s no more serious underlying cause for your pain. While a muscle strain is the most likely diagnosis, it’s important to rule out anything more serious, such as a fracture or other structural issue. We want to make sure we're providing the best and safest treatment for you. If we skip the X-ray and it is something more serious, it could potentially lead to long-term complications. However, if you're strongly opposed to the X-ray at this time, we can discuss some initial treatment options, such as muscle relaxants and pain relievers. But please understand, without the X-ray, we're making a diagnosis based on assumption. Would you like to consider those options?
PATIENT: I do not want to be exposed to… radiation. And I do not have time for more appointments. Just give me something for the pain. Something that will let me work. That is all I ask. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If you think it is just a muscle, give me something to relax it. But no more pictures. No more waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, I understand your concerns and respect your wishes. Given your strong preference, and acknowledging the potential risk of not obtaining an X-ray, we can proceed with a trial of medication. I will prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help ease the spasm and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug for the pain. It’s important to take these as directed and avoid activities that worsen your pain. I’ll also recommend applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, and gentle stretching when you’re able to tolerate it. However, if your pain worsens, doesn't improve within a week, or you develop any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, it is crucially important that you come back in immediately, and we'll reconsider the X-ray. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Very clear. No worsening. No numbness. Just… better. And I will try to rest. As much as possible. Can I get the prescription now? I need to get back to work. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. Here are your prescriptions for the muscle relaxant and NSAID. Please take them as directed. I will also give you a printed handout with instructions on proper back care and stretching exercises. Remember, if anything changes, or if your pain doesn't improve, please come back in right away. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you for your time. I will try to take care of myself. And get back to work.
