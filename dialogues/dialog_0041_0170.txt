DOCTOR: Hi Waleed, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. I’m here for, uh, a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out before they give me a policy. It’s a medical exam for the insurance company. I just wanna get it over with, if that’s okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical – totally reasonable. We can definitely get that done for you. It's pretty standard, just a check-up to make sure everything's looking good. Just to confirm, is this a specific form they gave you, or is it just a general check-up request?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, they gave me a form. A long one. It said… something about a medical history and stuff. Let me see… Here it is. It’s from… Pacific Life, I think?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Pacific Life… okay. Looks pretty standard. Alright, well, let’s start with some basics. Just to get a good picture of your overall health. Could you tell me a little bit about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe ten years ago? The doctor put me on some pills, and it went down. I stopped taking ‘em a few years back, and it seemed okay. Other than that… not much, really. I get a little aches and pains, you know, getting older. But nothing serious. I don't think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. High blood pressure in the past, treated with medication, and now off of it. We'll definitely want to check that again today. And the aches and pains are common – it is part of getting older! Just to be thorough, when you say "a few years back," roughly how many years ago did you stop taking the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Uh… lemme think. My daughter, she graduated high school five years ago… and I think I stopped the pills right around then. So, five years, maybe a little more. It was when I moved back home, I think. Yeah, about five years. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Five years ago, around the time you moved home. Okay. And just to clarify, when you say “back home”, do you mean you relocated to a different area?
PATIENT: Yeah, I used to live on the mainland. In California. But I moved back to Majuro, where I grew up. It’s… quieter here. And my family’s here, so it’s better. I get to see my grandkids more. California was… expensive. And crowded.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Family is important. Okay, so you’ve been living in Majuro for about five years now. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital, not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that was just a cast. Nothing serious, like… staying overnight or anything. Just the doctor put the cast on, and I healed up. That was a long time ago. Probably when I was eight or nine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know – no surgeries or hospitalizations as an adult. A broken arm as a child doesn’t sound like it’s relevant to the insurance exam. Let's talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mom, she had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember exactly. And my dad, he had diabetes. He was sick for a long time before he passed. My sister, she’s healthy, as far as I know. But that’s about it. It’s a small family, really. Lots of early deaths, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your mom and dad. It's good to know about the heart condition and diabetes in the family, though. That helps us get a better picture. Now, just a few more questions before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with that. I can eat anything. And I haven’t had to take much medicine, really, except for the blood pressure pills. So I don’t know about reactions or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Okay, last question for now. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a thing. I stopped the blood pressure pills like I said. Don’t take anything. Just try to eat healthy, when I can. It's hard sometimes, but I try. That’s it. Can we get this over with now? I got some errands to run.
DOCTOR: Alright, sounds good. No current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Perfect. That gives me a good overview. Now let's just do a quick physical exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a few other things. It shouldn't take long at all. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just… hurry, okay? I really need to get going. Let’s just get it done. Whatever you need to do, just… be quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick as possible. If you could just sit here for me, please. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure. Alright, just relax your arm… perfect. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. I’ll want to check it again in a few minutes to make sure it’s consistent. Breathe deeply for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but something we’ll note. Lungs are clear.
PATIENT: A murmur? What’s a murmur? Is that bad? You said it was okay, but… My dad had heart problems, you know. This is starting to sound like… bad news.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a deep breath. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when it’s beating. A lot of times it’s perfectly harmless – many people have them and don't even know it. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something wrong. The fact that your dad had heart problems is good information to have, though, and that’s why we want to pay attention. This murmur is faint, and your rhythm is regular, which is good. We're just documenting everything thoroughly for the insurance company. I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any pain or tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little… gassy sometimes, but not pain. You know, old age. I just wanna get this over with. Is there anything else? Are you gonna poke and prod me for hours? I got things to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, no poking and prodding for hours, I promise. Just a few more quick checks. Reflexes are normal, pulse is a little quick, but that could be from anxiety. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Not bad at all, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. It wasn’t terrible. But are you gonna need more tests? Blood work or anything? I really don’t wanna have to come back. I just need them to approve the insurance, that’s all. I don’t want a whole medical investigation.
DOCTOR: Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the murmur, I think it would be prudent to order some basic blood work. Just to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and rule out anything else. It’s a standard precaution, especially with a family history of heart problems. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong, and it will give us a more complete picture for the insurance company. It's also good to have a baseline for your own health, just in case. It won't be a whole investigation, just a few simple tests. We can do them right here in the clinic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… fine. But how long is this gonna take? And what if they say no to the insurance because of all this? I need that insurance. My grandkids… I gotta provide for them. Just get it over with, Doctor. Whatever you gotta do. But please… hurry.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll do everything as quickly as possible. The blood work will only take about 15-20 minutes, and then we'll get the results back in a few days. I'm hopeful everything will be fine. The insurance company is mainly looking for a basic overview of your health. The blood work will just give them more information to work with. Let’s get that blood work ordered, and then we'll go from there. I'll explain everything as we go, and you can ask any questions you have.
