DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… well, it's my stomach. Just constantly running to the bathroom. And nothing seems to stop it. I’ve tried everything the pharmacy suggested, and it’s still happening. It’s been going on for… honestly, I’ve lost track. Too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're dealing with frequent diarrhea and haven't found relief with over-the-counter medications. “Too long” is a little vague – can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Probably… a little over two weeks, maybe? Look, it's embarrassing, okay? I don't usually talk about this with anyone. And I don't see why I have to give you a precise date. It feels like forever when you're constantly worried about being near a toilet. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Two weeks is helpful. And I apologize if I'm pressing, Ms. Woodring – it’s just important information for me to understand what’s going on. To clarify, is it diarrhea all day, or are there specific times it's worse?
PATIENT: It’s… pretty much all the time, honestly. There are moments, maybe an hour or two after… well, after I manage to eat something without it going straight through, that it calms down. But then it starts up again. It's worse in the mornings, usually. And after I drink anything, really. Which is… not ideal. It’s just… relentless.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's fairly constant, with some relief briefly after eating and worsening in the mornings and with fluids. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Really? You're asking me if there's blood in it? Look, I already told you this is embarrassing. No, I haven't seen any blood. If there was blood, do you think I'd be sitting here calmly talking about it? Honestly. It's just… watery. A lot of it. And it smells awful, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Woodring. Thank you for the information. Alright. And is there any cramping, nausea, or vomiting associated with this?
PATIENT: Cramping, yes. A lot of it, actually. Lower stomach, mostly. Like… really bad period cramps, but constant. Nausea sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Not yet, thankfully. I feel… just generally awful, weak. I've barely been eating, which I’m sure isn't helping. Honestly, I just want it to stop. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping in the lower abdomen and nausea. I understand how exhausting this is. Let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Look, I was married for a long time, my husband, he… he passed a few years back. Cancer. That’s… that’s enough about medical history, honestly. I don't have any conditions. I’m generally healthy. I mean, besides this… this disaster. Is that what you need to know? Do you need a list of everything I ate last week? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Woodring. That must have been incredibly difficult. No, I don’t need a detailed food diary, and I apologize if my questions are upsetting. Knowing about your husband’s cancer is helpful, thank you for sharing that. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, just a tonsillectomy when I was a kid. Ages ago. That’s it. No other surgeries. I’m not some… delicate flower who's constantly under the knife. Seriously, are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to talk about my entire life story? Because I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child is good to know. No recent surgeries. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I haven’t broken out in hives or anything. I’m a pretty simple person, really. I don't go around trying fancy foods or anything that would cause problems. Just… normal stuff. This is just… wrong. I've never had anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the stuff I told you before – the stuff from the pharmacy for the stomach. Imodium, I think? And… Pepto-Bismol? Something pink. I don’t even bother anymore, it doesn’t do anything. I stopped taking it a few days ago, honestly. It was just… wasting my money. I don't take anything else regularly. I tried a multivitamin for a while, but it didn't seem to do anything, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Alright, Imodium and Pepto-Bismol, but you’ve stopped taking them recently. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. Are you kidding me? What does my family have to do with my stomach? I already told you, my husband passed. My sister lives in Seattle, she's… fine, I guess. We don't talk much. Honestly, I don't understand what any of this has to do with anything. Are you a detective or something? I came here for help, not a life history interrogation.
DOCTOR: You are right, Ms. Woodring. My apologies. It’s just a routine part of gathering information, but I can see it’s causing you distress. We can skip that for now. Let's move on to your social history, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I don’t… I haven't smoked a cigarette in my life. My husband… he used to, but I made him stop years ago. And no, I don’t drink. Or… do anything else, if that's what you're implying. I'm a respectable woman. I don’t need vices. I’m perfectly capable of dealing with things on my own, thank you very much. Can we please get back to my stomach? This is ridiculous. I feel like I’m being judged here.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration. You don't smoke, drink, or use recreational drugs. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I really don’t have all day. And please don't poke too much. It hurts. Just listen and be done with it. This whole thing is just… humiliating. I want to know what’s wrong with me, and I want something to make it stop. Now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. If you could lie down on the table, please. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay. I’m hearing some… increased bowel sounds. That’s not entirely surprising given your symptoms. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Just tell me if anything feels tender. Starting here, on the right side… Any pain there?
PATIENT: A little. It's… sharp. Not constant, but when you press… yes. It hurts there. It's always been a little sensitive, but it's definitely worse today. Like… a cramping ache, almost. And it feels… swollen. I don't know if that makes sense. I just feel… bloated. And uncomfortable. Can you tell me what that means? Is it something serious? Because honestly, I'm starting to panic a little.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little tenderness in the right lower quadrant, and a feeling of swelling. And you're also feeling some discomfort on the left. Anything there?
PATIENT: Yes! Definitely worse on this side. Like… a dull ache, but it's throbbing. And it's… tight. Really tight. It feels like… something’s pressing down. It’s making me nauseous just thinking about it. Please… just tell me what’s going on. I need to know if this is something bad. Is it… appendicitis? I read something about that once. Or… is it something worse? I’m getting really scared now. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. Given your symptoms – the frequent diarrhea, the cramping, the tenderness in both the right and left lower quadrants, and your history of nausea – there are several possibilities we need to consider. Appendicitis is one possibility, but there are other things that could be causing this, such as inflammatory bowel disease or a severe infection. To rule out appendicitis, and get a better understanding of what's going on, I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The CT scan will give us a detailed image of your organs and help us identify any inflammation or other abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? That sounds… serious. Does that mean you think it's appendicitis? Is it something I need surgery for? I don’t want surgery. I just want… a pill. Something to make it stop. But… if that’s what you think is best, then… yes. Do the tests. Just… tell me what’s going on. And how long will it take? And will it hurt? I just… I just need to know what I’m dealing with. This is terrifying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring, I understand your fear. The CT scan is a precautionary measure – it doesn't necessarily mean it's appendicitis, but it will help us rule it out or confirm a diagnosis. It’s the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. The CT scan itself is painless, though you'll need to lie still for a short period of time. The lab work will involve a simple blood draw. It will take approximately 30-45 minutes to complete both tests. I'm going to order an IV to give you some fluids, as you've been losing a lot with the diarrhea. We'll also give you something for the nausea to make you more comfortable. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and discuss them with you. We will make a plan together, Ms. Woodring. I will not do anything without your full understanding and consent. Right now, let's get you comfortable and start those tests. A nurse will be in shortly to start the IV. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: IV… okay. And the blood work… fine. I just… I hope it's not something serious. I just want to be normal again. You really think it could be appendicitis? I mean, is it something that needs to be fixed right away? And… what happens if it is appendicitis? I just… I don’t do well with hospitals. Or… being sick. I just want this to be over.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, it's understandable that you’re worried. I wish I could give you a definitive answer right now, but I need the results of the tests to be certain. Appendicitis is a possibility, and it does require prompt treatment, usually surgery, to remove the appendix. However, it's important to remember that it's not the only explanation for your symptoms. If it is appendicitis, we will get you into surgery as quickly as possible. The surgery is fairly routine, and most people recover fully. We have excellent surgeons here, and we’ll ensure you're comfortable and well-cared for throughout the entire process. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done and getting you some relief from the nausea. The nurse will be here soon to start the IV and draw some blood. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Woodring. I will be with you every step of the way. I know this is scary, but you're not alone. I will explain everything to you, and we'll make the best decision together. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: Okay… surgery. Just… the thought of it… makes me feel sick. I don't know if I can… If it is surgery, will I be… awake? And will it hurt a lot afterward? I just… I'm terrified of pain. And what if… what if something goes wrong? I just… I want this to be over. And I want to go home. I just want to be normal again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, those are very valid concerns. It's completely understandable to be afraid of surgery, and it's good that you're asking these questions. If surgery is necessary, you will be completely asleep under general anesthesia. You won’t feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will be monitoring you closely throughout the entire surgery to ensure your safety and comfort. After the surgery, you will experience some pain, but we will manage it with medication. We have various pain control options available, and we’ll work with you to find what works best. The pain will gradually decrease over time, and we’ll provide you with instructions on how to manage it at home. As for complications, any surgery carries some risk, but serious complications are rare. Our surgical team is highly skilled and experienced, and we take every precaution to minimize those risks. We will discuss all the potential risks and benefits with you before the surgery, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. Right now, let's focus on getting those tests done. We need to understand what's causing your pain before we make any decisions about treatment. I'll be with you every step of the way, and we'll make the best decision together. You're not alone in this, Ms. Woodring. I will do everything I can to help you through this. A nurse should be here momentarily to start the IV. Do you want me to stay with you until she arrives?
PATIENT: Please. Yes, please stay. I… I don't think I can do this alone. Just… knowing you're here… helps. It makes it… a little less scary. I just… I just want this to be over. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening. And for… not making me feel like I'm crazy. Just… please… help me get through this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Woodring. I’m here. We’ll get through this together. It’s okay to be scared, and it’s okay to ask questions. That’s what I’m here for. The nurse should be here any minute. Let’s take a few deep breaths while we wait. Focus on your breathing. In… and out… I’ll explain everything to you every step of the way, and we’ll make the best decisions together. You’re not alone in this. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Woodring. And we’ll take care of you.
