DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, feelin’ like a tight band. It's been comin’ and goin’ for… oh, maybe a month now? Not constantly, but enough to bother a fella.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. A tightening sensation at the back of the head. I see. And would you describe the pain as constant, or does it come and go in waves?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. Not somethin’ that’s there all the time. More like… it’ll build up, get pretty noticeable, then ease off. Then later in the day, or the next day, it’ll be back. It hasn’t been keepin’ me up at night or nothin’, thankfully. Just… annoying, you know? Like a dull ache, most of the time. Sometimes it feels a little sharper, but not a real bad pain, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Percell. A dull ache with sharper moments, coming and going over the course of a month. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Let me think... I don't know if anything starts them, exactly. But... sometimes when I've been bendin' over in the garden, workin’ with the vegetables, it seems worse afterward. And maybe, just maybe, when I get really stressed about things. My daughter, she’s havin' a little trouble with somethin', and worryin' about her... could be that. It's hard to say for sure, though. I’m an old man, I got a lot goin’ on!
DOCTOR: Indeed. Many factors can contribute to such discomfort. Gardening and stress, you say. Noted. Now, Percell, have you experienced any other symptoms along with these headaches?
PATIENT: Let’s see… not really. No dizziness, nothin’ like blurry vision. No nausea or throwin’ up, thankfully. Sometimes… sometimes my neck feels a little stiff when the headache’s bad, but that could just be from sleepin’ wrong. I haven't felt any fever or chills or nothin’ like that. Just the headache, mostly. Oh! And maybe a little tired lately, but I’m 84, Doctor. Bein’ tired comes with the territory, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does, Percell. It certainly does. No dizziness, no visual disturbances, no nausea. Neck stiffness occasionally, and general fatigue. Very well. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. I’ve had plenty of headaches in my life, Doctor, bein’ my age. But… not quite like this. Usually, it's more of a general ache, all over, and maybe from tension. This feels… focused, right at the back of my head, like a band tightenin’. I don’t remember ever havin’ somethin’ like this for a whole month before, comin’ and goin’. So, no, I haven't had headaches like this before, not that I recall.
DOCTOR: I understand. A different character than your usual headaches. Now, Percell, regarding your medical history… do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. I try to stay active, walkin’ in the garden and all. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was… oh, maybe 20 years ago now? And my knees ain't what they used to be, but that’s just old age creepin’ in. Otherwise, I’d say I’m pretty healthy for an old fella. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin’ like that.
DOCTOR: Very good. Controlled blood pressure, gallbladder removed some time ago, and some age-related knee discomfort. And what about any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's another good question. Let me think... I don't think I have any allergies. I haven't had any bad reactions to any medicine that I recall. I take a little somethin’ for my knees sometimes, over-the-counter stuff, the ibuprofen, and I've never had any trouble with that. And I had a course of antibiotics a few years ago when I got a little infection, and that was fine too. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Percell, before we proceed, I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Just to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m used to gettin’ poked and prodded, ha!
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll just lie down on the table, please. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll take a look at your neck and neurological function. Let’s begin. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming, given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Some mild tenderness in the posterior cervical muscles. No palpable lymph nodes. Reflexes are normal. Cranial nerves appear intact.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just tell me if anything hurts. It felt a little tender back there, yeah, but nothin' too bad. Like you said, just a little bit. Everything else felt fine, as far as I can tell. I’m an old man, I don't feel things quite as sharp as I used to, ha! What do you think it is, Doctor? Could it be somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively at this stage, Percell. The tenderness in your neck, combined with the headaches, suggests a possible muscle strain or tension headache. However, given your age and the persistence of the symptoms for a month, we need to rule out other possibilities. The fact that your neurological exam is intact is reassuring, but not conclusive. While it’s unlikely to be something serious, I would like to order a CT scan of your head, just to be on the safe side. It will allow us to visualize your brain and rule out any underlying structural abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A CT scan, huh? I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… expensive? I don’t have any of that insurance, you see. I don’t want to be a bother, if it’s gonna cost a lot. And… is it dangerous? I read things online sometimes, and… well, you know how it is. I appreciate you lookin’ into it, Doctor, but I don't want to run up a bill I can’t pay.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Percell. A CT scan can be expensive, and it's perfectly reasonable to be worried about the cost. The scan itself is generally quite safe, involving a small amount of radiation, but we take every precaution to minimize exposure. Given your financial situation, I’m going to recommend a referral to the county hospital. They have financial assistance programs available for patients without insurance, and they may be able to offer the scan at a reduced cost or even free of charge. They also have specialists who can interpret the results and provide further guidance. It’s better to err on the side of caution in this case, Percell. Ruling out any serious underlying causes is the most prudent course of action, and the county hospital may be the best option given your circumstances. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: The county hospital… That… that sounds alright, actually. I’ve heard good things about them. Better to be safe than sorry, like you said. And… financial assistance would be a big help, you know? So, a referral to the county hospital. How does that work? Do I need to call them myself? Or will your office help me with that? I’m not very good with all that paperwork and phone calls, these old hands ain’t as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. My office will handle the referral process for you, Percell. I'll generate a referral form and fax it to the county hospital's neurology department. They will then contact you directly to schedule an appointment. It may take a few days for them to reach out, so please be patient. I’ll also provide you with a list of resources for financial assistance programs at the hospital. You can contact them directly to inquire about eligibility and application procedures. Here is the contact information for the county hospital and a list of their financial assistance programs. Do you have any questions about this information?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… that’s a big weight off my mind. Let me see… Neurology department… and the financial assistance stuff… yes, this is good. Very good. No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man and explain everything so clearly. And for helpin' me with the hospital stuff. I was worried about the cost, you know? I guess… I guess that’s it. Unless you need me to do anything else before I go?
DOCTOR: No, Percell, that will be all for today. Just follow up with the county hospital as soon as they contact you. They will guide you through the next steps. I wish you all the best. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And Percell, while it’s unlikely to be anything serious, it’s always better to be proactive about your health. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help. I'll be sure to call the hospital when they get in touch. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you again.
