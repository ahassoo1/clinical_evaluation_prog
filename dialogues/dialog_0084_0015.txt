DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mikeisha. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Um… my nose. It feels… bad. Like something is stuck, maybe? It's been… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Okay, “feels bad” and “something stuck”... that’s a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about what "bad" feels like?
PATIENT: It's… hard to explain. Not really pain, but… full. And… pressure. Like when you have a cold, maybe? But not… stuffy, exactly. Just… heavy. And sometimes it hurts a little bit behind my eyes. Does that make sense? I don't remember ever having this before.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Pressure, heaviness, and some pain behind the eyes. Okay. And is it on one side, or both sides?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think… both sides. But maybe… a little more on this side. But not much. It's hard to tell. Everything feels… the same, almost. Sorry. My head is just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Fuzzy is a good way to describe it. Has anything made it better or worse since it started?
PATIENT: Well… sleeping sometimes helps a little. But not much. And… working makes it worse, I think. All the… dust and noise. But I have to work, you know? My husband… he needs me to. I don’t… I don't know if anything really helps. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sleeping offers minimal relief, and work seems to aggravate it. And you’re exposed to dust and noise at work. Let’s talk about your work for a moment. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I… I operate a drill. For oil. It’s… a big drill. We… make holes in the ground. It's… loud. And dirty. Lots of dust. And… shaking. It's hard work, but… it pays the bills. It's what I do. I’ve been doing it… a long time, I think. Maybe ten years? I forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, operating a drill for oil, for about ten years. That certainly explains the noise and dust exposure. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure and heaviness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I feel tired. Very tired. More tired than usual. And… I think my nose… it runs sometimes. Not a lot, but… a little. And… sometimes I have a bad taste in my mouth. Like… metal, maybe? But I don't know. It goes away.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, a runny nose, and a metallic taste in your mouth. That’s helpful. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. And no cough. Just… tired. And this… nose thing. It’s just… annoying. It keeps me from sleeping good. And… I worry. I worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’ve noticed. Maybe… a little blurry sometimes? But I always wear glasses, so… I don’t know if it’s different. I need new ones, actually. Been putting it off. Everything looks blurry anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision that you attribute to needing new glasses. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to check your ears, nose and throat, and then listen to your lungs. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop hurting. And to feel better. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, your ears look clear. Throat looks a little irritated, but no sign of infection. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Breathing sounds are a little diminished on both sides, but no wheezing or crackles. Your heart rate is normal, and your blood pressure is 110/70. Now, let's check your sinuses. This might be a little uncomfortable. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. Right here. And… maybe here too. It's… hard to tell. Like a pressure. Not really pain, but… uncomfortable. Like when you have a headache. Does that make sense? It feels… deep inside.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tenderness to palpation over both sinuses, more prominent on the left. Given your history of working with a drill, exposure to dust and noise, fatigue, runny nose, metallic taste, and now sinus tenderness, I'm concerned about potential chronic sinusitis, possibly complicated by some metal exposure. We’re going to need to rule a few things out. I want to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better look. Would you be able to get to a lab for blood work today?
PATIENT: Blood work… and a scan? Oh dear. That sounds… expensive. I don't… I don't have insurance, Doctor. And… my husband, he’s been out of work. We… we don’t have much money right now. Is it… very important? I just want the headache to stop. Is there… anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. The tests will help us understand what’s going on, and rule out anything serious. I’m aware you don’t have insurance, and we can discuss options for reducing the cost. There's a program with the clinic that offers some assistance based on income. We can also prioritize what's most important right now. To start, let’s focus on symptom management. I'm going to recommend a saline nasal rinse twice a day to help clear the sinuses. You can get a saline rinse kit at most pharmacies. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of a decongestant to help relieve the pressure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. A rinse and something for the pressure. That I can do. Is the rinse… expensive? And… how often should I do it? Twice a day… that sounds like a lot. Maybe just once a day? I don't want to make it worse. And… is the medicine safe? I worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: The saline rinse kits are generally very affordable – usually under $20. And you can use tap water that’s been boiled and cooled, or distilled water, which is even cheaper. Twice a day is ideal to help clear out the sinuses, but once a day is okay if that's easier for you. We can always adjust as needed. The decongestant I’m prescribing is pseudoephedrine. It can raise your blood pressure slightly, so it's important to avoid it if you have high blood pressure, heart problems, or glaucoma. Do you have any of those conditions?
PATIENT: No, no high blood pressure. My husband… he checks my blood pressure sometimes. It's always… okay. No heart problems either. And I don't have glaucoma. Just… the headache. And the tired feeling. I don't think I’ve ever been told about glaucoma. So… pseudo… ephedrine… that's okay? As long as it doesn’t make my blood pressure go up? I don’t want to feel… worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Pseudoephedrine should be safe for you, as long as you monitor your blood pressure and follow the instructions carefully. I'm going to write you a prescription for a 7-day course. If the headache doesn’t improve after a week, or if you develop any side effects like dizziness, rapid heartbeat, or insomnia, stop taking it and contact the clinic. I also want to strongly recommend that you explore ways to reduce your exposure to dust and noise at work. Perhaps wearing a mask and earplugs could help?
PATIENT: A mask and earplugs… my boss… he wouldn’t like that. He says it slows us down. But… I guess I could try. Maybe just the earplugs. The noise… it really gets to me sometimes. And the dust… it makes my throat sore. So, a mask and earplugs… and the rinse… and the medicine… That’s a lot to remember. Could you… write it down for me? Just so I don’t forget. I worry about forgetting things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here's a summary of everything we discussed: the saline rinse , the pseudoephedrine , and the importance of trying to reduce dust and noise exposure at work. I've also included some information about the potential side effects of the medication. Do you have any questions about anything we've discussed before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very… patient with me. And… thank you for writing it down. I really appreciate it. I'll try my best to do everything you said. Hopefully, this will help. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. I’m glad I could help. If you don’t see improvement, or if anything gets worse, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. And remember, we can discuss financial assistance options if the tests become necessary. Take care of yourself.
