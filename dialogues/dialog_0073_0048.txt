DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It's these… spells, I suppose you’d call them. My wife, she’s been worried. I just… get lost sometimes. Not lost lost, you understand. More like… things don't make sense for a bit. Like I’m looking at a puzzle with pieces missing. It's frustrating, really. A man should have his wits about him.
DOCTOR: "Spells," alright. And how long has this been going on, these… episodes of confusion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months now? It started small, forgetting where I put my tools. Now… well, last week I couldn't remember how to start the lawnmower. My wife had to show me. Again. And she doesn’t know everything, you know. It’s embarrassing. A tile setter forgetting how to use a tool… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Six months. And would you say these episodes are getting more frequent, or is it staying about the same?
PATIENT: Definitely more frequent. It used to be just once a month, maybe. Now it's… well, it feels like every other day. Yesterday I was in the middle of laying tile, beautiful work, mind you, and I just…stopped. Couldn't remember what came next. Had to step away for a bit. My wife says I just stared at the wall. It’s unsettling, Doctor. Very unsettling. I pride myself on my work, you understand. It's a skill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say "stopped," do you feel dizzy, weak, any headache or any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness. Not weak, either. No headache. It’s just… blank. Like the television is static. I’m aware of where I am, I know who my wife is, but the thought… it’s just gone. Like someone turned off a light switch. I can usually snap out of it after a minute or two, but it’s… disconcerting. And frankly, it’s starting to worry me. I'm a practical man, Doctor. This isn’t practical.
DOCTOR: Do you have any difficulty with your memory outside of these episodes?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say difficulty, exactly. I mean, I’m 66, things aren’t as sharp as they used to be, naturally. But I remember dates, important things about my work, my wife's birthday… important things. It’s not like I don't know who the president is. It’s just… specific things, tasks, things I’ve done a thousand times, that seem to slip my mind. And only when I'm trying to do them. It’s very peculiar. Not a general failing, you see. It’s… selective.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never been much for taking pills unless absolutely necessary. And no, no high blood pressure, no diabetes. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that's about it. My wife makes me take some glucosamine for that. Other than that, I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life, stayed active. This… this is new. And unwelcome.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your reflexes, your balance, a quick neurological assessment. It won’t be anything extensive, just to rule out anything obvious. Then we can discuss some possible next steps. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life. Although, I don’t particularly care for cilantro. Is that an allergy? I just… don't like it. But no actual allergies. Proceed with your examination. Let’s get to the bottom of this, shall we? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow me. We'll start with your vital signs, then move on to the neurological assessment. If you could just sit here for a moment.
PATIENT: Fine. Though I must say, all this testing seems a bit… excessive, don’t you think? A few simple questions should suffice. A man knows his own mind, generally.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, just follow my finger with your eyes… Don't strain, just keep your gaze steady. Good. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. This might be a little startling.
PATIENT: Startling? Honestly. A bit rough, if you ask me. My reflexes are perfectly fine. I’ve been lifting tiles for forty years, you need good reflexes for that. Do you have any experience in the trades, Doctor? I doubt it. It’s a skill, you know. Requires precision. And a strong back. There. That wasn’t necessary.
DOCTOR: Plantar reflex is…normal. Alright, Mr. Lason. Let's check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Just for a few seconds. Let me know if you feel unsteady.
PATIENT: This is ridiculous. I'm not unsteady. I'm perfectly balanced. You’re making me nervous, Doctor. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy, you know. You expect me to fall, so I almost fall. It’s basic psychology. I told you, I’ve been working with heavy objects for decades. I have excellent balance. It’s a requirement of the job. Are we finished yet?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Your gait appears stable, but the balance test wasn't ideal. Given your symptoms – these episodes of confusion, the increasing frequency, and the subjective lack of other neurological deficits – I think we need to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid function test, and a Vitamin B12 level. Also, I'm going to order an MRI of the brain, just to rule out any structural issues. It’s standard procedure, Mr. Lason. It’s best to be thorough.
PATIENT: MRI? Now you're talking. That seems a bit… extreme, doesn’t it? I haven’t done anything to warrant an MRI. Blood work, fine. I suppose that's reasonable. But an MRI… Is that going to cost me a fortune? I have Medicare, but even still… And what exactly are you looking for? I'm a practical man, Doctor. I need explanations. Not just… tests. What could possibly be wrong with my brain? I feel perfectly fine when I'm not having these spells. Perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, the purpose of the tests is to rule things out. We need to see if there’s a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid problem, or any signs of a stroke, a tumor, or early signs of dementia. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something wrong. But given the nature of your symptoms, it's the responsible course of action. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion. We’ll have the billing department confirm the exact out-of-pocket expense. I understand your concerns, but I assure you, we’re not ordering these tests arbitrarily. It’s about gathering information, making an informed decision, and ensuring your well-being. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Dementia? Now you’re just being insulting. Dementia! I’ll have you know my mind is perfectly sharp. I remember dates, I can calculate tile quantities in my head… I'm a tile setter, Doctor. Precision is everything. And you're talking about dementia? I think I’ve heard enough. I’ll think about it. I’ll have my wife call and cancel everything. This has been a complete waste of my time. A complete and utter waste. I expect a referral to a competent doctor, if I decide to pursue this further. Someone who understands practical men, and doesn't jump to ridiculous conclusions. .
