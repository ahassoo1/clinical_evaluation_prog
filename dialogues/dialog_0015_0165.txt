DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever keeps comin’ back. It’s been a couple weeks now, on and off. Drives me nuts, honestly. Not much else going on, really. Just feelin’ a bit tired with it, ya know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A fever that comes and goes for a couple of weeks… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about the fever itself?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts in the afternoon, feels kinda like the flu, chills and all. Gets up to about 101, maybe 102. I take some Tylenol, it goes down for a while, then pops back up the next day, or later that same day. It’s… regular, if that makes sense? Like clockwork, almost.
DOCTOR: “Regular, like clockwork…” Yes, that is… specific. And when you say “pops back up,” about how long after taking the Tylenol does it return?
PATIENT: Usually, within six, maybe eight hours. Sometimes it’ll stay down for a full day, but mostly it's comin' back before I even sleep again. It’s not a high fever, but it's enough to knock me off my feet a little. I don’t like feelin’ weak, ya know? Makes it hard to get things done.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed anything else happening with the fever?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No aches, really, just the usual tiredness. No cough, no sniffles. Sometimes I get a little… sweaty when it spikes, but that's about it. No rashes, no nothing. Just the heat and the feelin’ like I got run over by a truck. My wife keeps checkin’ my temperature, bless her heart, but I don’t look sick, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see you've been seen here a few times previously. Let's go through a more detailed review of your health history. Have you had any major illnesses or hospitalizations that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Now you're askin’ me to remember things from… a while ago. Let me see. I broke my arm when I was a kid, playin’ baseball. Nothing serious. Had a bad case of the flu once, back in ‘88, but that’s about it. No hospital stays, nothin' like that. I’m pretty healthy, usually. This fever’s just… weird. I don’t remember ever havin’ somethin’ stick around this long.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. I try to stay away from doctors as much as possible, to be honest. Nothin’ against you, Doctor, but… well, you know. I prefer to just tough things out, usually. This fever though… it’s wearin’ me down. It's just not goin' away.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... my father had high blood pressure, I think. And my aunt, on my mother's side, she had… somethin’ with her heart. Can't remember the name of it, exactly. Nobody ever really talked about health much, ya know? We just kinda… dealt with things. It wasn’t a big thing to go see a doctor back then. My wife’s family’s healthier than mine, if that helps. She's got good genes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your daily habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it! And I drink... maybe a beer or two on the weekends, sometimes with dinner. Nothin’ heavy. I try to eat healthy, too. Mostly chicken and rice, some vegetables. My wife's a good cook. Keeps me in line. We walk around the neighborhood most evenings, keeps us both movin'.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, Doctor?
PATIENT: Just the Tylenol for the fever, when it comes back. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take a little ibuprofen. But that’s about it. Nothing regular, like a prescription or anything. Mostly just over-the-counter stuff. I don't like takin’ pills if I can avoid it. Makes me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. My wife’s always tellin’ me to slow down when I'm eatin', but that's just because I like my food! Seriously, I don't have any allergies. That’s one thing I don’t have to worry about. Lucky me, huh? I just want this fever to go away. It's drivin' me nuts.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brege. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Then we'll see what we have to work with. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Fine with me, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got things to do. And my wife’s waitin’ in the car, I told her I wouldn’t be long. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, a bit elevated, but not concerning. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… slightly high, 140/90. Not alarmingly so, but we’ll need to keep an eye on it. Throat is a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Ears look clear. No significant lymph node swelling. Temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. No rash present. Alright, Mr. Brege. I think we need to run some blood work to figure out what’s causing this persistent fever. It could be a number of things. We’ll check your white blood cell count, look for any signs of infection, and run a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Fine. As long as it doesn't take all day. And what exactly are we lookin' for? I don't understand all this medical talk, Doctor. Just tell me straight. Is it somethin’ serious? I got a business to run, ya know?
DOCTOR: "Somethin’ serious" is not a medical term, Mr. Brege. We are looking for signs of infection, inflammation, or any other underlying condition that could be causing your fever. It's standard procedure. The lab results will give us a better idea of what's going on. I'll order the tests now. It will take a few hours to get the results back. In the meantime, continue taking Tylenol as needed for the fever, and try to get some rest. And please, try not to worry unnecessarily. I'll have the nurse draw the blood for you immediately.
