DOCTOR: Right, Calin Sachar. 28 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Ruocco. Thank you for seeing me. I’m here to… well, to see if I qualify for some help at home. It’s about getting certified for home health, or hospice, if that makes sense. It’s a little confusing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Home health… hospice. Look, I’m an internal medicine doctor, not a social worker. You need someone to sort out the paperwork and eligibility for those programs. But alright, tell me why you think you need them. What’s going on with your health?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand, Doctor. I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. It’s just… my friend suggested I start here, to get a doctor’s opinion first. Well, I work with fabrics, pressing clothes mostly. It’s… physical work. And lately, I’ve been getting really tired. Not just a little tired, but… worn out. It’s hard to explain. And my back has been giving me trouble for months now, and it's gotten worse. It makes it hard to stand for long periods, which, you know, is most of my day. I’m divorced, and I don’t have a lot of family nearby to help out, so I’m trying to figure out my options.
DOCTOR: Right, fatigue and back pain. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. The fatigue… it’s been creeping up on me for maybe six months now, but the last three months have been noticeably worse. The back pain… that started probably around January, but it was manageable at first. Just a little ache after work. But since… oh, maybe April, it's been constant, and it's really started to affect my ability to work. I'm having trouble lifting things, even light things sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months fatigue, increasing over three. Back pain since January, worse since April. Any injuries?
PATIENT: No, no injuries that I can think of. Nothing specific, anyway. I mean, I lift and move a lot at work, but it’s just part of the job. I haven’t had any falls or accidents. It just… started gradually. It didn't happen suddenly. I just woke up one day with a bit of a stiffness, and it just kept getting worse over time. I tried some over-the-counter pain relievers, but they only help a little bit, and not for very long.
DOCTOR: Over-the-counter…Right. And what exactly do you do with these fabrics?
PATIENT: Well, I work at a dry cleaner's, mostly. I take the clothes after they're cleaned and press them. Shirts, trousers, dresses… all sorts of things. It’s a lot of standing, a lot of reaching, a lot of repetitive motions with my arms and hands. It’s not glamorous, but it's always been a steady job. We have some pretty large industrial irons, so… it’s physical, definitely. And it can be hot, even with the fans running. I've been doing this for about seven years now, on and off. I had to take some time off a few years ago when my marriage ended, but I went back when things stabilized.
DOCTOR: Seven years…repetitive motions… Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… Hmm. I've been feeling a little more… breathless lately, especially when I’m walking up stairs. Not all the time, but enough that I’ve noticed it. And I’ve been sleeping… not very well. I toss and turn a lot, and I wake up feeling tired even after a full night’s sleep. Oh, and sometimes my hands feel a little numb, especially in the mornings. It’s not constant, just… occasionally. I haven't really told anyone about it, to be honest. I thought it might just be stress.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, sleep disturbance, numbness… You’re listing a lot of vague complaints. Alright. Any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, Doctor. I had asthma as a child, but I grew out of it years ago. I haven't had an attack since I was maybe ten years old. And I had a really bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered fully. Other than that… no, not really. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. That’s why this is all so… worrying. I don’t usually get sick. I don’t take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional pain reliever when my back flares up.
DOCTOR: Asthma in childhood... Alright. Any family history of anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. Type 2, I think. And my uncle, my mother’s brother, had heart problems. He had a bypass surgery about ten years ago. And… oh, my father had high blood pressure, but he managed it with medication. That's all I can really think of, off the top of my head. We didn’t really talk about health much when I was growing up. It wasn't really a priority.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look at your back. Just to get an idea of what we're dealing with. Lie down on the exam table, if you would.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness… here, and here. Some muscle spasm. Range of motion is… limited. Nothing alarming, but clearly some discomfort. I’m not seeing anything that requires immediate imaging. Your height and weight… you're slightly overweight, but not drastically so. Let’s just run some basic bloodwork. CBC, CMP, thyroid. Rule out anything obvious. It could be a musculoskeletal issue, or… something else. I'll also order a Vitamin D level. Get those results, and we can reassess. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Thank you. Bloodwork sounds good. Will someone tell me where to go to get that done? And… how long do you think it will take to get the results back? I just want to have a general idea. Also, should I continue taking the over-the-counter pain relievers while I’m waiting?
DOCTOR: The lab is down the hall, first door on the left. They'll need my order. Results usually take about 3-5 business days. Continue the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, but don’t exceed the recommended dosage. And… try to get some rest. Don't overexert yourself. Honestly, this sounds like a lot of stress. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. That’s everything. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you taking a look at me. I'll go down to the lab and get the bloodwork done. I'll wait for the results and then… I guess I'll hear from your office? Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Right. The office will contact you with the results. Don't call us, we'll call you. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
