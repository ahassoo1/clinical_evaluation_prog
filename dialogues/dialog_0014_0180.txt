DOCTOR: Well, hello there, Hedy. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. Just…tired. Real tired. And I…I eat dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just have to sometimes. It’s stupid, I know. Don’t ask me why. It just happens. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: "Right…tired, and…dirt. Okay. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling this fatigue?
PATIENT: How long…? Honestly? A while. Months, I guess. It’s just…getting worse. It's not like a normal tired, you know? It’s…everything hurts to do. Even thinking. Don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Old age, probably. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: "Old age, perhaps. Though 57 isn't usually… debilitating. Has anything changed in your life recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Well, my husband… he passed last year. That was… a change. Everything’s been… off since then. Besides that? Not really. Same job, same… everything. Why does that matter? It's just tiredness and… this weird thing with the dirt. I don't see what's so complicated.
DOCTOR: "Well, grief can manifest in many ways. But we need to rule out anything else. And the dirt…that is unusual. Do you feel any cravings for it?
PATIENT: Cravings? Ugh, yes! That's a good word. Cravings. It's…like I need it. Not for the taste, don't get me wrong. It’s…hard to explain. Like something's missing if I don't. Mostly clay, if that matters. The red kind. Look, I told you, it’s weird. Don't ask me to explain it, I don't know!
DOCTOR: "Right. Red clay. Interesting. And how much would you say you consume?
PATIENT: Consume…? Oh, jeez. How do you measure dirt? A handful? Sometimes more. Depends. When I’m really…bad. Maybe like…a cup a week? Sounds awful, doesn’t it? Don’t judge me. I didn’t ask for this. It’s just…happens. Why are you even writing all this down? It's not like you can fix it.
DOCTOR: "We're documenting everything, Hedy, to get a complete picture. This…pica, as it's called, can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency. Have you noticed any other unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Pica? Is that what you call it? Fancy. No. Just the dirt. And… maybe ice. I like to chew on ice a lot. But everyone likes ice, right? Don't see what that has to do with anything. Look, can we hurry this up? I have things to do. This is wasting my time. And probably yours.
DOCTOR: "Alright, alright. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Everything hurts. But… my stomach? Yeah, sometimes. A little. Not a big deal. I just… ignore it. And… no, I haven't noticed anything different… really. I eat, it goes… you know. Is that what you want to know? Can we just skip all the gross questions?
DOCTOR: "Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Nothing invasive, I assure you." "If you could just sit up there for me."
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I really don’t have time for this. Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: "Heart rate is a little elevated, but not alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen." "Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ugh, yes! Stop poking me. It always hurts a little there. I don't know why. Probably just…old age. Like everything else. Don't press so hard. It's annoying. Is that all you're going to do? Can I get off this table now?
DOCTOR: “Tenderness in the left lower quadrant… noted. Alright, I think that’s sufficient for a preliminary exam. I'm going to order some blood work, just to check your iron levels, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney function. It’s standard procedure, especially with the… unusual cravings." "And I'm going to recommend a stool sample, just to rule out any parasites.”
PATIENT: Parasites?! Oh, great. You think I have worms now? This is ridiculous. Look, I told you, I just eat dirt. It's not like I'm living in a barn! I don’t want to give a stool sample. I really, really don’t. Can’t you just…give me something for the tiredness? That’s all I want. Blood work, fine. But no poop tests. Seriously. .
DOCTOR: "Look, Hedy, I understand you're uncomfortable. But we need to be thorough. Ignoring potential underlying causes won't solve anything. The stool sample is to rule out infections that could be contributing to the cravings and fatigue. It's a simple procedure. If you're unwilling to complete a basic workup, it's going to be difficult for me to help you." "I strongly advise you reconsider."
