DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife set this up. I don’t really remember all the details, but she said it was an evaluation for… bariatric surgery? Is that right? It’s a bit confusing, honestly.
DOCTOR: Bariatric surgery. Right. Well, it’s good you’re taking the initiative, even if your wife did the heavy lifting. It is a significant undertaking. Let’s start with the basics. You mentioned wanting surgery for your weight. How long have you been concerned about this, and what has prompted you to seek help now?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Honestly, it feels like… a long time. Years, definitely. I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. But it’s gotten harder lately. Just getting around, you know? And my wife… she worries. She's been saying I need to do something for a while now. I think that’s the main thing. She really pushed for this appointment. I don’t really have a specific moment I can point to, just… a slow build-up of things being difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s been a gradual process, and your wife is a motivating factor. That’s quite common. Let's get some specifics then. Can you tell me a little about your weight history?
PATIENT: Weight history… uh, that’s tough. I don’t really… keep track of that kind of thing. I know I was always heavier as a kid, compared to other kids, but I don’t have numbers or anything. As an adult… it’s just… gone up over time, I think. I used to be able to… well, do more things. Easier things. Now… stairs are a bit of a challenge. I really don’t know what I weighed last year, or even a few months ago. Sorry, I’m not much help with specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… not ideal, but we can work with it. We'll get a current weight and BMI here today. What about your height?
PATIENT: Oh, height I remember! I’m… pretty short, actually. I think it’s five foot one? Maybe two? Something around there. I haven't been measured in a long time, but yeah, around five foot one or two.
DOCTOR: Alright, the chart has you listed at five foot one. And we just weighed you at 139 pounds. That gives you a BMI of… well, it’s quite elevated. Now, before we discuss surgery further, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I don't think so. The doctor hasn’t told me about anything major. I get a little tired sometimes, but… I don't know if that counts. And my knees ache, but I figured that was just… being older and heavier. I don't take any regular medications, if that helps. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, honestly. Just for check-ups. My wife handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. No current medical conditions, no medications. And you haven’t been to a doctor recently. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think really hard. No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, at least. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. But that was a long, long time ago. And… that’s about it. Nothing else that I can remember. My wife might know better, she remembers things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Um, my dad, he had… heart problems, I think. He had a heart attack when he was older. And my mom, she had… diabetes, maybe? Something with sugar. She needed to watch what she ate. It’s all a bit blurry, honestly. I wasn’t very close to either of them, and my wife handles keeping track of that sort of thing. It’s been a while since we talked about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of heart problems and diabetes in the family. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Don’t smoke. Never liked it. My wife doesn’t smoke either, so it wasn’t really around much growing up.
DOCTOR: Good. What about alcohol?
PATIENT: Uh… I have a little sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing crazy, though. I don’t drink every day, and I don’t get… you know, drunk or anything. Just a little to relax. My wife drinks a little too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well… not much. Honestly. I used to walk more, but… it’s gotten harder with my knees and everything. I mostly just sit around now. Watch TV, read… I work on my feet some at the store, but that’s not really exercise, is it? It’s more just… standing. I try to help my wife in the garden sometimes, but that tires me out pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, limited activity. Now, I need to do a physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take a look at your knees. This will just give me a better idea of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My wife said I’d be poked and prodded, so I was expecting something like this. Go ahead. Just try not to poke too hard in my knees, they’re a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… somewhat diminished, but no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with some mild obesity noted. Knees exhibit mild crepitus and limited range of motion. Some tenderness to palpation. There’s definite swelling. Well, the exam confirms what we’ve discussed. You are significantly overweight, and your knees are showing signs of wear and tear. Now, before we discuss surgical options, I want to be clear: bariatric surgery is a major undertaking with potential risks and complications. It’s not a quick fix, and it requires a significant lifestyle change. We also need to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could affect your eligibility. Have you had any blood work done recently?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Like I said, I haven’t been to the doctor in a while. My wife usually handles all that stuff. I don't even know what kind of blood work I’d need. She said something about checking my sugar levels, maybe? But I’m not sure. It all sounds a bit complicated, honestly. I just want to feel better, you know? But if it’s going to be really risky… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, before we even consider surgery, we need a full blood panel – to check your glucose, cholesterol, liver function, kidney function, and a complete metabolic panel. We also need an EKG to assess your heart health. And frankly, given your weight and limited activity, I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist before proceeding any further. It’s just to ensure your heart can handle the stress of surgery. I’m going to order these tests for you. You’ll need to go to the lab, and they’ll draw some blood. Then, I'll schedule you an appointment with Dr. Al-Amin, the cardiologist. We'll need those results before we can even begin to discuss surgical options. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I think so. Blood work, and a heart doctor… That sounds like a lot. My wife is going to be busy setting up appointments. Is… is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, and we’re… not really rolling in money. I didn’t even think about the cost of all this when I agreed to come here.
DOCTOR: That’s… a valid concern. Unfortunately, without insurance, these tests will be expensive. We have a financial assistance program at the clinic, but eligibility requirements apply. I'll have the receptionist give you information about that. As for Dr. Al-Amin, you'll need to contact his office directly to inquire about his fees and payment options. I can write you a referral note. Here. Take this to Dr. Al-Amin’s office. They can schedule an appointment for you. And I’ll have the receptionist give you the information about the financial assistance program. We need to get this done, Mr. Kochubey. Delaying this will only worsen your condition. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, I… I don't think so. That's a lot to take in. My wife will probably have a lot of questions though. I just… I hope we can afford it. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll go talk to the receptionist.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist is at the front desk. She will assist you. I expect to receive the results of your tests and a report from Dr. Al-Amin within two weeks. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once I’ve reviewed them. Don’t delay.
PATIENT: .
