DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been having some discomfort… down there. In the… testicular region, you said? It’s a rather new thing, and I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what’s going on. It’s just…painful, and it's been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're coming in to get it checked out. Discomfort in that area can be concerning, and it's always best to rule things out. And you’re right to come in when it’s new. Now, when you say “testicular region,” just to be absolutely clear, are you experiencing discomfort in the scrotum—the sac that holds the testicles—or are you referring to a different area?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the scrotum, yes. That is the correct term, isn't it? It’s… well, it’s a dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels… heavy, if that makes sense? And occasionally, a sharp pain, but that doesn’t last long. It's been… maybe a week now? I’m not very good with dates, I’m afraid. Perhaps a little longer. It’s all been rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize about the dates, Noelani. A week is helpful. And yes, describing it as a dull ache with occasional sharp pains is very useful information. The “heavy” feeling is also something I want to explore. Now, have you noticed any swelling in the scrotum at all?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. That's a good question. I think… maybe a little? It's hard to say for certain. It doesn’t seem drastically different, but… perhaps a bit fuller than usual? I haven't looked closely, if that makes sense. I’ve been avoiding it, to be honest, as it causes me some anxiety. Is that strange?
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Noelani. Completely understandable. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious and avoid looking at something that’s causing you discomfort. Okay. So, a possible slight fullness. Have you noticed any changes in the size or shape of the testicles themselves, or any lumps you’ve been able to feel?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that sounds… invasive. I really haven’t… examined them closely, Doctor. I apologize. I haven’t felt anything specifically… like a lump, but… I haven't been actively looking for anything either. It’s just been the general ache and… fullness, as I said. I’m afraid I’m not very good at self-examinations, and… I suppose I’ve always avoided thinking about it. Is it something I should be doing?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It's perfectly alright. Many people don't routinely perform self-exams, and it's never too late to start. We can certainly discuss how to do that properly later, if you'd like. Right now, let's focus on what's happening. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discomfort?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… not that I’ve noticed, specifically. No fever, no nausea… I haven't felt any pain in my abdomen or lower back. Everything else seems… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little more tired than usual, but that could be anything, really. I do try to stay active, but… well, I'm getting older, aren’t I? I find it harder to recover after exertion now. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Noelani. No fever, nausea, or abdominal pain is helpful. And yes, feeling more tired is something we can consider, although it's often a non-specific symptom. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any recent trauma or injury to the groin or testicle area?
PATIENT: Trauma or injury… hmm. No, not that I recall. I haven’t had any falls or bumps… I live a fairly quiet life, Doctor. I do a lot of woodworking, but I’m very careful in my workshop. I always wear protective gear. Perhaps… perhaps I lifted something a bit too heavy a few weeks ago? A large piece of timber. But it didn’t hurt at the time. It was just… strenuous. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Noelani. Lifting something heavy could be a factor, even if it didn't cause immediate pain. Sometimes these things can have a delayed onset. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, perhaps twenty years or more. And I have… I have slightly elevated blood pressure, but it’s well-managed with medication. That’s all I can think of, truthfully. I haven’t been to a doctor very often, I must admit. I generally prefer to avoid it if possible. Is that a terrible thing to say?
DOCTOR: Not at all a terrible thing to say, Noelani. Many people feel that way. It's good you're here now. So, gallbladder removal and well-managed hypertension. Do you know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I believe it’s… a small white pill. I get it refilled regularly at the pharmacy. I'm afraid I don't recall the name specifically. I just take it every morning with my breakfast. I’m terribly forgetful, Doctor. It’s a real problem. Perhaps the pharmacy has a record? I do remember it ends in “-pril,” I think? That sounds right, doesn’t it? Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's actually very helpful, Noelani. "-pril" suggests it’s an ACE inhibitor, which is a common type of blood pressure medication. We can certainly verify with your pharmacy later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. I sometimes get a slight itch when I eat shellfish, but that’s been my whole life. It's just a minor annoyance, really. Not a proper allergy. I don’t have any known allergies to penicillin or any other common medications, as far as I am aware. I’m fairly sure. It’s just… it's hard for me to remember these things sometimes. I apologize for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Noelani. It's perfectly alright. It's good to know you don’t have any known medication allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My father had… heart problems, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don’t recall the specifics. And my mother… she had arthritis, very badly, in her later years. It was terribly debilitating for her. I don’t recall any other major medical conditions in my immediate family. We didn't really talk about these things much. It wasn’t really our custom. I'm afraid that's all I can remember. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Noelani. Heart problems in your father and arthritis in your mother. That gives us something to consider. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, as I mentioned, I enjoy woodworking. It keeps me active, mostly. I live alone, and I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to stay as active as possible, but I do spend a lot of time indoors, working in my workshop. It's a solitary life, perhaps, but it’s what I enjoy. I don't have any close family nearby, so I mostly keep to myself. Is there anything specific you'd like to know?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Noelani. It sounds like you live a very healthy lifestyle overall. No smoking, limited alcohol, healthy diet, and woodworking – that’s excellent. Okay. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and then I'll need to gently examine your groin and testicles to assess the discomfort you’ve been experiencing. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… yes, I suppose so. It does feel… rather intrusive, but I understand it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please be gentle, if you would. And… perhaps could you explain what you're doing as you go along? It would help to ease my anxiety a little. I apologize for being… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. Absolutely. I understand your discomfort, and I will explain everything as I go along, and be as gentle as possible. Your comfort is my priority. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This will help me rule out any other potential causes for your discomfort. It will only take a moment. Your heart rate is regular and normal, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I need to examine your groin and testicles. I'm going to gently palpate the area to check for any swelling, tenderness, or lumps. Please let me know immediately if you feel any sharp pain. Your lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Now, I'm going to gently examine your testicles. I'm feeling… some tenderness on the upper portion of your left testicle. It's not markedly swollen, but there is some discomfort when I press there. Your right testicle feels normal – no tenderness or swelling. Okay. I've completed the exam. I do feel some tenderness on your left testicle. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s where it hurts. Not terribly, but… definitely tender. Further investigation… what does that entail, Doctor? Is it something serious? I must admit, I am quite anxious now. I’m afraid I don't cope well with uncertainty.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Noelani, and I want to be as clear as possible. The tenderness on your left testicle could be caused by a number of things. It could be something relatively minor, like an inflammation of the epididymis , or a mild strain. However, it's also important to rule out more serious possibilities, such as a torsion of the testicle, or—less commonly—a tumor. To investigate further, I would like to order a scrotal ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to visualize the testicles and surrounding structures in detail. It will help us determine the cause of the tenderness and guide our next steps. I’m also going to order a urine analysis to check for any signs of infection. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… and a urine analysis. Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will help determine what’s going on, then yes, I agree. How long will it take to get the results, Doctor? And… will it be painful? I'm dreadfully worried about pain. I'm also concerned about the cost. My insurance… is that something I need to worry about at this stage?
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. Let's address your concerns one by one. The ultrasound is completely painless. It involves using a handheld device to emit sound waves, and it doesn't involve any radiation. The technician will apply a gel to your scrotum to help the sound waves travel through the skin. It will take approximately 15-20 minutes. The urine analysis is also painless – you will simply be asked to provide a sample of your urine. It takes only a few minutes to collect. As for the results, the ultrasound typically takes 24-48 hours to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have the results, I will contact you immediately to discuss them and our next steps. Regarding cost, you are covered by Medicare, which should cover the majority of the cost of the ultrasound and urine analysis. However, there may be a small co-payment or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can verify your coverage and provide you with an estimated cost before the tests are performed. I can have them contact you directly after this consultation. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That… that is reassuring, Doctor. Completely painless, and Medicare should cover it… yes, that is good to know. Yes, please, if you could have the billing department contact me, that would be wonderful. It puts my mind at ease a little knowing that is being taken care of. And… what happens after the results are in? What are the possible scenarios? I know it’s a lot to ask, but I find it helps to be prepared. I'm terribly anxious, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. It's perfectly reasonable to want to be prepared, and I'm happy to discuss the possible scenarios. The most likely scenario is that the ultrasound will reveal an inflammation of the epididymis, known as epididymitis, or possibly an inflammation of the testicle itself, known as orchitis. Both of these conditions are usually caused by a bacterial infection, and they can be effectively treated with antibiotics. Less commonly, the ultrasound could reveal a hydrocele – a fluid-filled sac around the testicle – which may or may not require treatment depending on its size and symptoms. In rare cases, the ultrasound could reveal a testicular torsion – a twisting of the spermatic cord – which requires immediate surgical intervention to prevent permanent damage. This is why it's important to rule this out quickly. Finally, in very rare cases, the ultrasound could reveal a testicular tumor. If this is the case, we would refer you to a urologist for further evaluation and treatment. I want to emphasize that the most likely scenario is a relatively minor condition that can be easily treated. However, it's important to get the ultrasound to rule out any more serious possibilities. In the meantime, I recommend wearing supportive underwear and avoiding any strenuous activity. If you experience any sudden, severe pain, or if you notice any redness or swelling, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Supportive underwear… and avoid strenuous activity. Yes, I can manage that. It’s just… the thought of surgery… and a tumor… it’s terrifying. No, I don’t think I have any more questions at this moment. I suppose I’ll just have to wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it very much. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll just go home and rest now. And try not to worry too much. Although, that’s easier said than done. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. It was my pleasure. Remember, the most likely scenario is a minor condition that can be easily treated. Try to stay positive, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. The billing department will be in touch shortly. And please, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Have a peaceful rest, and I'll be in touch soon with the results. .
