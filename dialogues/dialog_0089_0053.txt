DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I’ve been having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes me a while to empty everything. It's been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all – these things happen, and we'll figure it out. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a couple of weeks. Maybe three? It’s hard to say exactly. I usually don’t have trouble, so when it started, I just thought I was drinking too much tea. But it hasn’t gotten better on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the stream itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not weak, exactly. It just… starts and stops. It’s not a steady flow, more like little bits at a time, then a pause, then a little more. It's frustrating, really. I have to push a little, too, which I never used to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent, a bit of straining… and you said it’s a change from your usual pattern?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Usually, it just… goes. No pushing, steady stream, and done. This is definitely different. It's just… annoying, and I worry a little about it. I don't want something seriously wrong, you know?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your worry. Let's get a bit more information. Besides the difficulty starting and the intermittent flow, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I do feel like I have to go more often than usual. Especially at night. I wake up once or twice, sometimes three times, to use the bathroom. That hasn't happened in years. It's not painful, just… inconvenient. And I'm drinking the same amount of tea as always, maybe even less now because of this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, particularly at night… that's helpful. Any burning or discomfort while you're urinating?
PATIENT: No, no burning or pain. It doesn't hurt during, just the effort to get it started and the stopping and starting. It’s more of a… struggle, than actual pain. And sometimes, after I do finish, I feel like I haven’t emptied everything completely, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, the color and smell seem normal. It's the same as always, as far as I can tell. I haven't paid much attention to it, to be honest, unless it's very dark, which hasn't happened. It’s just this difficulty that’s bothering me. I drink plenty of water, too, so it’s usually pretty clear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it went down with diet and exercise. My family doctor checked it regularly and said it was fine. I don’t have diabetes, never been told that. I see my family doctor once a year for a check-up, and he always says I'm in pretty good shape for my age. I take a vitamin D supplement, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Vitamin D supplement only. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospital stays. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago, and it healed up just fine. Otherwise, I’ve been very lucky with my health. I've never needed anything serious done. I try to stay active and eat well, I think that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. And just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve taken antibiotics a few times over the years for a cold or a little infection, and I never had a reaction. I don’t really take any medication regularly, except for the vitamin D, like I said. I’m very careful about what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, this gives me a good starting point. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's okay with you. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen and a quick neurological check, and I might do a brief digital rectal exam to check your prostate, just to rule things out. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well, that doesn’t sound very pleasant, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, if everything else looks okay, could we maybe skip that part? I’m just… not very comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Yadao, and I wouldn’t suggest it if it weren’t potentially helpful. Given your symptoms – difficulty starting, intermittent flow, increased frequency – it’s important to assess the size and shape of your prostate gland, as it can contribute to these issues, even in women. It’s a quick exam, and I'll explain everything beforehand. However, if you're truly uncomfortable, we can proceed without it, but it may mean we need to do further testing, like a urine analysis and possibly a referral to a urologist for an ultrasound. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I suppose if it’s important, and it will really help you figure out what’s going on… alright. But please be gentle, Doctor. And explain everything very clearly before you do it. I really don't like the sound of it, but I want to know what’s wrong. And if it’s not too much trouble, could someone explain what they’re looking for? Just so I understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. I completely understand. We'll take it slowly and gently. I'll explain every step as we go, and I will answer any questions you have. Essentially, we're checking the size and shape of the prostate gland, looking for any enlargement or tenderness. Enlargement can sometimes press on the urethra, causing the symptoms you’ve described. Tenderness could indicate an infection or inflammation. It’s a quick exam – it shouldn’t take more than a minute or two. First, let's have you lie on your side with your knees bent. I'll use a lubricated gloved finger to gently examine the area. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… as okay as it can be, I suppose. Knees bent, you say? Please be quick, Doctor. And, honestly, don't hesitate to tell me if you need me to do anything or if I'm tensing up too much. I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Just breathe normally. I'm just going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just let me know if you feel any significant discomfort. Okay, that’s all done. I didn't feel any significant tenderness or enlargement. The prostate feels normal in size and shape. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to check for any abnormalities. I'm not hearing anything unusual. Your abdomen sounds normal.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn't as bad as I feared, thankfully. So, a normal prostate and everything sounds okay in my stomach? What does that mean, Doctor? What could be causing this trouble if it’s not that?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear it wasn’t too unpleasant. And yes, a normal prostate and abdomen sounds are encouraging. It makes a serious physical obstruction less likely. Given your age and symptoms, and the normal exam, it could be a few things. One possibility is overactive bladder, which causes a sudden urge to urinate and increased frequency. Another is bladder irritation, perhaps from something you're eating or drinking, or even a mild urinary tract infection that isn't causing severe pain. Sometimes, it can also be related to changes in the pelvic floor muscles. To investigate further, I'd like to order a urine analysis, to rule out infection. I'd also like to check your post-void residual, which is the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. It's a quick and painless ultrasound. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Ultrasound and a urine test... yes, that sounds reasonable. Anything to figure out what’s wrong. A urine test is easy enough, and I suppose an ultrasound is better than more poking and prodding. When can I have these tests done? And will you explain the results to me when they come back? I don't want to be left wondering.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you’re comfortable with that. We can do the urine analysis right here in the office, and I’ll send you to the radiology center across the street for the ultrasound. They usually have same-day appointments, and I’ll have the results faxed to me within 24 hours. I will absolutely explain the results to you as soon as they come in. I’ll call you with the findings, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and try to drink plenty of water. That can help rule out irritation. Also, try to practice pelvic floor exercises – Kegels – those can strengthen the muscles and improve bladder control. Are you familiar with those?
PATIENT: No, I don't think I've ever heard of Kegel exercises. But I can certainly look them up online. Caffeine and water, yes, I can manage that. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even with the… exam. I feel a little better knowing we're doing something to figure this out. When should I expect a call with the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. You can expect a call within 24-48 hours, so by tomorrow afternoon. As for Kegel exercises, you can tighten the muscles you use to stop the flow of urine. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat several times a day. There are also lots of helpful videos online if you’d like a visual demonstration. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now. I'll try the exercises and watch my caffeine. Thank you again, Doctor Roseburrough. You've been very kind and patient with me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. It was my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here’s a little brochure on overactive bladder and pelvic floor exercises. Have a good day, and I'll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor.
