DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I can travel. It’s mostly just a formality, I believe, but I haven’t seen a doctor in quite some time and I want to be sure I’m able to provide everything they need.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A pre-travel check-up is always a good idea, even if it is just a formality. It’s good you're thinking ahead. Let’s get some information down. You said you haven’t seen a doctor in a while… can you tell me roughly when your last physical was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It would have been… 2018, I believe. My husband, God rest his soul, always made the appointments and kept track of things. After he passed…well, it just slipped my mind, to be honest. It was a complete check-up with Dr. MacIntyre, over at County General. He retired a few years back, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2018. That’s alright, we'll get you updated. And just to confirm, today's date is August 2nd, 2025. Now, besides the cruise requirement, are you experiencing any specific health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: No, not really, Doctor. I feel quite well, all things considered. A little ache here and there, as one gets older, but nothing I’d be unduly worried about. My knees sometimes bother me in cold weather, and I get a bit tired after a long day, but that's probably just my age showing. Nothing new or alarming, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear. Let’s just go through a quick review of systems just to be thorough. This will involve me asking about different parts of your body and if you've noticed any changes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Please do. I’ll answer as best I can. I haven't the medical training to diagnose anything, of course, but I can certainly tell you what I've been feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Let's start with your heart. Have you noticed any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath – even with normal activity?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that at all. My heart feels perfectly steady, as far as I can tell. I do get a bit breathless if I climb a steep hill, but that's just because I'm not as young as I used to be! I haven’t experienced any pain or fluttering, thankfully. I used to walk quite a bit, and never had any trouble then, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your lungs?
PATIENT: No cough, Doctor. No wheezing or trouble breathing normally. I occasionally get a bit of a tickle in my throat in the mornings, but that’s just seasonal, I think – dust or something. Nothing that keeps me up at night or requires any sort of remedy. I used to smoke, years ago, but I gave that up completely in ‘98.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear about quitting smoking. That’s excellent. Now, let’s move on to your digestive system. Any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. Everything's… regular, shall we say? I eat a good, sensible diet – plenty of fruit and vegetables, not too much indulgence. I do enjoy a wee biscuit with my tea, but nothing excessive. No pain, no bloating, no unusual… well, you understand. Everything functions as it should, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. And what about your abdomen?
PATIENT: No pain or tenderness, Doctor. No bloating, no nausea, nothing unusual at all. I sometimes get a bit of indigestion if I eat something too rich, but it quickly passes. I don't have any history of stomach problems, thankfully. I used to have a bit of trouble with heartburn years ago, but that went away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let's talk about your joints now. You mentioned your knees bother you in cold weather. Any pain or stiffness in any other joints?
PATIENT: Well, my hands sometimes feel a bit achy in the mornings, particularly after I’ve been gardening. Nothing debilitating, Doctor, just a bit of stiffness that quickly goes away with a bit of movement. It's probably just arthritis, I suppose, as my mother had it quite badly. I don’t take anything for it, as it’s not too bothersome. It's just a small price to pay for a bit of gardening, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your skin?
PATIENT: No rashes, no unusual moles, no change in colour. I do have a few age spots, naturally, but nothing new. I'm quite careful in the sun these days, always wear a hat and sunscreen. My skin tends to be a bit dry in the winter, so I use a good moisturizer. Nothing alarming to report, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, just a couple more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: My vision isn't what it used to be, of course. I need reading glasses now, and sometimes have a bit of trouble seeing things in dim light. That started a few years back, and I've got a prescription for glasses, which I use regularly. My hearing is a bit less sharp than it used to be, as well. I don't need a hearing aid yet, but I do sometimes have to ask people to speak up. Nothing sudden or dramatic, just the usual signs of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss or fever in the past few months?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. My weight has been fairly stable, and I haven't had a fever in… well, I can't remember the last time! I do have a good appetite, and generally feel quite well. I'm quite particular about my diet, as I mentioned, and try to stay active as much as possible. No worries on that front, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Ms. Squiers. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I’m aware of. My husband used to handle all the medical appointments, and I never needed to see a specialist until after he passed, when I needed a prescription for my glasses. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. Dr. MacIntyre always said I had a strong constitution. I haven’t been hospitalised for anything serious, thankfully. Just the usual bumps and scrapes over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. Never needed them, thankfully. I had my tonsils out as a child, that's the only thing I can remember, and that was… oh, goodness, must be seventy years ago now! Everything else has been quite straightforward, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis, as I mentioned, quite badly in her hands and knees. My father was healthy enough, he lived to be 85, though he did have a bit of trouble with his heart towards the end. My brother had high blood pressure, but he didn't take much care of himself, I'm afraid. No history of diabetes or cancer on either side of the family, thankfully. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I don't take anything regularly. I might take a paracetamol if I have a headache, but that's about it. I try to avoid taking medication whenever possible. I believe in a good diet and plenty of rest, and that usually keeps me going. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Squiers, that's very thorough. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. Please do. I’ll just sit here, shall I? Let me know if there's anything I need to do. I'm quite comfortable, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in...and out... Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning. Next, let me just check your pulse. 72 and regular. Let me check your temperature. 98.6. Throat looks clear. Now, I’ll just listen to your abdomen. Bowel sounds are normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Finally, let's just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. All right. Overall, everything seems within normal limits. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to being in the office. We’ll keep an eye on that.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. I always worry about my blood pressure, as my brother had trouble with it, but it's good to know it’s not too concerning at the moment. Is there anything I should be doing to keep it under control? Perhaps less tea? I do enjoy my tea, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about it. Less tea isn't necessarily the answer, although moderating caffeine intake can be helpful. The most important things are diet and exercise. A low-sodium diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is important. And regular exercise – even a brisk walk for 30 minutes most days of the week – can make a big difference. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to recheck your blood pressure and discuss this further. Are there any other concerns you have today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. That all sounds very sensible, and I’ll certainly try to incorporate more walking into my routine. Perhaps I'll take a walk along the beach after my cruise, if the weather is nice. And I’ll try to be mindful of the salt in my food. A follow-up appointment sounds very wise, thank you. I suppose you’ll need some information for the cruise line now? I have my insurance details somewhere… although I haven't actually used them in years.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's get that sorted. The cruise line usually just requires a statement confirming you've had a medical evaluation and have no significant health concerns that would prevent you from traveling. I’ll prepare a brief summary for them. Here you go. It states you are in generally good health, with slightly elevated blood pressure, and have no contraindications to travel. I've also included my contact information should they require further clarification. Regarding insurance, they don't typically require it, but having the details is always good. Do you have that readily available?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, here it is. It's just a basic policy, really. I mostly wanted to be sure I had it in case of an emergency. It's with Caledonian Assurance, policy number 47B-829. I haven’t made a claim in… goodness, decades. I’m quite careful, you see. Is there anything else you need from me, Doctor? I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you. That’s all the information I need for now. Just remember to stay hydrated during your cruise and protect yourself from the sun. And if you experience any new or concerning symptoms while traveling, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. I’ll schedule that follow-up appointment for you now. How does November 15th at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: November 15th at 10:00 AM sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time and your thoroughness. I feel much more reassured now, and I’m looking forward to my cruise with a bit more peace of mind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I suppose that’s everything then? I should be going, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s everything. You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. Enjoy your cruise, and please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's a card with our contact information. Have a wonderful time!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I certainly will. Goodbye, and have a good day.
