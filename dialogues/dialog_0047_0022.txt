DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. McConnon. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Well, my tummy… it feels big. Bigger than usual, I think. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not hungry, you see? It’s just… not nice. I don’t remember when it started, exactly. A little while, maybe?
DOCTOR: “A little while” isn’t terribly helpful, Mrs. McConnon. Can you give me any more specifics?
PATIENT: Oh dear. I’m sorry, Doctor. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Maybe… after the summer started? Or before? It’s all a bit of a blur, really. I used to be very good at remembering dates… when I was a sociologist, you see. Lots of details, lots of people… but that was a long time ago. Is it important exactly when it started?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have some idea of the duration of your symptoms, yes. But never mind. You said your tummy feels big and you’ve lost your appetite?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Big tummy… and not wanting food. I used to love to cook, you know? Russian food… very tasty! But now… It doesn’t sound good. And it’s… uncomfortable. Just a little bit. Not pain, exactly. Just… full. Even when I haven’t eaten much. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Fullness, even with a decreased appetite. Alright. And have you noticed any other changes, Mrs. McConnon?
PATIENT: Other changes…? Let me think… Oh! I've been… well, going to the bathroom more. Not… not always a lot, just… more often. And I feel a little tired, maybe? It's hard to say. I sleep a good bit, but still… not very strong. Is that… is that important, Doctor? I don’t want to bother you with silly things.
DOCTOR: More frequent urination and some fatigue. Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh dear. I… I don't quite understand. Do you mean… going to the toilet? I've been… regular, I think. Not much different. I'm sorry, Doctor. I'm not very good at explaining these things. It's just… private, you see? And I don't want to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: It’s important information, Mrs. McConnon. Regular is good, but can you tell me how often you are having bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh! How often… yes. About… every other day, I think. Sometimes every day, sometimes two days. It’s not a… a big problem, Doctor. Just… normal for an old lady, maybe? I used to be very strong, you know. A sociologist. Lots of travel… but that was a long time ago. I’m sorry, am I rambling?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight… loss? I… I don't know, Doctor. I haven’t weighed myself. I don’t really think about my weight. I used to be… a healthy weight, I suppose. I feel a little thinner, maybe? But it could be the clothes. They might have shrunk. Old clothes do that, you know. Is it important to know exactly how much weight I’ve lost?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is, Mrs. McConnon. We need a baseline. Let's have you step on the scale. And then we’ll do a quick physical exam.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. The scale, you say? Yes, yes. I used to be very strong, you know. I hope it’s not too much trouble. It’s just… I haven’t stood on one in a long time. Is it alright if I hold onto the wall?
DOCTOR: Of course. Take your time. …106 pounds. Alright, Mrs. McConnon. And now, if you’ll just let me listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. I'm just checking for anything unusual. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh… 106 pounds? That’s… very little, isn’t it? Alright, the table, you say? It’s alright, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My tummy… it’s a little sensitive. Is it cold? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. McConnon. This will only take a moment. …Hmm. Bowel sounds are present, but a little… sluggish. And there’s some mild tenderness here… on the left side. Nothing acutely alarming, but… It’s slightly enlarged. I’m also feeling a… a fullness. Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea…? Not really, Doctor. No… I don’t think so. A little queasy sometimes, maybe? But that could be anything. I get carsick easily. And I don't eat much, you see. Vomiting… no, not at all. I haven't been sick to my stomach in a long time. Is something wrong, Doctor? It's not my tummy, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. McConnon. Given your age, the weight loss, the abdominal fullness and tenderness, and the change in bowel habits… I want to order some blood work. A complete blood count to check for anemia, a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a CA-125 level. It's a marker that can sometimes be elevated in certain conditions. I'm also going to order an abdominal ultrasound. It will give us a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and ovaries. It's important to rule things out, Mrs. McConnon. This doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but we need to investigate.
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests! Blood work… and an… ultrasound? Is it… painful? I don’t like needles. And I’m not very good with machines. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it… something bad? I’m an old lady, you know. I’ve lived a long life. I don’t want to cause too much trouble. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mrs. McConnon. It’s a lot, I know, but these tests are necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. The blood work is just a small prick, and the ultrasound is completely painless – it uses sound waves, like an echo. No needles involved. We’re looking for anything that might be causing your symptoms – it could be something simple, like a change in your diet, or something else that needs attention. I want to be thorough. And you're not causing any trouble at all. You’re doing the right thing by getting checked out. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’m going to give you a requisition for the blood work and a referral to the imaging center for the ultrasound. They will call you to schedule an appointment. Can you manage that, or would you like me to have someone from my office assist you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. No needles… that’s good. And no trouble, you say? I think… I think I can manage the appointments. My granddaughter, Anya, she’s very good with these things. She can help me. Yes, Anya can do it. She’s a very smart girl. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. It's just… getting old is hard. So many things go wrong. Can Anya come with me to the appointments? For support, you see? I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. McConnon. Having Anya with you is a very good idea. Support is always helpful. Here are the papers. The requisition is for the blood work – you can go to any lab that accepts your insurance, though I have a list of preferred labs if you’d like. And this is the referral to the imaging center. They'll call to schedule the ultrasound. I want to emphasize that we're just gathering information at this point. Try not to worry too much. We’ll discuss the results once they are available. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all for now. Anya will help me with everything. She’s very organized. It’s just… it’s been a long time since I’ve had to deal with doctors and tests and things. I used to be a sociologist, you see. Lots of people, lots of details… but not this. I hope the tests aren’t too expensive. I don’t have much money. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I think I’ll go home now. And let Anya help me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. McConnon. We’ll do our best to make sure everything goes smoothly. As for the cost, we have a financial counselor who can help you navigate any concerns. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, give you her information before you leave. Get some rest, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care now, and I’ll see you soon.
