DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, I… I saw something online about preventing HIV, and thought I should probably get checked out. It's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know? I think it was called PrEP? Something like that.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Preventative medication. Well, it's good you're being proactive, I suppose. Though relying on the internet for medical advice… hmph. Let's get some information first. Now, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t get me started on the internet! My granddaughter is always telling me not to believe everything I read. And yes, I am. Not… a lot, but I am. It’s… complicated. I date sometimes. It's not regular, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Complicated. Of course. And are these… partners, generally, known to you?
PATIENT: Well, some I’ve known for a while, friends of friends mostly. Others… not so much. Just people I meet. It's not like I go looking for one-night stands, if that’s what you’re thinking! I just… like company, and sometimes it leads to that. Is that… bad? I don’t really know what I’m supposed to say. I just want to be careful, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Not bad, Ms. Trefren. Just… relevant. And frankly, a bit irresponsible if you aren't taking precautions. Have you consistently used condoms with these partners?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, yes! Most of the time. I mean, it’s always in the back of my mind, but… sometimes things happen, you know? A moment of… passion. It’s silly, I know. And I always feel terrible afterwards, thinking, "Did I forget something?" That's why I'm here, honestly. I'm getting older, and my memory isn't what it used to be. I just want to make sure I don't… mess up.
DOCTOR: "Mess up"?
PATIENT: Well… catch something, you know? Get sick. I don't want to risk anything. It's not something I talk about much, even with my daughter. It feels… shameful, I guess. Old lady and all that. But I’d rather be preventative. And I keep reading things online about how PrEP is a good option, if you’re… not always perfect with protection. But I don't want to be taking pills if I don't need to, you understand? It’s a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Online. Always the online. Alright. Let’s get a basic medical history then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Whatever you need. I’ve got Medicare, if that helps. And I’m generally healthy, I think. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure last year, but it’s under control now. I walk every day, if the weather is nice. And I try to eat my vegetables. Is there a form I need to fill out? I’m good at filling out forms, I used to be a secretary.
DOCTOR: Medicare is fine. We'll get to the forms later. Right now, I need to know about any past illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays. Have you been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out about fifteen years ago, no problems with that. And I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, playing basketball. Stupid, really. And I had the flu a couple of times, like everyone else. Oh, and I was in the hospital for a few days when my daughter was born, but that was a long time ago! Nothing major, honestly. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. But lately…well, I’ve just been a bit anxious, I guess. That’s why I’m here. Trying to be smart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of… significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. My mother had arthritis, really bad towards the end. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He smoked for years, stubborn man. My sister has high blood pressure, like me, but she manages it with diet. And my daughter is healthy as a horse, thankfully. Does that help? I can try to remember more if you need me to, I have a pretty good memory for things like that. Especially family stuff. It’s just… a lot of people to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Fine. And… are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible, honestly. I always worry about side effects. And I don't really believe in all those fancy supplements, just a waste of money, if you ask me. Although, my granddaughter is always trying to get me to take vitamins… she says I’m getting too old! Honestly, Doctor, I’m pretty straightforward. Not much to tell you.
DOCTOR: Straightforward, hmm. Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the exam. That’s fine. No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, pretty much. And I haven’t had a reaction to any medication before, as far as I know. You can listen to my heart and lungs, no problem. Although, I do get a little nervous at the doctor, so my blood pressure might be a bit high. It always goes up when they put that cuff on! Honestly, Doctor, I’m an open book. Just… try not to be too rough. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Old bones. Right. Roll up your sleeve, please. Let's start with your blood pressure. And I’ll listen to your lungs, just to be thorough. Breathe deeply. Hmm. A little elevated, but not surprising given your anxiety. Lungs sound clear, though a bit of wheezing. Have you had a cough recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, that cuff is tight! And yes, a bit of wheezing, you say? Well, I have had a little tickle in my throat for the past week or so. Nothing serious, just a dry cough. I thought it was the dust, honestly. We had a bit of a sandstorm last week, and everything was covered in grit. I’ve been drinking a lot of tea, and it seems to be helping. It’s probably just a bit of a summer cold, if you ask me. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not usually this delicate. It's just... the doctor's office always gets to me.
DOCTOR: Dry cough, possible dust irritation. Alright. Let's check your heart now. Heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Have you ever been told you have a heart murmur before?
PATIENT: A murmur? Oh, my goodness. No, never! Not that I recall, anyway. My regular doctor never mentioned anything. Is that… bad? Honestly, Doctor, you’re starting to scare me a little bit! I just came in here for a little preventative thing, and now you’re talking about murmurs and dust and… Honestly, I think I need to sit down. My knees are starting to feel a bit wobbly. I just want to be safe, you know? And now I feel like there's something seriously wrong with me.
DOCTOR: It’s likely a benign murmur, Ms. Trefren. Many people have them, especially as they get older. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. But, to be thorough, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Just to check your overall health, and rule out anything serious. And an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and an EKG? Honestly, Doctor, is all this really necessary? I just wanted to talk about PrEP, and now I feel like I'm falling apart! I’m not sure I can handle all of this. And…what if something is wrong? I don’t want to know. I just want to be healthy, you know? It’s a lot to take in. Maybe I should just forget the whole thing. PrEP sounds risky enough without having a heart attack on top of it! Honestly, Doctor, I think I need a moment. Maybe a glass of water? This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Fine. Let's start with the blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. And we’ll get the EKG scheduled for later this week. My nurse will draw the blood for you. As for the PrEP, we can discuss it further once we have the results of the tests. It's best to have a complete picture before making any decisions. Is that alright?
