DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, really. I have… a lot of gas. More than usual. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it’s… uncomfortable. It makes me feel quite full, you see. And… well, the sound is not pleasant, either. I hope this doesn’t sound silly.
DOCTOR: No, not at all silly, Mr. Goodstein. It’s perfectly reasonable to come in about something that’s bothering you, and excessive gas can be quite disruptive. We'll figure out what's going on. So, a few weeks now… can you tell me a bit more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started… around the middle of July, I believe. Yes, July 15th, perhaps? My neighbor, Mrs. Petrov, had a barbecue, and I had… quite a lot to eat. A new sausage, I think it was. Spicy. But I didn't think much of it then. It just got… worse over time. Now it happens nearly every day, several times a day. Not always after eating, either. Sometimes it happens just… randomly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around July 15th, coinciding with a barbecue and trying a new, spicy sausage. And it’s become more frequent and is now happening even when you haven’t eaten recently. Do you notice anything specific that seems to trigger it, besides eating?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. Let me see… I do notice it gets worse when I am… stressed. I worry a lot about things, you know? Bills, the news… small things, mostly. And also… when I drink fizzy drinks. Coca-Cola, Sprite… those make it much, much worse. But even when I avoid those, it still happens. Not as bad, but… still there. Is that helpful information? I do not want to bother you with too much detail.
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Goodstein. Stress and fizzy drinks are definitely things we should consider. It sounds like those are aggravating factors. Now, aside from the gas, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, sometimes my stomach feels a little… bloated. Like it’s full of air, even when it isn’t. And… occasionally, a little bit of cramping. Not painful, exactly. More like… uncomfortable squeezing. But it does not happen every time I have the gas. And… no, that is all. No nausea, no change in my… bathroom habits, nothing like that. Just the gas, bloating, and sometimes a little squeeze in my tummy.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating and occasional mild cramping along with the gas. No changes in bowel movements, no nausea. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Well, the doctor says I have… high blood pressure. But it is controlled with pills. I take one every morning. And… I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. About fifteen years ago, I think. But they say it shouldn't cause any trouble now. Otherwise… no. I have not been seriously ill, thankfully. Just the usual… colds, flu, that sort of thing. I am on Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important information, thank you. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, and a gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. We'll note both of those. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, just the one for the blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it with my breakfast. I do take a vitamin, sometimes. A multivitamin. But not every day. When I remember, mostly. I try to eat healthy, but it is difficult. Old habits, you know? I also use a cream for my… arthritis in my hands. Just a topical cream, nothing taken by mouth. But that is all. No other pills, no other medicines.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the blood pressure medication daily, a multivitamin occasionally, and a topical cream for arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything. Not that I know of, anyway. I eat all sorts of foods. I used to help my mother make pastries, and she used a lot of different things - nuts, fruit, chocolate… everything. Never had a problem. And I’ve never had a rash, or trouble breathing, or anything like that with medicines either. I believe I am quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies is very helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother, she had… stomach problems. Not gas, exactly, but… indigestion, and heartburn. She used to take a lot of pills for it. And my father… he had heart trouble. He passed away when he was quite young, from a heart attack. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. She lives in Budapest. We do not see each other very often. And that is… about it. Nothing else that I can think of. My grandparents… they lived long lives, but I do not know much about their medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had indigestion and heartburn, your father passed away from a heart attack, and your sister is currently healthy. That's helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I do not smoke. My mother always said it was terrible for your health. And I agree with her. I do not like the smell of it either. I avoid people who smoke, if possible. It makes me cough just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I have a small glass of wine with my dinner, sometimes. Red wine. But not every night. Maybe two or three times a week. Just a small glass. It helps me relax, you see. But I do not drink beer, and I certainly do not drink hard liquor. Just a small glass of red wine, occasionally. And not very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of red wine two or three times a week. That’s good to know. Now, finally, could you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: My diet… it is not very good, I am afraid. I try to eat healthy, but… I live alone, you see. It is easier to make something quick and simple. I eat a lot of pasta. And bread. And… processed meats, sometimes. I like sausage, as you know. And I do not eat enough vegetables, I am ashamed to admit. I have a sweet tooth, too. I like cookies and cakes. And chocolate. I know it is not good for me, but… it is difficult to change old habits. I try to have a piece of fruit with my breakfast, sometimes. But mostly… not very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a diet consisting of mostly pasta, bread, processed meats, sweets, with limited vegetables and fruit. I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Goodstein. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your belly and check for any tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. I suppose it is necessary. I hope it will not be too uncomfortable. I am a bit sensitive, you see. But if you think it is important, then please proceed. I trust your judgement. I will try to relax.
DOCTOR: Alright, just take some deep breaths for me. Okay, I'm not finding any significant tenderness to the touch. I do hear some increased bowel sounds, which isn’t surprising given your symptoms, but nothing alarming. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Everything seems normal from a quick examination.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was quite worried. So… what do you think is causing all this gas? Is it something serious? I hope it is not something I need surgery for. I have read so many things on the internet… and they are all very frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Goodstein, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, I don't think it’s anything serious. It sounds most likely to be a combination of factors. Your diet – the pasta, bread, processed meats – those can all contribute to gas production. The fizzy drinks aren't helping either. Stress can also play a significant role, as it affects digestion. And sometimes, it’s just a matter of increased gas production for no clear reason. Surgery is very unlikely to be necessary. We're going to try some conservative measures first, and see if we can get things under control. Have you ever tried any over-the-counter remedies for gas, like simethicone or activated charcoal?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I have not. I have never used anything like that. I just try to… ignore it, mostly. Or take a walk. But it does not always help. Is simethicone… safe? I am a bit wary of taking pills, you know? I prefer to avoid them if possible. And what about activated charcoal? I have heard it can interfere with other medicines. I take my blood pressure pill every day.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible concern, Mr. Goodstein. Simethicone is generally very safe, it works by helping to break up gas bubbles in the digestive tract. It’s not absorbed into the bloodstream, so it doesn't interact with other medications. Activated charcoal can interfere with the absorption of medications, so we'll definitely avoid that given your blood pressure medication. Let’s start with the simethicone. You can find it over-the-counter, usually under brand names like Gas-X or Mylanta Gas. Try taking it before meals, to help prevent the gas buildup. More importantly, though, let's focus on your diet. We're going to try a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks. Have you heard of that before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. What is a… low-FODMAP diet? It sounds complicated. I am not very good at cooking, you see. And I do not want to spend a lot of money on special foods. Is it very expensive? And what sorts of foods am I allowed to eat? I am a bit confused.
DOCTOR: It sounds more complicated than it is, I promise. FODMAP stands for Fermentable Oligo-, Di-, Mono-saccharides And Polyols. Basically, it means reducing foods that are easily fermented in your gut, which can cause gas and bloating. It’s not about buying special foods, it’s about making some smart substitutions. We're cutting back on things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, high-fructose corn syrup, wheat, and dairy. Things like carrots, blueberries, bananas, rice, chicken, and fish are all good. I can give you a handout with a detailed list of what to eat and what to avoid. It does require a bit of effort, but it’s worth trying to see if it makes a difference. And we can start slowly, by cutting out just a few things at a time. Would you like me to explain it in more detail, and go over the handout with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. That would be very helpful. I am a bit overwhelmed, you see. A list of foods would be excellent. And if you could explain it slowly, that would be much appreciated. I want to understand it properly, so I can do it correctly. And… what happens if it does not work? Will I have to go for… tests? I do get very anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That's exactly why we're taking the time to go through this carefully. As you can see on the handout, we’re dividing foods into three categories: Foods to avoid, Foods to limit, and Foods you can eat freely. Foods to avoid are things like onions, garlic, apples, pears, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, wheat products, dairy products, and beans. These are the biggest culprits for gas production. Foods to limit are things like carrots, blueberries, and bananas – you can have small portions of these. And Foods you can eat freely are things like chicken, fish, rice, and gluten-free bread. We'll try this diet for two weeks, and see if your symptoms improve. If they do, we can slowly reintroduce some of the restricted foods to see which ones are causing the problem. If it doesn’t improve after two weeks, then we'll consider other options. And yes, if it doesn't improve, we can discuss further testing, such as a stool test to rule out any underlying infections or a breath test to check for lactose intolerance or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth . But let’s not worry about that just yet. Let's focus on the diet for now, and see how it goes. Do you have any questions about the handout, or anything else?
PATIENT: This is… a lot of information. I see… no onions, no garlic? That will be difficult. I use those in everything. And no dairy? I like a little cheese with my pasta. But… I understand. I will try my best. And… what about sauces? Tomato sauce? Does that have onions in it? And what if I go to a restaurant? It will be very difficult to explain all of this. This is… quite a big change to my lifestyle. I am a bit scared, to be honest. But I trust you, Doctor. I will try my best to follow your instructions.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a big change, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. And yes, those are excellent questions. Tomato sauce can contain onions and garlic, so you'll need to be careful. Read the labels carefully, or choose a plain tomato sauce and add your own herbs and spices. When you go to a restaurant, explain your situation to the waiter. Most restaurants are happy to accommodate dietary requests. You can say something like, “I’m following a low-FODMAP diet, so I need to avoid onions, garlic, and dairy.” Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the ingredients. And remember, it’s okay to slip up occasionally. Just get back on track with your next meal. This is about finding what works for you, and it may take some trial and error. For now, let’s focus on making some simple substitutions. Use herbs and spices to flavor your food instead of onions and garlic. Use lactose-free milk instead of regular milk. And keep a food diary to track your symptoms and see which foods are triggering them. I'll also give you a list of websites and resources with more information about the low-FODMAP diet. Do you feel like you have a better understanding of the diet now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think so. The websites might be helpful. And keeping a food diary… that is a good idea. It will help me track everything. And… you said to try simple substitutions. What about butter? Is that okay? And what about sugar? Can I still have a little bit of sugar in my tea? I do like my tea. It is the only pleasure I have, really. I do not want to give up everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable request, and absolutely, you can still have a little bit of sugar in your tea. Small amounts of refined sugar are generally well-tolerated on a low-FODMAP diet. And yes, butter is generally okay, as long as it doesn't contain any added garlic or herbs. The key is to be mindful and make small changes. Don’t try to overhaul your diet overnight. Focus on one or two substitutions at a time, and see how you feel. So, let's recap. We're going to try a low-FODMAP diet for two weeks, keeping a food diary to track your symptoms. You'll avoid onions, garlic, high-fructose corn syrup, wheat, and dairy, and focus on making simple substitutions. Small amounts of refined sugar and butter are okay. And if you slip up occasionally, don’t worry about it. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… manageable. It is still a bit daunting, but… I will try my best. I trust your judgement. And… what if my symptoms get worse? Should I call you? Or come back for another appointment? I do not want to bother you if it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. If your symptoms get worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, please call the office right away. Don’t hesitate to reach out – that’s what we’re here for. We can schedule a follow-up appointment if needed, and we can adjust the diet as necessary. It's also important to remember that it can take a few days for your symptoms to improve after starting the diet. So, don’t get discouraged if you don’t see results immediately. We're going to work through this together. And remember, this is about finding what works best for you. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have explained it very clearly. I have the handout, and the website links. I will keep a food diary, and I will try my best to follow your instructions. Thank you for your patience. I hope I have not wasted your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Goodstein. You haven’t wasted my time. I'm glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'll see you in a couple of weeks, and we can see how things are going. Take care, and good luck. .
