DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Elijiah. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Thanks for seein’ me. It’s… well, it’s kinda silly, honestly. I’m just havin’ a real hard time gettin’ out of chairs these days. Like, I sit down, and then… stuck. Not really stuck, but it takes effort, y’know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It doesn't sound silly at all – any difficulty with movement is worth checking out. It's good you came in. Just to clarify, when you say "hard time getting out," can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not pain, exactly. More like… my legs feel heavy. Real heavy. And kinda… disconnected, almost. Like they don’t wanna move right away. I gotta kinda… will them to work, and even then it’s slow. It’s worse the longer I sit. If I get up pretty quick, it’s not so bad. But if I’m relaxin’ for a bit, forget about it. It's kinda like when you’ve been sittin' too long on a long drive, but… it lasts longer, and happens even when I haven’t been travelin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy legs and a feeling of disconnection, worse with prolonged sitting. That gives me a little more to work with. And it's not accompanied by pain, which is good to know. Just to get a better picture, has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: It started… maybe six, seven months ago? At first, it was just now and then. I figured I was just gettin' old, workin' out in the oil fields and all. But it’s been gettin’ worse steadily since then. Like a slow leak, y’know? Now it's pretty much every time I sit for more than… twenty minutes, maybe. Sometimes even less, if I'm really tired. It’s kinda scary, honestly. I gotta be able to move fast when I'm on a rig.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with the demands of your job. A slow progression is helpful information. Okay, so six to seven months, gradually worsening, triggered by sitting, and impacting your ability to move quickly. Now, aside from the oil fields, what else do you do?
PATIENT: Well, not much, Doc. Lost my wife, Maria, about a year and a half ago. Been… quiet since then. Mostly just work, come home, maybe watch some TV. I try to get out fishin' when I can, but haven’t been doin’ much of that lately either. Not much energy for it, I guess. Used to go every weekend with Maria. She loved to fish. So… yeah. Mostly just work and… rememberin’. Not a whole lot of excercise, that's for sure. I eat okay, I think. Mostly beans and rice, tortillas, sometimes chicken if I’m feelin' fancy.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about Maria, Elijiah. It sounds like you've been through a lot. It's completely understandable that your energy levels might be lower. Okay, so some recent lifestyle changes and a period of grief alongside this increasing difficulty with movement. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ diagnosed. Never been much of a sick fella. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Broke my arm once fallin’ outta a tree when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. I’ve had a few aches and pains from the work, of course, but nothin’ serious enough to go to the doctor about. Just busted up knuckles, sore back… stuff like that. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothin’ like that. Maria always told me I was too stubborn to get sick, haha.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A relatively clean medical history is helpful. And it sounds like Maria had a good read on you! Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had anythin’ cut open, thankfully. I’m not a fan of doctors messin’ around inside me, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so. Always figured if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Maria used to tease me about that too. Said I was a dinosaur.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your feelings. It's good to be cautious. Alright, no surgeries. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, my momma had arthritis in her hands when she got older. Real bad. Couldn’t knit no more, which was sad 'cause she made the prettiest blankets. My daddy… he was a strong fella, worked on a farm his whole life. He had some problems with his heart towards the end, but I don’t know much about it. He didn’t talk about it much. And… Maria’s side of the family… they were mostly healthy, as far as I know. Her momma lived to be ninety-two, so I guess good genes were on her side. But honestly, we didn’t talk much about medical stuff. It wasn't really our way.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, some heart issues in your father, generally healthy on Maria’s side. That gives me a little something to work with. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergic reaction to anythin’. I can eat pretty much whatever you put in front of me. Maria used to say I had a cast iron stomach. I've been stung by a few bees workin’ outdoors, but nothin’ serious. Just a little swelling, that’s all. Never needed an EpiPen or anythin’ like that. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. Unless you count bein' allergic to bein' bored, haha. But that’s not a medical allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's not a medical allergy, although I understand the sentiment! Alright, so no known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single pill. I don't like takin' nothin' if I can avoid it. Maria used to try and get me to take vitamins, but I always forgot. Just good old-fashioned beans and rice, that’s my medicine. Maybe I should start takin' somethin', though. I'm startin' to feel my age, haha. But right now, nothin'. Clean as a whistle, Doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful, Elijiah. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. So, to recap: you're a 26-year-old male, generally healthy, with a recent history of difficulty getting out of chairs, which started about six months ago and has been gradually worsening. It's not painful, but you describe it as heavy legs and a disconnect, worse with prolonged sitting. You've experienced a loss and some lifestyle changes recently, and you’re not currently taking any medications or have any known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and do a basic neurological assessment. That will help me narrow down the possibilities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I just wanna figure out what's goin' on and get back to workin', if I can. Fire away. I ain't afraid of a little pokin' and proddin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's just have you sit here on the examination table. And then I'll start with checking your reflexes in your legs. Just relax, and I'll let you know what I'm doing. Okay, good reflexes there. Now I'm going to check your muscle strength. Could you please push your legs against my hands?
PATIENT: There ya go. Like this? I'm tryin', Doc. Ain't been liftin' much lately, just workin’ with tools and such.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. Strength seems… within normal limits, but perhaps a little diminished. Not significantly, but noticeable. Now, I'm going to lightly brush your legs and feet. Just tell me when you feel the sensation. Okay, sensation is intact. Everything seems to be responding normally there. Now, if you don’t mind, could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There ya go. Like this? I try to walk normal, Doc. But like I said, havin’ trouble gettin' up and goin' is the main thing. Walkin’ ain’t so bad, just… the startin' part.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Your gait appears relatively normal, but I do notice a slight hesitation when you initiate movement. And as you mentioned, that difficulty with starting. Now, I'm just going to feel along your lower back to check for any tenderness. Any pain there?
PATIENT: Nope. Not really. A little sore, maybe, from all the work, but nothin' that stands out. I get aches and pains all the time, Doc. Just part of the job. You're feelin' around a lot, though. Everything okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is okay. Just being thorough. I’m not finding any significant tenderness there. Okay, Elijiah. Based on this quick exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s anything acutely wrong. Your reflexes are normal, your sensation is intact, your strength is within normal limits, and I didn’t find any tenderness in your lower back. However, the hesitation when initiating movement and the difficulty getting up from a chair are concerning. Given your symptoms and the gradual onset, it could be a few different things. It could be related to mild nerve compression, a muscle imbalance, or even early signs of peripheral neuropathy – a condition affecting the nerves in your legs. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a couple of blood tests. We'll check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd also recommend an electromyography study – that's a test that assesses the electrical activity in your muscles and nerves. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doc. Blood tests and that… EMG thing. I don't really know what any of that is, but if it'll help figure out what's wrong, I'm game. I just wanna get back to workin'. I ain’t one for sittin’ around doin’ nothin’. So, yeah. Let’s do it. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I understand your eagerness to get back to work. Okay, so I'll write you a lab order for the blood tests. You can go to any Quest Diagnostics lab – there are several locations around the city. And I’ll give you a referral for the EMG study. You’ll need to schedule an appointment with a neurologist. I have a list of neurologists in the area that are covered by most insurance plans, but since you're currently uninsured, we'll need to explore some options that offer a sliding scale or affordable payment plans. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, help you with that after this appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding prolonged sitting as much as possible. When you do sit, try to stand up and move around every 20-30 minutes. Gentle stretching and light exercise can also be helpful, but avoid anything that causes pain or discomfort. And lastly, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as weakness, numbness, or tingling – or if you develop any new symptoms, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Wow. Okay. That's… a lot. Blood tests, neurologist, avoid sittin', stretchin'... I think I got it. Um… the neurologist thing… how long does that usually take to get an appointment? And is that EMG thing gonna hurt? I ain't too fond of needles. And… what about work? Can I still, like, try to work while I'm waitin' for all this to happen? I kinda need the money, you know?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Elijiah. Let's tackle them one by one. Getting an appointment with a neurologist can vary, but typically it takes about 2-4 weeks, sometimes longer depending on their availability. I’ll make a note to Sarah to prioritize getting you an appointment as soon as possible. As for the EMG study, it does involve small needles, but it's generally well-tolerated. There's usually a mild, brief discomfort when the needle is inserted, similar to a bug bite, but it shouldn’t be painful. The technician will do their best to minimize any discomfort. And finally, regarding work. That's a tricky one. It depends on the nature of your job and the severity of your symptoms. If your job involves heavy lifting or prolonged sitting, I would advise against it until we get the results of the tests and have a better understanding of what’s going on. However, if your job involves lighter tasks and you can take frequent breaks to stand up and move around, it might be okay. I can write you a note to your employer explaining your symptoms and recommending modified duties for the time being. But ultimately, you need to listen to your body and avoid anything that exacerbates your symptoms. Does that address your concerns?
PATIENT: Yeah, that helps a lot, Doc. Thank you. A note for work would be great. And… tryin' to avoid the sittin' and takin' breaks. And gettin' to that neurologist as soon as possible. I guess… that's all I can do for now, huh? Wait and see. It's just… kinda scary not knowin' what's wrong. Maria always told me I was a worrywart. But thanks again, Doc. You've been real helpful. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to me. I'll let Sarah know about the work note and get those tests scheduled.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Elijiah. It's understandable to be worried when you don't know what's going on. That's why we're doing these tests – to get a clear picture of what's going on and develop a plan to get you feeling better. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And remember, listening to your body is the most important thing. I'll have Sarah come in and give you the lab orders and referral. She’ll also help you with the work note. Take care of yourself, Elijiah. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
