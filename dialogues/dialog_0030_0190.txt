DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve been feeling… unsteady. Like I might fall over. It’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s quite concerning. I don't quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. Feeling unsteady, like you might fall over. That is concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. You mentioned it’s been happening for “a bit now.” Could you try to be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific. That is… troublesome. I wish my memory were better. Let me think… It feels like… several weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month or two? It’s hard to say. It wasn’t sudden, not like I tripped and then it began. It just… gradually worsened. I do recall feeling a little dizzy at work sometimes, but I attributed that to the… the machinery. We operate drills, you see. Quite a lot of vibration.
DOCTOR: Okay, several weeks to a couple of months, and it developed gradually. And you work with machinery that causes a lot of vibration. That’s helpful information. Aside from the dizziness at work, have you noticed the unsteadiness in other situations?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I believe so. It's… more noticeable when I’m walking, certainly. And sometimes when I stand for long periods. It's funny, actually. It doesn’t happen all the time. Some days I feel perfectly fine. Others… well, others I feel as though I might topple over with the slightest breeze. It’s unsettling. I don't recall if it's worse at certain times of the day… I’m afraid my recollection is quite poor.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s intermittent, which can be frustrating. Noticing patterns is important, so don’t worry about the recollection – we'll try to piece things together. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I have been rather fatigued lately, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… I’ve had a few headaches, but they’re not terribly severe. Mostly just a dull ache. Nothing I would normally bother a doctor about, to be honest. And… oh, dear. This is difficult. I think my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so… it's hard to say if that’s new or not.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some mild headaches, and possible blurry vision. We'll explore that vision a bit further, as changes can be significant. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That is… a difficult question. My husband handled most of those details. He passed away a little over a year ago, you see. I believe I had the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… things of that nature. And I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. I don't recall any other significant conditions. I'm afraid I wasn’t particularly attentive to such things. Is this important?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Lilyanna. It's understandable that details might be difficult to recall right now. It is important, but don’t feel pressured to remember everything. We can work with what you do recall. The pneumonia is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don't believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was quite routine. And… Oh, there was a small procedure on my knee, years ago. A sports injury. I was rather active then. It wasn’t a full surgery, more of a… scope, I think. But it didn’t require a hospital stay, if that makes a difference. It healed quickly, and I haven’t had any trouble with it since. Honestly, my memory regarding these things is quite spotty. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lilyanna. Wisdom teeth removal and a knee scope - I’ve documented that. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family medical history… This is particularly difficult. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing specific, just… a weak heart, they said. My siblings… I don't recall any major illnesses amongst them. One brother has diabetes, I think, but he wasn’t terribly forthcoming about his health. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. My husband’s family… I wasn’t particularly close to them, so I don’t know much about their medical history at all. Is that helpful? I feel terribly inadequate.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Lilyanna, thank you. High blood pressure in your mother and heart trouble in your father is good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, my no. Absolutely not. I have never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that is all. And recreational drugs… the very idea! No, Doctor, I lead a very… temperate lifestyle. I spend most of my time at work, or tending to my home. It's rather quiet, since my husband passed, but peaceful. I do take pride in maintaining a respectable household. Is there a reason you ask?
DOCTOR: I ask everyone, Lilyanna, as part of a standard medical assessment. It helps me get a complete picture of your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, I take a multivitamin, of course. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but only occasionally. Nothing regular. Oh! And I used to take something for my blood pressure, a few years back, but the doctor took me off of it when it went down. I believe it was… I'm terribly sorry, but I can't recall the name of the medication. It was a small white pill, I think. My husband handled all of that, and I didn't pay much attention to the details. I apologize for my inadequacy. It seems I am not very helpful at all.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Lilyanna. You’re doing perfectly fine. Many people find medication names difficult to recall. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don't believe so, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can recall. And I eat a fairly standard diet – nothing unusual. I do sometimes get a bit of a stuffy nose during pollen season, but I don't consider that a true allergy. I've never had any severe reactions to anything, thankfully. No hives, no difficulty breathing… nothing like that. I suppose I'm quite fortunate in that regard. Is that helpful? I do hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilyanna. This is all very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I suppose the more you examine me, the better you’ll understand what’s going on. I just… I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your vital signs. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam to assess your balance and coordination. We’ll also take a look at your ears and throat. Blood pressure is 128/76. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiratory rate is 16. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Now, please walk heel-to-toe for me. I’m observing a slight unsteadiness in your gait and a mild wobble. Now, please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. You exhibit some swaying, but you are able to maintain your balance. Okay, Lilyanna. Thank you for your cooperation. I would like to order some bloodwork to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any underlying infections. I also think an MRI of the brain would be beneficial to get a clearer picture of what may be causing your unsteadiness.
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? That sounds… rather serious. Is it necessary? What do you suspect is the cause of all this? I must admit, I’m quite frightened. My husband… he always handled these things. I feel so lost without him. Is it something… neurological? Something… terrible?
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, I understand your fear, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let me assure you, we are doing this to rule things out and get to the bottom of what’s causing your unsteadiness. An MRI will give us a much clearer picture of your brain and help us identify any potential issues. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, there are several possibilities. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or a problem with your inner ear. It could be something neurological, but it’s far too early to say that definitively. The MRI will help us determine the cause and guide our treatment plan. I don’t want to cause you any unnecessary anxiety, but it's important to be thorough. I will order the MRI and bloodwork. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding driving or operating heavy machinery. I also want to refer you to a neurologist for a consultation. They are specialists in the brain and nervous system and can provide a more detailed assessment. We will discuss the results of the tests and the neurologist’s recommendations at a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Oh dear. That does sound serious. What… what are the possible causes, if it is neurological? And… what kind of treatment would be involved? I understand you can't give me a diagnosis yet, but… just a general idea would be helpful. I feel so helpless, not knowing what’s going on. And… will the MRI hurt? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, it’s perfectly understandable to be anxious and want to know what to expect. Let’s address your questions one by one. If it is neurological, the possibilities are varied. It could be something like a mild stroke, although based on your symptoms, that's less likely. It could be a problem with your cerebellum, which controls balance and coordination. There are also conditions like multiple sclerosis or Parkinson’s disease, but again, those are less common and we won't jump to any conclusions. The neurologist will be able to assess your symptoms more thoroughly and determine the cause. Treatment would depend on the diagnosis. It could range from medication to physical therapy to lifestyle changes. Regarding the MRI, it’s a painless procedure. You’ll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-60 minutes. You won't feel anything during the scan, but if you're claustrophobic, we can discuss options for managing that, such as medication or an open MRI. I want to emphasize again that we are doing this to get to the bottom of what’s causing your unsteadiness. We will take things one step at a time, and I will be here to support you throughout the process. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Claustrophobic… yes. I believe I am. Small spaces… they make me very anxious. Would an open MRI be possible? And… what if it is something serious? What if… what if it's something that requires… surgery? I'm afraid I'm getting rather overwhelmed. Perhaps I should have just stayed home. I'm clearly not equipped to handle all of this. My husband… he would have known what to do.
DOCTOR: Lilyanna, it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. It's perfectly normal to be anxious, and you’re not alone in this. We will take things at your pace, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Yes, an open MRI is definitely an option. It’s less enclosed and may be more comfortable for you. I will write a note to the radiology department requesting that you have an open MRI. Regarding your concern about surgery, it's too early to say whether that would be necessary. Many neurological conditions can be managed with medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. If surgery is required, we would discuss all of your options thoroughly and ensure you understand the risks and benefits. You are not equipped to handle this alone, and you shouldn't be. That's what I'm here for. We will work together, and I will explain everything in detail. We'll start with the MRI and then see the neurologist. Let’s focus on getting through one step at a time. Do you have a family member or friend who could come with you to the MRI appointment for support?
PATIENT: No… I live alone. My children live out of state, and they… they have their own lives. They’re very busy. I don’t want to burden them. I suppose I'll have to manage on my own. I always do. Very well. An open MRI, then. And I'll see the neurologist. What is their name? And where are they located? I suppose I should make an appointment. I just… I wish my husband were here. He always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: His name is Dr. Alistair Finch. He’s located at the City General Hospital, Neurology Department. Here’s his phone number and address. His office is located on the third floor, suite 305. The number is 555-123-4567. I can have my office staff call and schedule an appointment for you if you’d like. They can also provide directions to the hospital and answer any questions you may have. I understand how difficult this must be, and I want to assure you that you're not alone. We will work together, and I will do everything I can to support you. Now, I'll write the order for the MRI and a referral to Dr. Finch. Once you have an appointment scheduled, please let my office know so we can send them your medical records. Do you have any other questions or concerns right now?
PATIENT: Thank you… thank you very much. Yes, please. If your staff could schedule the appointment for me, that would be wonderful. I… I don't think I can manage it on my own right now. And… is there anything I should do to prepare for the MRI? Anything I should avoid? Perhaps… perhaps this won't be so bad after all. If I just take things one step at a time. You've been very kind, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. That's what we're here for. Let me have my staff schedule the appointment for you right away. Nurse Davies, could you please schedule an MRI and a neurology appointment for Lilyanna Snerling?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. And… thank you to Nurse Davies as well. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime? Any symptoms I should be watching out for? Or… anything I should avoid doing? I just want to be prepared. I don't want to… make things worse. I appreciate your patience, Doctor. You've been very reassuring.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity or situations that could cause you to fall. Continue to take your multivitamin, and stay well-hydrated. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe headache, vision changes, weakness, numbness, difficulty speaking, or loss of balance – please contact my office immediately. Otherwise, just try to rest and relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll have my staff give you a copy of these instructions before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. You've been very thorough, Doctor. And… very kind. I appreciate your patience and your reassurance. It’s… it’s comforting to know that I’m not alone in this. Thank you, Doctor. Very much. I suppose I should be going now? I don't want to take up any more of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It's my pleasure. And you haven't taken up any of my time at all. We’re here to help. My staff will escort you to the checkout desk and give you your instructions and the MRI order. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you, Lilyanna. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. It was… comforting to meet you. I believe I’ll be going now. Thank you again, Doctor.
