DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Piet, you say? Hmm. Well, honestly, I don't quite recall exactly what brings me here. My husband, Tenzin, he made the appointment. Said something about being awfully tired lately. Just… worn out. It's not like I’ve been sitting around doing nothing, you know. I’m still a commercial diver, even at my age! Though… it is harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Commercial diver, that's… quite active! Okay. So, primarily feeling tired, even with your work. Has this tiredness been sudden, or has it been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Though it comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, a little achy, maybe. But then other days… just no energy. Like someone’s drained all the strength right out of me. It’s been… unsettling. And Tenzin keeps fussing over it. He worries so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fluctuating fatigue. That's helpful. And you mentioned some aches as well?
PATIENT: Yes, aches. Mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, sometimes. It's hard to say, really. Old age, probably. Always something creaking and groaning. Though… they feel a bit different than the usual aches. More… deep-seated, if that makes any sense. Like the pain is in the muscle itself, not just in the joints.
DOCTOR: "Deep-seated" muscle pain, alright. We’ll definitely want to explore that. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats with this fatigue and muscle pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, not that I’ve noticed. And chills… well, it gets chilly here sometimes, doesn’t it? But not a shivering sort of chill. And night sweats… oh dear, no. I always sleep quite warmly. Tenzin complains, actually. Says I heat up the whole bed! Honestly, he exaggerates.
DOCTOR: Sounds like Tenzin is a caring husband. No fever, no chills, no night sweats – that’s good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: My appetite is… alright. I still enjoy my food, thank goodness. Though, I haven't been as hungry as usual, perhaps. And… well, I suppose I’ve lost a little weight. Just a bit. My clothes feel a little looser. But I wouldn’t say it’s anything dramatic. Probably just from not eating quite as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite with some mild weight loss. And fatigue and muscle aches… Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and just take a look at you overall. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A physical exam. I suppose that's sensible. Though I've always been rather healthy, you know. Still, if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be very gentle. Okay, let's start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, Ardelle… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your reflexes. Alright… reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. And finally, let’s just quickly check your muscles. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! There. Right… there. In my calf. And… a little here, in my bicep. That's… quite sore, actually. Not constantly, but when you press on it like that, yes. Definitely tender. I hadn’t really paid much attention to it before, to be honest. I just thought it was old age, as usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the calf and bicep muscles noted. Given your fatigue, muscle aches, and the tenderness I’m feeling, I’m thinking we should run some blood tests to rule out a few things. Specifically, I want to check your vitamin D levels, thyroid function, and do a complete blood count to look for any signs of inflammation or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh dear. I hate needles. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I suppose I can endure it. Though Tenzin will have to drive me, you know. I don’t trust myself to drive after all that fuss. And… will it be a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: It won't be a lot, Ardelle, just a few vials. And yes, it's perfectly reasonable for Tenzin to drive. We’ll get the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they can help you schedule an appointment. It’s usually fairly quick. While we're waiting for the results, it's also important to stay hydrated and get as much rest as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Rest? That's easier said than done, you know. Still diving, as I mentioned. Though perhaps… I should take it a little easier. Just for a while. Hydrated… yes, I can manage that. Water is good. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… get the blood tests done, and tell me what’s wrong, alright? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ardelle. We’ll get those tests done, and we’ll figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. I’ll have the front desk schedule those tests for you and give you instructions on how to prepare. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you need a note for work, considering your commercial diving job?
PATIENT: A note for work… hmm. Perhaps. I don’t want them thinking I’m… slacking, you know? It wouldn't be a good look. Yes, a note would be good. Just something saying I need to take it easy for a bit. Nothing too detailed, alright? I don’t want to alarm anyone.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can write a note stating you've been seen for fatigue and muscle aches and are advised to reduce your physical exertion for a period of time. I’ll have the front desk print that out for you along with the lab order. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Ardelle?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Though, I still don’t like the sound of those blood tests… But, needs must, I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll sit here for a moment before Tenzin comes. All this talk has made me rather tired.
DOCTOR: Of course, take your time. I’ll leave you to rest, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Please don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day, Ardelle.
