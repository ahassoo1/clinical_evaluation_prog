DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Oh, well… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, you understand? It comes and goes. It feels… tight, like someone is sitting on it. A little scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain can definitely be concerning. “Comes and goes” is good information. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… when does it happen… let me think. It's hard to say exactly. But I think… when I walk up the hill to my daughter’s house, it gets worse. And sometimes, if I’ve been gardening all day, bending and lifting, it bothers me. But not always when I garden. It’s… tricky. It doesn’t hurt when I’m just sitting, watching TV, you know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful. So, it seems to be related to exertion – walking uphill or physical activity like gardening. And it doesn’t happen at rest. About how long does the pain last when it does occur?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Not long! Usually… maybe five minutes? Ten, if I really pushed myself. Then it goes away. I just… slow down and it stops. But it makes me worry, you know? Like maybe I should not be doing so much. My husband, he worries too.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good you're paying attention to it. Five to ten minutes with activity, then relieved with rest… That's important to note. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, what number would you give the pain when it’s happening?
PATIENT: Oh, a number… hmm. Okay. When it’s bad… maybe a 4? No, not bad bad. More like… a bothersome 4. It’s not like a sharp pain, it's more like… pressure. Like someone is squeezing. Not 10, definitely not 10! That would be awful. Maybe a 4 or a 5 when I’m really walking up that hill. It doesn’t take my breath away or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a 4 or 5, described as pressure, brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. No shortness of breath. That's helpful. Now, aside from the chest pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think… Hmm. Well, sometimes my arms feel a little tired. But I do a lot of gardening, so maybe that’s just from that. And… oh! My jaw feels a little funny sometimes. But not all the time. Like a little ache, not a sharp pain. Is that… is that something I should tell you? It’s hard to say if it’s connected.
DOCTOR: Yes, please tell me everything, even if you're unsure if it's connected. The fatigue in your arms and the occasional jaw discomfort are both good things to mention. Can you describe when you notice the fatigue in your arms?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad I told you. The arms… it’s after I’ve been weeding for a long time. Or if I’m lifting heavier pots. It's not a weakness, you understand? More like… tired. Like they need a rest. It goes away pretty quick if I stop and sit down for a bit. And the jaw… that’s harder to say. Sometimes it aches a little when I’m chewing. But I have an old tooth, so maybe that’s the problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue in the arms with prolonged activity, relieved with rest, and jaw discomfort occasionally when chewing, possibly related to an old tooth. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history… let me think. Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill. I take it every day. I think it's working okay, he hasn’t changed it. And… I had a little bit of cholesterol, he said. But nothing too bad. He told me to eat less butter. I try to, but I like butter! No diabetes, no. Never had that. And I had the flu shot last year, and… oh, and I had a bad fall a few years ago, broke my wrist. But that’s healed now. Everything else… I think I’m pretty healthy for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and slightly elevated cholesterol. You had a broken wrist a few years ago that has healed, and you get the flu shot. That’s good information. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies! Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband, he’s allergic to cats, but I’m not. I’ve taken lots of different pills over the years, for headaches and things, and I never had a problem. Never had a rash or trouble breathing. No, no allergies. I’m lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Besides the blood pressure pill… oh! Sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis in my hands. It’s just when they’re really sore. It’s a little white pill. I don't take it every day, just when I need it. And… sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little something for that too. But not very often. Just when I’m really worried about something. Mostly, just the blood pressure pill.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a blood pressure pill daily, and occasionally take something for arthritis and for sleep. Do you know the names of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, the names… that's a hard one. The blood pressure pill… I think it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. And the arthritis one… let me see… it’s a little white pill, the bottle says… Ibuprofen. Yes, Ibuprofen. And the sleep one… oh dear, I have so many bottles. Let me look… it’s… Diphenhydramine. Yes, that’s it! Diphenhydramine. I hope I said those right. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril daily for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Diphenhydramine occasionally for sleep. That’s very helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! Not even once. My mother smoked, and it gave her terrible trouble. No, no smoking. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit years and years ago. We’re both very careful about our health.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Good. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little bit. We have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week. Just one glass each. It helps us relax. I don't drink very much, and my husband doesn't either. Not like some people, you understand? Just a little bit with dinner.
DOCTOR: Okay, a glass of wine with dinner a few times a week. And finally, can you tell me a little about your job and activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, my job! I am a transportation inspector. I check the buses and things, make sure they are safe. It keeps me busy. I walk a lot, walking around the buses, checking things. But it's not too strenuous, you understand? And I garden, like I said. I try to stay active. I walk to my daughter's house when I can, but it's uphill, and that's when my chest bothers me. I guess I’m pretty active for my age, but sometimes I worry about pushing myself too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work as a transportation inspector, which involves walking, and you enjoy gardening. That's good to know. Alright, Ms. Chelberg, I’m going to take a look at your chart here. I see your blood pressure has been fairly well controlled on Lisinopril, as you mentioned. Cholesterol levels are slightly elevated, but stable. No significant allergies listed. You had the flu shot last year. And your BMI is 33, which puts you in the obese category. Now, based on what you’ve told me – the chest pain with exertion, relieved by rest, the fatigue in your arms, the occasional jaw discomfort, and your medical history – I want to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what's going on, and if a check-up will help, then that’s fine with me. A BMI of 33? I’m a little bigger, yes, but I’m strong! I garden all day, you know. But, yes, check me. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90 today, which is a little elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Everything looks normal there. Now, I’m going to feel your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal as well. Finally, I’m going to check your extremities – your arms and legs – for any swelling or tenderness. No swelling or tenderness in your extremities. Your reflexes are normal. Okay, Ms. Chelberg, everything seems normal on the physical exam. However, given your symptoms of chest pain with exertion, and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it would be prudent to order some tests. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. If tests will help you figure out what's going on, then yes, please do them. I want to know what's happening, and I trust your judgment. What kind of tests? I hope they're not too bad. I don't like needles very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern about needles. We'll try to keep it as minimal as possible. I’d like to order a few things. First, an EKG, or electrocardiogram, to check the electrical activity of your heart. That doesn't require a needle. Then, some blood work. We'll check your cholesterol levels again, as well as some markers to rule out any heart damage. That will require a small blood sample. And finally, I’d like to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything in your lungs that could be causing your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… an EKG, that sounds okay. No needle, good. Blood work… yes, I can do blood work. And a chest X-ray… I had one of those a long time ago. It's not so bad, right? I just don't like being exposed to… what is it… radiation? But if you think it’s important, then yes, do it. I want to know what's going on. Just… tell me when and where I need to go for these tests, and try not to use too many needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns and will certainly keep that in mind. The radiation exposure from a chest X-ray is very minimal, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks. The lab is just down the hall. They can take the blood sample right away. Then, the radiology department is on the second floor. You can go up there after the blood work. They'll take the chest X-ray. The EKG can be done here in the office after you’re done with the blood work; my nurse will set that up for you. I’ll have my nurse give you the paperwork you need. Once you have the results, they will be sent to me, and I’ll give you a call to discuss them. It usually takes a couple of days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed and avoiding strenuous activity. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You explained it very clearly, Doctor. Just… avoiding strenuous activity? That's hard, because I like to garden! But, okay, I’ll try. And I will call you if anything gets worse. I appreciate you listening to me, and thank you for taking the time to figure out what's going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And… thank you for not making me feel silly about worrying.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. It’s my job to listen and help you figure things out. It's never silly to worry about your health! Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. My nurse will be right in to get you started with the tests. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
