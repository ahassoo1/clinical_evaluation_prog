DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it's hard to explain exactly. I just get full so quickly when I eat. Even a little bit of food feels like too much, you know? It’s been happening for a while now, and it's a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling full quickly, even with small amounts of food… and you said this has been going on for some time?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few months now, I'd say. Maybe longer, hard to pin down exactly. It’s not like a sharp pain or anything, just… uncomfortable. And it makes it hard to enjoy my food, which is a shame. My wife makes a lovely salmon chowder, but I can barely get a bowl down these days.
DOCTOR: Salmon chowder… right. And it’s not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or any significant abdominal pain, just this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: No, no sickness or pain, thankfully. Just… full. Like someone put a brick in my stomach after only a few bites. And it doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, fish, even just a piece of toast. It all feels the same. It’s just… odd. I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Obarr. We need to explore this further. Have you noticed any weight loss associated with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, I think so. Not a lot, but my clothes feel a bit looser than they used to. My wife keeps saying I look thinner, but I just figured it was old age creeping in. Maybe it is more than that though, huh?
DOCTOR: Weight loss is concerning, especially with the early fullness. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I had a bit of a bad cold a few winters ago, but nothing serious. My wife worries about my blood pressure sometimes, but it’s usually okay when the nurse checks it. Other than that… just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: No, never been in hospital, thankfully. No surgeries either. I've always avoided them if I could. My father used to say “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”, and I kind of took that to heart. Though… I did have my tonsils out when I was a little boy, but that was ages ago. Doesn’t seem relevant now, does it?
DOCTOR: No, that was quite some time ago. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… well, she had a bit of trouble with her stomach when she got older, but I don't know exactly what it was. Something to do with her digestion, I think. And my father… he had heart trouble, towards the end. Nothing much on my wife’s side, as far as I know. She doesn’t talk about her family much. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful. Now, Mr. Obarr, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never been a smoker. Tried it once when I was a young man, didn't like it. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. My wife doesn’t really like me drinking, so I don’t push it. Mostly just tea, to be honest. Lots and lots of tea.
DOCTOR: Tea. Alright. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a bit of fish oil, for my joints. My wife says it's good for me. And sometimes I take a little something for heartburn, but not very often. It’s just… antacids, the kind you get at the store. Nothing prescribed by a doctor. Oh! And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my arthritis, but only when it’s really bad. Just ibuprofen, nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed. Now, Mr. Obarr, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please lie back for me. I’m not feeling any significant tenderness, but I do notice your abdomen feels… slightly distended. Your heart and lungs sound clear, but your pulse is a little weak. I’m also noting some mild generalized swelling in your lower extremities. Can you tell me if you’ve noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… my ankles have been a bit puffy lately. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. We’ve had a warm summer. My wife noticed it too, and said I should put my feet up more. She's always telling me to rest. I suppose she was right, then. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It warrants further investigation, Mr. Obarr. Considering the early fullness, weight loss, abdominal distension, and now the lower extremity edema, I’m concerned about a potential gastrointestinal issue, possibly related to reduced nutrient absorption or even a blockage. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and a nutritional panel to assess your vitamin and electrolyte levels. I’m also going to order a stool sample analysis to check for any signs of malabsorption or infection. Additionally, I recommend an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your organs and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… like a lot. But if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. Whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. I just want to be able to enjoy a bowl of my wife’s chowder again, you know? So, blood work, stool sample, and an… ultrasound. Right. When do we do all this? And… will it hurt? I'm not good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Obarr. The blood draw will be a routine procedure, and we’ll take every precaution to make you comfortable. The ultrasound is non-invasive; a technician will simply apply gel to your abdomen and move a probe around to create images. It shouldn’t cause any discomfort. I’ll have the lab requisition and stool collection kit prepared for you immediately. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood sample today. The stool sample can be collected at home, and you can bring it back with you at your convenience. I’ll schedule the abdominal ultrasound for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to eat small, frequent meals, and avoid any foods that exacerbate your symptoms. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps with you. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Small meals… and try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, I suppose. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for taking the time to listen to an old man's worries. I'll go get the blood work done now. I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Obarr. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this.
