DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… well, a good few days now. Quite bothersome, they are! Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Persistent hiccups, alright. And how many days exactly would you say it’s been?
PATIENT: Let me think… started last Tuesday, I believe. So, four days now. Four full days of hic… there it is again! Four days of this jumping business inside me. It's really quite tiring, to be honest. Especially when I'm trying to rest.
DOCTOR: Four days. And are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, thankfully. Not every second, goodness no. But they pop up several times an hour, easily. Usually after I eat something, but not always. Sometimes just… randomly. It’s a bit unpredictable, really. Makes it hard to enjoy my tea, you know? hic There! See? Even talking sets them off!
DOCTOR: I see. And have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. My granddaughter, Leilani, she told me all sorts of things. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… even a spoonful of sugar! None of it’s worked, sadly. Old wives' tales, I suppose. Though, I did try the sugar - it was a nice spoonful of sugar, at least! hic But no luck.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’m a bit tired, maybe, but that’s just getting old, I reckon. Appetite's normal. No trouble breathing. No pain anywhere, except maybe a little bit of a sore chest from all the… hic… the effort of hiccuping, if that makes sense? Nothing major, truly. Just the hiccups being a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, been on it for years. And I had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when I was a girl, so I stay away from that. Other than that, no. No allergies, no other medications. I’m usually a pretty healthy old bird, you know? hic Just this blasted hiccuping.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril… yes, I see it here. And penicillin allergy noted. Now, just to get a better idea of things, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Happy to have a listen, happy to be poked and prodded! I’ve had plenty of both in my eighty-six years. hic Just hoping you can figure out what’s causing this bother.
DOCTOR: Very good. If you could just lie back on the examination table, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Your abdomen feels normal, and your heart and lungs sound good. No immediate concerns there. Now, I’d like to check your neurological function just to be thorough. Could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Happy to cooperate. hic Here, let me get my glasses on… there we go. hic Yes, I can follow your finger. Nice and steady, you keep it right there. I think my eyes are a bit tired, but they're following alright. Old age, you know? hic Everything's a bit wobbly these days.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common for someone your age, but symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No obvious neurological deficits noted. Everything seems normal so far, Ms. Sucich. Given the persistent nature of the hiccups, and the lack of any other concerning symptoms, it could be a benign case of phrenic nerve irritation. It can sometimes happen spontaneously, or be triggered by minor issues. However, to rule out anything more serious, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray? hic Sounds a bit… serious, doesn’t it? But if that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, absolutely. A complete blood count too… alright. I trust your judgement. hic I just want this hiccuping to stop! It’s driving me bonkers. So, yes, please. Do whatever you need to do. Just tell me what I have to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll just need to get an order for the X-ray, and then the lab will draw some blood. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the nurse come in and assist you with that. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, I’ll also review your medications again and check for any potential interactions. It’s unlikely, but we want to be thorough. And if the hiccups continue to worsen significantly – say, if you develop any shortness of breath, chest pain, or start bringing up anything when you hiccup – please go to the emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I understand perfectly. No shortness of breath, no chest pain, no bringing anything up… just hic… the hiccups! I'll remember that. Emergency room if anything gets worse. I appreciate you being so thorough. hic And I’ll just sit here and try not to jump every five seconds until the nurse comes. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. The nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, try to relax as best you can. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you again. hic I appreciate it.
