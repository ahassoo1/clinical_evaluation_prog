DOCTOR: Hi Ronnald, good to see you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it's a bit hard to explain exactly. Something about… papers? My wife, bless her heart, said I need something from you. For… time off, I think? Or maybe… if I can't work? Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I’m Ronnald Limtiaco, by the way. I think she said something about FMLA? Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA – Family and Medical Leave Act. That makes sense. It sounds like you might be needing some documentation related to a possible leave from work. No worries at all, we can definitely sort that out. It’s common to feel a little confused about all the paperwork. So, to start, can you tell me what's been going on that's making you think about taking time off?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… official. Right, time off. Well… It’s… my memory, mostly. It's been getting worse, I think. Things just… slip away. Names, dates, even what I had for breakfast sometimes! It's making it hard to… focus at work, you know? I'm in charge of religious activities and education at the church, and… well, it requires remembering a lot of things. My wife has been very patient, but she says I need to take care of this. I just… don’t recall what exactly needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, memory issues, getting worse over time, impacting your work at the church. That’s good information, thank you. And it sounds like this is concerning both you and your wife. Can you give me a little more detail about when you started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a hard one. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It's been… gradual. Maybe… six months ago? Or was it a year? It's difficult to pinpoint. I used to be very organized, always knew everyone’s name, could recite hymns from memory… Now, I have to write everything down. Even simple things. I find myself repeating questions, too. My wife gets… concerned when I do that. I think it started around the time… well, around the time we had that big church fundraiser. Did that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ronnald. It is common for these things to come on gradually, and it's helpful to have that timeframe, roughly six months to a year. Repeating questions is definitely something we'd want to explore further. Now, besides the memory issues and repeating questions, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmmm. Let me see. Well, sometimes I feel a bit… lost, you know? Not exactly confused, but… disoriented. Like I'm not quite present. And… My wife says I've been more quiet than usual. I used to enjoy a good conversation, but now… I sometimes struggle to find the right words. It’s frustrating. And I think… I get easily overwhelmed. Big crowds, lots of noise… it just feels… too much. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, that all counts. Feeling lost or disoriented, changes in your personality or energy levels, difficulty finding words, and feeling overwhelmed with crowds - those are all important things to note. Have you experienced any physical symptoms along with these changes?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms… Let me think. Oh! My balance isn't what it used to be. I’ve stumbled a few times, nothing serious, but… more often than I used to. And… I’ve been having headaches. Not terrible, just… a dull ache, mostly in the back of my head. They come and go. And… I've been sleeping… more. A lot more, actually. I used to be a morning person, but now I just want to sleep in. Is that physical enough? I'm not sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, that's very helpful information. Changes in balance, headaches, and increased sleepiness are all things we need to consider. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision… no, I don't think so. I wear glasses, always have, and my prescription hasn't changed recently. I had my eyes checked just last year. Hearing… That's a good question. Maybe… a little bit of ringing in my ears sometimes. Very faint, though. It comes and goes, and I mostly ignore it. My wife hasn't mentioned anything about me not hearing well. I think I'm okay there. Mostly. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just listing things now.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ronnald, just listing everything you've been experiencing is exactly what I need. Ringing in the ears is good to know. Okay, let’s switch gears a little. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. Let me see… I had my prostate checked a few years ago, that was all fine. And… Oh! I had a bout of shingles a long time ago, maybe ten years? But that cleared up completely. Otherwise… I think I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat okay, mostly fish and vegetables. My wife makes sure of that. I don't smoke, never have. And I only drink a little wine with dinner. I don’t recall any other diagnoses. I really don’t. Is that alright? I apologize if I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ronnald. It's common to not remember everything off the top of your head. No history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, prostate check was normal a few years ago, and a history of shingles. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, yes! When I was a young man, I had my appendix out. That was a long time ago, though. And… I think I was hospitalized once for a bad flu, many years ago. But it was nothing serious, just a few days to recover. That's all I can remember, really. I apologize for being so vague. My wife says my memory has always been a bit… unreliable. But it seems to be getting worse lately. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Appendectomy in the past, hospitalization for the flu. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s easy! Not much, thankfully. I take a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure – the doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things healthy. That’s it, really. No other medications, no supplements. Just the lisinopril and the multivitamin. My wife keeps track of everything, makes sure I take them on time. I don’t worry about it too much. Is that alright? I hope I’m not forgetting anything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or dust?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. I can eat anything, breathe anything… I've never had a problem with pollen or dust or anything like that. My wife always asks, just to be safe, but I always tell her no. I really don't have any allergies. Is that alright? I hope I’m not missing anything important. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Ronnald, truly. Okay, we've covered a lot of important information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just… hope it’s nothing too serious. My wife will be very worried if I have to spend a long time at the hospital. But if you think it’s necessary, I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just be gentle, please. My balance isn't what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll take things slow, and I'll make sure you're comfortable the whole time. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – that’s your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72, temperature is 98.6, and your breathing rate is 16. Those are all within normal limits. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. No murmurs, rubs, or wheezes detected. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. This will involve testing your reflexes, muscle strength, and coordination. I’ll also check your balance and gait. Your reflexes are normal, and muscle strength is good. However, your gait is a little unsteady, and you do seem to have some difficulty with balance, as you mentioned. I also noticed some slight tremor in your hands when you extended them. Finally, I’m going to briefly assess your cognitive function. I’ll ask you a few simple questions to check your memory and attention. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. The year… Is it… 2023? No, wait… is it 2024? Oh dear. I’m terrible with dates. My wife always tells me I’m living in the past. I think… I think it’s 2025? But I'm not very sure. I apologize. It's just… hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ronnald. It's okay. These questions can be tricky. And as you said, keeping track of dates can be challenging. Can you tell me the names of three current objects in this room?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. There's… a chair. And… a desk. Oh, and… I'm sorry, Doctor. I can only think of two. My mind is just… blanking. I apologize. I used to be very good at remembering things. But now… it's just… difficult. Is that alright? I feel like I'm failing this test.
DOCTOR: You're not failing any test, Ronnald. This is just to help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. It's perfectly alright that you can only name two objects. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Let me see… The words were… apple, table, and penny, right? Apple… penny… no, table! Table, apple, penny. Is that correct? I hope I remembered them properly. My wife will be so proud if I can do this.
DOCTOR: Alright Ronnald, thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam I’ve performed, you’re experiencing some memory loss, difficulty with balance and coordination, and some changes in your cognitive function. It's important to investigate this further to determine the underlying cause. There are many possible reasons for these symptoms, ranging from medication side effects to vitamin deficiencies, or potentially something more serious like early stages of dementia. I’d like to order some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions and vitamin deficiencies. I also recommend a brain scan, like an MRI, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, okay. That doesn't sound too bad. But… a brain scan? Is that… necessary? It sounds a little scary. Are you… are you saying it could be something serious, Doctor? I just want to know what's going on. I don’t want to worry my wife. But I also don’t want to ignore anything. If it's something I need to do, I will. But I'm a little nervous, to be honest. What are we looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ronnald, and it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. A brain scan is a non-invasive procedure – you simply lie down in a machine that takes pictures of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation or injections. We're looking for any structural abnormalities, like small strokes, tumors, or signs of atrophy, which can sometimes contribute to memory loss and cognitive changes. It’s important to rule out any serious causes. The scan will help us get a clearer picture and determine the best course of action. The blood work will check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other underlying medical conditions that can affect memory and cognitive function. I want to emphasize that these tests don't necessarily mean there's something seriously wrong. They're simply a precaution to help us understand what's going on and develop the best plan for you. I'm going to order both the blood work and the brain scan. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist – a specialist in brain disorders – who can help us interpret the results and develop a treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, alright. If that's what you recommend, Doctor, I trust your judgment. It sounds… a lot. But I suppose it's better to know. The blood work, okay. And the brain scan… even though it sounds scary. Will my wife be able to come with me to the appointments? She gets worried when I’m alone. And can you explain everything to both of us? I sometimes forget things, you know. It would be helpful if she could be there to help me remember. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep her in suspense for too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. Your wife is more than welcome to come to all the appointments. In fact, I encourage it. It's always helpful to have a second pair of ears, and I'm happy to explain everything to both of you in detail. I’ll make sure to speak slowly and clearly, and I’ll provide written information as well. As for the results, the blood work usually takes a few days to come back. The brain scan may take a little longer, perhaps a week or so, depending on the availability of the radiologist. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Lee, a wonderful neurologist in the area. Here's the referral form, and this is her contact information. I'll also have my nurse schedule you for the blood work before you leave today. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Um… no, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. Just… try not to scare my wife, okay? She worries enough as it is. And… thank you again for listening. It’s good to finally know what might be going on. I just hope it's nothing too serious. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ronnald. I'll do my best to keep things calm and explain everything in a way that's easy to understand. And remember, we’re taking things one step at a time. Let’s get those tests done, and then we’ll go from there. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your blood work. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ronnald. Take care.
