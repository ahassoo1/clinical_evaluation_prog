DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I'm Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it's… this waterworks thing. Been going on a spell now, I reckon. Just… gotta go all the time. It's a nuisance, more than anything. Don't feel sick, just… frequent. Can’t quite put my finger on why it’s happening, to be honest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, “waterworks thing,” frequent urination… and you said it's been going on for a while. Can you tell me roughly how long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while… hmm. It’s hard to say exactly. Months, I suppose. Maybe six? Seven? Time kinda… blurs when you’re my age, you know. It’s not sudden, didn’t just start happening yesterday. It just… gradually got worse, I guess. Not a terribly big deal, mind you. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand. Gradual onset over six or seven months. And is it mostly during the day, or are you getting up a lot at night to go?
PATIENT: Mostly during the day, thankfully. I don't like getting up in the middle of the night. My wife wouldn't appreciate it much either. But yes, I do get up some nights. Not every night, mind you. Just… when it hits. Usually only once, maybe twice. It's not like I'm running to the bathroom every hour, you understand. Just… enough to be annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some nighttime urination, not every night, usually once or twice. And when you go, do you feel like you empty your bladder completely, or do you feel like you still have to go a little bit afterward?
PATIENT: Hm. That's a good question. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to it. I go, and… well, it's gone, isn't it? I can't say I've noticed any… lingering. Not usually, anyway. Sometimes maybe a little dribble, but that’s just… old age, I suppose. It happens. Don't think much of it. It’s just water, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant feeling of incomplete emptying, though occasionally a little dribbling. Do you notice any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Burning? No, nothing like that. It doesn't hurt. That’s good, isn't it? I mean, if it hurt I'd be worried, wouldn’t I? It's just… frequent. And a bit of a bother. Honestly, Doctor, I don't think there's much to it. Probably just need to drink less water, eh? Though my wife always says I need to drink more. Women, you know? Always fussing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or burning. And you’ve mentioned drinking habits. Do you drink a lot of caffeine or alcohol?
PATIENT: Caffeine… well, I have my coffee in the morning. Always have. A couple of cups. Not enough to get me bouncing off the walls, you know. And alcohol… maybe a beer with supper now and then. Nothing fancy. I'm not a drinker, never have been. Used to back in the old country, maybe, but that was a lifetime ago. Don't hold with it much these days. Gives me heartburn, mostly. It’s not like I’m out carousing every night, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of cups of coffee and occasional beer. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, anything unusual like blood?
PATIENT: Blood? Goodness, no! Haven't seen any blood. It looks… well, it looks like pee, doesn’t it? Yellow, usually. Sometimes a bit darker if I don’t drink enough. Smell… can't say I’ve noticed anything unusual. I mean, it smells like urine, what do you expect? I don’t go sniffing it, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not that observant about these things. Just glad it is coming out, if you understand. Keeps things… regular.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Okay, so no blood, color and odor seem normal. Now, just a few more questions. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or urinary tract infection?
PATIENT: Illnesses… hmm. Had a bit of a sniffle last winter, I think. Nothing major. Just a common cold. Didn’t keep me down. My wife made me chicken soup. That usually fixes everything. A urinary… what did you call it? Tract infection? No, I don't think so. Never been told I've had one. Don't even know what that is, to be honest. Feels like I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Old age aches and pains, of course, but that’s just part of life, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illnesses or history of urinary tract infection. Do you have any difficulties with constipation?
PATIENT: Constipation? Well… sometimes. You know how it is when you get older. Things don't move quite as smoothly as they used to. My wife gives me prunes. They help some. But no, it's not terrible. Not a big problem, really. Just… part of getting old. Everything slows down, doesn't it? I’m not spending all day in the bathroom, if that’s what you’re worried about. It’s just… not always easy, let’s say that.
DOCTOR: Okay. I think I have a pretty good picture now. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. We’ll just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll do a brief neurological exam. It's just routine, to rule out anything serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A quick exam… I suppose that’s sensible. Don’t go poking around too much, eh? Just a quick listen, you say? I’m not a young man anymore, you know. Bones aren't what they used to be. Lie down… yes, yes. Lead the way. Though I warn you, I’m a bit of a skinny one. Don't expect to find much to listen to!
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this. It'll be cold, but quick. Just breathe normally. Okay… normal bowel sounds. Nothing unusual there. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… can you cross your legs for me?
PATIENT: Cross my legs… hmm. Getting a bit creaky these days, you know. There. Like that? It's not as easy as it used to be. Never was a very flexible man, to be honest. Used to working the land, not… bending and stretching. Everything’s a bit stiff. Is that alright? Should I uncross them? Don’t want to pull anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished, which is normal for your age. Nothing concerning there. And lastly, just a quick check of sensation. Can you tell me when I touch your feet?
PATIENT: Touch my feet, eh? Alright, alright. Go ahead. Don’t poke too hard! I feel it… yes, I feel it. Right there. And there. Bit numb sometimes, to be honest, especially in the cold. But I feel it when you touch it. Is that what you wanted to know? Don’t expect a miracle, Doctor. Everything slows down when you get old. Nerves aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is a little diminished, but intact. Alright, that’s everything. You can sit back up. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That's an enlarged prostate, which is very common as men age. It can cause frequent urination, especially at night, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. It's not cancer, and it's not usually serious, but it can be bothersome. Does that sound… reasonable?
PATIENT: Enlarged… what did you call it? Prostate? Never heard of it. Sounds… complicated. Not serious, you say? That's good, that's good. Bother… yes, bothersome is a good word. It is a nuisance. So it's just… old age, then? Everything wearing out? I figured as much. It’s not like I’ve been doing anything to cause it, have I? What does one do about it, then? Do I need some kind of… potion? Or pills? Or something? Just tell me what I need to do to get rid of this blasted waterworks thing.
DOCTOR: It's not something you've done to cause it, no. It's just a natural part of aging. There are several options for managing BPH. We can start with lifestyle changes – limiting fluids before bed, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and regular bladder training. There are also medications that can help shrink the prostate or relax the muscles in the bladder. We can discuss those options and see what would be best for you. I also recommend a PSA test and a urine analysis to rule out any other potential issues. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… limiting fluids? Now see, that doesn't sound too appealing, Doctor. My wife already tells me I don't drink enough. And avoiding coffee? That’s just… out of the question. I need my coffee in the morning. Pills… well, I don't much like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Tests… a PSA test? Urine analysis? What exactly are those? Are they… painful? Honestly, I just want to get rid of this waterworks thing. Are those tests absolutely necessary? Can't we just try… something else? Maybe a different doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation. The PSA test is a simple blood test that checks for a protein produced by the prostate. It helps us rule out any possibility of prostate cancer, which is important to do even though it’s unlikely. The urine analysis is also simple – just a sample of your urine. It checks for infection or other problems. Neither test is painful. They’re important baseline tests to have before starting any medication, just to be sure we’re making the right decision for you. We don’t have to start medication right away. We can try lifestyle changes first, but I strongly recommend the tests. I assure you, I wouldn’t recommend anything if I didn’t think it was in your best interest. I want to help you feel better, and these tests are a good first step. Would you be willing to at least consider them?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests. If you say they’re important. I don’t like it, mind you. Don't like needles, and don't like giving samples. But… I suppose I can grit my teeth and get it over with. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long. And be gentle, eh? I’m not a young man anymore. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go? And how long will it take? Just tell me the least painful way to get this all done. And… is there a charge for these tests? Medicare should cover it, shouldn't it? My wife handles all that paperwork…
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s excellent. I’m glad you’re willing to consider it. We’ll draw the blood right here in the clinic. The nurse, Sarah, is very good – she’s very gentle. It will only take a few minutes. And you’ll just need to provide a urine sample in a cup – we have private restroom facilities. Medicare should cover it, but it's always best to double-check with your wife. We have staff who can help with the paperwork if needed. I’ll have Sarah come in and get you set up. It will be quick, and then we can discuss lifestyle changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Quick… yes, quick is good. And a gentle nurse… that's important. I don't fancy a rough poke. And you'll help with the paperwork, you said? Good. My wife will appreciate that. Very well. Let’s get this over with, then. Bring on the nurse. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get home and have a nice cup of coffee. Just… tell her to be quick about it, eh? Don't want to spend all day here. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll let Sarah know to be quick and gentle. I'll be right back with the paperwork as well. .
