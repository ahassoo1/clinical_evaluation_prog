DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…ear trouble, really. Feels blocked, you know? Full. It's been…a while now. Honestly, I can’t quite put my finger on when it started, exactly. Everything feels a bit hazy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “ear trouble” – blocked and full, you said. And it’s been going on for a while, though the exact timing is a little unclear. That’s perfectly alright, we can try to narrow it down. First, is it just one ear that feels blocked, or both?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I believe…yes, it’s the right one, definitely the right one. The left feels fine, thank you. Though, I wouldn’t swear on it, mind you. It might be a little…off. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily the right ear, with a possible slight feeling in the left. Do you have any pain with it?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Not pain, exactly. It's more…a pressure, maybe? Like when you go up too high in an airplane. But it’s not sharp pain, you know? Just…uncomfortable. It makes it hard to hear things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure rather than sharp pain, and it’s affecting your hearing. Can you tell me a bit more about the hearing difficulty?
PATIENT: Well…people mumble a lot, I think. Or maybe I just can’t hear them very well. My wife used to say I never listened anyway. But she’s…gone now. It's hard to say if that’s the problem, or my ear. It's muffled, I suppose. Sounds are just…distant.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to take your time, and it sounds like you've been going through a lot. It’s understandable that it's hard to separate what might be the ear and what might be other things. Muffled sounds in the right ear, specifically. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: Ringing…hmm. Now that you mention it…yes. Sometimes. A sort of…high-pitched whine. It comes and goes, I don’t pay it much attention, to be honest. And dizziness? No, not really. A bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but I put that down to…well, age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent high-pitched ringing in the right ear, and some unsteadiness you attribute to age. Have you noticed any discharge from the ear – anything at all, even a little bit of fluid?
PATIENT: Discharge? No, nothing like that. Clean as a whistle, I assure you. I always kept myself tidy, even…well. No discharge. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no discharge. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or a sinus infection?
PATIENT: Illnesses… Oh, goodness. It was…last winter, I think. A nasty cough. A bad one. Had to stay in bed for a week. That was…probably December. Or maybe January. It was cold, anyway. A proper winter. I don't remember much else about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bad cough last winter, December or January. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before – infections, tubes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I was always a healthy lad. Played a lot of football when I was younger. Never had much trouble with my ears, thankfully. No tubes, no infections, nothing. Just…this. Whatever this is.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous ear problems. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Just the pills the doctor gave me for my…blood pressure. And a little something for my joints. The arthritis, you see. But that's it. Nothing special. I think. Let me see… Yes, that’s all, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…hmm. Not that I know of. Never had much trouble with allergies. Maybe a bit of hay fever when I was a boy, but nothing serious. No, no allergies to speak of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, go ahead. Get it over with, eh? The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. This won’t take long, and it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. I'm just going to gently look inside your ears. Okay, I’ve taken a look. Your ear canals look relatively clear. I do notice a little bit of wax build-up in both ears. But more importantly, the eardrum on the right side is a bit…dull looking, and slightly retracted. It doesn't look acutely inflamed, but it’s not quite normal. The left ear looks much better. I also noticed you mentioned feeling unsteady at times. I'm going to do a quick balance check, just to see if I can get a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Balance check? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not very good at standing on one leg, I’ll warn you. Never was. Go ahead then. Get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. As I suspected, you do have a little bit of difficulty with balance, particularly when your eyes are closed. That could be related to your ear issue, or it could be something else entirely. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam I've done, it sounds like you may have some fluid build-up in your middle ear – possibly from a previous cold or congestion. It’s also possible you have some mild Eustachian tube dysfunction, which can cause a feeling of fullness and pressure. The slight retraction of your eardrum and difficulty with balance suggest we should investigate a little further. I’m going to order a tympanometry test, which will measure how well your eardrum moves, and an audiometry test, which will assess your hearing sensitivity. This will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I'd rather not, honestly. But…if it'll get to the bottom of it. Yes, alright. Tympa-what-you-call-it and audio-thingy. Fine. Just…please be quick about it. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Guerrerolopez, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and efficient as possible. The tests are relatively painless and shouldn’t take long at all. Our audiology department is just down the hall. I'll write you a referral now. They'll schedule a time that works for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you avoid getting water in your right ear, and you can try over-the-counter decongestants if you’re feeling congested. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Decongestants…right. No, I don’t think so. Just…get it over with, eh? I just want to be able to hear properly again. It's…lonely when you can’t hear. No, thank you, Doctor. That’ll be all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I’ll write you that referral now. We’ll do everything we can to get you hearing better. Here’s the referral. Please call them to schedule your appointment. And don’t hesitate to call us if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe pain, fever, or dizziness. It was nice meeting you, despite the circumstances. Take care.
