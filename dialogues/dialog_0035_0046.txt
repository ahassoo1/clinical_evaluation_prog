DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Alzoubi. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, pressure in my bladder, and it’s been concerning me. It’s been happening for about a week now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure for about a week. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not exactly painful, but it’s… a consistent feeling of needing to go, even when I’ve just gone. It’s a bit uncomfortable, and it’s starting to disrupt my sleep a little, having to get up. It feels like there’s just… something there, you know? I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, yes. A constant urge, even after emptying your bladder, and disrupting your sleep. Okay. Have you noticed any pain with urination, or any burning sensation?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not any burning or pain during urination. It’s purely the feeling of pressure and the frequent need to go. I haven’t noticed any blood either, if that’s something you were going to ask. I try to be aware of things like that, you know, just in case.
DOCTOR: Good. No pain, no burning, no blood – that's helpful. Have you been having any fever, chills, or lower back pain at all?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my back has been fine, thankfully. No lower back pain at all. I’ve been feeling a little tired, generally, but I thought that was just from work. I’m a graphic designer, and deadlines have been a bit stressful lately. Is that relevant, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no chills, no back pain. The tiredness could be related to stress, yes, but we'll keep everything in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No, not really. The color seems normal, as far as I can tell. It hasn’t been cloudy or anything like that. And the amount… well, I’m going more frequently, but the amount each time seems pretty standard. Not particularly large or small volumes, just… more often.
DOCTOR: Alright, standard color, normal volume, just increased frequency. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have any major conditions, thankfully. I do have a mild seasonal allergy to pollen, but that’s managed with over-the-counter medication. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful information? And my husband and I both keep fairly active lifestyles, which I think helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild pollen allergy managed with OTC meds, otherwise healthy, and active lifestyle – good to know. And you have Medicare. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Nothing like that. I’ve always been lucky enough to avoid needing them. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was very routine, and it was years ago. Does that count? Otherwise, no. Nothing significant, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, wisdom teeth removal is good to know, but doesn’t sound like it's related to this. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any known allergies to medications. I've taken a variety of things over the years – antibiotics, pain relievers, allergy medicine – and never had a reaction. I double-check with the pharmacist every time, just to be safe, but so far, nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medication allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones regularly?
PATIENT: Just the allergy medicine during pollen season, like I mentioned. It’s a daily antihistamine, but it’s very standard, and I buy it over the counter. Otherwise, no. No regular prescriptions or anything like that. I try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Does anyone in your family have a history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Let me think… My grandmother, on my mother's side, had some urinary tract infections when she was older, I believe. She was in and out of the hospital a few times for them. And my uncle, on my father’s side, he had kidney stones, but that was many years ago. Other than that, I don’t recall anyone specifically having bladder problems. It’s possible, of course, but I don't have any clear information about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. UTI’s in your grandmother and kidney stones in your uncle. Let's talk about your social history briefly. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband smokes occasionally, socially, but I don’t. I try to encourage him to quit, but it’s a difficult habit to break. Does that matter? I'm exposed to it sometimes, but I don't smoke myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how much fluid do you typically drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, I drink quite a bit of water, actually. I try to stay well-hydrated. Probably at least eight glasses, maybe more, depending on the day. I carry a water bottle with me everywhere, and I sip on it constantly. I also drink coffee in the morning, maybe two cups, but mostly water throughout the day. I know it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, good hydration – at least eight glasses of water daily. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I understand. Please proceed when you're ready. I'll do whatever I can to help. I just want to figure out what’s causing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't cause any discomfort at all. I can barely feel it. Just let me know if you hear anything, Dr. Alzoubi. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen, feeling for any tenderness or masses. Again, just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m a little sensitive right here, towards my lower abdomen. Not pain, exactly, but… a bit of pressure when you press. It's the same area where I’ve been feeling the bladder pressure. Everything else feels fine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lower abdomen feels tender to palpation. That’s helpful information. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes. This involves a gentle tap to your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I’ve had those tests before. Please go ahead, Dr. Alzoubi. I’ll just try to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are normal bilaterally. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a few things. It sounds like it’s not an acute infection. It could be overactive bladder, interstitial cystitis, or even muscular tension contributing to the discomfort. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to rule out any hidden infection, and a bladder diary for a few days to track your fluid intake and urination frequency. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. A urine analysis and a culture, and a bladder diary – I can definitely do that. I'm happy to track everything carefully. Just let me know where to go to provide the sample, and how to access the diary form. Is there anything specific I need to be aware of when tracking the fluid intake, like measuring exact amounts?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll have the nurse give you the instructions for the urine sample – it's important to be a "clean catch" sample, so they'll walk you through it. For the bladder diary, just estimate the amounts – roughly, in ounces or milliliters, is fine. And track everything you drink – water, coffee, juice, anything. And, of course, the time you urinate and how you felt beforehand. I’ll also order a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. I will have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Clean catch sample, track all fluids, bladder diary with urination times and feelings, basic metabolic panel, and a follow-up appointment in one week. And to contact the office if I develop a fever, chills, or severe pain. I’ve got it all written down. Thank you, Dr. Alzoubi. I feel much better knowing we're taking these steps.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. I'm glad I could help. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I really appreciate your patience and clear explanations. I’m looking forward to getting the results and figuring out what's going on. Thank you again, Dr. Alzoubi. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if anything changes or you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Marialena.
