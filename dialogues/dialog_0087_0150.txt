DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s a bit ridiculous I even have to be here. But my… friend suggested it. I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be… easy. No problems. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’d like to avoid all the… fuss, if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's very reasonable to want a smooth process when planning a pregnancy, and proactive evaluation is a good step. To get a better understanding of how we can help make that happen, let’s go through some details. First, have you been trying to conceive for a certain length of time?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not actively. I mean, things haven’t… aligned. But I don’t want to wait until it’s a problem. That’s the point, isn’t it? I’m not looking for trouble. I’m 51. I need to know if there’s something… wrong. Is that clear enough? I don’t do… waiting games.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly clear, Ms. Shteynberg. You’d like a preemptive assessment to identify any potential barriers to conception given your age. We can absolutely do that. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? It's... extensive. Mostly just the usual things, I suppose. I had chickenpox as a child. Broken arm when I was ten, skiing in the Alps. Divorced. Does that count? Seriously, I’ve been generally healthy. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. I have Medicare, so I’m sure you can see some of it. I don’t remember the specifics of everything. Is there anything specific you need to know? Don’t waste my time with things I’ve already told you.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll focus on the most relevant information then. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I eat reasonably well. I used to cycle competitively, you know. Very good for the heart. High blood pressure? Never. Diabetes? Preposterous. Thyroid? I... I might have had something checked, years ago, after my divorce. Everything was… fine. Honestly, I can't recall the details. My ex-husband always handled the doctor’s appointments. And I'm trying very hard not to think about him right now. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Shteynberg. Let’s move on then. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen, for my knees. They bother me after I cycle. That's it. I don't believe in filling my body with… chemicals unless absolutely necessary. Honestly, I try to maintain a very natural lifestyle. Is that sufficient? I don't need a long list of things to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I used to travel extensively, and I’ve had to try all sorts of things. I’m not a picky eater. No allergies. Definitely not. I pride myself on my… robust constitution. Is there anything else? I'm starting to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – mother, sisters, aunts, grandmothers – has experienced any difficulty with getting pregnant or has had any issues related to menopause?
PATIENT: Oh, family. That’s… complicated. My mother? She had three children without any trouble. My sister… she’s never married. And my aunts? I barely knew them. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to those sorts of things. People have babies. People don’t have babies. It’s… natural selection, I suppose. Is this really necessary? Are you going to ask about my great-grandmother next? I didn't even meet my great-grandmother.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll move on. Now, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like someone who would partake in such… debauchery? I cycle! I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I drink a small glass of red wine occasionally, with dinner. A very small glass. And I certainly don't smoke or… whatever else you were implying. Honestly, the question is rather insulting. I’m a respectable woman. Next question.
DOCTOR: Alright. We have no smoking, no recreational drug use, and occasional small glass of red wine. Finally, before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any specific concerns beyond wanting to proactively assess your fertility?
PATIENT: Well… my periods have been… irregular. Not stopped exactly. Just… less predictable. And I’ve been feeling… tired. More tired than usual. But honestly, at my age, one expects a bit of wear and tear. It’s probably just that. But it is a little worrying, I suppose. And I don't want to waste time. I want a straightforward answer. Can you tell me if there’s something… seriously wrong? That’s really all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteynberg. Irregular periods and increased fatigue. Those are important things to address. Let's proceed with a physical exam, and I’ll also order some bloodwork to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
