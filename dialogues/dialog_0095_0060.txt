DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, good morning. It’s… it’s kind of a long story, I guess. It’s just… my family. There's a lot of heart trouble on both sides. My mother’s side, and then my dad… it’s just always something. I’m probably being silly, but I’d like to just… know things are okay, you know? Get some reassurance, I suppose. Before something actually happens.
DOCTOR: I see. Family history is important, and it's not silly to be proactive about your health, especially with that background. It’s good you're thinking about this now. Let's start with some details. You mentioned a lot of heart trouble on both sides. Can you tell me a bit more specifically about what kind of heart problems your mother and father experienced?
PATIENT: Okay. Um… my mother, she had… well, it was angina, I think. She had chest pain, mostly when she was doing things, like gardening or walking. She ended up needing a stent, I remember that much. And then my dad… he had a stroke, a few years back. It was pretty bad, he needed a lot of rehab. And his brother… he died young, heart attack, I think. Early fifties. It’s… depressing, honestly. I’m not trying to be dramatic, but it feels like a ticking time bomb.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's… a significant family history, certainly. Angina, a stroke, and a heart attack at a relatively young age. Do you experience any chest pain yourself, Mr. Theriot?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. Not yet, anyway. That’s why I'm here, right? To prevent something like that from happening. I’m pretty active, I try to eat healthy, but you never know. It could be genetic, I guess. I just worry. A lot. It's stupid, probably. But it's always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: It’s not stupid at all to be concerned given your family history. It's responsible. Alright. Let’s do a quick examination and then we can talk about some testing options to get a better understanding of your risk. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to be sure. Honestly, the thought of ending up like my dad… it terrifies me. So, yeah, testing sounds great. Let’s get it done. The sooner the better, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. After that, we can briefly review your overall health—any medications you’re taking, allergies, things like that—and then discuss what tests might be most helpful. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. A little bit of seasonal allergies, pollen stuff, but that's it. No medication, either. I try to avoid it if I can. I'm pretty healthy, as I said. Just… worried. And I guess a little stressed, thinking about all this. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: It absolutely counts as a symptom, Mr. Theriot. Stress can definitely impact your heart health. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs that I can detect right now. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 122 over 78, pulse is 72. Now, just a few quick questions about your lifestyle… do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never touched it. My mother smoked for years, and seeing what it did to her… no thank you. I try to encourage everyone I know not to smoke. It’s disgusting and dangerous. Plus, my wife… well, ex-wife… she hated it too. So, definitely no. A good, strong no.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Socially, yes. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer if I'm out with friends. Nothing excessive, though. I don't really like the feeling of being drunk, honestly. I'm not much of a party person. Maybe once or twice a month, tops. It's certainly not a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And finally, tell me a little about your typical diet and exercise routine. What does a normal week look like for you in terms of activity and what sort of foods do you usually eat?
PATIENT: Right. Well, I teach, so I'm on my feet a lot during the day, which I suppose counts for something. But I also try to go for a run three times a week, usually about three or four miles. And I try to cook healthy meals most nights – lots of vegetables, lean protein, that sort of thing. My ex-wife was the gourmet cook, so I've had to learn to manage. It's not bad, I just… miss having someone else take care of it sometimes. We did a lot of grilling in the summer, and salads. I try to avoid processed foods as much as possible, and sugary drinks.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a pretty healthy lifestyle overall, Mr. Theriot. Alright. Given your family history and your understandable anxiety, I think it's reasonable to do a few tests. I’d recommend an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, and a basic metabolic panel to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. We can also order a high-sensitivity troponin test, which is a very sensitive blood test that can detect even small amounts of heart damage. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that all sounds… thorough. Good. I appreciate that. Yes, let's do it all. The more information, the better, right? I'd rather know what's going on, even if it's not good news. A high-sensitivity… troponin? Is that expensive? I'm on Medicare, so… I don't want to get a huge bill.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover it, Mr. Theriot, but we can double-check with billing to be certain before we proceed. It's a standard test, and given your family history, it's certainly justified. Okay, I’m ordering those tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get you scheduled for an EKG. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results—usually a couple of days—we can review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, continue with your healthy lifestyle—that’s the best thing you can do. Do you have any questions for me right now before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything, really. I mean, I'm still anxious, obviously, but I feel… better knowing we're doing something. Just getting it checked is a relief. Thank you, Dr. Vanochten.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome, Mr. Theriot. That’s what I’m here for. The nurse will be with you shortly. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions.
