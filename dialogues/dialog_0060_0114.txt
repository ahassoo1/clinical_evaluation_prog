DOCTOR: Right. Maribeth Vanderwiele. Seventy-one years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… No, excuse me, Doctor Nooruddin. It’s my breathing. It’s been… troublesome. When I lie flat, it gets harder to breathe. Like something’s pressing on my chest. It’s not good, you see. I don’t like it at all.
DOCTOR: Troublesome, you say. And it's worse when you lie flat. Hmm. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe three, four months ago? It wasn’t so bad at first, just a little… uncomfortable. But it’s gotten worse steadily, you see. Now, it really bothers me when I try to sleep. I have to prop myself up with pillows. Several pillows. It’s not a comfortable arrangement, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Several pillows. Right. And aside from the difficulty breathing when lying down, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… my ankles do seem a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but… noticeable. And I tire easily, even with just a little walking. I used to be able to walk for miles, you see, but these days… not so much. It just comes over me. A weariness.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles and fatigue. Okay. Do you have any pain in your chest at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not exactly. It’s… a pressure, like I said. A heaviness. Not a sharp pain, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. It’s a very unsettling feeling, though. I don't care for it, not one bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your history here… You're insured with Medicare, good. And you're… seventy-one years old. Are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And I’ve been taking it for… oh, a long time now. Five, maybe six years? The doctor before Doctor Bethanie… prescribed it.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not a rash, not a swelling, nothing. I’m quite… ordinary in that regard, I suppose. No allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we need to listen to your lungs and check for some fluid. Let’s get you up on the exam table, and I'll take a listen. It's likely nothing serious, but we need to rule things out. Could you lie back for me, please?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think it's best. Just… try to be quick, if you wouldn't mind. I don't care for being laid flat for long, you see. It makes the breathing… more difficult. But, I’ll do as you say.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… deep breath… good. Okay. And again. I hear some… congestion in your lungs. Not terribly concerning at this point, but something we need to investigate further. Your ankles are definitely swollen, and your blood pressure is slightly elevated. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG, just to be safe.
PATIENT: An X-ray and an EKG… very well, Doctor. If that's what you think is necessary. I just… I'd like to know what this is. I don’t like feeling like this, you see. Just a congestion, you say? Is it… serious? Is it my heart? Please, Doctor, just tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Mrs. Vanderwiele. The X-ray and EKG will give us a clearer picture. Congestion could be many things – a simple infection, perhaps, or something more. We need to rule out heart failure, which can cause fluid buildup in the lungs and ankles. I’m going to order a BNP test as well, that will help to evaluate for that. The nurse will get you set up for these tests. Don't worry unduly. We’re being thorough.
PATIENT: Heart failure… Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. A BNP test… I don't know what any of this means, Doctor. Is it painful? Will I be here all day? I have a luncheon with my sister, you see. She’s coming all the way from Albuquerque.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Vanderwiele, please. You’re getting ahead of yourself. We haven’t even done the tests yet. The BNP is a simple blood draw, hardly painful. As for your luncheon… the tests shouldn’t take long, but I can’t guarantee how quickly the results will be back. The nurse will explain everything. Honestly, you're making me nervous with all this worrying before we even know what's going on. Let's just focus on getting the tests done, alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I apologize, Doctor. It’s just… I don’t like being unwell. And I don’t like not knowing. I’m a… a nervous person, you see. Alright. Tests. The nurse. I understand. Just… please let me know as soon as you know something. Even if it’s bad news. I’d rather know.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. I'll review the results as soon as they’re available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: .
