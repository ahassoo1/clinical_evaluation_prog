DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been bothering me. Lower back, mostly. It’s a dull ache, really. Been going on for a little while now, but it’s getting harder to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in the lower back that's been worsening. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it started maybe six months ago? Not too bad, just felt a little stiff after gardening. I like to keep my tomatoes going, you see. But now… now it hurts even just sitting for too long. Or bending over to put on my shoes. It's not a sharp pain, never been sharp. Just… there. Always there, kind of. And I feel… brittle, if that makes sense. Like I could break easily. I don’t know if that’s part of the back, or something else. My ex-wife always said I was too thin, maybe she was right!
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started gradually about six months ago with some stiffness after gardening, and it’s now a constant dull ache that’s interfering with sitting and bending. And you’re also feeling a bit… fragile, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, fragile is a good word. Like an old vase, you know? I don’t go to many doctors. Never really needed to, until now. I try to stay active, but it’s getting harder. I used to walk a lot, but I’m worried about falling, to be honest. It just feels… unsafe. And my bones feel weak. I don’t know anything about bones, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. The feeling of fragility is concerning, and we definitely want to investigate that, along with your back pain. To get a better picture of what's going on, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Not much, really. I had the flu a few times when I was a kid, like everyone. Broke my arm once, fell out of a tree trying to get a kite. That healed fine. I don't smoke, never have. Drink a little wine with dinner, maybe two glasses. No big illnesses, no surgeries. My divorce was the biggest thing, I guess! Does that count? I haven’t seen a doctor for a check-up in… oh, goodness, maybe ten years? More? I don’t remember exactly. And I don't take any medicine regularly. Just aspirin if I have a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical issues, no surgeries, you don't smoke, and you drink alcohol in moderation. No regular medications other than occasional aspirin. That’s helpful. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she lived to be 92. Good health, mostly. She did have some trouble with her hips when she got older, needed a cane towards the end. My father, he died when he was 75, heart trouble. My sister, she's still living, lives in California. She's healthy as a horse, always been active. No one else in the family that I know of had trouble with their back. Or bones, not that I remember. They didn’t talk much about health, really. Mostly talked about politics and tomatoes, actually. Both sides of the family were Lebanese, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Lebanese heritage, mother with hip problems later in life, father with heart trouble, and a healthy sister. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your daily life?
PATIENT: Daily life… well, I live alone now, in a small house. I keep busy. I like to garden, as I said, mostly tomatoes and peppers. I read a lot, mostly history books. I try to walk, but not as much lately. I cook for myself, simple meals. I visit my sister a couple of times a year, she lives in California. I used to volunteer at the library, but I stopped when my back started to bother me. It was hard to lift the books. I don’t have any pets. Just me and the tomatoes. It's quiet. A little too quiet sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone, enjoy gardening, reading, and used to volunteer. The quiet life, with some social interaction with your sister. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms, anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been feeling more tired lately. Not just from the back, I think. Just… worn out. And… I think I’ve lost a little weight, even though I’m eating okay. Maybe a few pounds. It's hard to say for sure. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. That hasn't happened often, but it's happened a few times in the last month or so. Oh! And my teeth feel a little loose. I haven't told my dentist yet. It’s just a small thing, probably. But those are the things I've noticed. Does that make sense? I don't want to bother you with too much.
DOCTOR: No, you're not bothering me at all, Mr. Vankampen. It’s important to tell me everything you're experiencing. Fatigue, unintentional weight loss, dizziness when standing, and loose teeth – those are all things we need to investigate. Okay. Now, I'm going to do a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your back. I'll also feel your abdomen and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. It’s a little scary, thinking about what it could be, but I’m glad I came in. Just… be gentle with my back, please? It’s a bit sensitive. And… what are vital signs? I don’t think I know what those are.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible with your back. And no worries about the vital signs – they're just basic measurements like your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. They give us a general overview of your body’s functions. Okay, take a nice deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now I’m going to check your pulse… …and your blood pressure… ...and your temperature. Now, could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. It's a little hard getting down, Doctor. But I’m here. Go ahead. I'll try to stay still. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. It's a bit cold, isn’t it? But I don't want to complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to gently press on your back here… and here… Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there… That’s where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like you said. And… it feels a little warm there too, I think. It’s hard to say for sure. It just… doesn’t feel right. Is that bad? I’m probably making a fuss over nothing. I just don’t like being touched there. It’s sensitive.
DOCTOR: No, you're not making a fuss at all, Mr. Vankampen. It’s important for me to know what you’re feeling. Tenderness and warmth in that area is significant. Okay, now I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward… and backward… and to the sides… Just go as far as you comfortably can. I'm also going to check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. I can’t bend very far. It feels tight. And… I’m afraid of falling. Ooh! That’s a little startling. My legs jerked, I think? I don’t know much about reflexes. It just… made me jump. Is that normal? I’m probably just being a nervous old man. I always worry too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, your range of motion is limited, and you experienced some discomfort during the bending exercises. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. Based on the physical exam and what you’ve told me, there are a few things I'm concerned about. The lower back pain, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, dizziness, and loose teeth are all things we need to investigate further. I’m going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a Vitamin D level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. I’m also going to order a urinalysis. And finally, I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any fractures or other structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot of tests. Fractures? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? And what about the loose teeth? Could that be connected to the back pain? I’m just a little worried now. Vitamin D… I don't think I get enough sun. I mostly stay indoors. And what does the thyroid thing do? I don’t even know what those things are. I’m probably just making a fuss over nothing, aren’t I? But I appreciate you looking into it. It's just… a lot to take in. What’s the next step? Will I need to come back soon?
DOCTOR: It is a lot of tests, and I understand your anxiety, Mr. Vankampen. We're ordering them to get a comprehensive picture of what's going on and rule out any serious underlying conditions. A fracture would be concerning, but it's just one possibility we need to consider. The loose teeth could be connected to several things, including nutritional deficiencies or underlying bone conditions, so it's important to investigate further. The vitamin D level will help us determine if a deficiency is contributing to your symptoms. And the thyroid test is to check if your thyroid gland is functioning properly – the thyroid regulates your metabolism and can affect your energy levels, weight, and bone health. We'll get the blood tests done today, and the X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medications. Just… I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They always make me feel… funny. But I’ll take them if I have to. Okay, blood tests and X-ray. Tomorrow morning. Good. Can I still garden while I wait for the results? I don't want to stop doing things, if I can help it. It's all I have, really. And… will the tests be expensive? I don’t have much money saved up. I lost a lot in the divorce. I'm probably worrying about the wrong things. But it's hard not to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the allergies. Regarding the gardening, I wouldn't advise any heavy lifting or strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. Light gardening, like weeding, might be okay, but listen to your body and stop if you experience any pain. I understand your concern about the cost. I'll have the billing department look into potential financial assistance programs or discounts for uninsured patients. We can also discuss prioritizing the tests if cost is a major concern. Alright, let’s get the lab orders sent over. And I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you some instructions for the blood tests and X-ray. She can also answer any questions you have about scheduling and billing. Do you have any questions for me right now before I call her in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And I appreciate you looking into the cost. It’s a weight off my mind. Tell Sarah to take her time. I’m not in a rush. I’ve been waiting a long time for someone to listen. And… it’s nice to know someone cares. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. It's my job to listen and help you get to the bottom of this. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Sarah will be in shortly with the instructions. And remember, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. .
