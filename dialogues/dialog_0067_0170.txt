DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for a life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know, for the policy. Want to get it over with quick if we can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. A life insurance physical, alright. We can definitely work through this efficiently. Just to be thorough, I still want to get a good understanding of your overall health. To start, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Work's been busy at the hotel. Nothing major, really. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And you said you work at a hotel?
PATIENT: Yeah, I manage things. Lodging manager. It's... a job. Lots of people coming and going, you know? Keeps you on your feet. It's mostly paperwork these days though, thankfully. Not as much running around as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long have you been working as a lodging manager?
PATIENT: About fifteen years now, I think. Maybe a little longer. Time flies when you're... dealing with complaints, mostly. Before that, I was doing some construction work, but my back wasn’t so happy about that. That’s why I got into the office stuff. Easier on the body, for sure.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you found something more comfortable. And you mentioned your back – do you still experience any issues with it now?
PATIENT: It flares up sometimes. Not like it used to, thankfully. Mostly just a little stiff in the mornings. I take some over-the-counter stuff for it when it bothers me. Ibuprofen, mostly. It usually does the trick. Don't want to bother a doctor with an old back thing if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you've found something that helps. Just to get a complete picture, are you taking any other medications regularly?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the ibuprofen when I need it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. Doctor told me years ago to watch my blood pressure, but it's usually okay. I try to eat alright. Mostly. Hotel food's not the best, but I bring my own lunch most days.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're proactive about your health. And you mentioned your doctor previously advising you to watch your blood pressure. Do you recall when that was, and if they gave you any specific numbers to be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm... must have been... ten years ago, maybe? Before the divorce. He just said to keep an eye on it, you know? Didn’t give me any specific numbers. I think it was okay last time I checked it at a pharmacy, but that was a while back too. Honestly, I don't remember the numbers. It’s all a bit of a blur. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Putney. It’s alright. We can check it today to get an updated reading. Before we do that, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, but I haven't had that in years so I don’t even know anymore. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. Just get tired easy, that's my biggest problem.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And you mentioned getting tired easily. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's just... I wake up feeling okay, but by the afternoon I'm dragging. It's not like I'm sick or anything, just... worn out. I get enough sleep, usually six or seven hours, but it doesn’t feel like enough. Especially with the work stress. Paperwork, people complaining... It adds up, you know? I don’t bounce back like I used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating. And it's good you're recognizing the potential impact of stress. Now, let’s move on to some general health questions. Have you had any recent changes in your weight, either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been kinda steady for a while now. Maybe put on a few pounds during the pandemic, like everyone else, but I haven’t changed much since then. Around 215, I think. It's hard to say exactly, don't own a scale. Mostly I just hope my pants still fit. It’s usually a good indicator.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing like that. Just tired. Like I said, mostly just tired. No sickness, no aches, no nothing. Just… worn down. I’m not a young man anymore, you know? Things slow down. It's probably just age catching up with me. Not worth bothering you with it, to be honest. I just want to get this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: I understand your wanting to be efficient, Mr. Putney, and I appreciate you being upfront with me. But even if you think it's just age, it’s my job to rule out anything else that could be going on. Now, just a few more quick questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my dad had some heart trouble when he got older, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don't remember a lot of details. My mom, she was mostly healthy. Lived a long life. As far as cancer, I think my aunt on my wife's side had something… but that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't keep track of all that family stuff. We weren’t that close. It's all a bit of a blur. Sorry. Can we just get to the physical part now? I’ve got things I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We can move on to the physical exam. First, I'll check your vital signs - your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is 142/90, your pulse is 78, temperature is 98.6, and your respiration rate is 16. Your height is 5’8” and your weight is 215 pounds, which gives you a BMI of 32.8, placing you in the obese category.
PATIENT: Obese, huh? Well, I knew I'd put on a few pounds. Didn't realize it was that bad. Look, is this going to affect my insurance? That’s all I'm really worried about. I just need this policy to get sorted out. I’m trying to leave something for my kids, you know? Is this blood pressure going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It's good you're aware of your health, Mr. Putney. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your BMI indicates obesity. It’s not necessarily a showstopper for the insurance, but it might lead to a higher premium, or some additional testing. I can't give you a definitive answer on that, as the insurance company has their own criteria. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick examination of your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with. I've got a lot on my plate. I'm not a fan of doctors, to be honest. Always bad news, it feels like. But I'm here, so let’s just do it. Just… try to be quick, okay? I need to get back to work. And hopefully this insurance thing doesn't fall through. That's all that matters.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I can hear a slight murmur. It’s not immediately concerning, but we may want to get an EKG just to rule out anything significant. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness, and no masses. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes and your neurological function, just a basic assessment.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Neurological function? Look, is all this really necessary for a life insurance exam? I thought it was just a quick check-up, you know? Blood pressure, weight, maybe some blood work? This feels like a full physical. I’m not a complainer, but… I'm really trying to get this done as quickly as possible. I've got a business to run. Is there any way we can just skip to the blood work and be done with it? I just need the paperwork signed so I can move on with my life.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, Mr. Putney. I apologize if this feels more extensive than you anticipated. The scope of a life insurance exam can vary, and I was erring on the side of caution, given the elevated blood pressure and BMI, and your report of fatigue. I want to be thorough to ensure we have a complete picture of your health and accurately assess any potential risks. However, if you are truly uncomfortable with proceeding with the full examination, we can certainly focus on the blood work and complete the necessary paperwork for the insurance company. It's your choice, and I respect that. Keep in mind, though, that the insurance company may request additional information later if they feel it’s needed. Would you prefer to proceed with just the blood work at this time?
PATIENT: Yeah, let’s just do the blood work. That's all I want. I don't need a full physical. I'm not sick, I'm just tired. I need this over with, you know? Paperwork, blood work, and I'm outta here. Let’s just focus on getting the insurance sorted, okay? I appreciate you understanding. Just… please, let’s get it done quickly. I'm running on empty.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. We’ll focus on the blood work then. I’ll have the lab technician draw a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel to assess your overall health. That should give the insurance company the information they need. The lab is just down the hall. They'll give you instructions on fasting requirements, if any. Once the results are back, we can review them together, and I'll complete the necessary paperwork for your insurance application. Is there anything else I can do for you today, before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, that's it. Just the blood work. Thanks for understanding. I appreciate you not making me jump through a bunch of hoops. I've got a business to run, and I can't spend all day in a doctor's office. Hopefully, everything checks out alright, and I can finally get this insurance sorted. Where's the lab, exactly? Down the hall, you said? Just point me in the right direction, and I’ll be outta here.
DOCTOR: Yes, just down the hall, second door on the left. The lab technician, Sarah, is expecting you. She’ll take great care of you. Here’s Sarah’s name and the tests. Once you've completed the blood work, feel free to come back, and we can review the results. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Putney. I hope you have a good day, and I wish you all the best with getting your insurance sorted. .
