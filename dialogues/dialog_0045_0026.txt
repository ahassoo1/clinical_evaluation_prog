DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s just…this tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it’s awful. Just…completely drains me. I don't even have the energy to tend to my garden, and I love my garden. The doctor sent me here because of…something in my blood, I think? Something about my muscles? Honestly, I don't pay much attention to all that fuss.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Something in your blood…yes, I see here you had some lab work done recently. Okay. And this tiredness… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. Months, I suppose. It’s hard to say exactly. Things just…blur as you get older, you know? It wasn’t constant at first, just after I’d done a bit too much. But now…now it seems to come on even when I haven’t done anything strenuous. My husband, Tenzin, keeps telling me I need to rest more, but…well, he doesn’t understand. A body needs to be useful. Sitting around all day is no good for anyone.
DOCTOR: Useful, yes, I understand. But even useful things need maintenance, Mrs. Oitker. Alright, so it's been happening for months, even with rest. And is it just the tiredness, or are you noticing anything else?
PATIENT: Well…sometimes my muscles feel a bit…sore, I suppose. Not like I pulled something, just…ach-y. And a little weak. It's hard to explain. Like trying to lift a heavy bucket, but the bucket isn’t that heavy. It’s just…more effort than it should be. Though, to be fair, I’m not as young as I used to be. Everything takes more effort these days.
DOCTOR: Right, muscle soreness and weakness. And you said it’s been going on for months. Now, let’s try to pinpoint this a little more. Does this soreness and weakness feel all over, or is it more in certain areas?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly in my legs, I think. And my arms, a bit. It’s not…sharp pain, you understand. It's just…heavy. Like they’re filled with sand. And sometimes…sometimes they just feel…floppy. Like I could just…collapse. Though, I haven’t actually collapsed. Not yet, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Legs and arms, heaviness, and occasionally a feeling of floppiness. Have you noticed any difficulty with… everyday things?
PATIENT: Well, getting up from chairs isn’t as easy as it used to be. And climbing the stairs…that’s a bit of a chore now. I used to practically bound up them! Now…well, now I have to take them one step at a time, and even then, I have to use the railing. Tenzin keeps offering to help me with things, but I don't want him fussing over me. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with stairs and getting up from chairs. And you're hesitant to let your husband help. Now, Mrs. Oitker, I see here from the lab results there's an elevated creatine kinase level. That's an enzyme released from muscles. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate muscle damage or inflammation. Do you recall anything unusual happening before these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Creatine…what now? Inflammation? Oh, goodness. No, I don’t think so. Nothing unusual. I do a bit of gardening, of course. And I help Tenzin with some things around the house. Nothing strenuous! We had a bit of a…scuffle with a raccoon last spring, trying to get into the compost bin. But that was months ago! He was a nasty one, scratched at the screen door. Tenzin dealt with him.
DOCTOR: A raccoon, alright. And this was months ago. Okay, well, the elevated CK levels, combined with the tiredness, muscle soreness, weakness, and difficulty with stairs… it could indicate a condition called polymyositis. It’s an inflammatory muscle disease. It's not something we can diagnose definitively just yet, but it's something we need to investigate. I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Polymy-what-now? Sounds…serious. And a physical exam? Oh dear. I suppose so. But I warn you, I'm not as nimble as I used to be. Just be gentle, doctor. My knees aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, I don’t see what poking and prodding will accomplish. I told you, I’m just tired.
DOCTOR: Polymyositis can be serious, but we're not jumping to conclusions. Just gathering information. And you’re right to be cautious, we’ll take it slowly. Alright, let's just see how easily you can stand and walk a few steps. And I'm not "poking and prodding," I'm assessing your muscle strength and reflexes. Now, can you try to walk forward a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's…a bit wobbly. See? Just old age, doctor. No need to get all concerned about fancy diseases. Tenzin always says I need to watch my step. He worries about me falling. Honestly, I think I just need a good nap. And maybe a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. I see what you mean. There is some weakness, and a bit of difficulty with balance. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your arms and legs. It’s just a quick assessment, I promise. Reflexes are a little diminished in your knees…and some slight weakness in your biceps and triceps. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. All this poking and prodding is rather unsettling. There. Is that alright? I haven’t been doing much lifting lately, you see. It’s mostly Tenzin who does the heavy work around the house. He's a very strong man, you know. Always has been. I just…tend to the garden and keep things tidy. Honestly, I think all this fuss is unnecessary. I just need to rest. And maybe a little more sunshine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. Your grip strength is reduced as well. And I understand your reluctance, but these findings, combined with the elevated CK levels and your symptoms, are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. I want to order a few more blood tests to rule out other potential causes. We'll also need to consider an MRI of your thighs and upper arms to get a better look at your muscles. It’s the most definitive way to diagnose polymyositis. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI? Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. I don’t like being confined in small spaces, and all that…machinery. It sounds dreadful. And more blood tests? Honestly, they've taken enough blood already! I feel quite faint just thinking about it. Look, doctor, I think I just need a good rest and a change of scenery. Maybe a week at the coast with Tenzin. I'm sure that would fix everything. Honestly, all this fuss over…nothing. I’ve lived a long life, and I've never needed an MRI before!
DOCTOR: Mrs. Oitker, I understand your apprehension, and I'm not trying to alarm you. But ignoring these findings could lead to serious complications. Polymyositis can cause progressive muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and even heart problems. While a week at the coast would be lovely, it won't address the underlying issue. Now, about the MRI… it's a very safe procedure, and you can have someone with you for support. And we can discuss medication options if we confirm the diagnosis. I'm not saying it's definitely polymyositis, but we need to rule it out. Perhaps we can start with a referral to a rheumatologist?
PATIENT: A…reumatologist? Oh dear. Another doctor? Honestly, I feel like a pincushion already! Look, doctor, I appreciate your concern, I truly do. But I've lived a long life, and I've always trusted my instincts. And my instincts tell me I just need rest. And a good cup of tea. And maybe a little less poking and prodding. Perhaps…perhaps I could try a week at the coast and see how I feel? And then, if I'm still feeling poorly, I'll consider…seeing another doctor. But right now, I just want to go home and rest. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Oitker. I respect your wishes, but I need to document that I’ve discussed these concerns with you and that you’ve declined further testing at this time. I strongly advise you to reconsider if your symptoms worsen. If you experience any difficulty breathing, new muscle weakness, or feel increasingly fatigued, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'll write you a prescription for some vitamin D supplements, as a deficiency can sometimes contribute to muscle weakness. And I'll give you a list of symptoms to watch out for. And please, do keep me updated on how you're feeling.
PATIENT: Oh, well, that’s…kind of you, doctor. Vitamin D sounds nice. And I will try to…keep you updated. Though, I suspect I’ll be feeling much better after a nice week at the coast. Thank you for your time, doctor. And thank you for the vitamin D. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go home and rest. It’s a bit wobbly, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Oitker. Let me help you to your feet. Take your time, and lean on me if you need to. And please, if you experience any changes in your condition, don’t hesitate to call the office. Here, let's take it slow. Do you have someone to drive you home?
PATIENT: Yes, Tenzin is waiting in the car. He always worries about me. Honestly, he's a very good man. Always looking after me. Thank you again, doctor. For everything. And for the vitamin D. I truly appreciate it. I think I'll just go home and rest now. A nice, long rest.
DOCTOR: .
