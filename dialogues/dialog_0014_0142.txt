DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Right, well, it's my head, mostly. Been getting these headaches… really bad ones. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart races, feels like it's gonna jump outta my chest. It’s… not fun. Honestly, I don’t really remember when they started, just that they’ve been happening on and off for a while now.
DOCTOR: "On and off for a while now," you say. Right. Well, that narrows it down. Okay. And when you say 'bad,' can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Like, it's not just a dull ache. It's… throbbing, mostly, right behind my eyes. And it feels like pressure, all over my head. Makes it hard to think, really. And like I said, the sweating is awful, and my heart… it just pounds. I get kinda dizzy too, sometimes. I don't really… know what else to tell you. It just feels really, really bad. I don’t usually bother anyone about stuff like this, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, pressure… dizziness, sweating. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed recently… Not that I can recall, no. Work's the same, pretty boring really. Just… packing boxes all day. Divorced about a year ago, which… wasn't great, but that's settled now. I haven’t been travelling or anything. I mean, nothing major. Does that make sense? I just… don’t have a good memory for dates and stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Packing boxes. Divorce a year ago… Okay. And do these headaches happen at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. Not really, no. Seems pretty random. Sometimes it's morning, sometimes afternoon, sometimes… even at night, waking me up. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, which is kinda frustrating. I wish I could tell you something useful. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we need to rule some things out. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, or vision changes with these headaches?
PATIENT: Fever… not that I’ve noticed. Neck’s okay, feels normal. And vision… uh. Sometimes things seem a little blurry when the headache’s really bad, but I thought that was just… from straining my eyes, maybe? I don't wear glasses or anything. I don’t know, honestly. Everything feels a bit off when my head’s pounding, so it’s hard to tell what’s normal and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision… okay. Let’s take a look. Could I get you to follow my pen with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. No problem. Just tell me when you want me to look somewhere. I’ll try my best. It’s kinda hard to focus even without a headache, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Follow the pen... good, good... and now down... and up. Okay. Seems… adequate. I’m not seeing anything glaringly obvious. Let me listen to your heart and lungs, just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Go ahead. I haven’t been to the doctor in… a long time, to be honest. Hopefully everything is okay. I just figured these headaches would eventually go away on their own.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, please. Okay. Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is… a little elevated, but that could just be anxiety, given the headaches. Blood pressure is… within normal limits. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Deep breath… Whoa, that’s a bit jumpy, isn’t it? I’m not usually very good with… medical stuff. Everything feels a bit weird. I don't know if that's normal or not. I always feel a bit awkward at the doctor.
DOCTOR: A little jumpy. Yes. It’s… not alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I haven’t really taken much medication, to be honest. Just the occasional painkiller for a cold, maybe. Nothing regular. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… I honestly couldn’t say for sure. My memory isn't the best.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not anything at all. Like I said, just the occasional painkiller if I've got a really bad cold, but I haven’t needed anything for ages. I usually just try to rest and drink plenty of water. I haven’t been taking anything regularly or anything like that. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I just try to get on with things, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, headaches, no allergies, no current medications. Given your history – or lack thereof – and the exam findings, it could be tension headaches. However… they’re also quite common with stress, and given your recent divorce… …it's possible they’re related.
PATIENT: Stress, huh? Yeah, well, the divorce wasn't exactly fun. It's settled now, though. I’m… getting on with things. But I wouldn’t say I’m stressed stressed, if that makes sense? Just… life, you know? Packing boxes isn't exactly relaxing, either. So, what does that mean, though? Is it something I need to worry about? Should I be taking something? I just want it to stop, really.
DOCTOR: “Something I need to worry about.” Right. Well, given that we've ruled out anything immediately concerning, I'd suggest starting with some basic measures. Over-the-counter pain relievers—ibuprofen, acetaminophen—can help with the pain. And I strongly recommend looking at stress management techniques. Perhaps some relaxation exercises, or… even talking to someone. Although, that's really a personal choice. But, if these headaches persist or worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms—fever, vision changes, weakness—you need to come back immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… pain relievers, stress management… So, basically, just keep an eye on it and try to relax? Is there anything specific I should do for the stress management, like… a website or something? I’m not really sure where to start. And what do you mean by “worsen”? Like, if the pain gets stronger, or… if it starts happening more often? Sorry, I just want to make sure I understand everything. I don't want to come back if it's nothing, but I also don't want to ignore something serious.
DOCTOR: "Worsen" means increased frequency, increased intensity, or any new symptoms. A website… … there are numerous online resources for relaxation techniques. Just search for "stress management exercises." As for relaxation techniques, deep breathing, meditation, yoga… anything that helps you calm down. And frankly, if you're struggling to manage it on your own, a consultation with a therapist would be beneficial. But let's start with the pain relievers and see how that goes. I’m writing you a prescription for ibuprofen, just in case.
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen. Right. Deep breathing… yoga… sounds… challenging. But I guess it's worth a try. I’ll look up those stress management exercises when I get home. Thanks. I mean, I appreciate you taking the time to see me. I’m not really one for… all that therapy stuff, but I'll definitely keep an eye on things. And if the headaches get worse, I’ll come back straight away. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: No. Just try to get enough sleep, stay hydrated, and avoid any obvious stressors if possible. And… remember what I said about coming back if things worsen. That's all. Here’s your prescription. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, will do. Thanks again, Doctor Osterholm. Have a good day too. Just… one more thing. Do you know if there’s a good pharmacy nearby? I haven’t really been to this part of town before.
