DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, is it? Yes… well, it's my hearing, mostly. It keeps… going. And then I get really dizzy. It's hard to explain. My daughter, she said I should come in. She worries, you know? And… my husband, he used to have trouble with that too. Though it was a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, and it’s good you came in, and that your daughter encouraged you to do so. Both the fluctuating hearing and the dizziness are important symptoms. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, regarding your hearing – when you say it “goes,” can you describe that more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific… hmm. It's not like it suddenly cuts out, no. More like… muffled. Everything sounds far away, even when people are right next to me. And then it comes back, sort of. Not always fully though. Sometimes it’s just… quieter for a long time. It comes and goes, like waves, I suppose. Does that make any sense? It’s hard to remember exactly when it started… everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – “like waves” is a very helpful description. Fluctuating hearing loss like that is definitely something we want to investigate. And you mentioned it’s been difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started. Roughly, would you say this has been happening for weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… months, I think. Yes, definitely months. Maybe six months? Or was it longer? It’s hard to say. Everything feels… jumbled up. It started slowly, I remember that. I just thought I was getting old, you know? Not paying attention. My daughter kept saying things, but I dismissed it. She's always been a worrier, that one. But it's been worse lately, that's for sure. More often, and it lasts longer each time.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to dismiss things at first, especially if they come on gradually. And six months is a good starting point. Now, let's talk about the dizziness. Can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… it's not just… feeling lightheaded. It’s like the room is spinning, sometimes. Or I’m spinning, I can’t always tell. It makes me feel sick to my stomach, too. I have to sit down quickly before I fall. It doesn't happen every time my hearing goes, but a lot of the time, it does. It’s… unsettling. And it scares my daughter something awful when I tell her. She always wants to take me to the hospital.
DOCTOR: That sounds quite distressing, Ms. Mayhugh. The combination of the spinning sensation and nausea is concerning. Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these episodes of dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, triggers… hmm. No, not really. It just… happens. I haven't noticed anything specific. Sometimes when I bend over to pick something up, maybe? But not always. And sometimes when I turn my head quickly. But honestly, it's so unpredictable. It’s frustrating, you know? I just want it to stop. And… my husband, he used to get it too. I think it was something to do with his ears… but I can't remember exactly what the doctor said. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable onset with potential triggers of bending over or quick head movements is helpful information. Given your husband’s history and your symptoms, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had my gallbladder taken out, years ago. And I've got a bit of arthritis in my hands, that's why they ache sometimes. And high blood pressure, the doctor told me. I take medicine for that. Oh, and I had the flu pretty bad last winter, but everyone gets the flu, don’t they? I don't really remember anything else major. I try not to worry about things too much. Does that help? I’m probably forgetting something. I always do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you. Past gallbladder surgery, arthritis, and high blood pressure are all important to know. And it’s good you’re taking medication for your blood pressure. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your high blood pressure, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… now you're asking about names and I'm just lost. It's a little white pill, I think? Or maybe it's a little pink one? I take it every morning with my breakfast. I really don’t know the name. My daughter, she brings me the pills and tells me when to take them. I don’t bother with names, honestly. It all gets mixed up. I just take what she gives me. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Mayhugh. We can sort this out. It’s common not to remember medication names, and that’s what your daughter is there for. I’ll ask her to confirm the name later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, honestly. My daughter always tells me to be careful with shellfish, but I’ve always eaten it and been fine. I think she worries too much. No, no allergies. Just a bit forgetful, that’s all. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: No, being a bit forgetful isn’t a problem at all, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds like you haven’t had any significant allergic reactions, which is good to know. Alright, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or hearing problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. Well, my mother, she had diabetes, I think. And my father had heart trouble, I remember him being very sick towards the end. And like I said, my husband… he had trouble with his ears, something to do with balance. He had to go to a specialist a few times. And my daughter, she’s very healthy, thankfully. She worries about everyone else, you see. Does that help? It’s hard to remember everything from so long ago.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and your husband's ear/balance issues are all important pieces of information. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… Well, I don't do much these days, truthfully. I mostly stay at home. I used to enjoy gardening, but my arthritis makes it difficult now. I watch a bit of television, and I like to read. I don’t go out much, except for appointments. And I definitely don't exercise. I try to eat healthy, but I have a bit of a sweet tooth, I must admit. I just take things easy, really. Is that what you wanted to know? I’m probably boring you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Mayhugh. It’s good to get a full picture. That gives me a good understanding of your general activity level. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. We’ll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’d like to take a look in your ears, and do a few simple tests to assess your balance and hearing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds fine. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… don't make it too long, please? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. And… if it's going to be uncomfortable, just let me know, alright? I'm not very good with pain. But you seem very nice, so I'm sure it will be alright. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. I’ll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I will explain everything as I go along. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, which isn’t entirely unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to examine your ears. I’m just looking to see if there’s any wax buildup or any signs of infection. I see a little bit of fluid behind your eardrums on both sides. This could be contributing to your hearing difficulties. Next, I'd like to check your balance. Please stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Okay, just hold that position for a moment… You have a little bit of sway, but nothing too concerning. Finally, I’m going to do a quick hearing test. I’ll place these headphones over your ears and play some tones at different frequencies. Please let me know when you hear a sound. Can you hear this tone?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can hear that one. It’s a little faint, though. And... what did you say about the fluid in my ears? Is that bad? I don't like the sound of that. Is it something I caught? I haven't been around anyone who's been sick. Oh, dear… I’m probably making a fuss over nothing. Just tell me what it means, alright? I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're not making a fuss at all, Ms. Mayhugh, and it’s good you're asking questions. The fluid behind your eardrums is likely a build-up of fluid in the middle ear space. It’s a common issue, especially as we get older, and it can be caused by a variety of things – sometimes it's related to allergies, sometimes it’s just a change in the Eustachian tube function, and sometimes it can be associated with a mild upper respiratory infection, even if you haven’t felt particularly sick. It’s not necessarily something you “caught” from anyone. Based on the physical examination and your history, I suspect you may have a condition called serous otitis media, which is fluid buildup in the middle ear. The mild hearing loss and dizziness you’re experiencing could be related to this. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a tympanometry test, which is a quick and painless test to measure the function of your middle ear. I’ll also likely order an audiometry test for a more comprehensive evaluation of your hearing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Tests… more tests. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don’t really understand all of that, to be honest. Eustachian… what was it? Serous… something. But if it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes, alright. I trust you to do what’s best. Just… please don't make it too complicated, alright? I get confused easily. And… how long will it take? I have that appointment this afternoon, you see. It’s with my daughter’s friend, she’s a hairdresser. I promised I’d be there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. I understand your concerns, and I'll keep everything as simple as possible. The tympanometry and audiometry tests are quick and painless – they shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes total. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you right away. We should have the results back within a week. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a nasal decongestant spray to help clear any congestion in your nasal passages, which can sometimes help improve Eustachian tube function. I also want you to avoid getting water in your ears for the next few days. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss the best course of action. In many cases, serous otitis media resolves on its own, but if it persists, we may need to consider other options. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
