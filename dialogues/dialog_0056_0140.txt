DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… unpleasant. Something with my mouth. It’s rather bothersome, and my wife insisted I come. I haven’t much time to spend on this, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll try to be efficient. “Something with your mouth” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s… white patches, you see? Inside my cheeks, mostly. And it… hurts a bit when I eat anything sweet. Honestly, I assumed it was just something I ate. I don't usually bother with doctors for minor things. It’s probably nothing, but my wife… she worries.
DOCTOR: Alright, white patches inside your cheeks that are sore with sweets. How long have you noticed these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It's difficult to say precisely. Things haven't been particularly… memorable lately. I suppose it started gradually, I didn't notice it right away. It’s just been getting a bit more… visible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about a week or so, gradually getting more noticeable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the patches – any pain when you talk, difficulty swallowing, or a bad taste in your mouth, perhaps?
PATIENT: Bad taste? No. I eat perfectly good food, Doctor. Not that matters. A little discomfort, yes, when I eat. Swallowing is fine. I haven't exactly been… singing lately, if that's what you mean. Just a bit of irritation, really. Honestly, I'm quite busy. Is this taking long?
DOCTOR: No, we’re getting there. Just trying to get a full picture. Okay, so no difficulty swallowing, just irritation and some discomfort with eating. Have you had anything similar happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I've always had… robust health, Doctor. I eat well, I work hard. This is a complete anomaly. Honestly, I suspect it’s something in the fruit I've been buying. Perhaps not washed properly. It’s probably nothing serious. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any fever, or any other changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, absolutely not. I feel perfectly… normal. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s just work. I've been putting in long hours. Changes? No. No changes. Look, Doctor, is there anything wrong with me, or not? My wife will be quite upset if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your time is valuable. Just a few more quick questions, then we can take a look. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, are you implying something? Absolutely not. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. It's a dreadful habit. My wife would never allow it, and frankly, I find the thought… repulsive. This is getting rather ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that came across wrong. Just a standard question, Antoine. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I am a responsible adult, Doctor. This line of questioning feels… unnecessary. Are we going to examine my mouth, or continue with this… interrogation?
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize again if I'm causing any frustration. Just trying to rule things out. Let’s take a look at your mouth, then. If you could open wide for me… Hmm… I see some white patches on the inner cheeks, as you mentioned. They look a little… raised. Do you notice any pain when I press on them gently?
PATIENT: Yes! A bit, yes. See? It is irritating. And rather unpleasant, I might add. Honestly, Doctor, it’s precisely as I described it. I don't understand what the fuss is about. It’s probably just a minor irritation. Can we be done soon? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'm noting that the patches are slightly raised and tender to the touch. Based on what I’m seeing, and what you’ve told me, it could be something called oral thrush—a fungal infection in the mouth. It’s not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable. I want to be sure, though. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, Doctor, are you planning to give me some sort of… potion? Because I'm not keen on taking unnecessary medication. I prefer to deal with things myself, if possible. And I really must insist, my wife… she’ll be quite worried if I'm much longer.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not planning to give you a “potion”, Antoine. Just exploring options. To confirm, and because you have no known allergies, I'd like to prescribe an antifungal mouthwash to start with. It’s usually very effective. If it doesn't improve within a week, we may need to do a quick swab to confirm the diagnosis and rule out anything else. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A mouthwash? Fine. Whatever. Just… write the prescription. I suppose it can’t hurt. But if it stains my teeth, Doctor, you’ll be hearing from my wife. And please, make it quick. I really must be going. I trust it’s not something serious?
DOCTOR: Here you go. It's a mouthwash called Nystatin. Use it three times a day for a week, rinsing for 30 seconds each time. It shouldn't stain your teeth, but if you're concerned, you can ask the pharmacist about it. And to answer your question, it's likely not serious, but it's important to follow the instructions and see if it improves. If it doesn't, or if you develop any other symptoms like difficulty swallowing or pain when eating, please come back right away. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Thank you… I suppose. And please, in the future, respect my time. It’s quite valuable. .
