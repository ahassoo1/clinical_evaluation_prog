DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. I have an appointment, you see. I was told this is where one goes to… obtain a permission slip, shall we say, for medical marijuana. My daughter suggested it. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but she insists it might help with… well, with getting a decent night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your appointment here. So, you’re interested in exploring medical marijuana as a potential option for sleep difficulties. That’s perfectly alright. We can certainly discuss that. First, let's talk a bit more about what's been going on with your sleep. Could you tell me how long you’ve been having trouble sleeping, and what that trouble looks like?
PATIENT: Trouble sleeping? Honestly, Doctor, if I had a nickel for every night I’ve not slept well… It’s been… oh, goodness, years. Decades, probably. It’s not as if it’s a new development. I simply… toss and turn. My mind races. It’s very irritating. And then, of course, my husband snores. A truly dreadful sound. It's not like I want to resort to… this, but my daughter keeps going on about how it’s “natural” and “helpful.” It’s a bit much, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Years of difficulty sleeping… that’s a long time. And it sounds quite disruptive, with the racing mind and your husband’s snoring. It’s understandable why you’re looking for relief. When you say your mind races, can you tell me a little more about what you're thinking about when you’re trying to fall asleep?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, what doesn’t go through my mind? Bills, mostly. My grandchildren – are they behaving? My garden – is it getting enough water? Old friends… regrets, I suppose. The state of the world, frankly. It’s a constant whirl. It’s not as if I can simply turn it off, you know. It's a lifetime of… thinking. And worrying. A very sensible woman worries, you understand.
DOCTOR: A lot on your mind, and a lifetime of sensible worrying – I can appreciate that. It sounds like you're carrying a lot. Now, aside from the trouble sleeping, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling lately?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I haven’t the energy I used to. Everything is just… tiresome. Getting up in the morning is a struggle, and I find myself rather… irritable. My husband says I snap at him unnecessarily. Which is probably true, but he is rather oblivious sometimes. And my appetite… well, it comes and goes. Nothing severe, you understand. Just… not as robust as it once was. A woman needs her strength, you know. It's important for managing things.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ellan. Loss of energy, increased irritability, and changes in appetite… those things can all be connected. Have you seen a doctor regularly for checkups?
PATIENT: Doctor, please. I’m seventy-four years old. I’ve seen doctors. Plenty of them. They poke and prod, ask silly questions, and tell me to eat more fiber. Honestly, it's all rather… pointless. I had a check-up last year, I suppose. They said my blood pressure was a little high, but nothing they hadn’t seen before. I’m not one for fussing over every little ache and pain. A little discomfort is part of life. It’s not as if they ever fix anything, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure noted. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else significant?
PATIENT: Oh, nothing a little rest and a good cup of chamomile tea couldn’t handle. A touch of arthritis, perhaps, in my knees. But who doesn’t have arthritis at my age? I managed just fine for years without any… interventions. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a delicate flower. I’m a practical woman. I just want a good night’s sleep, if that’s not too much to ask. And my daughter is simply insisting this is the way to go. It’s all very… modern.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you've managed very well on your own for a long time, and you're quite resilient. And it’s good you have a supportive daughter. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, I'd like to just do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to get a baseline and make sure there aren't any other underlying causes for your sleep difficulties. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had enough poking and prodding to last a lifetime. But… I suppose if you insist. It won't take long, I presume? My time is valuable, you know. And I do have a garden to tend to. Though I must say, I don't see how listening to my heartbeat will solve my sleeping problems. Still, if it gets my daughter off my back… very well. Proceed, but be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It won't take long, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, as you mentioned. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Lung sounds are clear, but a little diminished on both sides. I’m going to check your reflexes and some basic neurological function. Reflexes are normal. No neurological deficits noted. Finally, I'll take a look at your throat and ears. Throat appears clear. Ears are normal. Overall, your exam is relatively normal for your age. The slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur are things we should monitor, but don’t seem to be the primary cause of your sleep difficulties at this time.
PATIENT: Well, I could have told you that. Honestly, Doctor, you doctors always make such a fuss over nothing. I’ve felt perfectly fine for years. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s to be expected. So, are we getting to the… permission slip now? My daughter is waiting for an update. And frankly, I have a weeding schedule to adhere to. This is all rather time-consuming, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if the exam felt unnecessary. However, it’s important to have a baseline to ensure we’re considering all possibilities. Now, regarding medical marijuana. Based on what you've told me, and your exam findings, I think it could be a reasonable option to explore for your sleep difficulties. However, it’s not a magic bullet, and it does come with potential risks and side effects. Before I can recommend it, I need to discuss some important considerations. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness no. I don't believe in filling my body with all those… concoctions. A little chamomile tea now and then, perhaps. And a multivitamin, but that's it. I’ve always been very careful about what I put into my body. It's a sensible approach, you understand. I wouldn’t dream of relying on pills or potions to solve my problems. It's all rather… unnatural. My daughter will be pleased to hear I've resisted the urge to become a pharmaceutical guinea pig.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications, just chamomile tea and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, please. I'm Dominican, you know. We're a hardy people. A little sunshine, a little fresh air, that's all we need. No, I don’t have any allergies. Not to pills, not to flowers, not to anything. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking rather silly questions. It’s rather insulting, if you ask me. I've lived seventy-four years without a single allergic reaction. It's a testament to my good genes and sensible lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Very well. No allergies. Now, I want to be very clear about the potential risks of medical marijuana. It can cause dizziness, drowsiness, and impaired coordination. It can also interact with other medications, although in your case, that’s less of a concern. And it’s important to note that it’s not a long-term solution. Are you comfortable with these risks?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Drowsiness? Doctor, I’m seventy-four years old. I’m always a little dizzy and drowsy. It comes with the territory. And frankly, a little peace and quiet sounds rather appealing at this point. I've lived a long life, I've taken risks. A little marijuana isn't going to change that. Honestly, you're treating me like a fragile porcelain doll. I'm a practical woman, I understand risks. And my daughter assures me it's perfectly safe. So, yes, I'm comfortable. Just get on with it, please. I have a garden to tend to. And frankly, I'd like to get a good night's sleep for once.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on your assessment, and your willingness to accept the risks, I’m willing to recommend a trial of medical marijuana for your sleep difficulties. However, I need you to understand that I will need to complete some paperwork for the state registry. It requires your consent and some additional information. And it’s important to start with a very low dose, and gradually increase it as needed, under my supervision. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Paperwork, of course. More bureaucracy. Honestly, Doctor, it's always something. Very well, let's get it over with. But I must say, I'm not very good with forms. And I expect you to explain everything very clearly. And slowly. I don't want to sign anything I don't understand. And what exactly will this… low dose entail? I don't want to end up giggling uncontrollably in the garden. That would simply not do. Explain it all. And make it quick. My roses are waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will explain everything very clearly. And I assure you, we will start with a very low dose – a dose so low it is unlikely to cause any significant side effects, let alone giggling. The state requires this form to verify your identity and medical condition. It asks for your medical history, which we've already discussed, and your consent to use medical marijuana. It also requires me to monitor your progress and document any side effects. We’ll start with a very low dose of a CBD-dominant product – meaning it has very little THC, the psychoactive component that causes the "high." We can explore options like a tincture or a sublingual spray. We’ll begin with 2.5 milligrams at bedtime. If that doesn’t help, we can gradually increase it to 5 milligrams, and then 10 milligrams, as needed. I will provide you with detailed instructions on how to administer the product, and I will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress. If you experience any side effects, or if you have any concerns, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: CBD-dominant...sublingual spray…two point five milligrams… Honestly, Doctor, it sounds terribly complicated. And all those numbers! I prefer things simple. And what exactly is a tincture? Is it like a medicine? A potion? I don't want anything that tastes dreadful. And what if it doesn’t work? Will I have to keep increasing the dose until I’m… floating in the garden? And if I contact your office, will I have to fill out more forms? Honestly, this is turning into a nightmare. My daughter made it sound so easy. Is there no simpler solution? Perhaps a nice, warm bath with lavender? A sensible woman prefers a sensible solution. Explain all of this again, slowly. And please, simplify it. For the sake of my roses.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this seems complicated. I’ll explain it again, as simply as possible. A tincture is just a liquid extract of the cannabis plant. It’s administered under the tongue – that’s what “sublingual” means. It’s not a potion, it’s simply a way to deliver the medicine into your bloodstream quickly. It usually has a mild, earthy taste. We’re starting with a very low dose – 2.5 milligrams – because we want to see how you react. It’s unlikely to cause any significant side effects. If that doesn’t help after a week, we can increase it to 5 milligrams, and then, if needed, to 10 milligrams. We will not keep increasing the dose indefinitely. We’ll find the lowest effective dose that helps you sleep. If you experience any side effects – dizziness, drowsiness, or anything else – contact my office immediately. You won’t need to fill out more forms, just speak with my nurse. She'll ask you some questions. A warm bath with lavender is a great idea, and you should continue doing that. But if that doesn’t help, medical marijuana may be an option. Do you feel more comfortable now?
PATIENT: Perhaps… a little. But it still sounds terribly complicated. And I don’t like the idea of “medicine” at all. But… my daughter will be so pleased. Very well. I suppose I can try it. But if I start seeing purple elephants, I’m blaming you, Doctor. And my daughter. Now, about this… paperwork. Let’s get it over with. But please, be patient with me. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be, and I always misplace my reading glasses. And do you have a comfortable chair? My back aches terribly. And could you explain each question as I go along? Slowly. Very slowly. I do hate forms. It's a sensible woman’s curse.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Please, have a seat. And I will be very patient. I’ll explain each question as we go along, and we can take as much time as you need. I’ll read each question aloud, and you can tell me your answers. And I have a magnifying glass if you’d like. Here’s the form. The first question is simply your full name… Can you read that for me, please?
PATIENT: Ellan Rannells. R-A-N-N-E-L-L-S. Though honestly, Doctor, I doubt anyone will ever pronounce it correctly. It’s a Dominican name, you see. Very old. And very difficult for… foreigners. Now, what’s the next question? Is it about my weight? Honestly, I don't see what my weight has to do with my sleeping problems. A sensible woman’s weight is perfectly irrelevant.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to say that, Ellan. It doesn’t necessarily have to do with your sleeping problems. The form just asks for general information. The next question is about your date of birth… Just your month, day, and year, please. And don’t worry, we can skip anything you’re not comfortable with.
PATIENT: Honestly, the bureaucracy never ends. February… the 14th… 1951. There. Now, is that it? Can we be done with this nonsense? My roses are waiting, you know. And frankly, I’m starting to feel quite lightheaded. It's probably the excitement. Or the paperwork. Either way, let's get this over with. And please, tell me we're almost finished. A sensible woman deserves a nap.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ellan. Just a few more questions. This one asks about your medical history, specifically if you have any chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure. You mentioned your blood pressure was a little high during your exam… Would you like me to write that down for you?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t bother writing it down. It’s nothing serious. Just a little elevated, as the doctor said. It happens. A sensible woman gets a little flustered sometimes. And frankly, a little stress is good for the soul. It keeps one sharp. Write “slightly elevated blood pressure” if you must, but honestly, it’s barely worth mentioning. Now, what’s the next question? Is it about my… purple elephants? I hope not.
DOCTOR: No questions about purple elephants, I promise. This one asks about any medications you’re currently taking… You mentioned you only take a multivitamin and chamomile tea… is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. A sensible multivitamin for good health, and a calming cup of chamomile tea before bed. Nothing more, nothing less. Honestly, Doctor, I don't believe in filling my body with unnecessary potions and pills. It's a sensible woman’s philosophy. Now, is that it? Can we finally be done with this endless paperwork? I'm starting to feel quite faint. And my roses… they need me.
DOCTOR: You’re all done, Ellan. Wonderful. I’ve completed the form, and I'll submit it to the state registry. It usually takes a few days to process. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a low-dose CBD tincture, as we discussed. It’s a very mild product, and it’s unlikely to cause any significant side effects. I'll also give you some detailed instructions on how to administer it, and I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. Please contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, finally. No, Doctor, I believe that is all. Just… get me the prescription, the instructions, and the appointment date. And please, don’t make me fill out any more forms. A sensible woman has better things to do. Like tending to her roses. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need a nap. And perhaps a cup of chamomile tea. A very strong cup.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ellan. Here you are. The prescription is for 2.5 milligrams of CBD tincture to be taken before bed. The instructions detail everything you need to know. Your follow-up appointment is scheduled for August 16th at 10:00 AM. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. And I hope you enjoy your nap and your chamomile tea. It was nice meeting you. .
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you for your… patience. Though honestly, I still think it's all a bit much. A sensible woman prefers a simpler life. I trust you won’t be expecting any purple elephants. Paperwork… honestly. And chamomile tea… so much chamomile tea.
