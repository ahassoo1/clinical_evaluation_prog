DOCTOR: Hi Janie, welcome! I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on a while now, honestly. I don’t really… keep track of things very well. But a long while.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a long while.” We can definitely figure that out together. So, this tiredness… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… mostly constant, I think. Some days are… less than others, maybe? But never really good. It just… is. It’s hard to explain. I just don't have the energy for… anything, really. Even getting out of bed is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Changes… Not that I recall, no. It’s been… a bit of a blur, to be honest. My husband… passed a few years ago. Things haven’t been the same since, obviously. But… nothing new new. I don’t think so. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, my mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Janie. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. And no, you don't need to apologize, we’ll take things at your pace. Let's try to pinpoint this tiredness a bit more. Aside from just feeling tired, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel a little… achy. Like my muscles are sore, even if I haven’t done anything. And… I forget things. A lot of things. Like I said. Is that a symptom? I just… space out sometimes. It's frustrating. I don't even remember what I had for breakfast yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle aches and forgetfulness, along with the tiredness. Good, we’re building a picture. When you say muscle aches, where are you feeling them most?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. But mostly… my back and my legs. It's just a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Like I’ve been working in the garden all day, but I haven’t. Honestly, I barely get to the garden anymore. Too tired. Does that… help? I'm not sure I'm very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: It does help, Janie, you're doing great. We’ll take it slowly. Now, are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat, when I remember to. It's not much, though. I don't really feel hungry. And I think… I've lost a little weight. My clothes feel looser, but I haven’t… stood on a scale in ages. My husband used to worry about my weight, but… It's not a big concern, I guess. Just… less of me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… that’s… complicated. I go to bed early, usually. But I don’t always stay asleep. I wake up a lot during the night. And when I do sleep, I don't feel rested when I wake up. It’s just… frustrating. I feel like I’m always exhausted, even after a full night… or what should be a full night. It's a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. I had… something with my blood pressure, a long time ago. They gave me pills for it. And… arthritis, I think? In my hands. But I stopped taking the pills for that a while back. They didn't seem to do much, and I didn’t like feeling… foggy. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It was all so long ago, and… my memory is terrible. I do have Medicare, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis. That's helpful, Janie. We can access your records through Medicare, so we'll get the specifics there. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. Maybe… a tonsillectomy when I was a child? But that was… ages ago. Nothing else comes to mind. Honestly, I mostly just… stayed healthy. I didn't go to the doctor much, even when my husband was still here. He always took care of everything. It's just… different now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh… Let me see. I take something for my blood pressure, still. A little white pill. And… sometimes, when my arthritis is bad, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Nothing else, I think. Oh! And a multivitamin, every morning. Just… to be safe. Is that all you need to know? I just want to get this sorted out, if that’s alright. I have… things to do, you know? Or… I should have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little white pill for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin. We'll get the exact name of that blood pressure medication from your records. Alright, Janie. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check a few things. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, please do. The sooner we get this done, the better. I just… I feel like I’m wasting time, you know? I need to… get home. Whatever you need, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/90… pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal. Now, can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels… a little weak, doesn’t it? My grip isn’t what it used to be. Everything feels… weak, actually. I don't know why. Is something wrong? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie. I notice your grip is a bit weaker than expected. It’s not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but we'll want to investigate further. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Reflexes are a bit diminished, particularly in your ankles. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Sounds normal so far. Finally, I’m just going to check your feet for any swelling or abnormalities. No swelling, but some mild redness on the tops of your feet. Okay. That completes the physical exam for now. Everything seems relatively normal, but those findings - the weak grip, diminished reflexes, and redness on your feet - warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: So… something is wrong? I knew it. What does “further investigation” mean? Blood tests? More poking and prodding? I just… I’m not good with hospitals. Or doctors, really. I just want to feel better. Is that too much to ask? What do you think it could be? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie, deep breaths. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it means we need to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Yes, I’d like to order some blood tests. It will check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid function, and any signs of inflammation. We might also want to do a simple urine test. And yes, it involves a little poking and prodding, but it shouldn’t be too uncomfortable. As for what it could be… it’s hard to say without the results of those tests. Some of the things that can cause these symptoms include vitamin deficiencies – like vitamin D or B12 – thyroid issues, or even early signs of neuropathy, which is nerve damage. It could also be related to your blood pressure or arthritis. It’s a process of elimination, really. We'll start with these tests and go from there. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests… Alright. I suppose I have no choice. How long will it take to get the results? And… what happens after that? Will you tell me what’s wrong, or will I have to come back again? I just… I don't want to keep coming back and back and back. I just want this to be over. And will it hurt? Are the tests expensive?
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie, it's alright to feel anxious. It’s a lot to take in. The blood tests should be back within a few days, usually 2-3 business days. Once I have the results, I'll review them carefully and call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We'll go over everything together, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. I promise, no medical jargon. As for whether it will hurt… the blood draw itself is just a quick pinch. Some people feel a little discomfort, but it’s usually very brief. Regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the tests. There may be a small copay, depending on your specific plan. Our billing department can give you a more accurate estimate. Now, I’m going to write you a lab order for the blood tests and a urine sample. It will list everything they need to do. I'll also give you a list of instructions on how to prepare for the tests. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… get it over with, please. I need to… go home. Thank you, Doctor. I think… that’s all. I just… want to feel better. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all. And please, take it easy. .
