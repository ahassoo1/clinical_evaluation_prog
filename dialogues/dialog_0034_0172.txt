DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Antonis Seil. It's good to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Engelhaupt, yes. It’s… a social visit, I believe. My husband insisted. Honestly, I’m perfectly fine. Just moved here, that’s all. New area, needs must, I suppose. Really, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here, beyond that. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes a check-up is a good idea when making a big change like a move, even if you feel perfectly well. And it's perfectly alright if you're unsure why you're here—we can certainly figure that out together. It shouldn't take too long; we'll just go through a few questions to get a general understanding of your health, and I can do a brief physical exam. To start, could you tell me a little more about the move?
PATIENT: Oh, the move. Well, my son… Arthur, yes, Arthur, he decided we needed to be closer to him. Lives out in… somewhere. Don't ask me the specifics, I never could keep track of those things. Perfectly capable of managing on our own, we were, but he insisted. Took a rather lovely home with a garden, actually. Though, honestly, I prefer city life. Less… fuss. Is this relevant? I simply don't see why my son’s preferences matter to you.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel frustrated, Ms. Engelhaupt. And you’re right to ask what’s relevant. Knowing about a recent move can be helpful – changes in routine, new environment, even the stress of relocating can sometimes affect one's health. It’s simply part of gathering information. Perhaps we can shift gears then. Have you had a regular doctor before this move?
PATIENT: A regular… doctor? Oh, goodness. That would have been… Dr. Abernathy, I suppose. Ages ago. He retired, you know. A very nice man, though rather… chatty. I went when I had to, naturally. Nothing serious, thankfully. Mostly just… annual things. Pap smears, I think. Though, truthfully, I can’t recall. Is this terribly important? I haven’t been feeling unwell, as I’ve said. It's just a waste of both our time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. It sounds like you’ve generally been in good health, and only saw Dr. Abernathy for routine check-ups. That's helpful to know. Just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any new symptoms at all since the move?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Heavens, no. Not that I've noticed. A bit of… stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. Old age, you know. And my eyes aren't what they used to be, but that's hardly a symptom. Everything aches a little these days. Perfectly normal. Really, I assure you, I’m quite alright. Are we almost finished? I have bridge club this afternoon. It's a rather important game, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stiffness in the mornings and changes in vision are common as we get older, but it's still important to understand what’s going on. It's good you brought them up. To help me understand a bit better, could you tell me more about the stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, really, it's nothing. Just takes a bit longer to get going in the mornings. A little creaking, that's all. My husband has it too, you know. Perfectly normal. It goes away after I've been up and about for a bit. I take a hot shower, and that seems to do the trick. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not sure what you’re hoping to find. I assure you, I’ve always been a very healthy woman. Now, is there anything else? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Engelhaupt. It sounds like you've been managing well. To be thorough, and as you are new to the area, would you mind if I quickly ask about any allergies you might have, any medications you're currently taking, and if you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've always been rather lucky in that regard. Medications… well, just a little something for my blood pressure, I suppose. Arthur insisted on that, too. He worries terribly. Can’t recall the name, though. Some sort of… water pill, perhaps? And family… my mother lived to be ninety, but she had terrible arthritis. Father had a weak heart, I think. Honestly, it was ages ago. Do you really need all of this information? I'm feeling rather faint all of a sudden. Now if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Please, do sit down, Ms. Engelhaupt. It's perfectly alright to feel a little overwhelmed. It’s important for me to have this information to ensure I can provide you with the best possible care, even if you’re feeling perfectly well. Just so I can document everything accurately, would you mind if I ask a nurse to check your blood pressure and pulse?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. A nurse? Really? It’s all becoming rather… excessive. Fine, if you must. But don’t expect any miracles. I'm perfectly fine, you know. Just a little… flustered. My husband always makes a fuss about these things. He's a good man, Arthur, but terribly anxious. Just get it over with quickly, please. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to try and focus on bridge club. It’s a rather important tournament. . .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I'll have the nurse come in momentarily. This won’t take long, and then we can discuss a plan. Perhaps it will be best to focus on some routine screenings to ensure everything is as it should be.
