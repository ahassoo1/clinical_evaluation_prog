DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yes. Well, it’s my ear. It feels…full. Like something’s blocking it, you know? Not painful, just…there. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just want it to…unblock, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A feeling of fullness in the ear is certainly something we can investigate. And it's perfectly normal for memory to be affected as we get older, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Don’t worry about that part too much. Let's start with this ear issue. You said it’s been going on for “a little while.” Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Ugh, see? This is what I mean. A little while… maybe a month? Or was it longer? I really can’t say for sure. It didn’t come on suddenly, that much I remember. Just… gradually got worse. It's mostly noticeable when it's quiet, like right now. It's... distracting. I don't think it's gotten much worse recently, but it hasn’t gotten better either.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gradually worsening over roughly a month. Constant, more noticeable in quiet environments. Thank you. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Not really. No pain, like I said. No dizziness. I don’t think my hearing’s gotten any worse, but… well, I don’t spend much time listening to music these days. Sometimes, when I swallow, it feels… a little weird in my ear? A little pressure, maybe. But it's very slight. Honestly, it could just be my imagination. My wife… she would always tell me I worried too much. She’s… gone now. Sorry. I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize at all, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It’s important for me to understand the full picture, and that includes what’s going on in your life. I'm sorry for your loss. The sensation with swallowing is good to know, thank you. It could be related. Now, let’s move on to some general health questions. Do you have any history of ear infections, or any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Ear infections… when I was a boy, maybe? Nothing serious, I don’t think. Just…the usual childhood things. As for other conditions… I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a while back. I take pills for it, usually. And…arthritis in my hands. It's why my grip isn't what it used to be. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy. I used to be a farmer, you see. Lots of fresh air and hard work. Though I’m retired now.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and arthritis – thank you for letting me know. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure and arthritis?
PATIENT: Right, medications… yes, let me think. For the blood pressure… Lisinopril, I think that’s it. And for the arthritis… Ibuprofen, when it gets bad. Not every day, just when I need it. Oh, and sometimes paracetamol. My daughter helps me keep track of everything. I’m terrible with names and numbers these days. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. This is all very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had any reactions to anything. I used to eat all sorts of things on the farm. Strawberries, raspberries… everything. My wife made wonderful jam. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, but if I were, I'm sure I'd know by now. Though, I suppose you never really know, do you?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Alright. And finally, have you had any recent illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Nothing major. I had a cold a few months back, I think. Just a sniffle and a cough. No fever. And… no surgeries. Never had any reason to. I was always lucky, I suppose. Or maybe I just avoided anything that would require one. It's all a bit hazy now. I’m sorry. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Your memories are perfectly adequate, and I can always clarify anything if needed. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear. If you don’t mind. Could you please sit forward a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Be gentle, please. My ears are…sensitive. I haven’t had anyone look at them in years. I hope it’s nothing serious. I really just want this fullness to go away. It's a nuisance, that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just looking now… I see some cerumen – that’s earwax – present. It looks quite impacted, and it could be contributing to the feeling of fullness you're experiencing. The tympanic membrane – that’s your eardrum – appears intact, and I don’t see any signs of infection or fluid buildup. Now, let's take a look at your left ear.
