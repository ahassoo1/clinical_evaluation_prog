DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It's... well, it's my waterworks, I reckon. I'm havin' a bit of trouble gettin' things to go. It just... stays in there. It's been happenin' more and more lately, and it's... uncomfortable, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination – difficulty emptying your bladder, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That's... that's a good way to put it. Difficulty emptyin'. Like there's a dam holdin' things back. It doesn't hurt, exactly, just... doesn't go. And then it's like a rush when it finally does. It's been worryin' me some.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started... maybe three, four months ago? Not all the time at first, just now and then. But the last month or so, it's been happenin' pretty much every time I try. It's... a change, that's for sure. I used to be able to... well, you know. Now it feels like I gotta push and strain.
DOCTOR: Okay, three to four months, progressively worsening, and now requiring straining to urinate. Do you feel like you completely empty your bladder when you do go, or does it feel like there's still some left in there?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. It… it doesn't feel empty, no. Like there's still somethin' holdin' back. Even after I've... done my business, I feel like there's more there. Not a lot, but... somethin'. It's a strange feelin'. I usually gotta go back a little while later, too. Not right away, but… sooner than I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so incomplete emptying and increased frequency. Have you noticed any other changes, like pain while you’re urinating, blood in your urine, or a fever?
PATIENT: No, sir, no pain. Not when I go, and not after. No blood that I've seen, and no fever. Just... the feelin' of not gettin' it all out, and havin' to go more often. It's mostly just uncomfortable and… worryin'. My wife, bless her soul, she always said to get things checked out if somethin' felt off. And this feels off.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good information. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don't rightly have much in the way of sicknesses. When I was younger, I had a bit of trouble with my knees, workin' in the fishin' boats, but that's mostly gone now. My wife, she kept me goin' to the doctor regular, but they never found nothin' serious. I take Medicare, is that what you need to know? I mostly just see the doctor for check-ups. She was real good about keepin' track of things. I miss her somethin' awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly healthy with some past knee trouble and regular check-ups. I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Dondre. It’s good you were keeping up with those check-ups. And yes, knowing you’re on Medicare is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir, never had any surgeries. Always managed to avoid 'em, thank goodness. My wife always said I was too stubborn to let anyone cut on me. She was probably right. Just the knees bothered me some, but they never needed cuttin' on, just a bit of liniment and rest. Mostly just got old, I reckon. Everything wears out eventually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family – any history of urinary problems, kidney disease, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one, Doctor. My family… we didn't talk much about sicknesses, to be honest. We were more of a 'tough it out' kind of folk. My mother, she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, but I don't recall anyone havin' trouble with their waterworks. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life as far as I know. So, no, I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known family history of urinary issues. Do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my knees now and then, when they act up. Mostly just ibuprofen, you know, the over-the-counter stuff. And sometimes a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause we don't get much sun up here this time of year. That's about it, Doctor. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can. My wife always said they do more harm than good.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knees and vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir, not that I know of. My wife always gave me everything, and I never had a reaction. She was real careful about that. No allergies to food, no allergies to plants, no allergies to nothin'. I've always been a pretty lucky fella in that regard. Never had to worry about carryin' an EpiPen or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Dondre, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a quick check of your prostate. It's a standard part of evaluating urinary issues in men. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Well, now… a prostate check, huh? My wife always said a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. I reckon it’s alright. It don’t sound pleasant, but if it’ll help figure out what’s goin' on, I’m willin'. Just... let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable, alright? I'm an old man, things don't work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. I’ll let you know what to expect, and we’ll take it slow. If you could lie down on your back, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first with my stethoscope. Just try to relax. Okay, I'm going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to check the size and texture of your prostate. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Okay, all done. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. It is a bit firm, though. That could be contributing to your symptoms. I also didn't feel any obvious masses.
PATIENT: Well, that weren’t the most comfortable thing I’ve ever done, but I got through it. Glad you didn’t find nothin’ awful. So, enlarged, you say? What does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin’ serious? And what happens now? I'm not a young man anymore, Doctor, and I don't want any unnecessary fuss. Just tell me straight what you think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. An enlarged prostate is very common as men age – it's called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. "Benign" means it's not cancerous, and "hyperplasia" just means the gland is enlarged. It's not necessarily serious, but it can cause the symptoms you're experiencing – difficulty starting and stopping urination, a weak stream, and feeling like you can't empty your bladder completely. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra – that's the tube that carries urine out of your body. When it enlarges, it can squeeze the urethra, making it harder for urine to flow. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for any infection or blood. Then, a PSA blood test – that stands for Prostate-Specific Antigen. It's a marker that can be elevated by an enlarged prostate, but also by prostate cancer, so it helps us assess your risk. Finally, I'd like to do a bladder scan to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright, that… that makes a bit more sense, hearin' it explained like that. Not cancer, that’s good. Just… old age gettin’ to me, huh? I can live with that. Tests sound fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Urine, blood, and… a scan. I’ll do whatever it takes to figure this out. When can I get these done? And how long will it take to get the results? I got some fishin' I'd like to get back to, if you don’t mind. It's been a slow season, and I don't want to miss out.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We can get those tests done right here in the clinic today. The nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. The bladder scan is quick and painless – we just use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine in your bladder after you try to urinate. The results usually take a few days to come back. I’ll have the nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. Once I have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. For many men with mild symptoms, lifestyle changes like reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, and timed voiding can be helpful. If your symptoms are more bothersome, there are medications that can help relax the prostate muscles or shrink the gland. In some cases, surgery may be necessary, but that's usually a last resort. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or blood in your urine, please contact us immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Tests today, results in a few days, and then we’ll see what the fuss is about. I can live with that. Less caffeine, less booze… my wife would be pleased to hear that. And I will, I’ll contact you if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease some, at least. It’s good to know what I’m dealin’ with, and that there are options. I reckon that’s all for today, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dondre. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect your urine sample. Yes, I think that’s all for today. Just remember to drink plenty of fluids before your appointment to make it easier to collect a urine sample. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor Condray. Thank you again for your time and patience. I appreciate it. .
