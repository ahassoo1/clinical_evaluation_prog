DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too. Bigger is the name. Delmon Bigger. They sent me here... something about the mine? Been working there a long time, you know. They say I gotta come get checked, even though I feel alright. Don't see what the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. So, it seems your employer requested a check-up due to your long-term work at the mine, which is quite responsible of them. Even if you’re feeling alright now, it’s good to be thorough. To start, can you tell me a little more about the type of work you do at the mine?
PATIENT: Type of work? I... I run the machines. Big ones. Load the rocks, move them around. Underground, mostly. Been doing it… oh, goodness… nearly fifty years now. Strong back, you know. Still is. Not like these young fellas these days. Always complaining.
DOCTOR: Fifty years is a very long time, Mr. Bigger – truly impressive. And operating heavy machinery underground is physically demanding work. Now, have you noticed any changes in how you feel recently, even small ones?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn't at my age? I sleep well enough. Eat my yam and plantain, like always. Don't go around looking for trouble. Everything feels… normal. Why are you asking so many questions if I feel fine? This is wasting my time, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. It is good that you feel generally well. We’re simply trying to establish a baseline, to make sure everything stays that way. A lot of potential health concerns develop gradually, and we want to catch them early, if there are any. Just to be complete, let’s run through a quick review of systems. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I walk to the market every week, no problem. Climb the stairs to my room… well, I could climb the stairs, if I wanted to. I mostly ask my grandson to get things now, but that's just because I'm an elder, you understand. Not because I can't breathe. I have good lungs. Always have. What’s “exertion” anyway? Sounds like fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: “Exertion” just means any physical activity that makes you breathe a little harder, Mr. Bigger. Walking, climbing stairs… exactly the things you described! It’s good to hear you’re still so active. Alright. Have you noticed any cough, perhaps with any phlegm?
PATIENT: Cough? Not much. Sometimes a little tickle in my throat, but that’s just dust, you know. From the mine. It’s a mine. There’s gonna be dust. I drink plenty of water. Clears it right up. Don’t need no fancy medicine for a little dust. I’ve been breathing mine dust for fifty years! You think a little bit now will bother me? Honestly.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Mr. Bigger. Fifty years of exposure is significant. It’s good you’re staying hydrated. Now, thinking about your chest – have you experienced any pain, discomfort, or tightness?
PATIENT: Pain? No. My chest is strong. Built from hard work. Maybe a little ache sometimes when I lift something heavy, but that's just my muscles. I'm an old man, you know. Things ache a little. Nothing to worry about. I've broken a few bones in my time, but this ain't a broken bone situation. This is just… being an elder. Do you even listen when I talk? You keep asking about things that don't matter.
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Bigger, and I appreciate you being so candid with me. It's helpful to understand what you're experiencing—and what you aren't experiencing. I understand your frustration with the questions, but it’s important to rule things out and gather a complete picture. Let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Good as ever! I eat plenty. Yam, plantain, fish, sometimes a little goat meat if my grandson brings it. Weight… well, I don't weigh myself. Always been a solid build. Not skinny, never been skinny. I'm a strong man. Why would my weight change? I'm eating the same things I've always eaten. This is just…nonsense. You are wasting my time. I should be home resting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. I truly do. And you are right to be concerned about your time. I assure you, I’m not trying to cause you any unnecessary discomfort. Just to be thorough, I'd like to do a brief physical examination, if you're willing. It won’t take long, and it may help us understand if there’s anything we need to investigate further. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general well-being. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Examination. More poking and prodding. I don’t like doctors. Too much touching. But… if it’ll get me out of here faster, alright. Get it over with. But don’t expect me to tell you anything you don’t already know. I'm a strong man. I’ll probably be fine. Just…be quick about it. And don’t press too hard. My bones ain’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bigger. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things slowly. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Breathe in… and out… excellent. I’m hearing slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs, Mr. Bigger. Nothing alarming at this point, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. Again, not immediately concerning, but something we should monitor. Your pulse is strong and regular. Finally, I'll just take a quick look at your general well-being. Do you feel any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Tenderness? No. Not really. A little ache sometimes, like I said. Old age. You keep poking and prodding… it’s gonna ache eventually! What’s “diminished”? Sounds like something bad. And “elevated”? Is my blood pressure supposed to be low? You doctors and your fancy words… I don’t understand a thing you’re saying. Just tell me if I'm gonna die or not. That’s all I need to know. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger. I apologize for using medical terms that are difficult to understand. I will do my best to explain everything in plain language. “Diminished” means slightly quieter than expected. It can be normal, especially with a long history of exposure to dust, but we want to monitor it. “Elevated” blood pressure means it’s a little higher than the ideal range. Ideally, we like to see it below 130/80. Yours is 145/90, which means it’s slightly higher, and we’ll want to discuss ways to bring it down. It doesn’t mean you are in immediate danger, but it’s something we need to address to prevent future health problems. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I would like to order some basic blood work and a chest X-ray. These tests will help us assess your overall health and see if there’s anything concerning in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and an X-ray? More poking and prodding. More waiting. Honestly… I just want to go home. Is it really necessary? I feel fine. You keep finding things that aren’t there. All this fuss over nothing. I’ve lived a long life, you know. Maybe I’m just getting old. Is that allowed? Can old people just be old? Ugh. Fine. Do the tests. Get it over with. But if it’s just gonna tell me I'm old, I'm not coming back. And don't expect me to be happy about it. I have better things to do than sit in a doctor’s office. This is a waste of time, I tell you. A complete waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Bigger, and I respect your wishes. I will order the blood work and chest X-ray as you requested. The lab and radiology staff will be gentle and efficient. We’ll get the results back within a few days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan, if necessary. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or a persistent cough – please contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a requisition form for the lab work and a referral for the chest X-ray. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Bigger. I appreciate you coming in today. .
