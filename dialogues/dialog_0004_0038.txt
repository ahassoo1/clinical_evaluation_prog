DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you, I believe. Honestly, it's a bit difficult to explain. I was advised to come and… arrange something. Something about future care, should I… become unable to make decisions for myself. I believe it's called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I’m rather hazy on the details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. An Advance Directive, or POLST form… yes. It sounds as though someone has been… proactive. It’s good to think about these things, though frankly, at your age, it’s a bit unusual. We’ll get it sorted, of course. But let’s start with you. Are you experiencing any health problems currently?
PATIENT: Health problems… Not that I’m aware of, no. I feel… generally well. I work, I eat, I sleep. Though, to be perfectly honest, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Little things, mostly. I sometimes forget where I put my tools, or the names of clients… it’s frustrating, but not debilitating, I assure you. I haven't been diagnosed with anything, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: “Little things,” you say. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It feels… gradual. Perhaps the last few years? It started subtly, I suppose. Misplacing things, forgetting appointments. Now… it’s more noticeable. It's not a sudden change, Doctor, but a slow… fading, if that makes sense. I haven’t really discussed it with anyone, truthfully. I simply… try to compensate.
DOCTOR: "Compensate," alright. And are these memory issues interfering with your work, your daily life, beyond just misplacing tools?
PATIENT: Interfering… Not drastically, no. I’m a meticulous etcher, you see. Very detail-oriented. So I double-check everything. I write lists. I've adapted. But sometimes… sometimes I feel a flicker of… uncertainty. A name on the tip of my tongue, a detail in my work that feels… wrong, even though I can’t quite place why. It’s unsettling, more than debilitating. And it's becoming more frequent, I think. My ex-husband… he suggested I see someone about it, but I dismissed it at the time. He always worried unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said “ex-husband.” Are you currently married?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Divorced. Several years ago now. A… amicable separation, for the most part. He simply wanted… a different life, I believe. It’s… not relevant, is it? I just assumed you were making polite conversation. I apologize for rambling. It’s a habit when I’m… unsettled. I’m rather focused on this Advance Directive, you see. That’s what brought me here, isn’t it? I’d like to get that sorted, if we could.
DOCTOR: It’s all relevant, Ms. Buoniconti. Knowing your life circumstances can help me understand your overall health. Now, let's talk about your work. You mentioned you are an etcher. How physically demanding is that?
PATIENT: Not physically demanding at all, Doctor. It requires a steady hand, a keen eye, and… patience, certainly. I spend most of my day seated at my workbench, meticulously carving designs into metal plates. It’s… a solitary profession, I suppose. I work mostly on commission these days; portraits, landscapes, sometimes heraldic designs. It’s… satisfying work, but it can be isolating. I don't lift anything heavy, or engage in strenuous activity. Though I do walk to the market each day for fresh ingredients. A small walk, perhaps a mile round trip. Is that… pertinent? I feel I’m being tested. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me.
DOCTOR: Not a test, Ms. Buoniconti. Just gathering information. And yes, even that small walk is pertinent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of dementia, Alzheimer’s, or other neurological conditions in your family?
PATIENT: That… is a difficult question, Doctor. My family… wasn’t one for discussing such things. My parents passed away some time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to either of them. I believe my mother suffered from… “weakness” in her later years. She became increasingly frail and withdrawn, but I don't recall a specific diagnosis. My father… he was a stoic man. He kept his ailments to himself. I simply don't know, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful, but my recollections are… fragmented, at best. There may have been instances, but I truly couldn’t say. Is it vital information? Perhaps we could move on? I’m growing increasingly anxious about this whole process.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Buoniconti. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Only… occasionally, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. I’m not a social drinker, you see. I prefer the quiet of my workshop to… boisterous gatherings. Rarely more than one or two glasses a week, and sometimes not at all. I don't smoke, and I certainly don't engage in… recreational drug use. A simple life, Doctor. Perhaps too simple. Is that… concerning? I feel I am being judged. I merely wish to ensure my affairs are in order.
DOCTOR: No one is being judged, Ms. Buoniconti. We are simply assessing your overall health. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. As far as I am aware, none. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I’m… remarkably unremarkable, in that regard. I eat most foods, I can tolerate most medications. Though, I avoid shellfish; I simply dislike the taste. But no true allergies, no. I’m quite robust, actually. It's my memory that is… unreliable, not my immune system. I apologize for repeating myself. This Advance Directive… it seems to be the only thing I can focus on at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Buoniconti. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I haven’t required any medication for… years. I occasionally take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s… infrequent. Truly, nothing regular. I pride myself on maintaining good health through diet and exercise, as minimal as that exercise may be. I dislike taking pills, and I avoid doctors whenever possible. This visit is… an exception. A rather unpleasant exception, I might add. Perhaps we could finally discuss the Advance Directive? I am growing quite agitated.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Buoniconti. Before we proceed with the Advance Directive, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Just a basic neurological assessment, to get a baseline. It will help us to better understand your current cognitive function. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? I wasn’t informed of that. I came here specifically to discuss the Advance Directive, not to be… prodded and poked. I’m a private person, Doctor. And I’m not comfortable with… unnecessary examinations. I agreed to provide a medical history, but a physical assessment… no. I’m afraid that’s unacceptable. Perhaps we could simply fill out the form? I’m capable of making my own decisions, thank you very much. I’m feeling quite overwhelmed at this point.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand your reluctance. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure you are fully competent to make these decisions. A brief neurological assessment is a standard procedure in these cases. It doesn't involve anything invasive, simply some basic tests of your memory, balance, and reflexes. If you are truly competent, you shouldn't have any objection. If I am unable to perform even a basic assessment, I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on the Advance Directive. It’s a matter of ethical responsibility, not personal judgment. I would also be happy to provide a referral to another physician, if you prefer. But I cannot compromise my professional standards.
PATIENT: It seems I have no choice, then. Very well, Doctor. But please… be gentle. And explain everything you are doing. I don't like surprises. I simply want to ensure my wishes are respected, should… the inevitable occur. I understand your responsibility, but… this is all rather unsettling. I suppose… proceed. But slowly, please. And explain each step.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Buoniconti. I will explain everything as I go. We’ll start with a simple eye exam, to check your pupillary response. Please follow the light with your eyes. Don’t strain. Just look at the light. Good. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. This involves a gentle tap on your tendons with this hammer. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll start with your knee. Please relax your leg. Alright. And now the other knee. Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow a few simple instructions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… August… the second. Yes. August the second, 2025. I believe. Is that… correct? I’m rather unsure. It's all a bit of a blur, you see. Dates aren’t my strong suit. But yes, August the second, 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me the name of the current President?
PATIENT: The President… Oh dear. That’s… escaping me, Doctor. I truly apologize. I should know that, shouldn’t I? It's… on the tip of my tongue, but I simply can’t grasp it. I follow the news occasionally, but… names and dates… they always elude me. Perhaps… you could remind me? I’m terribly embarrassed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, based on this brief assessment, I am concerned about your cognitive function. Your difficulty recalling basic information, combined with your reported memory issues, is cause for further investigation. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on an Advance Directive at this time. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation by a specialist. This will involve more in-depth testing to determine the cause of your memory loss and assess your capacity to make informed decisions. I can provide you with a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected neurologist in the area. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist… So… you’re saying I’m not… capable? That my wishes… won’t be respected? I came here to ensure my wishes were respected, not to be… declared incompetent. This is… devastating. I… I don't know what to say. Dr. Ramirez… yes, perhaps. But… what happens now? Will someone take control of my affairs? I simply wanted to simplify things, not… complicate them further. I… I think I need to sit down. This is… quite a shock. .
