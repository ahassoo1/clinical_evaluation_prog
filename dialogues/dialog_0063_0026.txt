DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It’s…well, it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, you see. Makes it hard to get anything done. And the young man at the lab said something about my…my numbers being off. Something about muscles, I think? Honestly, these things are always so confusing.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, yes. And “numbers being off,” you say. From the lab. Hmm. Could you elaborate on when this tiredness began?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it begin? That's…difficult. It feels like it’s always been a bit there, honestly. But worse lately, I suppose. Maybe…a few months? It’s hard to say. I’ve been busier with the garden, you see, and tending to things around the house. Though, I’ve always been busy. My husband, he doesn’t do much these days. So it's mostly me.
DOCTOR: A few months, with some worsening. And you attribute that to increased activity?
PATIENT: Well, it makes sense, doesn’t it? I’m not a young girl anymore! Always puttering around… digging, weeding, hauling things. It's what one does. Though, I do try to pace myself. Not like these youngsters running around all the time. It's exhausting just watching them. But, yes, the garden is probably it. Though, I do think it's more than just that. I just…feel weak sometimes, even when I haven't done a thing.
DOCTOR: Weakness, you say. And this weakness…where do you feel it specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. It's not one spot. My arms, especially. It gets hard to lift things, even light things. And my legs…they feel like lead sometimes. Makes it hard to get up from a chair, you know? And…well, my back. My back always aches, but it’s worse when I’m tired. Honestly, it's just old age, I expect. Though, the young people now, they’ve got all sorts of remedies. I don’t put much stock in them, personally.
DOCTOR: Everywhere, you say. A rather nonspecific complaint, but… alright. Do you have any difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No, no trouble breathing. Not that I've noticed. I get a little…winded, perhaps, after climbing the stairs, but who doesn't? I mean, I'm not running marathons! It’s just…a normal amount of puffing and panting for someone my age. I think you're looking for something serious, and honestly, I think I just need a good rest. That’s all. I used to be able to do anything, but these days…well. It’s just age, I tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is fine. Always has been. I like my food, you know? I’m a good cook, always have been. My husband, he doesn’t eat much anymore, but I certainly do. Though, sometimes when I'm really tired, I don’t feel like cooking. And then I just have a little something, a biscuit or some fruit. But that’s just because I’m tired, not because I don't want to eat. Honestly, I think everyone makes too much fuss over these things. A little tiredness, a little weakness…it's just life.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, just the little blue pill for my blood pressure. Doctor prescribed it years ago. Can't remember the name, honestly. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take a little something for that, but not very often. It's an over-the-counter thing, you know? Nothing fancy. And that's about it. I don't believe in loading up on pills unless I absolutely have to. My mother always said… well, never mind what my mother said. It’s just the blue pill, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies. Never had any. I eat everything. I used to go foraging with my mother as a girl, you know. Mushrooms, berries…all sorts of things. Never had a problem. And pills…well, I don't take many, so I haven't had much chance to be allergic to them! Honestly, all this questioning…are you looking for something wrong? I just feel tired, doctor. It’s not complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we should do a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Just a routine procedure.
PATIENT: Oh. Now you want to poke and prod? Honestly. Well… alright. If you must. It's just…I don't like being touched. I suppose it’s necessary, if you’re going to figure out why I'm so tired. But don't take too long, dear. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear, but diminished bilaterally. Reflexes are diminished in the upper and lower extremities. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all extremities. Alright. Your strength is somewhat reduced, and your reflexes are a bit sluggish. This could be due to a number of factors. I’ll order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh. "Rule out anything serious." That sounds ominous. I knew it! You are looking for something wrong. Honestly, I told you, it's just tiredness. And a little weakness. All this poking and prodding and… panels. Will it take long? I really don’t have time for a lot of waiting around. And what exactly are you hoping to find? Something dreadful, I suppose?
DOCTOR: The tests are fairly routine. We’ll check your blood cell counts, electrolytes, kidney function…standard things. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend you try to get more rest. And perhaps…consider a multivitamin. I’ll have the lab send the requisition form to you directly. It will have all the instructions. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: A multivitamin? Honestly. As if a little pill is going to solve everything. No. No, I don’t think so. Just…let me know when the results are back. And don’t keep me waiting, dear. I have a garden to tend to. And a husband who needs…well, never mind. Just the results, please. Quickly. I suppose that’s all for now. Honestly, all this fuss over a little tiredness.
DOCTOR: Very well. The results will be sent to you as soon as they are available. Have a good day, Ms. Oitker. .
