DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here today because I need to understand if I qualify for help at home. My… situation is becoming difficult, and I believe this visit is to confirm if I can receive assistance. I was told this is the first step.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the initial assessment. Right. Well, “qualifying for help at home” is quite broad, Mr. Bahta. Can you elaborate on what specifically is becoming difficult?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… my recovery from the operation. It has not gone as planned. Simple tasks, like preparing a meal or even getting dressed, are becoming very challenging. My daughter, she helps, but she has her own life, you understand. It is… taxing on her. I do not wish to be a burden. I believe this is what they refer to as “home health” or perhaps “hospice” care? I am unsure of the exact terminology, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Hospice is generally reserved for… more advanced situations, Mr. Bahta. We’re likely looking at home health at this point, if that’s what you require. But let’s focus on the operation first. What was the operation, and when did you have it?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, you are correct. Home health, I believe that is more accurate. It was… a repair to my abdomen. A rather large one, I’m afraid. It occurred on March 14th of this year. At Saint Luke’s Hospital, in the city. Dr. Abernathy was the surgeon. A very skilled man, but the recovery… it has not been smooth. There were… complications, you see.
DOCTOR: Abernathy… yes, I see it here. Abdominal repair, March 14th. And complications… the notes are rather… sparse. Could you tell me specifically what those complications were, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: That is… understandable. Dr. Abernathy is a man of few words, I found. There was an infection, initially. That required a second procedure. Then… the wound, it did not heal properly. It opened, and it has been… difficult to keep clean and closed since then. It causes… considerable pain, and I find myself very fatigued. It is a slow process, but it is not improving as we had hoped. I apologize for the lengthy explanation.
DOCTOR: Right. Infection, wound dehiscence… fatigue. And you’re experiencing pain. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, where would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Ah, the pain scale. Yes, I have encountered that before. Right now… it is manageable, but it is always present. I would say… a six, perhaps? It flares up with movement, of course. Standing for long periods is particularly difficult. And bending over… forget about that entirely. It is a dull ache, mostly, but it can become quite sharp at times. It interrupts my sleep, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite… is poor, Doctor. Very poor. I find it difficult to eat much at all. I try, for the sake of strength, but it is… unappetizing, everything. I have lost a considerable amount of weight, I believe. My daughter is quite concerned. It is not a matter of wanting to eat, but simply… not feeling hungry. And, truthfully, preparing the food is… strenuous. It is a cycle, you see. Weakness leads to loss of appetite, which leads to further weakness. It is… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The weight loss is noted on the chart, yes. 15 pounds since the operation. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam. I need to see the wound, of course, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Just a standard assessment. If you could please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever is necessary. I apologize in advance if it is… unpleasant. It is quite sensitive, I must warn you. This way, then. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. The wound is… larger than I expected, and there is some redness and drainage present. It doesn’t appear to be actively infected at this moment, but it's certainly not healing well. I’m also hearing some diminished bowel sounds. Your heart and lungs sound clear, thankfully, but your blood pressure is a little low. 110 over 60. And your pulse is weak. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes, I had noticed my energy levels were… low. And I do feel rather lightheaded at times. The low blood pressure does not surprise me. As you wish, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. It is… reassuring to have someone examining me thoroughly. It has been a rather isolating experience, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems you're experiencing complications from your abdominal surgery, specifically a wound that isn’t healing properly, contributing to fatigue, poor appetite, and low blood pressure. We need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order some bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an albumin level – to assess your overall health and nutritional status. I also want to order a wound culture to identify any bacteria present.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Bloodwork and a wound culture, yes, that seems sensible. Will these tests require another visit? Or can they be done here today? I am… rather reliant on my daughter for transportation, you see. And I would prefer to minimize the inconvenience to her, if possible. I understand, of course, if it is not feasible.
DOCTOR: We can draw the blood here today, yes. The wound culture can also be done here, it will only take a few minutes. The results will take a few days, usually three to five business days. Once we have those results, we can discuss a plan. It's possible you may benefit from home health care, including a nurse to monitor the wound and a dietitian to help with your nutrition. However, if the wound culture shows a serious infection, you may need to be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. I want to be upfront about that possibility.
PATIENT: That is… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Knowing that both options are being considered. Bloodwork and the wound culture today, then. That is perfectly acceptable. And if hospitalization is required, then so be it. I trust your professional judgment entirely. The thought is… unsettling, but I understand it is a possibility. Thank you for being forthright. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Or can I simply… proceed?
DOCTOR: No preparation is needed. Just sit comfortably. I'll have the phlebotomist come in to draw your blood, and then we'll take a sample from the wound. It may sting a little, but it shouldn't be too uncomfortable. I'll be right outside if you need anything. Let me call them now. And Mr. Bahta, try not to worry. We'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. .
