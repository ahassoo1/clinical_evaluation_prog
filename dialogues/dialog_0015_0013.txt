DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, when I need to go. It feels like there's always some left, even after I try. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but often enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying… and you’ve noticed this for about a month?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. It’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly. Just… frustrating. And I worry about it, you know? About… getting sick from it, if it stays in there too long. I don't really know what to do.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, and your concern is understandable. It’s good you’re addressing this. Let’s get some more details. Can you describe the stream itself?
PATIENT: The stream? Hmm… well, it starts okay. Not weak, at first. But then it… slows down. And kind of… sputters, at the end. It doesn’t stop completely, but it takes a while to finish. I have to… push a little, sometimes. I don’t always have to, but sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, initially good flow, then it slows, sputters, and occasionally requires straining to fully empty. And how frequently are you urinating throughout the day?
PATIENT: Well, I try to go every few hours, just in case. Probably… six or seven times a day? Maybe more, if I drink a lot of tea. I like my tea. It’s a habit, I guess. But it seems like even when I do go, I still feel like there’s something left. It’s confusing.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, despite not feeling fully emptied… alright. Now, do you notice any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really. No pain, like I said. No burning. Sometimes, after I go, it feels like it’s… not quite done. Like there's a little bit still there, but I can’t get it out. And… now that you ask, maybe I’ve felt a little more tired lately. But I’m an older man, so I figured that was just getting old. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Feeling of incomplete emptying, and increased fatigue. Fatigue is… worth noting, but often non-specific. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe twenty years. And I had a bad flu last winter, but everyone gets the flu, right? My wife… she passed away five years ago, and she had some problems with her heart, but that was her, not me. I mostly just… take it easy now. No big health problems, not that I know of. I see Dr. Olsen for check-ups every year, but he never said anything about anything serious. I get Medicare, so they check me over pretty good.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant past medical history besides cholecystectomy. You mentioned Dr. Olsen… do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. And I don’t take any medicines regularly. Sometimes, if my knees bother me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Just over-the-counter stuff, when I need it. Nothing a doctor prescribed. I mostly try to avoid taking pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: No regular medications, ibuprofen as needed. Now, before we proceed, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. It’s standard procedure, and will help me get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you know? I'm not a complicated man. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We’ll start with a quick abdominal palpation, and then I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam. I understand that can be… uncomfortable, but it’s important for evaluating the prostate. I’ll explain everything as I go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A digital… what now? You mean… you’re going to… check my prostate? With your fingers? Is that really necessary? I… I’ve never had that done before. It sounds… unpleasant. What are you looking for, exactly? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Hilber. The prostate can contribute to urinary issues, and a digital rectal exam is the most reliable way to assess its size and texture. It allows me to feel for any abnormalities. While it may be uncomfortable, it shouldn’t be painful. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m looking for enlargement, tenderness, or any nodules. It’s a standard part of the evaluation for men your age. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I understand… I just don’t like the sound of it. I guess if you say it’s necessary… Alright. Go ahead. But please… be gentle, like you said. And tell me what you’re feeling, or what you’re looking for, as you do it. I… I’d feel better if I knew what was going on. Just… be quick, if you can.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain everything as I proceed. Please lie on your side, with your knees bent. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses are palpable. Now, we’ll move onto the rectal exam. I’m palpating the prostate now… it’s slightly enlarged, but not significantly. There is some mild tenderness on the left lobe. No obvious nodules are felt, but the texture is somewhat irregular. Alright. The prostate is mildly enlarged and tender, with an irregular texture. This could be contributing to your urinary symptoms. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I’m going to order a urinalysis and a prostate-specific antigen blood test. The PSA test will help us rule out any underlying infection or… other concerns. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Irregular texture… that doesn’t sound good. What does “irregular texture” mean? Is it… serious? And what's this… PSA test? Is that a blood test? And will it hurt? I just… I get nervous about these things, you know? I’m an old man, and I don’t want any surprises. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hilber, an irregular texture simply means the prostate doesn’t feel entirely smooth. It’s not necessarily serious, but it warrants further investigation. Many things can cause it – inflammation, benign prostatic hyperplasia , or other, less common conditions. The PSA test is a blood test. It measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood, which can be elevated in cases of infection, inflammation, or prostate cancer. It’s a screening tool, not a definitive diagnosis. The blood draw itself will involve a small prick, and some mild discomfort. It's not a painful procedure. We’re running these tests to gather more information. It’s premature to be concerned at this point. We’re being thorough, and that’s the most important thing. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So, it’s not necessarily… cancer? That's what I was worried about. It could just be… old age? Or something I can take a pill for? And how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another… exam? I just… I don’t want to keep coming back if I don’t have to. It's just a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It could be benign prostatic hyperplasia, or prostatitis, or several other, less concerning conditions. It's far too early to say definitively. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days. Once they're available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It’s likely we’ll need to repeat the PSA test periodically, to monitor any changes. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further imaging, such as an ultrasound, or even a biopsy, but let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, I’m going to order the urinalysis and PSA test. I’ll also give you a prescription for tamsulosin, a medication that can help relax the muscles in your bladder and prostate, and hopefully improve your urinary flow. It’s a relatively safe medication, but it can cause some side effects, such as dizziness, so be careful when standing up. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: Tamsulosin? That’s a… a long word. And it might make me dizzy? I already get a little dizzy sometimes, just standing up. What if I fall? I live alone, you know. And I don’t want to end up in the hospital. What are the other side effects? And is there anything else I can do, besides take a pill? Maybe some exercises, or something? I just… I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. It's just… a lot to worry about.
DOCTOR: Tamsulosin, yes. It can cause dizziness in some patients, particularly when starting treatment. However, it’s usually mild and temporary. We can start with a low dose, and monitor your blood pressure regularly. As for alternatives, there are pelvic floor exercises, known as Kegels, that can strengthen the muscles supporting your bladder and prostate. They can be helpful, but they require consistent effort, and it takes time to see results. Honestly, Mr. Hilber, these exercises are unlikely to be sufficient on their own, given the tenderness I felt during the exam. As for other side effects, tamsulosin can sometimes cause retrograde ejaculation – semen flowing backwards into the bladder. It’s not harmful, but it can be… disconcerting. The medication is relatively safe overall, but it’s important to be aware of potential risks. I'm prescribing it to alleviate your symptoms while we await the lab results. Are you prepared to try it, with the understanding that we’ll monitor your response closely?
PATIENT: Retrograde… what now? It sounds… complicated. And I’m an old man, I don’t need any complications. I guess… I guess I’ll try it. But just a low dose, like you said. And I want to know everything that could go wrong. And if I start feeling dizzy, or anything else, I want to know what to do. Just… take care of me, Doctor. I'm just an old man, and I don't want any surprises. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hilber. I’m prescribing tamsulosin 0.4mg, to be taken once daily. If you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, or any unusual symptoms, discontinue the medication immediately and contact my office. Retrograde ejaculation is a common side effect, but it’s not harmful. I’m also providing you with a handout detailing the medication’s side effects and potential interactions. Please read it carefully. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the lab results and your response to the medication. In the meantime, if you experience any significant changes in your urinary symptoms, such as fever, chills, or blood in your urine, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything… and for not laughing at me. I just… I appreciate your patience. And I’ll try to remember everything you said. I guess I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber. And remember, contact my office if you have any concerns. .
