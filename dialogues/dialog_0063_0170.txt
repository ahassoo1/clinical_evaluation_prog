DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… life insurance. They need me to get a medical exam done for the policy. I’d like to get it over with, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Life insurance, yes. A rather… tedious requirement, if you ask me. Still, we must comply. Very well. I will need to gather some information from you. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not officially, no. I mean, the doctor back home – on Majuro – he told me my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, but he just said to watch my salt. Nothing I had to take pills for or anything. Other than that, I've been pretty healthy, I think.
DOCTOR: "A little high," you say. And when was this, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… probably… five, maybe six years ago? It was before I moved here, for sure. Things were… stressful back then. I don’t remember the exact date, though. Sorry. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is… relevant, Mr. Putney. We must establish a baseline, however imprecise your recollections may be. Have you experienced any symptoms suggestive of hypertension since then—headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, chest pain?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Honestly, I haven't really noticed anything. I work long hours, so I’m usually just tired. But no headaches, dizziness, or anything. I feel okay, generally. Just… tired. Is that a symptom of high blood pressure? I really don't know much about it.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is a non-specific symptom, Mr. Putney. It can be caused by a multitude of factors. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, stroke, or hypertension in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my dad, he had… problems with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was still pretty young. It was back on the islands, so the doctors weren’t like they are here. I remember him being sick, and then… he just wasn’t anymore. My mom… she was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Didn't have any major health issues, I don’t think. That’s about all I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your current medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Uh… none. I don't take anything regularly. Just… sometimes I take something for pain if my back is acting up from work, but that's it. Over-the-counter stuff. Like ibuprofen. Nothing a doctor prescribed.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Right. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken a lot of different things over the years, but nothing ever bothered me. That I can remember, anyway. Is this going to be a long exam? I've got a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: We are making progress, Mr. Putney. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never have. Smokes are bad for you. My grandpa used to smoke, and he always had a bad cough. I stayed away from ‘em after that. No, no smoking here. And not much drinking either, if that matters. A beer now and then with friends, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, for a brief physical assessment. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here you go. Just get it over with, please. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Hmm. 150 over 90. Elevated, as expected. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit forceful. Now, I'll check your weight and height. Please step on the scale.
PATIENT: Here we go… I haven't weighed myself in ages. Don’t judge me, Doc. I work hard, but I like my food too.
DOCTOR: 97 kilograms. And your height is 174 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that sounds about right. I haven’t grown in a long time. So, what does all this mean? Is my blood pressure really bad? I just need this exam for the insurance, right? Can we hurry it up?
DOCTOR: It indicates a degree of concern, Mr. Putney. Your weight places you in the overweight category, and your blood pressure is consistently elevated. It is not an immediate emergency, but it requires attention. For the insurance policy, yes, this assessment fulfills the requirements. However, I strongly advise further investigation. I will document these findings. I recommend a follow-up appointment with a primary care physician for a comprehensive evaluation, including an EKG and blood work to assess your cholesterol levels and kidney function. I will also provide a referral to a specialist.
PATIENT: Ugh. A specialist? Look, Doc, I just need the insurance. I don’t want a bunch of tests and appointments and… and doctors poking around. Is there anything I can just… sign? Just say I’m healthy enough for the policy? I'll eat better, I promise!
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, I am a medical professional. I cannot ethically falsify medical documentation. That is… unacceptable. And frankly, irresponsible. While I understand your desire to expedite this process, your health is paramount. I can provide you with a document outlining my findings—elevated blood pressure, overweight—and my recommendation for follow-up care. The insurance company will make their own determination. I will not compromise my integrity. I am generating the report now. Perhaps you should consider the potential consequences of ignoring these findings, Mr. Putney. Life insurance is of little use if your health deteriorates.
