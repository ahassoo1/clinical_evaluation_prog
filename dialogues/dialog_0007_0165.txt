DOCTOR: Hi Clide, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's this fever, see? Keeps comin' back. It's been... a bit of a bother, really. I'd like to get it figured out if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, a recurring fever. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It usually starts kinda slow, feelin' a little chilly, then I get warm, real warm. Sometimes I get a headache with it, sometimes not. It lasts a couple of days, maybe three, then it goes away... for a week, two weeks, then it's back again. Happens maybe once a month now. It's not high high, you know? Not like 103, more like 100, 101. Just enough to make me feel lousy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, it’s been happening roughly once a month for a while now, usually around 100-101°F, and lasts about three days. You experience chills and sometimes a headache alongside it. Do you notice anything else happening when the fever comes on?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Maybe a little tired, but I'm always a little tired. No cough, no aches… nothing obvious. My wife, Maria, she says I get a little grumpy, but she says that anyway!
DOCTOR: Well, Maria sounds like a good observer. Okay, no other accompanying symptoms like cough, body aches... just the fever, chills, and occasional headache. Do you know if you've been exposed to anyone else who’s been sick recently?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Maria and I don't get out much, to be honest. Mostly stay around the house. We went to visit my daughter in Orlando last month, but she was perfectly healthy then. We were careful, washed our hands a lot. I haven’t been around anyone obviously sick, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you traveled anywhere else recently, besides Orlando?
PATIENT: No, sir. Orlando was the only trip. Been stayin' put mostly. Too hot to be travelin’ anyway! Just workin’ at the office, home with Maria... that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent travel except for the trip to Orlando, and you haven't been around anyone visibly sick. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Always been pretty healthy, to be honest. A little arthritis in my knees, but what old man doesn't have that? The chiropractor keeps me movin', though. Nothing major. And no, no diabetes, no high blood pressure... the doctor checks me every year and always says I'm doin' alright.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. A few broken bones when I was a kid, playin’ baseball, but they healed up just fine. Nothing serious, nothin’ that would matter now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just some childhood broken bones. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Well, my mother lived to be 95, healthy as a horse 'til the very end. Dad passed away when he was in his 70s, heart trouble. My sister has a little bit of trouble with her cholesterol, but other than that, everyone’s pretty good. No one's had anything like this fever, though. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. So, mom lived to 95, dad passed from heart trouble, sister has some cholesterol issues, but no history of recurring fevers like this. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not a single one. I try to stay away from 'em if I can. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my knees, but that’s it. Maria keeps tellin’ me I should get on somethin’ for the arthritis, but I resist. I figure a good chiropractor is better than a bottle of pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for your knees. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I've ever noticed. Maria always asks when the doctor prescribes somethin', and I always tell her no. Never had a reaction to anything. Pollen bothers me a little in the spring, but that’s just a sniffle, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Clide, that’s a lot of helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Go ahead, Doctor. Let's get this figured out. I got things to do, but I'll make time. Just... try to be quick, if you could. Maria's makin' lunch.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to take your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Temperature is 100.4°F, blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 80. Now let me check your throat and ears… open wide, please. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Ears are also clear. Now, I'm going to feel your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, which is good. Given your history of recurring fevers, a normal physical exam, and the fact that you haven’t been feeling acutely ill today, my initial thought is that this could be a viral infection that keeps flaring up, or potentially something inflammatory. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood work—a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel—to get a better look at your overall health and see if there are any clues there. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work… alright. Sounds reasonable. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Clide. I'll do my best to keep it as affordable as possible. We can discuss options if the cost is a problem. The lab typically gets the results back within 2-3 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and continuing to manage your symptoms with over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen if needed. If your fever spikes above 102°F, or you develop any new symptoms like a cough, shortness of breath, severe headache, or rash, please call the office immediately. I’ll also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, a week sounds good. And I appreciate you keepin' the cost in mind, Doctor. That's a big help. Rest, fluids, ibuprofen… alright, I can do that. I'll watch for those other symptoms you mentioned. Okay, so just wait for the nurse to call with the results? And then we'll talk next week? That's good. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Just wait for the nurse to call with the results, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them next week. I’m glad I could help, Clide. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Get some rest, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. You have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You too, Clide. Take care.
