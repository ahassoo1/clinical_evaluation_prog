DOCTOR: Hi Jammal, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. But I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, you understand? It’s been going on for… oh, maybe three weeks now, I would say.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all! It's perfectly normal to discuss these things with your doctor. Three weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, three weeks. And it is not just a little bit, Doctor. It is… quite disruptive. I work at the burger place, you see, and… well, it’s not ideal when serving customers. It happens at home too, of course. Not constantly, but… often enough to be bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Disruptive is a good way to put it. And it’s good you brought it up, we can definitely figure out what's going on. Just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a bit more about the gas itself?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… mostly odorless, I think. Sometimes… a little bit smells like the burgers at work, perhaps? But mostly, it doesn’t have a strong smell. And it comes in… different sizes, you understand. Sometimes small, sometimes… larger. And it makes a noise, of course. A… a rumbling noise. It's very… social. In a bad way.
DOCTOR: Okay, odorless mostly, occasionally a bit like burgers, varying sizes… and noisy. Got it. Now, is it associated with any particular foods?
PATIENT: That is a good question, Doctor. I have been trying to pay attention. It seems… worse after I eat beans. Definitely beans. And… sometimes after the onion rings. The ones at the burger place are very good, you see, but… perhaps they are the culprit? Also, I drink a lot of fizzy orange drink. Perhaps that does not help?
DOCTOR: Okay, beans, onion rings, and fizzy orange drink. Those are all good things to note. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think, Doctor. No pain, not exactly. But sometimes… my stomach feels a little bloated afterwards. Like it is… full of air. And… a little uncomfortable, but not a bad pain. Also, I have been… a little tired lately. But that could be the work, you understand? I work many hours.
DOCTOR: Alright, bloating and some tiredness. Okay. Let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I have… good health, I think. I have Medicare, so I see the doctor regularly for checkups. They say my blood pressure is sometimes a little high, but nothing serious. I do not take any pills, unless the doctor tells me to. And I have no… allergies, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies, generally healthy, occasional high blood pressure. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I have been fortunate. No surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a small boy, playing football, but they just put it in a cast. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother had some stomach problems, I think. She always complained of… indigestion. And my father… he had a weak heart, but that was when he was very old. Nothing like my problems, you understand. He mostly just… tired easily. They both lived a long life, though. In Hungary. I came here many years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with indigestion, father with heart problems later in life. And you came here from Hungary many years ago. That's helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I live alone, in a small apartment. I work at the burger place, six days a week, usually eight hours a day. I walk to work, it is not far. I eat… mostly what I can get at the burger place, to be honest. Or simple things at home - soup, bread, sometimes beans. I do not drink alcohol, and I do not smoke. I try to get enough sleep, but it is difficult with the work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you live alone, work long hours at the burger place, walk to work, and have a fairly simple diet. No alcohol or smoking. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. I will do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. It’s a little tender in the lower abdomen, but nothing alarming. I’m also hearing some… increased bowel sounds, which isn't surprising given what you've been describing. No significant masses or rigidity. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular. Everything seems within normal limits, but the increased bowel sounds and slight tenderness are something to consider.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That is good to know, I think. I am glad everything seems… normal. What do you think is causing all the… activity, then? Is it the beans, perhaps? Or the fizzy drink?
DOCTOR: It's likely a combination of factors, Jammal. Beans and fizzy drinks are both known to produce gas. The beans contain oligosaccharides, which your gut bacteria ferment, and fizzy drinks introduce extra air into your digestive system. Working long hours and eating a simple diet at the burger place could also contribute. It’s possible you have a bit of a sensitive gut, too. We can start with some dietary adjustments. Try reducing your bean intake significantly, and switch to still water instead of the fizzy orange drink. See if that helps. I’m also going to order a stool test, just to rule out any underlying infections or imbalances. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Reducing the beans and fizzy drink… I can certainly try that. It is worth a try, if it will help. And the stool test… yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll have the nurse collect a stool sample before you leave. The results should be back in about a week. If your symptoms don’t improve with the dietary changes, or if they worsen, please give us a call right away. We might need to consider further testing, like a breath test to check for lactose intolerance or SIBO. For now, let's focus on the dietary changes and see how that goes. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you have explained everything very clearly. Dietary changes… stool test… I understand. I will follow your instructions carefully. Thank you very much for your help. You have put my mind at ease. I suppose… I should go and collect the… sample, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. The nurse will guide you. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We're here to help. Have a good day, Jammal.
