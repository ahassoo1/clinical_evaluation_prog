DOCTOR: Good morning, San. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me San. I need to get a card so I can drive commercially, you know, for ride-sharing. It's… it's a long story how I ended up needing this now, but that’s what I need. A card to legally drive people around. Is that what you do here?
DOCTOR: Yes, San, I understand. We do provide medical evaluations for commercial driver's licenses – including those needed for ride-sharing services. It’s often referred to as a DOT physical, though the requirements can vary slightly depending on the specific regulations. To ensure I can accurately complete the necessary paperwork, I’ll need to gather some information about your medical history and perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. The more quickly we get through this, the better. I have a busy afternoon. Do you need a long list of everything? I try to remember things, but… well, you know. It’s good I can usually recall details, but a whole history… maybe we can just focus on what matters now?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, San. We don’t necessarily need everything, and I certainly won't quiz you. We’ll focus on what’s relevant to safe driving. I'll ask about some key areas, and if anything comes up that needs further detail, we can address it then. Let’s start with your current health. Are you experiencing any significant medical problems at the moment – anything that limits your ability to move, think clearly, or stay awake?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm… reasonably healthy for my age, I think. A little creaky in the mornings, but that's just old age! My doctor back home… well, my previous doctor… said my blood pressure was a little high sometimes, but it wasn’t anything alarming. He put me on a small pill for it, but I haven’t taken it in… oh, goodness. Maybe a year? I feel fine, though. Really. I drive just fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, San. It's good you feel well. Just to clarify, you mentioned a blood pressure medication you haven’t been taking for about a year. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was a small, white pill. That's all I really remember, honestly. The doctor… Dr. Ito… he handled it. He moved away, you see. A new doctor came, and I just… didn't bother refilling it. It didn’t seem to do much anyway. I don’t recall feeling any different with it or without it. Does it matter that I don't know the name? I can get the records if you really need it, but it will take time.
DOCTOR: It's alright, San, we can work with that. Knowing you haven’t been taking it is the most important thing right now. We may need to get those records eventually, but let's proceed for now. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me if you have any history of heart problems, lung disease, diabetes, or any neurological conditions, like stroke or seizures?
PATIENT: No, none of those. My heart is… well, it beats! I always thought it beat a little fast, but the doctors never said anything about a problem. My lungs are fine, I don't smoke, never have. Diabetes… no. My mother had it, but I skipped that one, thankfully. And no strokes or seizures, or anything like that. I’ve been very lucky, really. Just the creaky joints, and sometimes I forget where I put my keys. Is that a neurological condition?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, San. Forgetting your keys is perfectly normal, especially as we get older! It doesn't sound like a neurological condition at all. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. A long time ago. And… hmm. I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. That required a cast, but it healed perfectly. Other than that… I can’t recall anything major. I’ve always been pretty careful, you see. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. And I understand not liking hospitals. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the vitamins, really. A multivitamin, and sometimes I take calcium for my bones. The doctor said I should. That's all. I really don't take much. I try to eat healthy, you know? Fruits and vegetables. I don’t believe in loading up on pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, San. Multivitamin and calcium. And you’ve mentioned you used to take medication for blood pressure, but have not been taking it for about a year. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’ve always been able to eat anything without a problem. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter has a shellfish allergy, but I don’t. I can’t imagine not being able to eat shellfish!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear, San. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, like I said. She had it pretty bad towards the end. My father… he was a healthy man, a farmer. Never got sick a day in his life, as far as I know. My brother… he has arthritis, but that’s about it. My daughter is healthy, thankfully. She worries too much, but physically she’s fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure in your mother, arthritis in your brother, and generally good health in your father and daughter. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, hearing, and do a general assessment. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Let’s get it over with, please. I have appointments this afternoon, you see. I'm not fond of tests, but I understand it needs to be done. Just… be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. I will be as efficient as possible. Alright, San, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your vision is slightly diminished, but likely within the normal range for your age. Your lungs are clear, and your heart sounds normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. I am noting some mild crepitus in your joints, consistent with age-related changes. Do you experience any pain or discomfort in your joints?
PATIENT: Just a little stiffness in the mornings, you know? Nothing terrible. It eases up after I move around. It's just… old age, I tell you. It creaks and groans! I used to garden a lot, but it's getting harder now. My hands aren’t as strong as they used to be. But I still manage a few flowers.
DOCTOR: That’s common, San. The joints can stiffen with age and activity. And gardening is excellent exercise, even if it's becoming more challenging. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also normal for your age. Your gait is steady, but slightly slower than average. Everything else appears to be within normal limits. Based on this exam, and the information you’ve provided, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We may need to address that. The rest of the exam does not reveal any immediate concerns that would prevent you from obtaining a commercial driver’s license. Would you be comfortable with me ordering a basic blood workup to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels and kidney function?
PATIENT: A blood test? Oh dear. Well… if it's necessary. I really don't like needles. But if it's for the card… yes, alright. Just… try to be quick, please. And tell me what it's for exactly? What are you looking for? I don't want to be poked and prodded for no reason.
DOCTOR: Certainly, San. We'll be as quick as possible. The blood work will give us a more complete picture of your overall health. Specifically, we'll be checking your cholesterol levels to assess your risk of heart disease, and your kidney function to ensure they are working properly. These are standard tests for commercial driver's licenses. It’s just to ensure you meet all the requirements and that it’s safe for you to drive. I’ll write the order for the lab now. You can go to [Name of local lab] at your convenience. They’re located at [Address of lab]. Do you have any questions about the lab or the tests?
PATIENT: [Name of local lab]… I think I’ve heard of it. Very well. I’ll go there tomorrow, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. Is there anything I need to do before the test? Fasting or anything like that? I really don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Yes, good question, San. For this particular blood workup, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water, during that time. It’s important for accurate results. I’ll also give you a slip of paper with those instructions written down, just in case. Once you have the results, you can either have your previous doctor send them to me, or you can bring them in yourself. We’ll review them and determine if any further action is needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. I think my previous doctor’s office is still open. I’ll call them tomorrow and see if they can send the results directly to you. Hopefully, they still have my records. So… if everything is okay, I can get the card? Is there anything else I need to do? Any forms to fill out or anything like that? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, San, if your blood work is within normal limits, you should be eligible to receive the medical certification for the commercial driver's license. There is a DOT physical form – I have one here. It’s fairly straightforward, mostly asking about your medical history. You can fill it out at your convenience. Once we have the lab results and the completed form, we’ll review everything together and I’ll sign off on the certification. It's usually a pretty quick process. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, San?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, thank you. I appreciate your patience. I really just want to get this done and get back to my garden. I’ll call my doctor tomorrow and schedule the blood work. Hopefully, it won't be too bad. Thank you again, Doctor Seil.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, San. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you enjoy getting back to your garden! Have a good afternoon, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
