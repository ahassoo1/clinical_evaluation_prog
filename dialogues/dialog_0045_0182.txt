DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Took long enough to get this appointment. It’s… a cosmetic thing. Doctor Billman, is it? Yes. A little… touch-up, you could say. I’m getting something done. Don't have all day, so let's get to it.
DOCTOR: “Cosmetic,” right. Look, I practice medicine, Mr. Orwin, not… artistry. But we’ll get through it. “Something” is pretty vague, though. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, it shouldn't be that difficult. I want a face lift. A small one. I'm not trying to look like one of those… those plastic dolls, you understand. Just… tidied up. My skin’s getting a bit… loose. And frankly, I'd like to know if I'm even healthy enough to bother with it at my age. Don't want any nonsense after the fact.
DOCTOR: Alright, a facelift. And you're concerned about being a suitable candidate, given your age. Eighty-one, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, eighty-one. Though I feel younger, thank you very much. Still get around fine. Mostly. But yes, eighty-one. And I have private insurance, so I expect… proper care. No cutting corners. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, perfectly understood. "Proper care" is standard here. Let's get some background, then. Have you had any major surgeries before?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Nothing major. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… oh, a hernia repair, maybe twenty years ago? Small thing. Nothing like this, of course. Mostly just… aches and pains, you know. What does this have to do with a face lift, anyway?
DOCTOR: It helps me understand your body's response to anesthesia and healing, Mr. Orwin. And to assess potential risks. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a bit of a sniffle with dust, but everyone does. And… I don't care for penicillin, gives me a stomach upset. But I wouldn't call it an allergy. Mostly just… disagrees with me. Are we getting anywhere with this? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: “Disagrees with you” noted. It’s important we have a complete picture, Mr. Orwin. And yes, we’re getting there. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take… oh, what is that stuff… for my joints. Glucosamine, maybe? It helps with the walking, you know. I get it at the drugstore. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not one for remembering names. Is that enough, or are you going to quiz me for another hour?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and glucosamine noted. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my father lived to be ninety-two, stubborn old man. Heart problems, eventually. My mother… she had diabetes, I think. And… my brother had some trouble with his lungs. Smoked too much, if you ask me. Not much else, really. A lot of Norwegians are just… tough. We don't fall apart easily. Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me if I'm even a candidate for this surgery? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to assess your overall health, skin elasticity, and… well, see if you're generally a good candidate. It’ll take just a few minutes. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your skin.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect miracles. And be gentle, I bruise easily. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished, as expected for your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Skin turgor is reduced, as expected. Some laxity in the jawline and neck area, consistent with your request. Blood pressure is 140/85. Alright, Mr. Orwin. Based on this initial assessment, you are generally healthy enough to consider a facelift, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We’d need to get that better controlled before proceeding. I'm also concerned about your skin elasticity. The results won't be dramatic. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure? Bah! It fluctuates. I'm fine. And dramatic results aren’t what I want, I told you that! I just want to look… less tired. And if you're saying it won't be a complete transformation, that’s… acceptable. So, you’re saying you will do it? When can we schedule the surgery? I have a golf tournament in October I’d like to look presentable for. Now, don't tell me about waiting months. I haven't got months.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I'm not saying I will do it yet. I'm saying you're a candidate, with some reservations. We need to get a baseline EKG, blood work, and get your blood pressure under control for at least two weeks before even considering scheduling anything. And I strongly recommend a consultation with your primary care physician to discuss managing your blood pressure. October is likely too soon, regardless. I need to see stable vitals before I’d even think about putting you under anesthesia. Now, I'm going to order those tests. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Look, I've been to doctors my whole life. I've had tests. This is just… ridiculous. Fine. Order your tests. But I expect results quickly. And I’m not running around getting referrals to primary care physicians. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. Just… get the tests done. Now, are we finished here? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Here's your lab order. It includes a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. They should be able to take care of you right away. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you once the results are in. Please consider discussing your blood pressure with another doctor, it's for your own safety. And yes, you are dismissed for now. But I expect you to take this seriously, Mr. Orwin. .
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. I’ll get the tests done. But don’t expect me to call you with a list of referrals. .
