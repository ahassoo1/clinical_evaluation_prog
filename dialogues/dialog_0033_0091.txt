DOCTOR: Right. Bianca Zicarelli. 63 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, is just… I does be really, really thirsty all the time. And I hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I feel like I need more. Is happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Thirsty and hungry… and this persists even after eating?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is not like regular hunger, you know? Is like… a hole inside me. I drink a lot of water, more than usual, and I still feel dry. And I eat, but it don't stay with me long. Is worrying me, to be honest. I never feel this way before.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… I does have to go to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. Waking me up and everything. And I feel a little tired, yes. Not all the time, but more than before. Is that important, Doctor? I don't know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, nocturia… fatigue. Alright. And have there been any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: My vision? Not that I notice, Doctor. I does wear glasses, you know, for reading. Is a little blurry if I don't have them on, but that is normal. Everything look the same as always, I think. Is everything alright, Doctor? You look worried.
DOCTOR: It's just… these symptoms can point to a number of things. We’ll need to run some tests. First, let's get a basic blood sugar level. Have you ever been tested for diabetes before?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. I don't know anything about that. Is that what you think is happening? I don't feel sick, not like a cold or anything. Just thirsty and hungry and tired. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's possible. We need to rule things out. Don't jump to conclusions. A blood sugar test is standard procedure. I'll have the nurse draw some blood now. And while we’re at it, a urinalysis as well. Just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think that is best. Whatever you think is right. I trust you. Is just… I don't like needles, you know? But I will do what I have to. The nurse will be doing this, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will handle it. It’s a simple procedure. And frankly, worrying about a little prick is… less productive than getting to the bottom of this. Let’s get it done. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the results once they come in. Don't leave the examination room.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I understand. A little prick is nothing compared to feeling like this. I will stay right here and wait for the nurse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking care of me. Is just… I does worry a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. We’ll see what we find. Try to relax. .
PATIENT: Okay. I will try to relax. A little prick… easy for her to say. I hate needles. But I have to know what is happening. I does feel so strange.
