DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? It’s not painful, thankfully, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Constant itching can be very disruptive. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say, maybe six weeks ago? It was just a little bit at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just dry skin, being summer and all. But it’s gotten worse over the last couple of weeks, definitely. I'm usually pretty good with dates, I keep a calendar... six weeks sounds right.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks. And has anything seemed to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Moisturizer helps a little for a few minutes, but then it’s back. I did try a new laundry detergent a few weeks ago, right around the time it started getting worse… a lavender scent. Could be a coincidence, though. I haven’t changed anything else, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new laundry detergent around the same time the itching worsened. That's good information. And where is the itching located?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, like I said. But… it's worse on my arms and back, I think. And my legs. My chest is pretty bad too, actually. It's hard to say exactly because, well, it’s everywhere. I have to scratch constantly, even when I’m trying to sleep. It doesn’t really seem to be in one specific spot, you know? I don't have any rash or bumps, just…itchiness.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generalized itching, worse on your arms, back, legs and chest, and no visible rash. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no weight loss… I haven’t been feeling tired any more than usual. No changes in my bathroom habits, if you don’t mind me saying. I have been a little…distracted, maybe? Just because I’m always thinking about the itching, trying not to scratch. But I don’t know if that counts as a symptom. Oh! And sometimes my skin feels a little warm, but that could be the summer heat. I'm usually quite good at noticing things, but I can't think of anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms. Just the itching and occasional warm skin. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. I also had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s been no trouble since. And…oh, my wife passed away three years ago. Not a medical condition, but it's…something. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat right, walk every day. I'm on Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ferneding. I appreciate you being so open. And I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so controlled hypertension, gallbladder removal ten years ago. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. That’s it, just the Lisinopril. And I take it every morning with my breakfast, same time every day. I'm usually very good about remembering my medication, it's a habit now. I also take a Vitamin D supplement, but that's just over-the-counter. Nothing else, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily and over-the-counter Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve taken all sorts of medications over the years for colds and flu, and never had a problem. My wife was the one with allergies, mostly to pollen. I always thought I got lucky with that one! I'm usually very careful about trying new things, just in case. But no known allergies, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any skin conditions, or other medical problems, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had eczema when she was a child, but she outgrew it. My father had diabetes, type 2, and he had some problems with his kidneys later in life. My sister has high cholesterol, but that's about it, really. Nothing major on either side of the family, as far as I know. I remember my mother talking about some arthritis in her hands, but that wasn't too bad. I'm usually pretty good at remembering these things, we talked about family history a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, eczema in your mother as a child, type 2 diabetes and kidney problems in your father, and high cholesterol in your sister. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. My wife smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. And I drink… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very rarely, though. Usually just on weekends. I don't drink very much at all, it doesn't really agree with me. I prefer a nice cup of tea, actually. I'm usually very moderate with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, thank you for providing all of that information. It's very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin to see if I can identify anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm usually quite comfortable with these things. I've had a few physicals in my time, so I know what to expect. Just let me know if you see anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. When I examine your skin, I don’t see any rash, bumps, or obvious signs of irritation. The skin appears normal in color and texture, though it does seem slightly dry. I don't see any evidence of insect bites or any other external cause for the itching. It’s a bit difficult to pinpoint the cause without any visible skin changes.
PATIENT: That’s what I thought, Doctor. I've been looking at my skin myself, and it doesn't look like anything's wrong. It just…itches. I appreciate you checking so thoroughly, though. It’s reassuring to know there’s nothing obvious. What do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I'm usually quite calm, but this constant itching is wearing me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ferneding. It’s frustrating when you can’t identify the cause of a symptom, especially one that’s so persistent. Based on your history and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be a mild allergic reaction, even without a rash – sometimes these can present as generalized itching. Dry skin, especially with the change in seasons, can also cause significant itchiness. And sometimes, certain medications can cause itching as a side effect. Less commonly, it could be related to an underlying medical condition, such as kidney disease or liver problems, although your history doesn’t strongly suggest either of those at this point. To rule out some of those possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work. We'll check your kidney and liver function, a complete blood count to look for any signs of inflammation, and I'll also add a thyroid panel, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause itching. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. I'd rather be safe than sorry, and I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure this out. I’m usually quite good at following instructions, so just let me know where I need to go and what I need to do. Do I need to fast before the blood work? And when can I expect the results? I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, it makes me feel much more at ease.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. Yes, I'd like you to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The lab is just down the hall to your left, and the receptionist there will give you the necessary paperwork. They usually can get you in quickly. As for the results, it usually takes about 2-3 business days for them to come back. Once I have them, I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, to help manage the itching, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin frequently, and avoiding any harsh soaps or detergents. If the itching becomes severe, you can try an over-the-counter antihistamine, such as Benadryl or Zyrtec. However, be aware that these can cause drowsiness. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Fast for 8-12 hours, moisturize, avoid harsh soaps, and try an over-the-counter antihistamine if needed. I'll head down to the lab now and get that taken care of. Thank you so much for your time and your help. I really appreciate you listening to me and taking my concerns seriously. I’m usually quite optimistic, so I'm hoping we can figure this out soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m happy to help. And I share your optimism – I’m confident we’ll get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.
