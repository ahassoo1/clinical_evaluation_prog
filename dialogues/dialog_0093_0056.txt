DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though, frankly, I haven’t much time for pleasantries. It’s…the university. The students, mostly. A dreadful lot of them these days. No respect for knowledge, I tell you. No respect. I suppose you want a detailed account of every…indiscretion? It’s rather tiresome. It's...work, Doctor. It’s simply work. And it's becoming…unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing some stress related to your work at the university. We don’t need to go through every detail immediately, of course. Perhaps we can focus on how this stress is affecting you specifically?
PATIENT: Affecting me? Well, what doesn’t affect me these days? Honestly, Doctor, I used to be a pillar of strength. Now…now I find myself…distracted. And tired. Exceedingly tired. Though, I assure you, it's not a physical ailment. It’s the youth. They drain one’s energy, simply by existing. Is that sufficient? Can we be done now? I have papers to grade, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. While it sounds like the source of your fatigue is related to your work environment, it's important to rule out any underlying medical causes as well. Just to clarify, when you say 'distracted,' could you describe what you mean?
PATIENT: Distracted… honestly, Doctor, must we dissect everything? It means I… I lose my train of thought. I reread sentences multiple times. Simple things, you understand. Things I’ve done for decades without issue. It’s… irritating. And it slows me down. I find myself… agitated. Is that clear enough? Really, I’m not prone to… emotional displays. This is all quite…undignified.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Mr. Schlatterer. Losing focus and experiencing agitation… those can certainly be symptoms of a number of things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Sleep? Doctor, I’ve always been a light sleeper. Always. A blessing and a curse, you see. I’ve never been one to…indulge in excessive rest. Though, lately… it’s a bit more… fragmented. I wake up. Multiple times. And I find myself…thinking. About the papers, mostly. And the students. It's hardly a restful experience, I assure you. Though, again, I suspect it's simply the…burden of responsibility. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? Can’t you simply prescribe something for…nerves?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like your sleep has been disrupted, and that’s something we should definitely address. While a medication might be helpful, it's important to understand what's contributing to the sleep disturbance first. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. Where to begin? I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A long life. I suppose…nothing significant. A touch of bronchitis when I was young. The usual aches and pains of aging. Nothing that would concern a doctor of your…expertise. I’ve never been one for… complaining. Though, my late wife… she was always going to doctors. Always. A nervous woman. Frankly, I suspect it was all… attention-seeking. I take after my mother, you see. Stoic. Resilient. Is this sufficient? Really, I haven’t the energy for a detailed recitation of every childhood ailment.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your summary, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s good to know you’ve generally been healthy. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I maintain a… disciplined lifestyle. A sensible diet. Regular, though admittedly brisk, walks. I wouldn’t dream of…indulging in unhealthy habits. My wife, again… she was fond of pastries. A weakness, frankly. But I… no. Nothing of the sort. I assure you, Doctor, I am a perfectly healthy specimen. At least, I was before this… university. Is this finally nearing an end? I have a mountain of work awaiting me. Perhaps a strong tea would be more beneficial than this… interrogation.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to get back to your work, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a few more questions, if you don't mind. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, are you suggesting I am… infirm? I told you, I maintain a disciplined lifestyle! I take… nothing. Absolutely nothing. A glass of sherry on occasion, perhaps. But that's hardly a medication. I find your line of questioning… rather insulting, frankly. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of managing my own well-being. Now, if you'll excuse me… is there anything you can prescribe to alleviate this… stress? Because frankly, my patience is wearing exceedingly thin.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Mr. Schlatterer. I assure you, I'm simply trying to gather a complete picture of your health. It sounds like you have a very independent lifestyle, which is admirable. Now, before we discuss potential solutions, let's quickly review your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, Doctor, this is preposterous. I’ve lived eighty-seven years without a single allergy. A testament to good genes and a sensible life, I assure you. Pollen, perhaps, occasionally. But who doesn’t sneeze in the spring? Nothing serious. Nothing that requires… medical intervention. I find this entire process… thoroughly unnecessary. Is there absolutely nothing you can offer me without subjecting me to this… exhaustive scrutiny? A simple sedative, perhaps? Just enough to get me through the next few months. Now, please, Doctor, tell me what you recommend. I have papers to grade. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Given your comprehensive responses and your generally healthy lifestyle, it sounds like stress is the primary contributor to your symptoms – the fatigue, the difficulty concentrating, and the disrupted sleep. While I would ideally recommend some further testing to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I understand your reluctance. I think a trial of a low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor could be beneficial. These medications are often used to manage stress and anxiety, and they can sometimes improve sleep quality. We would start with a very low dose and monitor your response closely. I would also recommend incorporating some relaxation techniques into your daily routine – things like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. And ensuring you maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends, can be helpful. Would you be open to trying a low-dose SSRI?
