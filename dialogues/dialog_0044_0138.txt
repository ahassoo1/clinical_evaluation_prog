DOCTOR: Good morning, Alayne. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Let me see… well, my daughter, bless her heart, she’s been worried about me. I’ve been having… little spells, I guess you’d call them. Not often, mind you, but enough to make her nervous. And, you know, my mother… she had terrible headaches, and my brother, too. It runs in the family, I think. It's hard to remember exactly what happens, just… a weakness, sometimes. Mostly on one side.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne, that's helpful. “Little spells” with weakness, sometimes on one side… and a family history of headaches and, potentially, similar symptoms. That is good information to have. Let me just quickly pull up your record here… Ah, yes. Alayne Tofani, date of birth… perfect. I see you've been a patient here for a few years. Now, when you say weakness, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Tofani… that's right. I've been coming here for… oh, goodness, I can't recall exactly how long. A while, though! Weakness… hmm. It's not like I can’t move, exactly. It’s more… like my arm feels heavy, you know? Or my leg. And sometimes it's hard to… form the words properly. It doesn’t last long, though. Just a few minutes, usually. It comes and goes. It's hard to explain. I don't feel pain, just… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, “heavy” feeling in an arm or leg, difficulty with speech for a few minutes at a time… and no pain. That's very helpful. And it comes and goes, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Comes and goes. Not every day, not even every week. Maybe once a month, sometimes less. It's been happening… well, I suppose for a few months now. Longer? It's hard to say, truthfully. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I mostly just try not to worry about it. But my daughter… she insisted I come in. She’s a good girl, always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: You’re very lucky to have such a caring daughter, Alayne. And it’s good she encouraged you to come in – it’s always best to get these things checked out. Now, aside from these “spells”, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, she is a treasure, that girl. Always has been. Let me think… other symptoms… well, I get the usual aches and pains, you know, for a woman my age. My knees bother me sometimes, and my back. But that's just… getting old, I suppose. And I have headaches, but I've always had headaches. Nothing different really. Just… tired sometimes. But who isn't, these days?
DOCTOR: Okay, typical aches and pains for your age, headaches you’ve had for a long time, and some fatigue. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long time ago. And I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that was… oh, decades ago. And the usual things, you know, high blood pressure, they told me, but it's been well controlled with medication for years. I take a little pill every morning. Can't remember the name of it, though. I just… take it. My daughter handles all the refills and makes sure I don’t forget.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, pneumonia decades ago, and high blood pressure controlled with medication. That's helpful. And your daughter keeps track of your refills, which is wonderful. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had any bad reactions to anything. I used to get hay fever when I was a little girl, but that cleared up years ago. I can eat anything, thankfully. I love to cook, you see, and I can’t imagine not being able to use certain ingredients. My daughter always asks if something has nuts in it for her, she's the one with the sensitivities. But me? No, I’m alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. You mentioned your mother and brother having headaches. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my family. My mother, bless her soul, she had terrible migraines. Absolutely debilitating. She’d have to lie down in a dark room for hours. She never really knew what triggered them, just… came on suddenly. And my brother, he had similar headaches, but not as bad as my mother’s. He saw a doctor for them for years. He used to say they felt like someone was hammering inside his head. He passed away a few years ago, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had debilitating migraines, and your brother had severe headaches as well. That's important information. Do you know if either of them had any other neurological symptoms, like weakness or difficulty speaking, along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… My mother, I don't recall her ever mentioning any weakness. Just the headaches and… nausea, sometimes. She'd get very pale. As for my brother… I think he might have mentioned… a bit of slurring, maybe? Once or twice. But it was years ago, and my memory isn’t what it used to be. He didn’t talk about his health much. He was a private man. I really can't say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible slurring with your brother, but uncertain. That’s alright, we're just gathering information. Now, just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, my daily life… Well, it’s pretty quiet these days. I live in the same house I’ve lived in for sixty years, with my husband, Frank. He’s… getting on a bit, too. We mostly keep to ourselves. He likes to watch his baseball, and I like to cook and garden. I have a small vegetable garden, mostly tomatoes and peppers. I try to stay busy. We get the occasional visit from my daughter and grandchildren. That's the best part of my week, really. Mostly, it's just… a quiet life.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Alayne. A quiet life with family nearby is a good life. Okay, so to summarize, we have a history of headaches in the family, some weakness on one side with these spells you’ve been experiencing, and no known allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a neurological exam to assess your strength, coordination, and sensation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m not afraid of a little exam. I used to take my grandchildren to the doctor all the time when they were little, so I’m used to it. Do whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much, if you don't mind!
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Excellent. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Okay, good reflexes here. Now, let’s move on to a neurological exam… I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and extend your arms… Can you keep them up like this?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, I can do that. Arms out… like this? A little wobbly, maybe. Getting old, you know! They’re not as steady as they used to be. I can feel my shoulder aching a bit, too. But yes, they’re up. Now what?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. A little bit of asymmetry, but that can be normal. Now, I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hands… as tightly as you can. Squeeze… and now the other hand. Squeeze… Alright, strength seems pretty good here as well. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your finger. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I can do that. Here we go… There… did I get it? It feels a little… off, maybe? A little to the side, perhaps. I haven't been doing as well with my coordination lately. It’s just… age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight deviation to the right, but nothing major. Now, I’m going to ask you to say a simple sentence, like “The sky is blue.” Just say it when you’re ready…
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here we go… “The… sky… is… blue.”
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, could you smile for me, and stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Here you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Alayne. Alright, the exam revealed a slight asymmetry in her smile, a mild deviation of her tongue to the left, some hesitation with speech, and a slight deviation to the right when touching her nose. These findings, combined with your reported symptoms and family history, are concerning for a possible neurological issue. It’s not necessarily anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. I’d like to order a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It's a non-invasive imaging test that will help us rule out any structural problems. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. An MRI? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad, Doctor? I don’t like the sound of that. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain everything carefully. And tell me if it will be uncomfortable. I don't do well with surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Alayne. It's perfectly natural to feel anxious when we talk about tests like this. An MRI is a very detailed imaging test, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's something bad going on. It’s just a way for us to get more information and rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. It's a painless procedure. You'll lie inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of your brain. It can be a little noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We'll provide you with earplugs to help with the noise. Do you have any metal implants in your body, like a pacemaker or surgical clips?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Metal implants… Let me think. I had a gallbladder surgery years ago, but they didn’t put any metal in me, I don’t think. And I have a few fillings in my teeth, of course. But that’s about it. Nothing else, that I know of. My husband, Frank, he has a hip replacement, but that’s not me! He's been warned about MRIs, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no metal implants besides fillings and your husband’s hip replacement, which is good. Fillings are generally not a problem with MRIs. Alright. I’m going to write a prescription for a brain MRI. The imaging center is located at [imaging center address]. They will call you to schedule an appointment. They will also ask you about your medical history and any metal implants. While we wait for the MRI results, I also want to be cautious. Given your symptoms, it's important to rule out any acute issues, such as a stroke. I'm going to recommend you go to the Emergency Room immediately if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as sudden weakness, difficulty speaking, vision changes, or severe headache. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The Emergency Room? That sounds… frightening. Sudden weakness, difficulty speaking… That’s a lot to keep track of. So, if I just feel a little wobbly, like I have been, that's not an emergency? But if it gets worse, then I should go? It's hard to remember everything, Doctor. My daughter is usually the one who knows what to do in these situations.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for clarification, Alayne. It is a lot to remember. If you just feel a little wobbly, like you have been, that's not an emergency. We're talking about sudden changes, things that come on quickly and are significantly worse than your usual symptoms. So, sudden weakness in your arm or leg, sudden difficulty speaking or understanding, sudden vision changes, or a sudden, severe headache that is different from your usual headaches. Those are the symptoms that would warrant an immediate trip to the Emergency Room. Here is a handout that lists these symptoms, just in case. It’s also a good idea to have your daughter review it with you. We’ll follow up as soon as the MRI results are available, and we'll discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very helpful, thank you. A written list is just what I needed. My daughter will be so glad. Let me see… sudden weakness, difficulty speaking… yes, that’s all very clear. Hmm… I don’t think so, not right now. You’ve explained everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I’m still a little worried, of course, but I feel better knowing that we’re taking steps to find out what’s going on. Thank you for being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. It’s my pleasure. Remember, I’m here for you, and we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your MRI appointment. Now, if you’re feeling up to it, let’s walk you to the front desk to schedule your appointment and get you checked out.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that would be lovely. Thank you, Doctor. I think I’m ready. My legs are a little shaky, but I can manage. It's so kind of you to walk me to the front desk. You're a very good doctor, Dr. Asami.
DOCTOR: You’re very kind to say so, Alayne. It’s all part of the job. And please, take your time. There’s no rush. Good morning, [Receptionist’s Name]. Could you please help Alayne schedule her brain MRI?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll need to fill out some forms, won’t I? My handwriting isn't what it used to be, but I’ll do my best. Thank you both for your help.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, just take your time filling out the forms, Alayne. And if you need any assistance, please don't hesitate to ask the receptionist. I'll be right here if you need anything. Have a good day, Alayne. And please, take care.
