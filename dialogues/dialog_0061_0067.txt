DOCTOR: Bula and good morning, Mr. Ruocco. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kimm, you said? Yes… well, it’s this pain. When I take a deep breath, it… hurts. It’s hard to explain. It just does. Been happening for a little while now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. We'll figure it out together. So, this pain when you take a deep breath… can you tell me where exactly you feel it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… in my chest, I think. Not like a squeezing, more like… a dull ache. Sometimes it feels like it goes to my back a little. But mostly in the chest. It's hard to pinpoint, you know? Everything feels a bit…fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be difficult to describe pain, especially when it's not constant. And it's perfectly normal for things to feel a bit fuzzy sometimes. Just do your best. So, a dull ache in your chest, sometimes radiating to your back. Does anything make the pain better?
PATIENT: Better…? Not really, no. Maybe… sitting still helps a little. But it’s always there, sort of. Lying down doesn’t seem to do much either. I haven’t really tried anything special for it, to be honest. Just been hoping it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything worsened the pain?
PATIENT: Worsened… Well, moving around, definitely. Like when I was helping my grandson with some work outside last week. Lifting things, bending… that made it much worse. And… cold air, I think. It feels sharper when it’s cold. Though I don’t know if that's just me getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, so moving around, lifting, bending, and cold air seem to make it worse. And you mentioned a cough just now – is that a new cough, or have you been coughing for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, the cough… It’s been on and off for a few weeks, I think. Not a bad cough, just… a little tickle in my throat, mostly. Gets worse when I lie down. Not much phlegm or anything. Just… annoying. I don't pay it much mind, honestly. Old man stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough for a few weeks, mostly a tickle, worse when lying down. No significant phlegm. Now, let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes, heart trouble, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see… I had some trouble with my blood pressure a long time ago, the doctor said. But I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I don’t really remember what else. My wife used to handle all that. She’s… gone now. And I haven’t kept up with it.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Ruocco. It's understandable that things have been difficult. Okay, so high blood pressure in the past. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not anymore. I used to, for the blood pressure, but… I stopped taking them a long time ago. Can't remember when exactly. Didn't seem to be doing much good anyway. Besides, I don’t have insurance, so… it's hard to afford things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, and no insurance. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never really had any trouble with that. Maybe a little sniffly nose in the spring, but nothing serious. I eat most things. My wife always said I had an iron stomach. She worried about me all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick listen to your lungs and heart, can you tell me a little bit about your smoking or drinking habits?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I used to smoke. A long time ago. When I was younger. But I quit… oh, maybe 20 years ago? More than that. And I don’t drink much. A beer with dinner sometimes, that’s about it. Not every night, though. Mostly just on special occasions. It's been a long time since I really celebrated anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you quit smoking over 20 years ago, and you have a beer occasionally. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Ruocco. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll also take your temperature and check your pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could. I have to get back and… well, there are things that need doing. I'm not as young as I used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I'll be as quick as I can. Alright, your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, which is normal. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, also within a normal range. When I listen to your lungs, I hear some slight wheezing, especially on the lower lobes. Your heart sounds a little muffled, but I don't hear any significant murmurs or irregularities. Do you ever feel short of breath, even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Short of breath…? Not really. Maybe a little when I climb the stairs, but… I just take it slow. I always have been a bit… winded easily, even when I was younger. It’s probably just old age, Doctor. I’m not expecting any miracles.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It's good you're aware of your body. Given your history of past high blood pressure, the wheezing in your lungs, and the dull chest pain, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. It will help us rule out things like pneumonia or other lung conditions. Would you be able to get that done at the clinic?
PATIENT: An X-ray…? I… I don’t know. Can I even afford that? I really don't have much money, Doctor. I'm on a fixed income. My wife… she handled all the finances. I’m just not sure. What will it cost?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Ruocco. Let me check with the clinic’s financial department to see what options are available. We do have some programs to assist patients with limited income. I’ll also see if we can get a discount. In the meantime, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your symptoms. Has the pain ever been so severe that it radiated to your arm, neck, or jaw?
PATIENT: Radiate…? No, no, it’s always just in my chest and sometimes my back. Never gone down my arm or up to my neck or jaw. It's just… a dull ache, like I said. It doesn’t feel like a sharp pain, more like a… weight. And it comes and goes, but it's always there, sort of. I really don't like feeling this way. I just want it to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. It's frustrating to deal with persistent pain. Okay, one last question for now. Have you had any recent fevers, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fevers…? No, no fever. Not that I know of. I haven’t felt hot or anything. And no chills, no night sweats either. I sleep okay, usually. A little restless sometimes, but nothing major. I just want to know what’s wrong, Doctor. And if you can fix it. It's been a long time since I felt truly well.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on what you've told me, and the findings from the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. The wheezing in your lungs, combined with the chest pain and your history of high blood pressure, could indicate a few things, including bronchitis, pneumonia, or even a heart condition. The chest X-ray will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. I’m going to step out now to check with the financial department about the X-ray costs and see what assistance programs are available. I’ll also see if I can get a standing order for a basic blood panel to check your overall health. It’s a standard test, and it may give us some more clues. Would you mind waiting here for a few minutes?
PATIENT: No, no problem. Waiting is fine. Just… let me know what it will cost, Doctor. I really need to know. I appreciate you trying to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. I spoke with the financial department. The chest X-ray will be $150, but we can apply for a patient assistance program that may cover a portion of the cost, reducing it to $75. They will need some basic income information from you to determine eligibility. We can also do a payment plan if needed. As for the blood panel, it's $50. We can include that in the assistance program application as well. I've also put in an order for both tests. The technician will come in shortly to draw the blood, and then you can go to the radiology department for the X-ray. They’re just down the hall. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: $75… that's… manageable, I think. A payment plan would be good, just in case. And the blood test too? Okay. So, the technician will come in here? How long will that take? I don't like needles, you know. And the X-ray… is it painful? I’ve never had one before. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about needles and unfamiliar procedures. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the technician is very skilled. They’ll use a small needle, and you might feel a slight pinch. It’s over very quickly. The X-ray is completely painless. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your chest. It’s a very quick process, and it doesn't involve any radiation exposure that would be harmful. I’ll have the technician come in now. I'll also write out a referral for a cardiologist, just as a precaution. If the X-ray results show anything concerning, or if your symptoms don't improve, I want you to have a specialist who can provide further evaluation. Here's the referral and the information about the assistance program. Do you have any other questions before they come in?
PATIENT: A cardiologist…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. But okay. If that's what you think is best, Doctor. No, I think… I think that's all the questions I have for now. Just… let me know if anything is wrong. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. I really do. I’m ready, I guess. Let the technician come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. I'll let them know you're ready. Remember, we're just taking these steps to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and we’ll address any concerns as they arise. “Technician, could you please come to room three?
