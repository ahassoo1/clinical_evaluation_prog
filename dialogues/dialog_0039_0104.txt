DOCTOR: Hello Tammie, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for... a bit now. Not a good hurt, if you know what I mean. Just want to get it over with, honestly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. "Not a good hurt" is helpful – can you tell me a little more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… scratchy. Like something is stuck. And it’s sore when I swallow. Like… really sore. I don't know why it hurts, that's the problem! I haven’t been doing anything to make it hurt. Just… happened. Is that enough information? I have things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Tammie. Scratchy and sore when you swallow… and it came on without any specific reason, as far as you know. Okay. Have you had any fever, cough, or runny nose along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I don’t… think so. I haven't checked. And cough… maybe a little? Not a bad cough. Just… a tickle. Runny nose… no. Definitely no runny nose. Why does it matter? Is it something serious? I don't have time for serious.
DOCTOR: It matters because it helps me figure out what might be going on, Tammie. A cough and fever can point to different things than just a sore throat alone. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's serious, just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, so mostly just the sore throat, scratchiness, and a little tickle in your throat. When did it start, roughly?
PATIENT: Honestly? I can't remember exactly. A few days, maybe? It all feels like a blur. I've been busy. It's not like I sit around paying attention to when my throat starts to hurt. Perhaps… last week? Before or after Tuesday? I went to the market on Tuesday. Does that help? Really, I just want something for it. A pill, or a… a spray, or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometime last week, before or after Tuesday when you were at the market. It's alright if you don't remember exactly, Tammie. We'll work with that. Have you noticed any white spots on your tonsils, or any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: White spots? I haven’t looked at my tonsils. Do you expect me to go around examining my own throat? That’s ridiculous! And difficulty breathing? No. I’m breathing, aren’t I? Look, I just want this over with. Is it strep? My neighbor had strep last year, and she said it was awful. Is it like that? If it’s like that, just give me the medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern about strep. It's good to rule things out. To know for sure, we would need to do a quick swab of your throat. It’s a very quick test. As for the white spots, it’s something I’ll check when I take a look at your throat. Just let me grab a tongue depressor and a light… Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it done. I don't like having things poked at, but if you have to… just be quick about it. I have appointments, you know. And try not to make me gag, alright? This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just open wide and say "ahhh." It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay, looking in your throat, I see some redness, which is expected with a sore throat. I don't see any white spots or significant swelling at this time. I'm going to go ahead and do a quick strep test, just to be sure. It'll only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Hurry up, then. This is awful. I hate doctors. Absolutely hate them. Just… get it over with. And tell me what you're doing. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick swab… almost done… there we go. Just holding it in place for a moment. Alright, now we just wait a few minutes for the results. While we wait, can you tell me about any allergies you have to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? I don't… think so. Never paid much attention. I take a bit of ibuprofen sometimes, for headaches. But that's it. No rashes, no breathing problems, nothing. Honestly, I just want a pill. Something strong. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon. A very important luncheon. And I cannot be late.
DOCTOR: Okay, good news, the strep test came back negative. That rules out a bacterial infection. It looks like you likely have a viral sore throat. Unfortunately, that means antibiotics won't help. Viral sore throats usually clear up on their own within a week or so. We can focus on managing the symptoms to make you more comfortable. Have you been able to drink fluids?
PATIENT: A viral sore throat? So, nothing you can do about it? That's… helpful. Absolutely wonderful. Just sit there and suffer, is that it? I knew I shouldn’t have come. I’ve been drinking water. And tea. But it still hurts. It hurts a lot. Is there anything at all you can give me? A spray? A lozenge? Anything?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Tammie. It’s not ideal, but there are things we can do to help relieve the discomfort. A spray or lozenge can definitely help soothe your throat. I can recommend a throat spray with a local anesthetic to numb the pain temporarily. And over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you already take for headaches, can help with the inflammation. I'm going to write you a prescription for a soothing throat spray. And I suggest you continue to drink plenty of fluids – warm tea with honey can be especially helpful. Also, get plenty of rest. Here’s the prescription. If the pain becomes severe or you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or any other concerning symptoms, please don’t hesitate to come back or see another doctor. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. Just… thank you. I suppose. Honestly, it’s not much, but… better than nothing. I really must be going now. I’m already late. Perhaps you should have warned me it would be a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tammie. I understand your time is valuable. If you find your symptoms aren't improving after a few days, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
