DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Obarr. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It's this… eating thing. I just don’t get hungry like I used to, and when I do eat, I get full awful quick. It's been happening for a few months now, and it’s starting to worry me a bit. I used to have a good appetite, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. A change in appetite like that is something we should look into. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about three, maybe four months now. It’s hard to say exactly. Things kinda sneak up on you when you get to be my age, eh? It's not like it happened overnight or anything. Just… less and less wanting to eat, and then bam, full after just a little bit.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right about that. Time does seem to slip away. Okay, so it’s been a gradual decrease in appetite, leading to feeling full quickly. Have you noticed any other changes along with that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I mean, my stomach sometimes feels a bit… uncomfortable, kinda bloated, after I eat. But it doesn't hurt, not exactly. Just… full. And a little gassy, maybe. Nothing too bad, though. I sleep alright, and I ain't lost any weight, as far as I know. My wife does most of the weighing, and she hasn’t said anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bloating and some gas after eating, but no significant pain or weight loss. That's good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – like, are they more frequent, less frequent, different in consistency, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking about things I don’t usually pay much attention to. Let me see… they’re pretty regular, I think. Same as always, mostly. Maybe a little… softer, sometimes? But I wouldn’t say diarrhea or anything. And no, no blood, thankfully. My wife would definitely notice that, she's very observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular, perhaps slightly softer stools. Good. And you said this hasn't been accompanied by any pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain. That's the thing! It's just… unsatisfying. I eat, but I don't feel satisfied, you know? Like my stomach’s telling me “enough” before my brain does. And it doesn’t last. An hour later, I feel like I could maybe eat a little something else. It's strange.
DOCTOR: That is unusual, feeling unsatisfied even after eating, and then feeling hungry again shortly after. Now, have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or heartburn with this?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, thankfully. And no heartburn either. I used to get heartburn pretty bad when I was younger, eating spicy foods and all, but that hasn't bothered me for years. It’s really just this… fullness thing and not being hungry. It's frustrating, honestly. I used to enjoy my food so much.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds frustrating indeed, especially when it impacts something you used to enjoy. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, but they put a stent in and it’s been alright ever since. I take a little pill for that, every day. Other than that… not much, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Oh! And I had the flu pretty bad last winter, but everyone gets the flu, don't they?
DOCTOR: Appendix removal, stent placement for a heart condition – that’s good to know. And you take medication for your heart. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's a little white pill… starts with a “C”, I think? Clopidogrel, maybe? Is that right? My wife handles most of the refills, so I don't always pay attention to the names. But I take it every day, same time. And I haven’t missed a dose, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Clopidogrel, yes. That’s correct. And you take that daily. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife is the one with all the allergies, poor thing. She has to be careful what she eats and all. But me? I can eat pretty much anything. Except maybe Brussels sprouts. I never did like those. But that’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, just a dislike for Brussels sprouts. Good to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My father smoked, and he always warned me off it. Said it was a terrible habit, and he was right. My wife doesn’t smoke either. We both try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I used to enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner now and then. But that was mostly when I was younger. Now, I maybe have a drink a couple of times a month, if that. Nothing heavy. Just a little sip to relax. My wife might have a small glass with me sometimes too, but we don't really drink much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. And finally, can you tell me a little about your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat pretty balanced. Lots of fish, we live near the ocean so it’s fresh, and vegetables. My wife does most of the cooking, and she’s good at it. We have salmon a couple times a week, and chicken, and beef sometimes. We try not to eat too much processed food, and we make our own bread. I do like a little dessert now and then, a piece of pie or a cookie. But nothing too crazy. I used to be a big hunter, but I don’t do that anymore. It's getting harder to get around.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very healthy diet, overall. Alright, Mr. Obarr, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. That will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I ain't afraid of a little poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just take a deep breath for me… Your heart sounds regular, a little murmur consistent with your stent placement. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, no obvious masses, but a little bit of bloating. No significant tenderness. I’m not finding anything alarming on the exam, which is good. Given your symptoms and the lack of red flags, I suspect this might be related to your appetite, or potentially some mild digestive issues. Let’s start with some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. We’ll also check your liver and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good place to start. Anything to figure out what's going on. I'm happy to get whatever tests you think are necessary. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. The lab is just down the hall, and they'll take care of everything. It will require a small blood sample, nothing too painful. The results should be back in a few days, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, try to eat small, frequent meals, and avoid anything that seems to upset your stomach. And if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Small meals and avoid upsetting my stomach… that sounds manageable. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. It's easy to feel like you're just getting old when things start to go wrong. I appreciate your help. I'll head down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It's my job to listen, and I take your concerns very seriously. Getting older doesn’t mean you have to simply accept feeling unwell. We'll figure this out together. The lab is just down the hall, to your left. If you have any trouble finding it, just ask the receptionist. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I’ll see you in a few days then.
