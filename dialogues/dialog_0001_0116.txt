DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Bilstein, good to see you… I guess. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Pehrson, is it? Yes, well. It's my legs, mostly. They… bother me at night. Cramp up something fierce, they do. It’s been going on for a while now, I reckon. I don’t rightly keep track of time these days.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” right. Well, that’s… helpful. Any other symptoms alongside the cramping?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh dear. Let me think… Not that I recall, no. Just… the aching. And sometimes, a little bit of… well, I suppose a twitching feeling before the bad cramp comes on. But not always. It’s all rather… vague, I’m afraid. I don't seem to remember things like I used to.
DOCTOR: Vague is… putting it mildly. Alright. Any past medical problems you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I had a touch of the flu, maybe, years ago. And… my hip, I think? Something about my hip when I was younger. But it was a long time ago. My husband, bless his soul, always handled the doctor visits. I wasn't one for fussing about my health. He’s… gone now, you see. A good many years. I don’t recall what exactly the doctor said about my hip, though. It didn’t seem important at the time.
DOCTOR: Right. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I… believe so. But what kind? Oh dear, it escapes me. I think it was something on my… foot, perhaps? A bunion, maybe? It was a small thing, I don’t remember being terribly sick afterwards. It was… a long time ago, before we moved here. Really, I wasn’t good at remembering these things even then. My husband always knew.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh, my. That’s a question. My mother… she lived to a good age. Ninety-something, I think. But I don't recall any… particular illnesses. And my father… he was a strong man, worked on the boats. He just… got old, eventually. Not much sickness on either side that I can recollect. We weren’t a family for complaining, you see. Just… dealt with things. It’s all very… hazy, I’m afraid. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have my spectacles, of course. And… Peppermints. For my tummy. And… No, I don’t believe I take any medicine. Not regularly. Sometimes, if I get a bad headache, I’ll take one of those… little white pills. But my neighbor gives those to me. I don’t know what they are, exactly. She just says they’re good for headaches. I don’t really keep track, you see. It’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's… concerning. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of, no. I’ve always been able to eat… well, most anything. I like berries, especially. And fish. Never had any trouble with those. I suppose I might get a bit of a sniffle in the spring, with all the pollen. But that's just the season, I reckon. Not a proper allergy. My husband used to say I had a constitution of iron. He was a good man.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a quick look at your legs. Just want to check your pulses and see if there's anything obvious going on. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I do hope it’s nothing serious. They just ache so dreadfully at night. It keeps me from my sleep, you see. And I do like a good night’s sleep. Be gentle, now. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though a bit weak in both feet. Some mild swelling in your ankles, and your skin feels cool to the touch. No obvious deformities. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your feet or toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbness… tingling… Sometimes, perhaps. Just a little… a faint prickling feeling. But it doesn’t last long. And I don’t know if it’s really… numbness. It’s just… a strange sensation. Hard to describe. Mostly, it just aches, like I said. And the cramps… those are the worst. I can’t rightly say if there’s tingling alongside it, though. It all happens at night, you see, and I’m mostly trying to get the pain to stop. Do you think it’s serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age and the vague symptoms, it could be a number of things. Poor circulation, nerve compression, even just muscle fatigue. I'm going to order some basic bloodwork to rule out anything serious. And I recommend you try taking a magnesium supplement before bed. But frankly, given the lack of clear information, it’s hard to say definitively.
PATIENT: Oh. Bloodwork? Is it… painful? And magnesium… what does that do? I don’t want to take anything that will make me feel unwell. I just want my legs to stop aching, you see. Is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a good rub with liniment? My mother always swore by liniment. It’s all a bit much, you know. I hope it’s not something too serious.
DOCTOR: The bloodwork is just a simple prick of the needle, Mrs. Bilstein. A little discomfort, but it won't take long. Magnesium can help with muscle cramps. It's relatively harmless, but you should follow the dosage instructions carefully. And frankly, liniment isn't going to solve the problem. Look, I'm ordering the bloodwork. We’ll see what comes back. If it's nothing major, the magnesium might help. If it is something more serious, we'll discuss further options. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Bloodwork it is, then. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? I don't have anyone to… to help me, you see. My husband… well, he's gone. I live alone, and I just want to be comfortable. What if I need… assistance?
DOCTOR: The results should be back in a few days. If anything serious is flagged, the lab will contact me immediately, and then we'll discuss a plan. Look, I'm not going to speculate about worst-case scenarios. We’ll deal with that if and when it happens. As for assistance… there are resources available in the community. I can give you a list. Here. This has the numbers for some local home health agencies. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. That’s… kind of you. I suppose not. Just… Just please… try to help me. I’m an old woman, and I just want to be comfortable in my own home. I appreciate you seeing me. Perhaps the magnesium will work. I do hope so.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the lab will contact you to schedule the bloodwork. Take the magnesium as directed. Have a good day, Mrs. Bilstein.
