DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Mande. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling… unwell after eating fava beans. It started a few weeks ago, and now my skin is a bit yellow, and I just feel tired all the time. It’s really worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that does sound concerning. Yellowing of the skin and fatigue… let's get some more information. When you say "after eating fava beans," can you tell me how long after eating them do you start to feel unwell?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It's usually within a few hours, I think. Maybe 3 to 5 hours after I eat them? It's hard to say exactly, but that's around the timeframe. And it doesn't happen every time I eat them, but most times, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few hours after eating fava beans, and not every time… That’s helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the yellow skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. Sometimes I get a bit of a stomach ache, and I’ve been feeling a little short of breath lately, though I thought that was just from the heat. Oh, and my urine is… darker than usual, like a dark tea color. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, Mande. Dark urine is definitely something we need to investigate. Okay, so we have yellow skin, fatigue, stomach ache, shortness of breath, and dark urine, all linked to eating fava beans. Before we proceed, have you ever been told you have a low red blood cell count, or anemia?
PATIENT: You know, I don’t think so. I've had blood tests before, with my general doctor, but no one ever said anything about that. I usually just get the results sent to my doctor, so I wouldn't necessarily know. It might have been mentioned, but I don't recall. Sorry, I'm not very good with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mande, it's perfectly normal not to remember details like that. We'll look into it. Alright. And just to get a full picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I can take most medications without any problems. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. Nothing else. It's one of those general ones, you know, for older people. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I'll take ibuprofen, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but other than that, not really. I’ve had the usual things – colds, the flu, a broken wrist once when I was younger – but nothing serious or long-lasting. And high blood pressure, but it’s well controlled with medication. I take a small dose every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and well-controlled high blood pressure. And do you know what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, let me check my purse… … Here it is. It's Lisinopril, 10 milligrams. I take one every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And a wisdom tooth taken out when I was young, but that doesn't really count, does it? Nothing major, I assure you. I’ve been quite lucky, health-wise, until now. This whole thing with the fava beans is really unsettling.
DOCTOR: No, a wisdom tooth doesn’t count. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anemia, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a difficult one. My mother had heart problems later in life, and my grandfather, on my father’s side, had diabetes. But other than that, not that I know of. No one in my family has ever had anything related to blood… I don't think so. My mother came from a very small village, so we didn’t really have access to much medical information back then. It’s hard to say, really. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We’ll work with what we have. Finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh dear. What does that mean, exactly? Do you mean, like, do I smoke or drink?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s part of it. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a fairly quiet person, I enjoy reading and gardening, that's about it. I’m not much of a partier!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Alright, Mande, thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d also like to feel your abdomen. Then I’ll check your skin color more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I'm a little worried, but I’m glad you're taking the time to figure this out. Please let me know if anything seems… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper right quadrant. And I can see some slight yellowing of your skin and the whites of your eyes – that's what we call jaundice. Your spleen feels a little enlarged as well. I'm also noticing some dark circles under your eyes. Now, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a reticulocyte count to help us understand what’s going on. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Enlarged spleen? That doesn’t sound good. And jaundice, I suppose that’s what I’ve been noticing in the mirror. Reticulocyte count… what does that test for? Is it serious? I’m starting to feel a bit anxious now, to be honest. Is it definitely something to do with the fava beans? Could it be something else?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to feel anxious, Mande, and it’s good that you’re asking questions. An enlarged spleen can indicate several things, and the tests will help us narrow down the cause. A reticulocyte count measures how quickly your bone marrow is making new red blood cells. It can help us determine if your body is responding to the anemia. It very likely is related to the fava beans, given your history. What you're describing—jaundice, fatigue, dark urine—strongly suggests a condition called Favism, which is caused by a genetic deficiency that makes you sensitive to a substance in fava beans. However, we need to rule out other possibilities, such as other causes of anemia or liver problems. The tests will help us do that. It's important to investigate fully to ensure we get the correct diagnosis. I want to be thorough. We’ll get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and the best course of action. Would you prefer I call you with the results, or would you like to schedule a follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, Favism… I've never heard of that. So it's something I was born with? That's… concerning. I suppose calling would be best. I'm not sure I could wait for another appointment. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It helps to understand what’s going on, even if it's not good news. What’s the usual turnaround time for the test results? And is there anything I should be doing now? Like, anything specific to eat or avoid? Besides fava beans, obviously!
DOCTOR: Yes, Favism is a genetic condition, meaning you’re born with it. It affects people with a deficiency in an enzyme called G6PD. It doesn’t usually cause problems unless you’re exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections. The test results usually take 24 to 48 hours, so I should be able to call you by the end of the day tomorrow with the results. In the meantime, it's a good idea to avoid any potentially triggering medications. We’ll have a complete list for you as soon as we confirm the diagnosis, but for now, it’s best to avoid anything new until we know more. And, of course, absolutely no fava beans! Also, try to stay well-hydrated, as that can help with the dark urine. Beyond that, just try to rest and eat a healthy diet. I'll also have the nurse give you a list of medications to avoid and a handout about Favism to read over. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you so much for being so thorough and patient with me. It’s a relief to have a plan, even if it’s a bit scary. A list of medications to avoid is definitely helpful. And a handout… that’s good, I like being able to read things over myself. I feel a bit better knowing what’s going on, and what to look out for. Thank you again. Is there anything you need from me before I leave? Like, any other information, or anything else I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mande. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. No, I don’t think I need anything further from you at this time. Just focus on resting, staying hydrated, and avoiding fava beans and new medications. I'll be in touch tomorrow with the results. If you experience any worsening symptoms—severe fatigue, dark urine, abdominal pain—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's a copy of your lab orders. The nurse will be with you shortly to discuss the handout and answer any questions. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I hope you feel better soon. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if anything comes up before I call you tomorrow. .
