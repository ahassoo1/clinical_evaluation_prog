DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Andraca, is it? Yes, well, it’s about the bruising. It's… excessive, frankly. I’ve been on this blood thinner for, oh, must be close to five years now, since… well, never you mind. But lately, I bump into anything – a doorway, the furniture – and I look like I’ve been in a fight. It’s ridiculous. And worrisome.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Farson, excessive bruising with a history of blood thinner use is definitely something we want to look into. Five years is a good length of time to be on one, and it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention now. To start, can you tell me a little more about the bruising itself?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to tell? It’s… purple. It appears quickly. And it doesn’t go away easily. I used to just get a little discoloration, a minor thing. Now, it’s like someone’s taken a hammer to my limbs. It’s not just my arms and legs either, I’ve noticed it on my torso a couple of times, which is… concerning. I don’t recall any major injuries, mind you. Just… everyday life. Honestly, it's getting embarrassing. I have a social life, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson. Bruising on the torso is definitely something we should pay attention to. And you’re right to be concerned about the change – a sudden increase in bruising, especially with new locations, is something we need to investigate. Let's get a bit more detailed. When you say it appears quickly, how quickly are we talking?
PATIENT: Well, not instantaneously, Doctor. I'm not made of glass. But… it's not like it takes days to show up. I might brush against a table, feel a little sting, and by the end of the day, there’s a noticeable mark. Yesterday, I barely tapped my shin on the leg of a chair and within a few hours, it was already turning a lovely shade of violet. It’s… faster than it used to be, considerably so. And larger. They’re not little pinpoint bruises anymore. They’re… substantial.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. “Substantial” and appearing within hours after minor trauma… that does sound like a change. We need to rule out a few things. First, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions besides what requires the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Honestly, Doctor, at my age, what doesn’t ache? I’ve got the usual wear and tear. High blood pressure, managed with a little pill every morning. And… arthritis, mostly in my hands. Nothing serious. Oh, and my cholesterol’s a bit high, but again, easily controlled. I used to be quite the athlete, you know. Now, just trying to keep things functioning. I don't see why any of that would have anything to do with bruising. This feels different.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Farson. Those conditions might not directly relate, but it's important to have a complete picture. High blood pressure and cholesterol are good to know. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the blood thinner and those for blood pressure and cholesterol, are you taking any other pills, supplements, or even over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. Well, I take a multivitamin, every day. And… occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for the arthritis, when it’s really flaring up. Just a couple of pills, as needed. And… oh, yes. I started taking fish oil capsules about six months ago. My daughter, she’s very health-conscious, insisted. Said it was good for everything. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. I don't go in for a lot of… fads.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The fish oil and occasional ibuprofen are important to note. Both can have an impact on bleeding. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a… reaction, to anything. My wife – God rest her soul – she always said I had the constitution of an ox. I could eat anything, take anything. She used to joke I was invincible. Clearly, I'm not anymore, if I’m bruising like this. But no, no allergies. Absolutely none.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Let's move on to your family history. Have there been any bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Bleeding disorders? That's a… complicated question. My mother’s side, they were Guatemalan, and things weren't always… openly discussed. My grandfather, I vaguely recall stories of him being… delicate. Prone to nosebleeds, I think. But whether that was a genuine condition or just… old age, I couldn’t tell you. My father’s side was more… German, very stoic. They didn’t talk about illnesses. So, I honestly don’t know. It’s not something that ever came up. Are you looking for something specific? Because frankly, I'm not very helpful on this topic.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Farson. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Just knowing that there might have been a tendency towards easier bleeding on your mother’s side is helpful. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Doctor, are you implying…? No. Absolutely not. I had a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, a very small glass. But I haven’t had a drink in… well, since my wife passed. It just didn’t seem right. And no, never touched the other… things. I was always a fairly disciplined person. A good provider. A good husband. I don't have any… vices. Is that what you were getting at? I hope you weren't implying anything untoward.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Mr. Farson. I apologize if my question came across that way. I just need to get a complete picture of your lifestyle. Knowing you don't drink is helpful. Okay, let's move onto a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse, and then I'd like to take a look at some of these bruises. And maybe do a quick neurological exam, just to rule out anything more serious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. I suppose it’s necessary. Though I doubt you’ll find anything. I told you, it's just bruising. Excessive bruising, admittedly, but still. It's not like I've had a fall or anything. But if it will put your mind at ease… do what you need to do. Just try not to poke too much. My skin is rather sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, now, if you could just extend your arm… let’s take a look at these bruises. Hmm. Yes, these are quite extensive. And varying in color – some are newer, more purple, and some are older, fading to a brownish hue. There’s some tenderness, but no warmth or swelling, which is good. And no signs of any underlying fracture. Reflexes are normal, sensation is intact. No signs of any nerve damage. Okay, the exam doesn’t reveal anything immediately concerning, but these bruises are significant enough to warrant some further investigation. I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to check your blood clotting ability, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests. Of course. More poking and prodding. Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a guinea pig. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, go ahead. Though I suspect it will just confirm what I already know: I'm an old man who bruises easily. Just… try to make it quick, will you? I have a luncheon planned with some friends. It's… important to me. And I don't want to be late. Can the results be ready quickly?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Farson. I assure you, I’m not trying to make you uncomfortable, and I will do everything I can to make this as quick and painless as possible. The lab should be able to turn the results around fairly quickly – usually within 24 to 48 hours. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as unusual bleeding from your gums or nose, blood in your urine or stool, or severe headaches – please call the office immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, clear enough. New symptoms. Bleeding gums, headaches… Honestly, it's a depressing list. But I understand. Better safe than sorry, I suppose. Fine. Let’s get it over with. Tell the nurse to be gentle, will you? And perhaps have a bandage handy. I don’t want to drip all over my luncheon outfit. This is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I will absolutely let the nurse know, Mr. Farson. She’s very experienced and gentle. And we’ll make sure you have a bandage to prevent any… inconveniences.
