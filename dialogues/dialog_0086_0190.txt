DOCTOR: Right. Lilyanna Snerling, 23 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s this… feeling unsteady, I suppose. Like I might fall. It’s been happening… well, I can’t quite place when it started, exactly. Just… lately. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Unsteady,” you say. And you can’t pinpoint when it began?
PATIENT: No, sir… or ma'am. I apologize. It’s just… things haven’t been very clear lately. Not with… everything. It feels like it’s been a few weeks, maybe? But I truly can’t say for certain. It comes and goes, you see. Some days are better than others.
DOCTOR: “Not very clear”?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It's difficult to explain. It’s… a fogginess, I suppose. With remembering things, and… dates. And sometimes, just… where I am, for a moment. It passes quickly, but it's unsettling. It started after… after my husband passed, I think. Though I can't be certain of that, either. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some cognitive difficulties – memory issues, disorientation – coinciding with… a recent loss. And this unsteady feeling… is it constant, or does it come in waves?
PATIENT: Waves, definitely waves. It isn’t always there. Some mornings I wake up feeling perfectly fine, and then… later in the day it will just… happen. Like the room is tilting, or my balance is off. It doesn't last long, usually, but it's enough to make me pause. And I worry about falling, especially at work. It wouldn’t be good.
DOCTOR: And what do you do for work, Lilyanna?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I operate a rotary drill. For oil and gas. It’s… a physical job. A lot of standing, and… moving around the rig. Which is why this unsteadiness is so concerning. I need to be steady on my feet, you understand.
DOCTOR: A rotary drill operator… right. Okay. And have you experienced any other symptoms along with this unsteadiness and… fogginess?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Hmm. Sometimes… a bit of a headache, I suppose. Not severe, just… a dull ache. And occasionally, I feel a little… nauseous. But I haven’t actually been sick. And… oh! My vision sometimes feels a little blurry, but I thought that was just from being tired. It’s hard to say, really. Everything feels… disconnected. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Disconnected… right. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Illnesses… not that I recall, no. I had a cold, maybe, a few months back? But nothing serious. Just the usual sniffles and a sore throat. I don’t… I haven’t been to a doctor in a very long time. Not since… well. I don’t really remember. I apologize again. It’s just… everything feels very distant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no. None that I recall, no. I… I haven’t had any major medical procedures. Nothing like that. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was… a very long time ago. I really don’t think that would be relevant, would it?
DOCTOR: It's important to have a complete history, Lilyanna. Now, family history. Is there anyone in your family with a history of neurological problems?
PATIENT: Oh… neurological problems? Hmm. That’s… a difficult question. I… I didn’t know my father very well. And my mother… she passed away when I was young. I don’t… I don’t recall anyone having… problems with their nerves, or anything like that. I truly don’t. I apologize. My family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical information, even before… everything. It’s terribly frustrating. Is that helpful? I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh. No, ma’am. I don’t drink. Never have. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I never cared for it. It… it makes me feel unwell. And I certainly don’t use any… other substances. I assure you. I apologize if that sounds… defensive. It’s just… I want to be perfectly clear.
DOCTOR: No alcohol, no substances… good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not currently. I haven’t needed anything, thankfully. Just… occasional ibuprofen for headaches, but I haven’t taken any in weeks. I… I prefer to avoid medication if possible. It always makes me feel… strange. And I don't really like relying on it, if I can help it. I apologize again for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your vital signs, your neurological function, and your balance. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Certainly. Just… give me a moment. My legs feel a little… weak. I apologize. I’ll try to be steady.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 118/72, pulse is 78, respiratory rate is 16. Normal. Now, let's check your reflexes. Okay, good. Now, let's do a Romberg test. Can you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and eyes closed for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Yes… I can try. Oh… Oh dear. This is… difficult. I don't think I can hold it for very long. It feels like I’m going to fall. I apologize. I’m… I’m a bit dizzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, sit down, sit down. That’s alright. A positive Romberg test. And that swaying… concerning. Now, let's check your gait. Can you walk a few steps for me, normally?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try. Oh… This is… difficult. I feel very unsteady. I am trying to be careful, but it's hard to… coordinate. I don’t like this. It feels… wrong. I apologize for being so… uncoordinated.
DOCTOR: Wide-based gait, unsteady… concerning. Okay. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 levels. I also want to schedule an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. And, given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I’m referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. I want to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI? A neurologist? Yes… I think so. It sounds… serious. Blood work… that’s alright, I suppose. But an MRI… and seeing a specialist… Is it something… bad? I… I don’t understand. Is this because of the unsteadiness? And the… fogginess? And the… everything? I apologize for being so… confused. I just… I don’t know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Lilyanna. It's about being thorough. The unsteadiness and fogginess could be caused by a number of things, and these tests will help us determine the underlying cause. It could be something relatively minor, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. The neurologist is a specialist in the brain and nervous system and will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, I want you to avoid driving, operating heavy machinery, and doing anything that could put you at risk of falling. I'll give you a prescription for some anti-nausea medication to help with the occasional nausea. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No driving… no machinery… That means… I can’t work. Oh dear. And… nausea medication. It sounds… overwhelming. Will… will I be able to go back to work? What if… what if it's something terrible? I… I don’t have anyone to… to help me with all of this. My husband… I… I understand you need to be thorough, but… I’m very frightened. Can you… can you explain it to me again? Slowly? And perhaps… what are some of the things you are looking for? I apologize for being such a… burden.
DOCTOR: You're not a burden, Lilyanna. It's perfectly normal to be frightened. And I'm happy to explain everything again, slowly. We're looking at a few possibilities. It could be a problem with your inner ear, which affects balance. It could be a vitamin deficiency, like B12. Or, less commonly, it could be something affecting your brain itself – a small stroke, or an early sign of dementia, although that’s less likely given your age. The MRI will help us rule out anything structural – any abnormalities in the brain. The neurologist will perform a more detailed neurological exam and can order additional tests if needed. The anti-nausea medication will just help with the occasional feeling of sickness, and it’s important to remember that we're just trying to gather information right now. We're not going to jump to any conclusions. I'll arrange the blood work and the MRI appointment for you. And I'll give you a referral to a neurologist. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A stroke… dementia… Oh dear. I… I understand you’re just trying to be thorough, but… it’s very frightening to hear. And… the neurologist. Is he… is he a good doctor? And… how long will it take to get the results of the tests? And… will I be able to work while I’m waiting? I… I rely on my job. And I don’t have much savings. I apologize for all the questions. It’s just… everything feels very unstable.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez is an excellent neurologist – highly recommended. He's very thorough and compassionate. As for the test results, the blood work should be back within a few days. The MRI will take a little longer, maybe a week or so, for the radiologist to interpret. As for working, it's difficult to say definitively right now. Given your symptoms and the potential risks, I strongly advise against operating heavy machinery until we have a diagnosis. It's just not safe. However, depending on the results of the tests, you may be able to return to work with some modifications. We'll discuss that with the neurologist. I’m going to write down Dr. Ramirez’s contact information for you. And I’ll also include the number for the lab where you can get the blood work done. I understand this is a lot to process, and I want to assure you that we'll support you every step of the way. Do you have anyone you can lean on while you're waiting for the results?
PATIENT: No… not really. My husband… he passed away six months ago. We didn’t have any children. And… I don't have any close family nearby. I used to have a friend, but… we lost touch after… everything. I’m… I’m mostly alone. I apologize for… for burdening you with this. It’s just… I don’t know what to do. I used to be so strong… so independent. And now… I feel like I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: You are not burdening me. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I'm glad you did. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed and alone right now. It’s not a sign of weakness to ask for help. I know I'm a doctor, but I’m also a human being, and I can see that you're going through a lot. I want you to know that there are resources available to help you cope with your grief and loneliness. I can provide you with some information on local support groups and grief counseling services. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That would be… very helpful. Anything… anything at all. I just… I don’t know where to start. It feels like my whole life has been… turned upside down. And now… this unsteadiness… and the… fogginess… It’s like I’m losing myself. I… I just want to feel normal again. Thank you. Thank you for being so… kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilyanna. That's what I'm here for. Here. This list includes a few different organizations that offer a range of services, including individual counseling, group therapy, and peer support groups. You can call them and see which one feels like the best fit for you. And don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns. I’m also writing you a temporary disability form to give to your employer. It will allow you some time to rest and focus on getting the tests done. Remember, you're not alone in this. We'll figure this out together. Now, do you feel well enough to walk to the front desk, or would you like me to call someone for you?
PATIENT: I… I think I can walk. Slowly, but… yes. I don’t want to be a bother. Thank you… again. For everything. You’ve been… a lifeline. I… I don't know what I would have done without you. Let’s… let’s go to the front desk. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Lilyanna. Take your time. And remember, if you feel unsteady at any point, please let me know. She'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the test results. You take care now. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. It was good meeting you, Lilyanna. We’ll get through this together. .
