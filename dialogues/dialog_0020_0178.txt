DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…call me Gerardo, please. I got this cough, been hangin’ on for a while now. And I’m just…tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection every other month, too. It’s gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay, Gerardo. A cough, persistent tiredness, and frequent sinus infections… I understand. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, about this cough – how long has it been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's gotta be… six, maybe eight months now? Started kinda mild, just a tickle in my throat. Now it’s… well, it produces a lot of phlegm. Sorry to be graphic, but that's what it is. It just won’t quit. And it’s worse in the mornings, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight months, more phlegm recently, worse in the mornings… That gives us a starting point. Is the phlegm any particular color?
PATIENT: Usually, it's clear-ish. Sometimes a little white. But when I get one of those sinus infections… then it turns kinda yellow, or even greenish. That’s when I really feel awful. It doesn’t happen every time I cough, just when the sinuses act up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Clear or white normally, yellow or green with sinus infections... And you mentioned feeling tired all the time. Can you describe that tiredness?
PATIENT: It's just… draggin'. Like I haven't slept in days, even when I have. Can’t really get motivated to do much. Used to enjoy workin’ on things around the house, now I just… sit. Doesn’t feel like I got the energy for it. It’s just wearin’ me down. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, wanting to get back to your normal self. Now, about these sinus infections – how often would you say you're getting them?
PATIENT: Like I said, every other month or so. Sometimes it’s three months between, but mostly it’s not long. Feels like I just get over one and another one starts up. I try to tough it out, but they knock me flat. Stuffed up, headache… the usual. I take some over-the-counter stuff for it, but it doesn’t always help much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent sinus infections, every other month or so, and over-the-counter medications aren’t consistently helpful. Do you have any fever, chills, or night sweats with these sinus infections, or with the cough?
PATIENT: Not really fever, no. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but nothing I’d call a fever. No chills, either. The night sweats… well, I sweat a lot in general, but nothin’ unusual, I don’t think. I work kinda hard sometimes, so I figured it was just that. Definitely no shivers or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or unusual night sweats. Now, let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – like asthma, COPD, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ like that. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, mostly. Had the usual childhood stuff – measles, chickenpox – but nothin’ serious. I haven’t been to the doctor much over the years. Just when somethin' really bothers me, like this cough. I mostly just try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No major medical history. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. Never had the need for ‘em. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but they just put it in a cast. That’s about it. I’m tellin’ ya, I’m usually a pretty healthy guy. This cough is really throwin’ me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm... My mom, she had high blood pressure when she got older. And my dad, he had some heart trouble. But neither of ‘em had any lung problems, not that I know of. I don’t really talk about health stuff much with my family, if I’m honest. It’s just not something we do. Mostly just keep to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Okay. Some family history of heart and blood pressure issues. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter stuff regularly?
PATIENT: Just what I said before, the stuff for the sinus infections when I get ‘em. Decongestants, that kinda thing. And sometimes I take some ibuprofen for headaches. But that’s it. I try to avoid takin’ pills whenever I can, to be honest. I just don’t like feelin’ reliant on ‘em.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen and decongestants as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I’ve eaten all sorts of stuff over the years, and taken plenty of different medicines when I needed to. Never had a problem. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to nothin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Alright, Mr. Pithan. I think I have a good starting point now. To get a better idea of what’s going on with your cough and tiredness, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your sinuses. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s goin’ on with me, and get back to feelin’ normal. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. If you could please sit up there for me. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Please take a few deep breaths in and out through your mouth. I'm hearing some…wheezing in your lower lobes, both sides. And there's some diminished breath sounds as well. I'll also check your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. No murmurs or anything concerning. Now, I’ll gently palpate your sinuses. There's some tenderness to the front of your sinuses, particularly over your forehead. Okay. So, there's some wheezing and diminished breath sounds, tenderness in your sinuses, and a faintly audible heartbeat. Those findings could point to a few different things.
PATIENT: Wheezin’, huh? That don’t sound good. Never heard that before. So what does that mean? Is it…serious? I'm kinda worried now. I just want this cough to go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry. Wheezing means there's some narrowing in your airways, making it harder for air to get in and out. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but we need to figure out why it’s happening. The tenderness in your sinuses suggests there’s some inflammation there, too. Given your history of frequent sinus infections and this persistent cough, it could be a few things. It could be chronic bronchitis, asthma that's developed later in life, or a recurring sinus infection that’s affecting your lungs. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us see if there's any inflammation or infection in your lungs. The blood work will check for infection and other possible causes of your symptoms. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Alright. Sounds like a plan. Whatever it takes to figure it out. Yeah, I’m okay with that. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have a whole lot of extra money.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. The X-ray should be able to be done today, and the blood work can be done at the clinic before you leave. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Regarding the cost, I'll have the billing department check your insurance coverage and give you an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options with you if needed. I don't have the exact figures here, but they'll be able to provide you with that information. We will work with you to find a way to manage the costs. In the meantime, I can prescribe you an inhaler to help with the wheezing and shortness of breath. It's a bronchodilator, which means it opens up your airways. It can provide some temporary relief while we wait for the test results. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: An inhaler sounds good. If it’ll help me breathe a little easier, yeah, I’ll take it. I'm just tired of coughin’ all the time. And tired of feelin’ so… drained. I appreciate you workin' with me on the costs, too. It’s been a tough year. .
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm sending that to the pharmacy now. They should have it ready for you shortly. Alright, so we have an inhaler prescription sent to the pharmacy, orders for a chest X-ray and blood work, and we'll get you an estimate of the costs from the billing department. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood before you leave. Once we get the results back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
