DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, good to see you. Or, well, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… my water. I have trouble, you see. It doesn’t… come out easy. Like it’s stuck. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a couple weeks. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “trouble with your water,” right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Trouble… emptying. Is that how to say it? I don’t know all the fancy words, Doctor. Just… doesn’t come out like it used to.
DOCTOR: Right, emptying. Okay. And you said a couple weeks now?
PATIENT: Yes. Maybe a little longer, truth be told. Hard to keep track when… well, when you’re thinking about other things. It wasn’t sudden, not like a switch flipped. Just… got harder and harder. And now it’s… a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset. And when you do go, is it a complete emptying, or do you feel like you still have some left?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. No, not complete. I always feel like there's… something still in there. Even after I try and try. It’s… frustrating. And a little worrying, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, incomplete emptying, feeling of retention. Any pain or burning when you try to go?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's not burning, no. More like… a pressure. A fullness. And it’s uncomfortable, like I said. Not sharp pain, just… a heavy feeling. It makes me have to… push. And I don’t like pushing.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure, fullness, needing to strain. Alright. Now, are you having any trouble starting the stream, or is it just difficult to empty completely once you get going?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. It starts okay, usually. It’s not like I can’t start it, no. But it’s weak. Like a slow trickle, not a strong flow. And that’s when I have to try and… help it along, you see? That’s when the pushing comes in.
DOCTOR: Okay, weak stream, then incomplete emptying requiring straining. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. I haven’t been looking at it that closely, Doctor. Sorry. It looks… normal, I suppose. The color seems alright. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of tea, so… I don’t know if that matters. Is it supposed to look a certain way?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Hilber. It’s good you're being honest. Darker urine can be from the tea, yes. But sometimes it can indicate dehydration or other things. Have you been drinking your usual amount of fluids?
PATIENT: I try to, yes. I drink a lot of tea, like I said, and some water. Maybe not as much water as I should, if I’m honest. My wife… she always reminded me to drink more water. It’s harder now, without her. Sorry, I didn’t mean to… get sad.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize. It's alright to talk about it. Losing someone is… difficult. And it can affect everything. Okay, so potentially a bit less fluid intake than usual. Now, let’s talk about your medical history… Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I’ve always been a healthy man, mostly. Had the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. My heart’s been good, the doctor always said. I have Medicare, if that helps. I don’t take any pills regularly. Just… a little something for my knees sometimes, when the weather’s bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, Medicare, occasional something for the knees. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was fishing. But that’s it, I think. Nothing else. No other surgeries.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, broken arm. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Never had one. I can eat anything, take most things. My wife always said I had an iron stomach! She used to tease me about it. Sorry… getting a little sad again.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright, Mr. Hilber. Don’t apologize. It’s understandable. No allergies, that’s good. And finally, any family history of medical problems – heart disease, diabetes, prostate issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a tough one. My father, he had a weak heart later in life. He wasn't very healthy towards the end. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don't really remember much about her health. No one really talked about it. My brother… he was healthy too, as far as I know. No one ever mentioned prostate problems. We didn’t talk much about… those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with heart problems, otherwise no significant family history known. Alright. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll just check your abdomen, and I’ll also do a digital rectal exam, which will help me check your prostate. Is that okay?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? You mean… I’ve never had one of those before. What will you be… looking for, exactly? Is it… necessary?
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of a prostate exam, Mr. Hilber, and yes, it’s necessary to help figure out what’s going on. It allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate. It can help determine if it’s enlarged, if there are any lumps or tenderness. I understand it can be uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. It will only take a few moments. We’ll also listen to your abdomen, and check your general health. Would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: Well… it doesn't sound very pleasant, Doctor. But if you say it's necessary… alright. I suppose I trust you. Just… be gentle, like you said. And tell me what you're doing, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hilber. I will explain everything as I go. And I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope.
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. This is… a little embarrassing, if I’m honest. But I want to figure out what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds normal on that front. Now, I’m going to need you to bend your knees and relax. I’ll let you know when I’m starting the rectal exam. It will only take a moment. And I’ll explain what I’m feeling as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… hurry, if you can. And tell me what you’re doing, like you promised. I’m… ready, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber. Everything is done. I did feel some enlargement of the prostate, and it felt slightly firm. It wasn't particularly painful to the touch, but it is definitely enlarged. This is consistent with what you’ve been describing. It’s likely you have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH – an enlarged prostate. It’s very common as men get older. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it can cause the symptoms you’re experiencing. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Enlarged prostate… Is that… bad? Is it cancer? My wife… she always worried about cancer. What does “benign” mean? And what can we do about it? I don't want to have to strain forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address all those questions. "Benign" means it's not cancer. It's a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate. It's very common, and in most cases, it's not life-threatening. However, it can cause uncomfortable symptoms, like difficulty urinating, frequent urination, and straining. As for what we can do about it, there are several options. We can start with lifestyle changes – drinking more fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and regular exercise. We can also try medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve your urine flow. In some cases, surgery may be necessary, but that's usually a last resort. I'd like to order a urine test to rule out any infection and check your kidney function. I'd also like to order a PSA test – that's a blood test that can help us assess your risk of prostate cancer. We need to rule that out, just to be safe. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: So… it's not cancer, that's good. But it could be? The test will tell us. And we can try pills first. That sounds… okay. What does the urine test involve? And is the PSA test painful? My wife… she hated needles.
DOCTOR: The urine test is very simple, Mr. Hilber. You'll just be asked to provide a small sample of urine in a cup. It's painless and doesn't take long at all. The PSA test is a blood test, so it will involve a needle prick in your arm. It's a quick prick, and most people don't find it very painful. It's similar to getting a blood test for anything else. If you're worried about it, just let the nurse know, and they can take extra care to make you comfortable. I'll write you a request for both tests now. The nurse will schedule you for them. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of fluids and avoid caffeine and alcohol. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Tests, fluids, avoid caffeine… I can do that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… a relief to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. And thank you for being gentle. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. It’s my job to explain things and make you feel comfortable. And don’t worry, we’ll take things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to review the test requests and schedule your appointment. If you have any questions before she gets here, please don’t hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just the tests, and then wait for the results. Thank you again. I guess… I’ll see you in a few days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. We'll see you soon. Take care of yourself, and remember to drink plenty of fluids. .
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. Goodbye. .
