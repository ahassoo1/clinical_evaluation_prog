DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. I'm Dr. Billman. So, Mrs. Sciarotta, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Billman. I need to get a card… a medical card for driving, I think? For ride-sharing. You know, like Uber or a taxi. I’m 70 now and they want to make sure I’m still… capable. It’s a bit of a hassle, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. A medical card for ride-sharing… so they need a physician to sign off on your ability to drive safely. I see. Well, it's good they're being cautious. Lots of responsibility comes with that kind of work. Okay, so this isn’t necessarily about you feeling unwell, it’s about meeting requirements for a company. Just want to clarify that upfront. Now, let’s go through a quick check-up. Tell me, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My vision… it’s not great, you know, getting older. But it hasn’t gotten any worse lately. I wear glasses, have for years. And I get them checked regularly by my eye doctor. Dr. Nakamura, over on Elm Street. I went last November, I think. Everything was stable then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Dr. Nakamura… I see his notes here. Last exam November 12th, stable correction. That’s helpful. Still, I need to do a brief vision screening myself, just to confirm. And it's not just about seeing well, it’s about peripheral vision and depth perception too, things we need to check in the office. Now, aside from your vision, have you noticed any changes in your memory, reflexes, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, memory… well, who doesn’t forget things at my age? But no, nothing major. I remember things perfectly well, actually. Dates, names, everything. I just… sometimes take a bit longer to recall things. But it doesn’t affect my driving, I assure you. As for reflexes… I haven’t been doing acrobatics lately, if that’s what you mean. I haven’t had any accidents, either. Not in years.
DOCTOR: Right. Accidents… good. That’s important. Look, Mrs. Sciarotta, I appreciate you telling me all this, but we still need to go through a basic physical exam to assess your overall fitness for driving, and especially for the demands of ride-sharing. It's not just about whether you think you’re capable; it’s about documenting a certain level of function. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then, I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your range of motion, and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. I understand. It’s just… a lot of fuss over nothing, really. But if you need to check, go ahead. I suppose it’s better to be safe. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have a gardening club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get started then. Have a seat on the table, please. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 85… a little elevated, but not terribly concerning. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Alright… deep breath. I used to smoke, you know. Years ago. Quit about fifteen years ago, though. Doctor told me to, of course. Best thing I ever did. Is that okay? Am I doing it right?
DOCTOR: Okay, good, you quit smoking. That’s excellent. I do hear a little bit of diminished breath sound on both sides, which is not uncommon in former smokers, or even just with age. Nothing alarming at this point, but we'll note it. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Can you cross your legs like this?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a bit stiff, you know, getting older. Arthritis in my knees. Not terrible, but it makes things… less graceful. Go ahead. I'm ready. Don't expect miracles, though.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your reflexes are… a little diminished, but symmetrical. That’s… acceptable. It correlates with your age and arthritis, as you mentioned. Now, I’m going to ask you to do a few simple coordination tests. Can you touch your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Alright. Finger to the nose… Oh, dear. A little off. It's harder than it looks! See? Not as nimble as I used to be. But I can still drive perfectly fine. Honestly. There. Better this time, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, a little better on the second try. Look, Mrs. Sciarotta, I understand you feel confident in your driving abilities, and I appreciate that. But these tests are not about your personal opinion; they are about establishing a baseline for safety, especially given the responsibility of transporting passengers. Given the slightly diminished reflexes, the reduced lung sounds, and the mild difficulty with coordination, I'm a little hesitant to sign off on the card without a bit more information. I'd like to order a basic neurological evaluation, just to rule out any underlying issues. It’s a simple test, mostly looking at balance and cognitive function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A neurological evaluation? Really? It sounds… excessive. It's just a driving card, Doctor. I've been driving for fifty years without a single accident! I don't understand why this is so complicated. Is it absolutely necessary? It’s going to take up a whole afternoon, you know. And I really do have that gardening club meeting… Is there… anything else I can do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Sciarotta, I understand your frustration. It is a hassle, and I apologize for that. However, given your age and the requirements of transporting passengers, I have a professional obligation to ensure a certain level of safety. I'm not trying to be difficult, but if something were to happen, and you hadn’t undergone a proper evaluation, it could create a very serious situation. There is… one alternative. We could contact Dr. Nakamura, your eye doctor. If he's willing to provide a detailed report confirming your current vision stability and peripheral vision, that would cover one aspect. But I still strongly recommend the neurological evaluation. It's a relatively quick test, and it would provide peace of mind for both of us. Perhaps you could schedule it for next week?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. All this trouble… Alright. Fine. Contact Dr. Nakamura. He's usually very accommodating. And… and I'll schedule the neurological evaluation, too. Next week. But please, try to get me in as soon as possible. I really don't want this to drag on forever. Do you… do you think there's any chance I can get the card eventually? I really need it to help with… well, to keep busy, you know? It's important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Sciarotta, I do. I believe that, with a comprehensive evaluation, we can likely get you approved. I'm not trying to deny you the card, I just want to make sure everything is safe and responsible. I’ll contact Dr. Nakamura immediately. My nurse will schedule the neurological evaluation for you before you leave. She’ll find the closest facility with availability. In the meantime, please continue driving as you normally do, but be mindful of any changes you might experience. If you notice anything different – even something small – please let me know right away. Now, do you have any other medical concerns I should be aware of today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. That does ease my mind. No, nothing else, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old. My arthritis flares up sometimes, but I manage with over-the-counter medication. And… well, I do have a little trouble sleeping, but that’s nothing new either. I think that’s all. I appreciate you taking the time, despite all this fuss. And thank you for being… understanding. I really do need that card.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sciarotta. I understand. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. My nurse will be right with you to schedule those tests. Drive safely, and I hope you enjoy your gardening club meeting. .
