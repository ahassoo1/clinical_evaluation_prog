DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's about my… well, it’s my stool. It's black. Been happenin’ a bit. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been on ‘em for years. Honestly, I don't have time for a lot of fuss, Doctor. Just want to know if it's serious.
DOCTOR: I see. Black stool, and you’ve noticed this occurring while taking pain medication for your arthritis. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Hatchard. It's good you've been consistent with your medications – that’s very helpful. To clarify, when did you first notice the black stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. I don't sit around inspecting my… output, Doctor. I have things to do. Is it the pills? That's what I want to know. They’re supposed to help me garden, not… whatever this is.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Hatchard. You’re busy, and it's perfectly reasonable not to be meticulously observing stool changes. A few weeks is helpful to know. It is possible the pain medication could be contributing to this. Some medications can cause changes in stool color. However, black stool can also indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract, so we need to investigate further to be certain. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the consistency of the stool when it’s black?
PATIENT: Consistency? What do you mean, consistency? It's… poop. It's solid, usually. Sometimes a little softer, depends what I ate. Look, I eat normal food. Vegetables, meat… occasionally a biscuit with gravy. I'm not living on air, Doctor! Are you suggesting I’m dying or something? Because I have tomatoes to can.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Ms. Hatchard. I apologize if my questions seem tedious. I simply need to gather enough information to determine the cause of the black stool. "Solid, usually, sometimes a little softer" is very helpful, thank you. Now, have you noticed any other changes accompanying this – any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weakness?
PATIENT: No. No pain. Maybe a little heartburn now and then, but I’m an old woman, Doctor. Things ache. No vomiting. I haven’t felt weak, except when my grandson tries to "help" me in the garden. And no, I haven’t been feelin’ nauseous, if that's what you’re gettin’ at. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine, except for this… stool issue. Can we just get a pill to fix it? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. It’s good to hear you’re not experiencing pain, nausea, or vomiting. The absence of those symptoms is reassuring. To rule out any serious underlying cause, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, focusing on your abdomen, and order a simple stool test to check for blood. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A test? Really? For a bit of black poop? Look, I’ve lived a long life. I’ve had worse things than this. But… fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Just don’t poke me too hard. And make it quick. I have a schedule, you know. Tomatoes aren’t gonna can themselves.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Hatchard. I will be as gentle as possible. If you’ll please lie down on the table, we’ll start with listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then a quick palpation. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Abdomen: Soft, non-tender to palpation. Bowel sounds normoactive in all four quadrants. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Now, could you please tell me about any other medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, I take a few things. Besides the red pain pills – Naproxen, that's what they're called - I take a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think. And sometimes, when my joints are really bad, I take Tylenol. Just the regular kind. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to take that last winter. That's it. I’m not a complicated case, Doctor. Just a bit of black… you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Hatchard. That’s very helpful. Naproxen, Lisinopril, occasional Tylenol, and Vitamin D – I've documented that. Given your history of taking Naproxen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, it is possible that this is contributing to the black stool, as these medications can sometimes cause minor gastrointestinal bleeding. However, to be absolutely certain and rule out any other potential causes, I would still like to proceed with the stool test. Would you be able to collect a small sample for me before you leave today?
PATIENT: Another sample? Honestly, Doctor, you're determined to make a fuss over this. Fine. Whatever you say. Just tell me how to do it and let me get out of here. The sooner I get this over with, the sooner I can get back to my tomatoes. Is there a special container or something? I don’t carry around little buckets, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard, and I apologize for the inconvenience. There is a collection kit in the restroom, with a disposable container and instructions. It’s a small sample, just a couple of tablespoons will suffice. I will also provide you with a written instruction sheet. Once you’ve collected the sample, please leave it with the receptionist before you leave, and we will send it to the lab for analysis. The results typically take 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your medications as prescribed. If you experience any abdominal pain, weakness, dizziness, or see any bright red blood in your stool, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me the container. And I'd like a note saying what to do if it's serious. So I know what to look for. And honestly, Doctor, please don’t fuss over this too much. I’m an old woman. Things happen. Now, where’s that restroom?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hatchard. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. Please don’t hesitate to ask the receptionist if you need any assistance. I will be sure to review the results as soon as they become available and contact you with the findings. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. .
