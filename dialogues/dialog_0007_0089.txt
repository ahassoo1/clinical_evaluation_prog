DOCTOR: Hi Alese, welcome. I’m Dr. Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Hernandez. It is nice to meet you as well. Um... well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it's quite severe. Honestly, I’ve been having these episodes for a little while now, and I thought it was finally time to get it checked out. I apologize if I seem a bit vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all about being vague – we'll get to the bottom of this together. “Down low in the abdomen,” and it comes and goes with “severe” pain... that gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about when these episodes happen?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s a tricky one. It doesn't seem to be tied to anything specific, truly. Not food, not activity... sometimes it happens in the morning, sometimes at night. I think it might be worse when I'm stressed, but that’s just a feeling, you understand? It's all rather… unpredictable. I do recall one particularly bad episode after a rather long journey, but again, I can’t say for certain that was the cause.
DOCTOR: Okay, unpredictable, possibly related to stress, and one episode after a long journey. That's helpful. And how long do these episodes typically last when they do happen?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... They vary quite a bit, actually. Sometimes just a few hours, a dull ache that comes and goes. Other times... well, a day or two. Once, I believe it lasted almost a week, and that was very unpleasant. It’s difficult to be precise, Doctor. I try to keep track, but… things slip my mind, you see. I hope that isn't too frustrating.
DOCTOR: No, not at all frustrating, Alese. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a bit hazy, and we'll work with what you can recall. So, pain lasting from a few hours to potentially a week… Is the pain constant during those longer episodes, or does it come and go even within an episode?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It definitely comes and goes within the episodes, especially the longer ones. It's not a steady, constant ache, thankfully. It'll be quite intense for a bit, then subside to a duller discomfort, then flare up again. It's a bit like waves, I suppose… rising and falling. Sometimes with cramping, too. Though, again, that isn’t every time. I apologize for being so imprecise; I wish I could give you a clearer picture.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all. “Waves” and cramping – that helps me visualize things better. Have you noticed anything that seems to relieve the pain, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Relief… hmm. Warm baths sometimes help a little. Just the warmth, I think. And lying down, being still. Not much seems to make it completely go away, but those things offer a bit of comfort, if only for a short time. Honestly, sometimes just distracting myself works best. Reading, or a quiet conversation. Anything to take my mind off it. I haven’t tried any medications specifically for this pain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm baths, rest, and distraction offer some relief. Good to know. Now, let’s talk about other things going on. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Well... now that is a question. Um... yes, actually. A little bit. I’ve been… constipated, more often than usual. It’s not severe, but definitely noticeable. And sometimes… sometimes it's the opposite, if you understand what I mean. Rather unpredictable, really. It seems to coincide with these pain episodes, but I can’t say for certain if there’s a connection. It’s all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating bowel habits – constipation and diarrhea – coinciding with the pain. That's significant. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, thankfully, no blood. Not that I've noticed, at least. And no... no black, tarry stools either. I would certainly remember that, wouldn't I? That sounds rather unpleasant, to be perfectly honest. Everything else… just the constipation and diarrhea, as I mentioned. I do apologize for going into such detail; I don’t mean to be… difficult.
DOCTOR: No, please, don't apologize. It's important information. And you're not being difficult at all. Okay, no blood in the stool. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I have been feeling a bit nauseous occasionally, especially when the pain is particularly bad. Not enough to actually vomit, thankfully. And… yes, my appetite has been a bit off. I’m not as hungry as usual, and sometimes I just don't feel like eating at all. It's not a major change, but I've noticed it. It all feels… connected, somehow, but I'm not a doctor, you see. I just know that something isn't quite right.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional nausea with severe pain, and decreased appetite. Now, I’m going to ask you about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… The most significant thing is… Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. SLE, I believe it’s called. I was diagnosed many years ago, though it’s been relatively well-managed… usually. That's why I'm under a specialist’s care for that. And… I believe I’ve had some issues with my kidneys in the past, related to the Lupus, perhaps. But I’m not entirely certain. My memory… It’s a bit of a jumble, you see. I do take medication for the Lupus, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, SLE and a history of kidney issues related to the Lupus, which you're managing with medication. That is very important information. Do you recall the name of the medication you're taking for the Lupus?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It begins with an ‘M’… Methotrexate, I believe. And… sometimes Plaquenil as well. Yes, those are the two I usually take. Though, the dosage changes from time to time, depending on how I’m feeling. And I see a rheumatologist regularly for that, of course. He’s the one who manages all of that. I apologize for being so vague. It's all rather complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, Methotrexate and Plaquenil for SLE, managed by your rheumatologist. Thank you for that information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. A few, actually. I had my appendix removed many years ago, when I was quite young. And… I believe I had a hysterectomy as well, some time ago. And… I've had a few procedures done on my kidneys over the years, related to the Lupus, I think. But I can’t recall the specifics, unfortunately. It was a long time ago, and my memory… well, you know. They were all relatively minor procedures, I believe. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, hysterectomy, and kidney procedures related to your SLE. Now, let's talk about your family history. Is there a history of any significant medical conditions in your family – things like colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? And my aunt… on my father's side… she had some sort of autoimmune condition, though I don't recall exactly what it was. It wasn’t Lupus, I’m fairly certain. Nothing else comes to mind immediately, I’m afraid. My family wasn’t particularly forthcoming with medical details, you see. It wasn't really discussed. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of arthritis in your mother and an unspecified autoimmune condition in an aunt. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I've always been very careful about my health, you see. Especially given my Lupus. It's important to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... I'm allergic to penicillin, yes. That's the only medication allergy I know of. And… I'm mildly allergic to dust, I believe. It doesn't cause any major problems, just a little bit of sneezing and a runny nose. Nothing serious. That's all I can recall at the moment. I apologize if I’m forgetting something. My memory… well, you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy and a mild dust allergy. Thank you, Alese. That's a very thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely. Let me know if there's anything I can do to make it easier for you.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Please let me know if anything feels painful. Okay, heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Where exactly are you feeling the pain today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s right here, Doctor. Mostly on this side, but it sometimes radiates around to my back. And it’s… difficult to describe. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, and a cramping sensation. It’s more pronounced when I press here. Please be gentle, if you don't mind. It’s quite sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some mild tenderness in that area, especially when I press. No significant masses or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your bowel sounds are normal. I’m also going to check your pulses in your feet. Pulses are strong and equal. Given your history of SLE and the tenderness in your left lower quadrant, I’m concerned about a possible flare-up of your SLE affecting your bowel, or possibly a diverticulitis. To help rule out diverticulitis, I'd like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan… That sounds… rather involved. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I’ve had quite a bit of imaging done over the years, you see. I’m a little concerned about the radiation. And... truthfully, the thought of another medical procedure is a bit daunting. But… if you think it’s important, I trust your judgment. What exactly are we looking for with the scan? And… would there be any alternative tests we could consider?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Alese. You’re right to ask about alternatives and radiation exposure. We're looking for signs of inflammation in your bowel, or possibly diverticulitis – small pouches in the bowel wall that can become infected. Alternatives would be a stool test to rule out infection, and a blood test to check for inflammation, but those wouldn’t give us as clear of a picture as a CT scan. A CT scan is the gold standard for diagnosing diverticulitis. We can use a low-dose CT scan, which minimizes radiation exposure, and we’ll only do it if absolutely necessary. It’s important to rule out something serious. Given your symptoms and your history, I do think it’s worthwhile. But we can certainly discuss it further and, if you’re truly uncomfortable, we can explore other options. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, a low-dose scan… that does sound a bit better. And you’re right, ruling out something serious is important. I suppose… if it’s the most accurate way to get a diagnosis, and it minimizes the radiation… then I’m willing to proceed. But please, let me know if there are any risks involved, or anything I should be aware of beforehand. And… would there be a long wait for the results? I do worry about waiting and not knowing. I do appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good decision, Alese. A low-dose CT scan uses significantly less radiation than a standard scan. The main risk is the small amount of radiation exposure, which is generally outweighed by the benefits of getting an accurate diagnosis. You’ll need to drink a special liquid beforehand, a contrast dye, to help us see the details of your bowel. It can cause some diarrhea, but it’s usually mild. The results typically come back within a few hours, and I’ll review them with you as soon as they’re available. I will also order some blood work to check your inflammation markers and rule out other potential causes. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating a bland diet. If you experience any severe pain, fever, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that all sounds manageable. Bland diet and plenty of fluids, yes. I can do that. And I'll be sure to go to the ER if anything gets worse. Um... yes, one question. If it is diverticulitis, what does that mean? What's the treatment? And… is it something I’ll have to live with? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. It's just… I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and you’re right to want to be prepared. Diverticulitis means that small pouches in the wall of your colon have become inflamed or infected. Treatment usually involves antibiotics, a liquid diet to rest your bowel, and pain medication. In some cases, if the infection is severe, you may need to be hospitalized. Whether you’ll have to "live with" it depends on the severity of the infection. Sometimes it’s a one-time occurrence, and sometimes it can recur. We’ll manage it with diet – high fiber is important – and potentially medication to prevent future flare-ups. I'll explain everything in more detail once we have the results of the CT scan. We'll take it one step at a time, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, one step at a time sounds perfect. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and I truly appreciate your thorough explanations. I feel much better knowing what to expect. Let’s proceed with the scan, then. When would I need to come in?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We'll get the order for the CT scan in right away, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a day or two to get in. They will give you instructions on how to prepare for the scan, including when to stop eating and drinking. While we're waiting for the scan, I will also write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your discomfort. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time, Alese?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. The pain reliever is greatly appreciated. And thank you again for everything. You've really put my mind at ease. I will wait to hear from the radiology department, then. I appreciate your time and expertise. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re very welcome, Alese. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before the scan. I'll be sure to review the results with you as soon as they’re available. Take care, and have a good day as well.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
