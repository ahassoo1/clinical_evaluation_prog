DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Yackey. It is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. But, I have been having… a lot of gas. More than usual. It started, oh, maybe a week ago? It’s just… excessive. It makes me feel quite uncomfortable, and… well, it is disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes. Well, many things can cause that, Mr. Goodstein. A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately one week. It isn't constant, you understand. More frequent after I eat. Especially… beans, perhaps. Though I have also noticed it with cabbage. Do you think that is… normal? I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Mr. Goodstein. Your diet… beans and cabbage, naturally. And you say “mostly” healthy?
PATIENT: Yes, “mostly.” I do enjoy a… sausage now and then. And maybe some pastries. Not every day, of course! But… I do not have a lot of exercise. I work at the diner, you see. Counter work. A lot of standing, but… not much moving around. Is that relevant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Counter work… standing, limited movement. Relevant, potentially. And the pastries and sausage… how often would you say you partake in those, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. The sausage, maybe… twice a week? Perhaps three times if it is a particularly cold day. The pastries… maybe four times a week? Small ones, usually. A cream-filled donut, or a little… strudel. I do enjoy my strudel, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, with all due respect, it sounds as though your diet may be contributing to your… discomfort. But let’s rule out anything more serious. Do you have any abdominal pain alongside the gas?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… a very fair point. I suppose I do enjoy my food a bit too much. As for pain… not really pain, exactly. More of a… cramping sensation, sometimes. Mostly after the… incidents. And a little bloating. But not sharp pain, you understand. More like… a fullness.
DOCTOR: Cramping after the… incidents, you say. And bloating. Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No nausea, and definitely no vomiting. My… bowel habits have been fairly regular. Perhaps a little… slower, now that I mention it. But nothing drastic, you understand. Just… not as prompt as usual. I am sorry to be so… detailed.
DOCTOR: Details are… necessary, Mr. Goodstein. Now, any family history of gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. My mother… she always had a sensitive stomach, I believe. A lot of… indigestion. And my grandfather, on my father’s side… he had something with his bowels, I think. But I am not certain what. He did not speak much English, and my father did not discuss it often. It was… uncomfortable for him to talk about, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Sensitive stomach in your mother, issues with your grandfather. Vague, but noted. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I am aware of. I have never had a… reaction to anything. I can eat most things, thankfully. Though I do prefer things with a lot of… flavor.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take anything regularly. I might take something for a headache, occasionally. But that is all. I prefer not to take pills, if I can avoid it. I believe in letting my body… handle things on its own, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you think that is best. I trust your judgment. I do hope it won’t be too… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Bowel sounds are… present, albeit a bit… hyperactive. Not particularly concerning at this stage. Palpating your abdomen… some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, but no guarding or rigidity. No masses palpable. Now, I would like to check your reflexes. Please extend your legs.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. I hope I am not too stiff. I have been standing a lot lately, you see.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… normal. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to need a stool sample. The nurse will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary examination, it appears you are likely experiencing functional dyspepsia—essentially, indigestion, possibly exacerbated by your diet and lifestyle.
PATIENT: "Functional… what, Doctor?" And a… stool sample? Oh dear. Is that truly necessary? I do hope it is not too… unpleasant. And will it take very long to… analyze?
DOCTOR: Dyspepsia is a medical term for indigestion, Mr. Goodstein. As for the stool sample, it’s a standard procedure to rule out any underlying infections or parasites. It's… routine. The lab will analyze it for any abnormalities. It shouldn’t be overly unpleasant, and it usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, I recommend a diet lower in processed foods, beans, cabbage, and—frankly—pastries. And perhaps some light exercise, if you can manage it. We'll discuss further options once we have the stool sample results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Less beans, less cabbage, less… strudel. And more walking, perhaps. It sounds… sensible. Though I confess, it will be a challenge. But I am willing to try, if it will alleviate this… discomfort. And the stool sample… the nurse will explain everything, I presume?
DOCTOR: The nurse will provide you with all the necessary instructions. I’m going to write you a prescription for an over-the-counter antacid. It may help with the bloating and discomfort. And please, follow up with me once you have the stool sample results. Do you have any further questions for me at this time, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your time and patience. And for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help. And I will certainly endeavor to reduce my intake of… tempting pastries.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you now for the stool sample kit and instructions. Have a good day, Mr. Goodstein. And please, try to make some healthier choices. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I shall do my best. Good day to you as well.
