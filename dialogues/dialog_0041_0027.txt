DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s this…stuff. Comes up. Acid, I guess. Especially after I eat. It’s…unpleasant. Been happening for a few weeks now, maybe longer, I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuff coming up,” especially after eating… and it’s been going on for a few weeks. Right. It sounds… uncomfortable. When you say “stuff,” could you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Well, what does it look like? It’s…food, mostly. Undigested food. And…well, it burns. Like heartburn, but…worse. It comes right up, sometimes before I even finish chewing. Honestly, it’s embarrassing. I eat a good, solid Polish meal, you know? Kielbasa, pierogi…not rabbit food. And then this happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, undigested food coming up, burning sensation… worse than typical heartburn, and it happens relatively soon after eating, even during chewing sometimes. And it’s connected to eating heavier meals, like your Polish food. Do you feel any pain in your chest along with the burning?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. It’s more…a fiery discomfort. Like someone lit a little match in my throat. It doesn't hurt hurt, if that makes sense. Just…aggravating. And the taste…awful. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth all day. I brush my teeth, but it lingers.
DOCTOR: Right, fiery discomfort, not sharp pain… and a lingering bad taste even after brushing. Okay. Do you have any trouble swallowing, generally?
PATIENT: Trouble swallowing? No. Not usually. I can eat a whole plate of golabki just fine. It's after the eating that's the problem. This isn’t like…choking or anything. Just…the reverse process, if you catch my drift. Honestly, it’s a waste of good food.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, no difficulty swallowing solids normally, just this reflux happening after meals. Have you noticed if it happens more often when you lie down, or bend over after eating?
PATIENT: Lie down? Now that you mention it…yes. Definitely worse if I try to take a nap right after dinner. My wife, bless her heart, always tells me I shouldn't, but sometimes I just…doze off. And then bam. It’s all coming up. Bending over, not so much. I do enough bending over at the garden, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's definitely worse when lying down after eating. That’s helpful. Now, have you tried anything to help it?
PATIENT: Anything? Well, I take a little antacid sometimes. Those pink chalky things. They help a little, maybe. But I don't like taking pills. And honestly, I just try to eat smaller meals. It’s not much of a life, I tell you. A good Polish man needs a hearty meal!
DOCTOR: Right, antacids offer some relief, but you're not a fan of pills and prefer to eat smaller portions. I understand wanting a hearty meal. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I get a bit of a cough. Not a bad cough, just…a little tickle in my throat. Probably from the…acid coming up, I guess. And I’ve been a little…bloated lately. My wife says I look like I’m going to pop. She's always making comments about my weight, but I’m a big man!
DOCTOR: Okay, a slight cough and some bloating. Your wife has noticed a bit of weight gain as well. Now, thinking about your past medical history… do you have any known conditions, like diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? Heavens, no! I’m as strong as an ox! I do a little gardening, you know? Keep me fit. Diabetes…no. My doctor did tell me my cholesterol was a bit high last year, but I haven’t been taking those pills either. Honestly, I don't trust all those medications.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And…oh, and I had a hernia repair a few years back. That’s about it. Nothing major. They didn’t have to open me up too much, thank goodness. I don't like being cut open.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child and a hernia repair a few years ago. Good to know. And finally, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My mother…she had stomach problems, always complaining. Nothing specific, just…indigestion, I guess. And my father, he had high blood pressure. That runs in the family, apparently. Nothing too exciting. They both lived to be a good age, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother with stomach problems, father with high blood pressure. Thank you. Now, Mr. Altine, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of acid reflux, possibly GERD – gastroesophageal reflux disease. The fact that it's worse when lying down, and the undigested food coming up, along with the heartburn sensation, points in that direction. The cough and bloating can also be related.
PATIENT: GERD? Another one of those fancy medical terms, huh? Look, I don't need a name for it, I just want it fixed. Is this something serious? I need to get back to my garden, you know. The tomatoes aren't going to pick themselves.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious right now, Mr. Altine, but left untreated, GERD can lead to complications. Things like inflammation of the esophagus, or even changes in the cells lining it. Which is why it's good you came in. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Also, if you haven't had one recently, we may want to consider a scope to look at your esophagus. But let’s start with the exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A scope? Now hold on a minute. You want to put a camera down my throat? Absolutely not! I don’t like the sound of that one bit. Listen, I'm a practical man. Can't we just try some medication first? Maybe something stronger than those chalky things. I'd rather not have a camera poking around in there, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Altine. A scope is not always necessary, and we can certainly try medication first. It's a reasonable approach. We could start with a proton pump inhibitor – a PPI – which reduces acid production. It’s a stronger medication than the antacids you’ve been taking. However, I want to be upfront: without further investigation, we’re treating symptoms, not necessarily the underlying cause. If the medication doesn’t provide significant relief, or if your symptoms worsen, we would need to revisit the possibility of a scope. Does trying a PPI sound like a good starting point?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. A pill is better than a camera. But if it doesn’t work, I’m not doing any scopes. I'm telling you now. What's the name of this pill, and what are the side effects? I don't want to be trading one problem for another. And how long do I have to take it before I know if it's working? I have tomatoes to pick, remember!
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The medication I’m thinking of is called Omeprazole. It’s a commonly prescribed PPI. As for side effects, most people don’t experience any significant ones. Some can have mild diarrhea, nausea, or headaches. Rarely, there can be more serious side effects, but those are uncommon. We'll discuss those in detail when I give you the prescription. Typically, it takes a week or two to see the full benefit of the medication. If you don’t notice any improvement after two weeks, or if your symptoms worsen, we’ll need to reassess. I’m also going to recommend some lifestyle changes. Avoid lying down for at least three hours after eating, elevate the head of your bed, and avoid foods that trigger your symptoms – things like spicy foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Three hours? No lying down? That’s a long time. And no spicy foods? My kielbasa is spicy! But alright, alright. I’ll try it. I’ll take the pill, and I’ll try to avoid the lying down and the spicy foods…but don’t expect miracles. And get me that prescription, quickly. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here's the prescription. It's good for 30 days. Please take one pill each morning, 30-60 minutes before a meal. I'll also print out some information on GERD and lifestyle modifications for you. If you don’t see improvement after two weeks, or if your symptoms worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And if you experience any new or concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just…don’t expect me back anytime soon. I have better things to do. Thank you, Doctor. And good luck with…whatever it is you do here. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Altine. I hope the medication helps, and you can get back to enjoying your garden – and your kielbasa. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
