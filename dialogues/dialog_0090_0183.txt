DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It’s… this tiredness. It’s just… always there now. Like a weight. I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now? I need to sit down after a few hours. It’s not good. My wife says I look… pale too. She worries.
DOCTOR: “Tiredness,” alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Grumman?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Slowly. At first I thought it was just the heat. But the heat is gone now, and I’m still tired. Six months, yes. Maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly, I don't keep track of these things. It's just… a feeling. A bad feeling.
DOCTOR: A “bad feeling” for six months… Okay. And has anything changed in those six months?
PATIENT: Changed? Well… not really. Same work. Same food, mostly. My wife does more of the cooking now, she worries about me eating enough. I drink the same tea. Everything is… the same. Except for the tiredness, of course. It’s very… frustrating. I can't get things done. My work is suffering. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can understand. And you said your wife has noticed you looking pale?
PATIENT: Yes. She says I look like a ghost! Not a happy ghost, mind you. She keeps asking if I'm getting enough iron. Women… always worrying about something. But she’s a good woman, my wife. She makes me eat my vegetables. She thinks that will help. But I don’t think vegetables are the answer to this. This is… deeper. It’s not just a lack of… of spinach.
DOCTOR: Well, we’ll see. It's good that your wife is observant. Has this tiredness been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I don’t get sick often. A little cough now and then. But nothing major. Oh… sometimes my stomach feels… funny. Not painful, just… unsettled. And I’ve been… going to the bathroom more often. That’s it, I think. It’s just… tiredness, mostly. And a funny stomach. You understand? It's not like a fever or something obvious.
DOCTOR: Unsettled stomach and increased bathroom trips… alright. And when you say “increased,” how much more frequent are we talking?
PATIENT: Well… before, maybe once a day. Normal. Now? Two, three times a day. Sometimes more. It’s… disruptive. I have to keep stopping my work. It's embarrassing, if you want to know the truth. A man shouldn’t have to worry about this! It’s… undignified. And it worries my wife, of course. She makes me drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Right. Water is good. And are these bowel movements normal in consistency?
PATIENT: Consistency? What do you mean? It’s… soft. Not hard. More loose, I guess. Not… not like before. Before it was… firm. You know. A man doesn’t talk about these things! But you asked. It’s… unpleasant. And it doesn't go away. Even with the water. It just keeps happening. Are you writing all this down? It feels like I'm telling you my life story!
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Grumman, I am documenting everything. It’s important. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Absolutely not. That would be… serious. I’m tired, I have a funny stomach, I go to the bathroom a lot… but no blood! My wife would have noticed. She notices everything. No, definitely no blood. That’s a good thing, right? You’re not looking at me like that for blood, are you? Because there is no blood!
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Grumman, I wasn't implying anything. Just covering all the bases. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Old age, of course. But that’s not a condition, is it? I had malaria, when I was a boy, back in Ethiopia. But that was a long time ago. And… oh! My liver. The doctor said it was… not quite right, a few years back. He said something about swelling. I don’t remember all the details. I don't like doctors much, to be honest. They just worry you. That’s all. Is that what this is about? My liver?
DOCTOR: Liver swelling… alright, that’s important. Do you recall when this liver issue was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… oh, maybe five years ago? Six? It was after I came to America. He had me take some pills. For a while. Then he said it was better. He said I just needed to… watch my diet. Something about fat. But he didn’t explain it very well. I don't remember the doctor's name either. He was a young doctor, I think. They all look the same to me! Are you sure this is important? I'm just tired.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Grumman. We need to understand the whole picture. Alright. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure. The little white ones. My wife makes sure I take them every morning. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleep aids. The red ones. But that doesn't always work. And that’s it. Nothing else. Just those two. Is this… is this going to take long? I have work to do, you know. And I'm very tired.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication and occasional sleep aids…Alright. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had problems with her heart. When she was old. My father… he was strong, always working. I don’t think he ever got sick. My brother, he has diabetes, I think. But he lives in Ethiopia, so I don’t see him very often. It’s hard to keep track of everything when people live far away. Does it matter? I just want to know what’s wrong with me. This tiredness is awful. .
DOCTOR: It always matters, Mr. Grumman. Alright, a quick question. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
