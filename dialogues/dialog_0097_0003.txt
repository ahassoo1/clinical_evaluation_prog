DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, you know. It’s this… shaking. Hands mostly. Been happening a while now, really. Not sure when exactly, things aren't as clear as they used to be. My wife, bless her soul, she noticed it first. But she’s… gone now. So, yeah. The shaking. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. That is enough to start with. I understand losing your wife must be incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly alright if details are a little hazy right now. We'll take things at your pace. So, this shaking in your hands… can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? It… jiggles. Like this. See? It’s worse when I try to do something, like… hold a glass or write. Though, I don't write much anymore. What is there to write about? It’s just… annoying, really. Makes me look like a fool. And it’s getting worse, I think. Or maybe I’m just noticing it more. Honestly, I can’t keep track.
DOCTOR: I see. Yes, I can definitely see a tremor there. It seems most noticeable when you’re trying to do something, which we call a kinetic tremor. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a while… roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Years, probably. Maybe five? Six? Look, I used to be a busy man, you know? Producing, directing… traveling all over. I didn’t pay attention to little things like shaking hands. It just… crept up on me. Honestly, I was probably drinking too much back then. Helps a fella relax, you know? Though, I've cut back. Mostly. Don’t make me list every single thing I used to do, I haven’t got the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Baide. You were a busy man, and it’s common for things to creep up on us when we’re focused on other matters. No need to list anything you don’t want to. Knowing it's been happening for around five or six years is helpful. You mentioned cutting back on drinking – that’s good to hear. Do you drink at all now?
PATIENT: A little. Just a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Maybe two if it’s been a rough day. Don't look at me like that, it’s not like I’m falling over every night. A man's entitled to a little enjoyment, isn’t he? And it doesn’t seem to make the shaking worse, honestly. Though, maybe I just don’t notice. Look, are we getting anywhere with this or what? I’ve got a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. You’re absolutely entitled to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. I wasn’t judging, just gathering information. It’s important to know everything that could be contributing to the shaking. Okay. To get a better picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… old. Is that a symptom? My knees ache, my back’s a mess, I forget things… like what I had for breakfast this morning. It’s just… aging, Doc. That’s all it is. You doctors always want to find something fancy, something complicated. It’s just… getting old. And frankly, I don't have time for a full medical examination. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. You're right, many things change as we age, and it's easy to dismiss things as simply "getting old." But it's my job to rule out anything that could be causing or contributing to your symptoms, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little more about the knee and back pain?
PATIENT: Ugh, the knees… they creak. Like an old door. Worse in the morning, or when it rains. Been like that for years. The back… well, I used to carry a lot of heavy equipment around on film shoots. Never thought much of it at the time. It just aches, mostly. Sometimes it gets sharp, but I take something for it. A little pill. Don’t remember the name. It helps, usually. Honestly, I’m not sure why I’m telling you all this. It’s just… old age! Are we still at this?
DOCTOR: You're providing very helpful information, Mr. Baide, even if it feels like you're just describing the normal wear and tear of life. Knowing about the creaking knees and back pain, and that you take something for it, is useful. One more thing, and then we can move on. Have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance? Look, I haven’t fallen or anything. Though, I almost tripped over the rug the other day. But that’s just because my wife used to move things around. She was a bit of a… rearranger. Honestly, I'm a bit clumsy, always have been. And I’m careful. I don't want to end up with a broken hip. Can we wrap this up soon? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. No falls, just a near trip, and you’re careful about your balance. Alright, Mr. Baide. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your reflexes, coordination, and strength. It won’t take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be able to stand on one leg or anything. I'm eighty years old, not a circus performer. And please, be quick about it. I have a luncheon to get to, remember? Don't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Baide. I’ll be as quick as possible, and I won’t ask you to do anything strenuous. “Okay, Mr. Baide, just walk normally for me. Good. A little bit of slowness, but no significant imbalance. Now, let's check your reflexes… This is normal on the right… and a little diminished on the left. And your strength… a little bit of weakness in your left hand, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to check your coordination…” "A slight tremor when reaching for your nose, and a little bit of difficulty with coordination on the left side."
PATIENT: See? What did I tell you? Old age. Everything's slower on the left side, always has been. Probably a little stroke or something, years ago. Didn’t bother me then, doesn’t bother me now. Honestly, you doctors always want to find something wrong. Just leave it alone. I’m not looking for a diagnosis, I just wanted to know why my hands are shaking. Can we please be done? I’m starting to feel faint. Probably from all the poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide, let's stop there. You're right, it's important to focus on what's bothering you. You mentioned a possible stroke in the past – do you recall when that happened, or any details about it?
PATIENT: Oh, ages ago. Decades. I was working on a film shoot, somewhere… California, maybe? I woke up in the hospital, couldn’t move my left side for a bit. They said it was a… a TIA, I think. A mini-stroke or something. It didn’t last long, and I recovered. Mostly. It’s just… always been a little weaker on that side since then. Honestly, I don’t remember much else. It was a long time ago, and I had a lot of other things on my mind. Look, are we getting anywhere with this, or are you just trying to scare me?
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned, Mr. Baide, and I’m not trying to scare you. Knowing about the TIA is very helpful. It explains some of the weakness on your left side. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, the most likely explanation for your hand tremors is essential tremor, possibly exacerbated by your past TIA. Essential tremor is a common neurological condition that causes rhythmic shaking, often in the hands. It tends to worsen with age and can be influenced by factors like stress and fatigue. However, given your history of a TIA, we need to rule out other possibilities. Would you be willing to get a brain MRI to get a clearer picture?
PATIENT: An MRI?! Are you kidding me? I'm eighty years old! I don't want to be stuck in a noisy machine for an hour! No, absolutely not. I’ve had enough poking and prodding for one day. Look, I’m just an old man with shaky hands. It’s not the end of the world. Can’t you just give me something for it? A pill, maybe? Something to calm them down? I don’t need a fancy scan. Honestly, I think you’re trying to run up the bill. Just give me something for the shaking, and let me go home. I have a luncheon to get to, remember?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Baide. An MRI isn’t necessary right away. We can try a medication to help manage the tremors, but I want to be upfront: it may not completely eliminate them, and it can have side effects. Given your history, I’m also going to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can confirm the diagnosis and discuss the best treatment options for you. For now, I can prescribe a low dose of propranolol, which can help reduce the tremors. It’s important to start with a low dose and monitor your blood pressure and heart rate. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. A pill is better than a noisy machine. But I’m warning you, if it makes me feel worse, I’m blaming you. And I don’t want any fancy side effects. Just something to calm the shaking, that’s all. And I’m not going to see any neurologist. I’ve had enough doctors for one lifetime. Honestly, I think you’re overreacting. Just write the prescription, and let me go home. I have a luncheon to get to, remember? And make sure it doesn’t interact with my wine.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Baide. I’m prescribing a low dose of propranolol, and it generally doesn’t interact significantly with moderate alcohol consumption. However, it’s always best to avoid excessive drinking. Here’s the prescription. I’ll also provide you with a handout outlining the potential side effects and what to watch out for. I strongly recommend following up with a neurologist, but I understand your hesitation. If you change your mind, I can provide a referral. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just let me go. I've wasted enough time here already. Thank you… I guess. And please, don't call me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Get to your luncheon, and enjoy your day. If anything changes or you have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out, even if it’s just to leave a message. .
