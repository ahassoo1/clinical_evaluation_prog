DOCTOR: Hi Nicky, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I must say, you seem awfully young to be a doctor. No offense, of course. It’s just… I’m used to seeing more… experienced faces when I go to the doctor. Anyway, it’s this bruising. It’s getting ridiculous. I'm on a blood thinner, as you probably know, and I seem to be covered in purple these days. It’s not painful, exactly, but it’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Nicky. I get that comment fairly often! I've been practicing for a couple of years now, and I'm definitely up to speed. And you’re right to be concerned about the bruising, especially with being on a blood thinner. Okay, so it’s bruising that's the main issue. Not painful, but frequent and concerning. Just to clarify, are these bruises happening with minimal trauma – like bumping into something lightly?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! That’s it. It’s not like I’m falling down and hitting myself. I’ll just… brush against something, maybe the edge of the counter, and poof – another bruise. It seems to happen more easily than it used to. And they’re bigger, I think. My wife… well, my late wife used to say I was a bit clumsy, but this is beyond that. It’s just… odd. And frankly, a little frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising with minimal trauma, increasing frequency, and possibly increasing size. That’s good information. And you said this is a change from how things used to be?
PATIENT: Yes, a definite change. When I first started on the blood thinner – it was about… oh, five years ago now, after the… incident – the bruising was minimal. A little bump, a little mark, gone in a week. This has been going on for… I don’t know, maybe three or four months? It's hard to keep track, truthfully. I try not to look at myself too much. It’s depressing. But it’s definitely worse. And I’m starting to wonder if the dosage is off, or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been worsening over the last three to four months. That timeline is helpful. You mentioned the blood thinner was started five years ago after an "incident" - would you mind briefly telling me what that was, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Really, must we? It was… a pulmonary embolism. A blood clot in my lung. Nasty business. That’s why I’m on this stuff in the first place. Look, I’m here about the bruising, Doctor. Not to rehash old medical history. I’ve told that story to enough doctors already. It’s unpleasant. But fine, yes, pulmonary embolism. There. Happy? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicky. My apologies. I didn’t mean to dredge up unpleasant memories, and I shouldn’t have pushed it. It’s just that the history can sometimes be relevant. Okay, so pulmonary embolism five years ago, currently on a blood thinner. Let's focus on the bruising. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, that's it. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no blood in my stool. Nothing like that. Just… the purple. And it’s rather embarrassing, frankly. I used to take pride in my appearance. A gentleman always does. Now I feel like some sort of… walking bruise. It’s… frustrating. And my daughter keeps looking at me worried. She fusses over me too much, if you ask me, but she means well. But no, no other symptoms. Just the bruising. And the worry. Mostly the worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other bleeding, no other symptoms. Just the bruising and your daughter’s concern – which is good of her! It sounds like you're very aware of what's going on, and that's helpful. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check you out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at the bruising. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: An exam? Really? What good will that do? You're just going to look at the purple spots. I already know they're there. Look, I’m a pathologist, Doctor. I understand the human body. I've spent my life looking at it. With a microscope. But fine. If you insist. Just… try not to poke too much. And please, don't tell me everything is fine. I’ve had enough of that.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Nicky, and I respect your background as a pathologist. You’re right, just looking won't solve everything. But listening to your heart and lungs can sometimes give us clues, and I want to rule out other possibilities. And I promise, I won't tell you everything is fine if it isn't. I’ll be honest with you. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Can you just roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect miracles. I'm not convinced this is going to be helpful. And please, be gentle with that cuff. My skin is rather sensitive these days. All this bruising, you know. It's a vicious cycle. Now, hurry it up, would you? I have things to do. A gentleman doesn’t spend all day in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Deep breath in… and out… again… Okay, good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, if you'll allow me, I’d like to take a look at some of the bruising. Can you point out where it’s most prominent?
PATIENT: There. That's from… I honestly can't remember. Probably bumped into the doorframe. Though lightly. And there's one on my thigh, but I'd have to… well, never mind. It's unsightly. You can see. Honestly, it’s all over. It's not just one spot. It’s… pervasive. And it’s growing. I swear it’s growing. Just look at it! It’s… disturbing.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is quite extensive. It’s raised, and it does appear somewhat… recent. No warmth or tenderness to the touch, which is good. I’m also noticing some smaller bruises in various stages of healing on your arms and legs. Given your history of being on a blood thinner, and the increasing frequency and size of the bruising, I think it would be prudent to order some blood work. Just to check your blood counts and see how well your blood thinner is working. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work, of course. What else? It’s always something with you doctors. Fine. Go ahead. But I warn you, I hate needles. Absolutely loathe them. And I expect a full explanation of the results. No medical jargon, if you please. I’m a pathologist, yes, but I don’t need a lecture on hematology. Just tell me what it means. And quickly. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicky. No lectures, I promise. I’ll explain everything in plain English, and we’ll take our time going through the results. I’ll also make a note that you dislike needles – we'll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. Okay, I’ll get the lab requisition form. We'll need to draw a few vials of blood. It should take about 10-15 minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Fine. Ten minutes, you say? Very well. And yes, I take a low-dose aspirin every day. My cardiologist recommended it. And… a vitamin D supplement. My daughter insists. She says I don't get enough sun. Honestly, she treats me like a child. But it’s just the aspirin and the vitamin D. Nothing else. And I stopped taking the garlic pills. They upset my stomach. Is that all you need to know? Can we just get this over with? I really dislike hospitals. And doctors' offices. Frankly, I dislike most things these days. But the bruising, that's the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, low-dose aspirin and vitamin D. That’s helpful to know, as aspirin can thin the blood as well. And I understand your dislike of hospitals and doctor's offices – I'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll also have her check your weight and vital signs. Once the results are back – usually within a few hours – we can go over them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s all. Just… hurry it up, would you? The sooner I’m out of here, the better. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. I repeat: gentle. Honestly, it’s bad enough having the bruising. I don’t need a sore arm on top of it. And no lectures, remember. Just the results. Plain English. That’s all I ask. I’m a busy man, Doctor. A very busy man. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just sit here and try not to think about needles.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Nicky. I'll make sure the nurse is aware of your preferences, and I promise, no lectures. Just the results, in plain English. The nurse will be right in. .
