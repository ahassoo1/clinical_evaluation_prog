DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Dr. DeCosta. Well, it’s…rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom quite a lot lately. More often than usual, certainly. I’m not entirely sure when it started, just…gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. It’s much better to get these things checked out. "Quite a lot" is a little vague, though. Could you give me a rough idea – how many times a day would you say you’re going, and how does that compare to your usual?
PATIENT: Oh dear, you’re right, that is vague, isn’t it? Let me think… Normally, I’d say perhaps three or four times a day. But recently… it feels like every couple of hours. Maybe six or seven times? It’s disrupted my sleep a little, too, having to get up. It’s all rather unsettling. I don't recall anything specific triggering it, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, six or seven times a day is definitely a change from your usual three or four, and waking you up at night is concerning. It's good you're paying attention to it. Aside from the frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see. No, not really… well, sometimes there’s a little bit of a burning sensation when I…finish, if that makes sense. It’s not terribly painful, more of an irritation, really. And… I think I’m a little more tired than usual, but I’ve been a bit stressed lately, so I chalked that up to that. Is that helpful? I’m not very good at remembering details, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. The burning sensation is good to know, and it’s important to consider both the stress and the increased fatigue. Just to clarify, is this burning sensation constant, or does it only happen with urination?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s definitely only when I urinate, Dr. DeCosta. It doesn’t happen at any other time. It’s fairly quick, it comes on when I start, and then it’s gone shortly after I’ve finished. It’s… a subtle discomfort, really. Not debilitating, but noticeable. I’m just…concerned that something might be wrong, you see. I don't like feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it’s good you’re getting this checked out. Alright, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Not that I recall, no. I’ve generally been quite healthy, actually. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I had a divorce a few years ago, which was… stressful, but no lasting physical effects. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything significant. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I could be forgetting something, but I don’t think so. I don't recall ever having a problem with my kidneys or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, I don’t believe so. Not that I remember, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think… but that was a very long time ago. Nothing else springs to mind. Honestly, I’m rather vague about these things. It’s frustrating! Is it alright if we skip that part, perhaps? I feel terrible for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Keoni, it’s perfectly alright. It’s more important to focus on what’s happening now. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the kidneys, bladder, or urinary system?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My mother passed away when I was quite young, and I didn’t know my father very well. As for my grandparents… I only met them a handful of times. I don’t recall anyone specifically having kidney problems, no. My aunt on my mother’s side did have some sort of… illness when she was older, but I never knew exactly what it was. She was quite frail. I’m afraid I’m not very knowledgeable about my family’s medical history. It wasn’t something we discussed much. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m a very… temperate person, you see. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I occasionally get a mild itch when I eat shellfish, but I don’t think it’s a true allergy. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions, like difficulty breathing or swelling. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, at least. Is that helpful? I do try to avoid anything that might upset my stomach, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Okay, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking anything at all, Dr. DeCosta. Not even vitamins. I’ve always been a bit skeptical of those, to be honest. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food. I haven’t needed to take any regular medication in years, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen, check your lower back, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes. It’s just a routine check to help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright, Dr. DeCosta. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment entirely. I'm happy to do whatever you think is necessary to figure out what's causing this. I might be a bit ticklish, though, just a warning!
DOCTOR: Okay, taking a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. I’m not hearing anything immediately concerning. Your abdomen is soft, and there’s no tenderness to palpation. Your lower back feels normal as well. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes… could you cross your legs and relax?
PATIENT: Certainly, Dr. DeCosta. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m a bit anxious, to be honest, but I’m trying to remain calm. I hope everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are normal and symmetrical, and sensation is intact. No immediate neurological deficits. Your lower extremities appear normal. I’m going to listen to your vital signs, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Everything appears within normal limits so far. However, to rule out a urinary tract infection or other potential causes, I’d like to order a urine analysis. Would you be comfortable providing a sample?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Dr. DeCosta. A urine analysis sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to provide a sample. Just let me know where I should go, and I’ll do that right away. Hopefully, that will give us some answers.
DOCTOR: Great. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. There are collection cups in there. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect about two ounces in the cup. Once you've collected the sample, please bring it back to me, and I'll send it to the lab. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Mid-stream, you said? I think I remember that from… somewhere. Yes, I can do that. Well, I suppose my biggest question is… what are you thinking it could be, Dr. DeCosta? I understand you haven't had the results of the urine analysis yet, but… are there any common causes for this that I should be aware of? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Keoni. It's good to be informed. There are a number of possible causes for increased urinary frequency, and thankfully, many of them are not serious. Common causes include urinary tract infection – which is why we're doing the urine analysis – overactive bladder, diabetes, or even just drinking a lot of fluids. Sometimes, it can be a side effect of medication, but you're not taking any, so that's less likely. Less common, but we need to rule them out, are things like bladder stones or, rarely, certain neurological conditions. It's important not to jump to conclusions before we have the results, but I want to assure you that we'll investigate thoroughly. We’ll start with the urine analysis, and depending on the results, we may need to do further testing. Is that understandable?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Dr. DeCosta. So, lots of possibilities, most of them not too worrying… that’s…reassuring. It's just a bit unsettling, feeling like I need to go constantly. It disrupts my sleep, you see, and I’m a bit worried it might be something more serious. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. It puts my mind at ease a little, knowing you’re taking it seriously. I’ll go and collect the sample now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Keoni. It's my job to help ease your mind, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please, take your time collecting the sample, and let me know if you have any trouble. I'll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. DeCosta. I will. .
