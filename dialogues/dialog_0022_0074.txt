DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure’s been actin’ up lately. My regular doctor said I should come see someone…said I needed to get it checked proper. Don’t rightly remember all the fuss, but it weren’t good, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s perfectly alright. It's common to forget details, especially when you're feeling concerned about your health. So, your regular doctor recommended you come in for a blood pressure check. Has anyone specifically told you your blood pressure was high, or is this more of a general concern?
PATIENT: Oh, the nurse at the old doctor’s office…she checked it a couple times and said it was too high. Said somethin’ about numbers…I don’t remember the numbers. Just that she looked worried. She’s the one who told me to come see someone, said I needed to get it sorted. I mostly just bake these days, don't have the energy to fuss with much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the nurse at your previous doctor’s office noticed some elevated readings. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned you’ve been feeling less energetic lately – is that a new thing, or has that been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: It's kinda new, I reckon. Not all at once, but over the last few months I've just…tired easier. Used to bake all day, no problem. Now I gotta sit down a lot more. Makes me feel old, it does. And I worry 'bout the bakery, you know? It’s been in the family a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. Feeling tired when you’re used to being active can be frustrating, and it's perfectly natural to worry about things like the bakery. We'll definitely try to figure out what's going on. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm…symptoms…let me think. My head gets kinda throbbing sometimes, especially in the back. Not a bad headache, just…a pressure. And sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Mostly just tired and a little achy, like an old house creakin’. Is that what you mean by symptoms? I don't go to the doctor much, so I don’t rightly know what to look for.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, Venna. The throbbing, the dizziness, and the general aches…those are all things we should investigate. It sounds like you're describing some symptoms that could be related to high blood pressure, but we need to confirm that and rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… Now that you mention it, my feet do feel kinda puffy some evenings. I just figured it was the heat. It's been awful warm this summer. I usually take my shoes off as soon as I get home. Didn't think much of it, really. Do puffy feet mean somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: Puffy feet can be a sign of a few different things, and it's good you mentioned it. It's another piece of the puzzle. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. I had the flu real bad when I was a little girl, and my husband…well, he had a bad heart. But me? Not much. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat good, mostly. Bake a lot of bread, so lots of flour and yeast, but I try to use good ingredients. My mother always said a good diet keeps you goin’. I did have a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that healed up fine. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Venna. The broken wrist doesn't necessarily count as a medical condition, but it's good information to have. And it’s wonderful to hear you’ve been generally healthy and have a good diet. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the one, when I was younger. Had my tonsils taken out when I was a little girl. That's all. Everything else has been…well, just livin'. I always figured strong bones and a little bit of luck were the best medicine. Are we gettin' anywhere with this, Doctor? I got a batch of sourdough startin’ and I need to get back to it before it gets too sour.
DOCTOR: Yes, we absolutely are getting somewhere, Venna. And I completely understand about the sourdough – that's important! Let's just quickly cover a few more things, then we’ll do a quick physical exam to get a clearer picture. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My grandmother used to say a little bit of everything is good for you. I did get a rash once when I was a child, after playin’ in poison ivy, but that wasn't an allergy, just bein’ careless. Mostly, I just try to avoid things that don’t agree with me, like too much sugar. I don't need that messin’ with my energy, thank you very much. Can we get this over with then, Doctor? My bones are startin’ to ache just sittin’ here.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, that's good. And I appreciate your patience, Venna. Just one last quick question: are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, when it flares up. It's called… um… I forget the name, now. The little white pills. I get 'em from the drugstore, down the street. Don't take 'em every day, just when my knuckles get stiff. And I take a little vitamin D in the winter, 'cause I don't get out in the sun much. That's all. Honestly, I mostly just rely on good food and a good night's sleep. Now, are we done with the questions? I can feel my sourdough callin’ my name.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some arthritis medication as needed and vitamin D. That's very helpful. Alright, Venna, I think we have enough information for now. We are almost done. I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It won’t take long, and it’ll help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with then. Just be gentle with the old bones, alright? The sourdough is dependin’ on me, you know. A good start is everything.
DOCTOR: I will be as gentle as possible, Venna. And I completely understand about the sourdough! Alright, blood pressure is a bit elevated… 150/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit of extra effort with each beat. Lungs sound clear. And I do notice some swelling in both ankles, especially on the inner side. Okay, Venna. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it does seem like your blood pressure is higher than it should be. The swelling in your ankles and the fatigue you’re experiencing could be related to that, but we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I’d like to order some blood work and a urine test. These will help us check your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests…figures. More fuss. Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don't like goin' to the lab, but I reckon I gotta do what I gotta do. So, what kinda tests? And how long will it take? And will it interfere with the bakin’? I got orders to fill, you know. A good sourdough can’t wait forever.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Venna. It’s never fun to have to go to the lab, and I wouldn't recommend it if it wasn’t necessary. The blood work will just be a standard panel to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. The urine test will help us check for protein, which can also be a sign of kidney problems. It should only take about 15-20 minutes at the lab, and you can go anytime during their business hours. As for the baking, it shouldn’t interfere at all. You should be able to go about your normal activities right after the tests. We’ll just need a few days to get the results back, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Alright. Fifteen minutes ain't so bad. And I can still bake…good. As long as I can still tend to the sourdough, I suppose I can manage. Do I need to make an appointment for these tests, or can I just…go? And where is this lab, exactly? My memory ain’t what it used to be, and I don't wanna end up lost in town.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Venna. This is the address and phone number for the lab. You don’t need an appointment; you can just walk in during their business hours, which are 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. It’s located just down the street, on Elm Street, right next to the pharmacy. I’ll also have my nurse give you a lab order form to take with you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Elm Street, next to the pharmacy…right. I think I know where that is. Alright, good. Nurse, you said? She can explain it better if I get lost. No, I don't think so. Just… get this over with so I can get back to bakin’. A good sourdough waits for no one, you know. Tell you what, you tell that nurse to remind me to add a little more honey to my start. Helps with the flavor. Alright then. Thank you, Doctor. I reckon I'll be seein' you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. And I will definitely pass along your message to the nurse about the honey – a little extra flavor never hurts! Take your time getting there, and don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
