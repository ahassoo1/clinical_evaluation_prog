DOCTOR: Good morning, Teretha. My name is Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. I see here you’re 63 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, Teretha Uzarski. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought I should probably get it checked out. I’m a mail carrier, you see, and it's starting to make things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands and feet. I understand it's been happening for a little while and is starting to impact your work as a mail carrier. That’s definitely good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s not constant, you know? Comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little… pins and needles feeling. Other times it feels almost numb, like when your foot falls asleep. It’s worse in the evenings, I think, after a long day on the route. And it seems to be both hands and both feet, pretty much the same. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it comes and goes, varies in intensity from pins and needles to numbness, it’s worse in the evenings after work, and it affects both your hands and feet equally. Is it just the tingling and numbness, or have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been dropping things a bit more lately. Not constantly, but enough that I’ve noticed it. And sometimes my feet feel a little… cold, even when they’re not. I don’t know if that’s connected, though. I just thought it was… old age, maybe? It's hard to say. And honestly, Doctor, I'm just trying to keep working. I don’t have the best insurance, you see, so I really need to be able to.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about being able to continue working, and I appreciate you telling me about the insurance situation. It's good you’re being proactive about this. Dropping things and the coldness in your feet are definitely things we need to consider. Let's talk a bit more about the tingling itself. Does anything specifically trigger it, or make it worse, besides the long day at work?
PATIENT: Well… walking, definitely. The more I walk, the worse it gets. And sometimes, if I’m standing still for a long time, it flares up too. It's funny, you'd think standing would be better than walking, but no. It's like… either way is bad. I don't know if it’s the shoes, maybe? I wear the boots the post office gives us, of course. They aren't the most comfortable things. I’ve tried adding extra insoles, but it doesn't seem to make much difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so walking and even standing for long periods aggravate the tingling, and adding insoles hasn’t helped much with the postal boots. That’s good information. Now, let's step back a little. Have you had any injuries to your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Injuries… Let me think. Nothing major, not recently. I twisted my ankle a few years back, delivering mail in the snow, but that healed up fine. And I’ve had my fair share of scrapes and bruises over the years, you know, from tripping and falling. But nothing that I'd call a serious injury. Definitely no broken bones or anything like that. I’ve been a mail carrier for a long time, you get used to a few bumps and bruises. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good to know there haven't been any major injuries. Minor bumps and bruises are likely not related, but it’s good to rule things out. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, the doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on a little pill for it and it seems to be okay now. I try to watch my salt intake. Other than that… no, not really. No diabetes, no thyroid problems that I know of. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. My mother had arthritis, but I haven’t felt anything like that myself… yet. I try to stay active, you know? Walking keeps me going, even if it's causing this tingling now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently controlled with medication, and a family history of arthritis. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill. That’s it. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep, that’s what my mother always told me. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but not regularly. It's just been sitting in the cupboard for months, probably. Honestly, I forget to take it most of the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication, and an occasionally forgotten multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I've never had any problems with bee stings or pollen or anything like that. I think I would have remembered if I had an allergy, wouldn't I? I try to be careful, though. You hear so much about allergies these days. Is that important, Doctor? I'm just trying to get to the bottom of this tingling before it gets worse, and I really need to keep working.
DOCTOR: You're right to prioritize finding the cause and keeping your job. No known allergies is good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your feet and hands, test your reflexes, and assess your sensation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I hope it’s not something serious. I really can’t afford to be off work for long. Go ahead, Doctor. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm checking your reflexes and sensation now. Your reflexes are a little diminished in both your ankles and wrists, but not significantly. Your sensation seems slightly decreased to light touch on the tips of your toes and fingers, bilaterally. I don't see any obvious signs of injury or swelling. Your skin feels warm and dry. Circulation appears good. I'm also noting a mild decrease in muscle strength when you resist me as you move your feet up and down and your hands up and down. But again, it’s mild.
PATIENT: Oh. That doesn’t sound… good, does it? What does all that mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? And will I be able to keep working? I really need to know. I know you probably need to do more tests, but… can you give me a little idea of what you’re thinking? I’m getting a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and I apologize for any anxiety this is causing. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam findings, the diminished reflexes, decreased sensation, and mild weakness suggest possible peripheral neuropathy. That means there’s some damage to the nerves in your hands and feet. Now, there are many possible causes for peripheral neuropathy. It could be related to your high blood pressure, even if it’s controlled, or it could be caused by other factors like vitamin deficiencies, or even just age. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, kidney function, and thyroid function. I also want to check your blood sugar levels to rule out diabetes. We may also consider a nerve conduction study, which is a painless test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves. It's too early to say definitively what’s causing this or whether it will affect your ability to work. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Nerves, you say? That sounds… complicated. Vitamin deficiencies? Diabetes? I don’t know… This is a lot to take in. Blood tests, okay, I can do blood tests. And a nerve study… painless, you say? That's good, I guess. So you’re saying it could be something serious, but it could also be something simple? And we need to figure out what it is before we know if I can keep working? Yes, that sounds alright. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… please try to be quick about it. I really need to know. And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything to make it better? I’ve been trying to rest my feet when I can, but… it doesn’t seem to help much.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is a lot to take in, and I apologize for the uncertainty. It's good that you're asking questions. Yes, it could be something serious, but it's also possible it's something we can manage with simple treatments. In the meantime, continue resting your feet when you can. Keeping them elevated can help reduce swelling. Try to avoid activities that aggravate the tingling, if possible, but don’t completely stop moving. Gentle stretching exercises may also help. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood tests and the nerve conduction study. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results, okay? I’m really anxious about this. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining things, and for not making me feel like I’m just an old woman complaining about aches and pains. It means a lot. I suppose I’ll just go home and try to rest. And try not to worry too much… easier said than done, though. Thank you again, Doctor. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teretha. I understand your anxiety, and I will do my best to get the results to you as quickly as possible. The lab should contact you within a couple of business days to schedule the tests. I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together, and we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on and get you back to feeling your best. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a good day as well, and try to stay positive.
