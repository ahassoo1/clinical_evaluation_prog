DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bohnett, it says here you’re 88 years old. That’s… good. Alright. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, a little while back, during a check-up with my regular fella, they said my cholesterol was a bit high. Hyper… something, I think he called it. Didn’t really explain it much, just said I ought to see someone about it. That's you, I presume?
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, that’s the word. It means high cholesterol. And frankly, it is something you should be seeing someone about. A lot of people don't take it seriously enough. Alright. And how long ago was this check-up, and do you recall what exactly your numbers were?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… oh, maybe six, seven weeks ago now? Dr. Olson did the test. He just said something about it being over 200, and that wasn't good. He wrote down the numbers, of course, but I didn’t bother asking for the paper. Old man’s memory ain’t what it used to be, you know? I shoulda asked, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you really should have. “Over 200” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Bohnett. There are different kinds of cholesterol, and the levels matter. But alright. We'll figure it out. Do you have any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I feel… well, I feel like an old man! A little stiff in the mornings, but that’s just getting up. Nothing special. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no funny feelings. Just… old. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: No, “old” isn’t a medical symptom, Mr. Bohnett. Though I understand your meaning. Alright. Let's go through some other things. Do you have any history of heart disease in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father, he had a bad heart. Real bad. Had to retire early, couldn't do much at all towards the end. And my sister, Elsie, she passed away a few years back, heart attack they said. Real sudden. Her husband, too, had problems. Seems to run in the family, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s… significant. And did either of them have high cholesterol, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Well now, that's a good question. I don’t rightly know. Back then, they didn't talk about cholesterol like they do now. They just said “heart trouble.” My father went to the doctor a lot, that's all I remember. Elsie, she didn't talk about her health much at all. Always a cheerful one, she was. Didn’t want anyone worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, bless her soul, she smoked for a bit when she was younger, but she quit years and years ago. Said it was a foolish habit. Smart woman, she was.
DOCTOR: Good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little, Doctor. A glass of wine with dinner now and then. Nothing fancy. Mostly red wine, they say it’s good for you. Though, at my age, I don't know if anything’s really good for you anymore!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure. Dr. Olson started me on that a few years back. Can't remember the name of it… little white one. And no allergies, not that I know of. I've had all sorts of shots and things over the years, never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your abdomen. Just standard procedure.
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Happy to cooperate. Just tell me what you want me to do. Getting old doesn't mean I'm helpless, you know!
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bohnett. Please, have a seat here. Heart rate is 78 and regular. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is a little weak, but present. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Alright. Everything sounds… okay. But your blood pressure is a little elevated, which isn't surprising given your family history and the elevated cholesterol. Do you happen to know your weight, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: Oh, I do! My daughter, bless her heart, she makes me weigh myself every time she visits. Last time, it was… 108 pounds. I’m a skinny old man, always have been. Not much meat on my bones.
DOCTOR: 108 pounds… and your height is 177 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: That's right. Always been a tall fella, even as a boy. Used to play basketball, you know. Not much good at it, but I enjoyed it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. Your BMI is 18.3, which puts you in the underweight category. Combined with your family history of heart disease and your elevated cholesterol, this is… concerning. We need to get those cholesterol numbers to understand what we’re dealing with. I’m going to order a full lipid panel. It will measure your total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides. We should also check a basic metabolic panel to rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me, Doctor. If you think it's best, I trust your judgement. I just want to feel a bit better, if that's possible at my age. What does all that… involve? Blood work, I presume? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to keep coming back here every other day!
DOCTOR: Yes, it involves a blood draw. It’s a standard procedure. The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn't take long – maybe ten minutes. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours. My nurse will call you with the results once they’re available. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a heart-healthy diet, low in saturated and trans fats. And regular, gentle exercise, if you’re able. We'll discuss the results and potential treatment options once we have them. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Bohnett?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… gentle exercise, you say? At my age? I suppose it’s better than nothing. Alright then. Let’s get this blood work done. Where do I go? And… thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The lab is just through that door, on your left. My nurse, Sarah, will be expecting you. She’ll take care of everything. And you’re welcome, Mr. Bohnett. I'll see you when your results are available.
PATIENT: Alright then. Thank you again, Doctor.
