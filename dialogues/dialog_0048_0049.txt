DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Schneer, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, it's me ears, mostly. They just… aren’t what they used to be, you know? Things are a bit muffled. Hard to hear folks talkin', especially when there’s a bit of noise around. Not sure when it started, really. Seems like a slow thing.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing… a slow onset. Alright. And is this in both ears, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both, I think. Yes, both. It’s not like one’s clear and the other’s gone, it’s just… quieter in both. Hard to tell sometimes, really. I mostly notice it when I’m tryin’ to watch the telly. The young fella next door says I have it up too loud, but… well, it's hard to hear!
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes. Not all the time, no. It’s a sort of… high-pitched whine, I guess. Not loud, thankfully. Mostly when it’s quiet. Like… after the telly’s been on for a while, maybe? Or when I'm lyin' in bed. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever been exposed to loud noises… regularly?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, now that you mention it… I worked in the shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must be fifty years. The machines were loud. Real loud. Clackin' and thumpin' all day long. Didn't think much of it at the time, you get used to it, I suppose. Everyone wore earplugs, but… I dunno, maybe they didn’t block it all out. It was a long time ago, though.
DOCTOR: Shoe factory… prolonged noise exposure. Okay. Have you ever had any ear infections, or had any wax buildup removed?
PATIENT: Ear infections… not that I recall, no. I had a bit of trouble with colds when I was a young fella, but nothin' serious. And wax… oh, the doctor did somethin' to 'em a few years back. Cleaned 'em out, I think. Just poked around with somethin' and then squirted some water in. Not painful or nothin', just a bit… strange. I don’t remember when exactly though. Old age, you know? Everything gets a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to take a quick look in your ears now, if that's alright. It’ll just be a quick peek.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course dear. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna be… pokey. I don’t like pokey.
DOCTOR: Alright. There’s some cerumen present in both ears, but nothing significant. The tympanic membranes appear intact. Given your age and history of noise exposure, it's most likely age-related hearing loss, potentially exacerbated by the factory work. It's common.
PATIENT: Age-related, is it? Well, that figures. Everything’s gettin’ old, aren’t it? So, what does that mean, exactly? Is it gonna get worse? And… can anything be done about it? I still like listenin' to the radio, you see. And talkin' with the neighbors. Just a bit hard sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: It will likely progress gradually. There's not much you can do to reverse it, unfortunately. We can consider hearing aids, but given the mild nature of your loss… it may not be beneficial at this stage. We could also schedule an audiology appointment for a formal hearing test if you'd like, to get a baseline measurement. But honestly, learning to adapt and asking people to repeat themselves is often the most practical solution. Are you experiencing any dizziness, or ringing in your ears that's persistent?
PATIENT: Persistent… hmm. No, not really. The ringing comes and goes, like I said. Mostly when it’s quiet. And dizziness… well, I get a bit wobbly sometimes, but I put that down to me knees. They ain't what they used to be either. So, hearin' aids might not be worth botherin’ with then? Seems like a lot of fuss for somethin' that… well, I suppose is just part of gettin’ old. What do you think, Doctor? You’re the expert.
DOCTOR: In your case, I suspect the benefit would be minimal. Hearing aids require a significant adjustment, and they aren't always effective for everyone, particularly with a gradual loss like yours. We can document your symptoms and monitor for any changes. I recommend avoiding loud noises whenever possible, and perhaps requesting that people speak more clearly and slowly when communicating. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds… sensible enough. Avoid loud noises, ask folks to speak up. Easier said than done sometimes, but I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Even if there isn’t much you can do. Just nice to have someone explain it all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, you're welcome, Mr. Schneer. We'll make a note of everything we discussed. If you notice any sudden changes in your hearing, or experience any dizziness or pain, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day. .
