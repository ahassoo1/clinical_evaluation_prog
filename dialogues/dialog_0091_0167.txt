DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my foot… it hurts. A lot. There’s a sore, a bad one, and it’s not getting better. It’s been bothering me for… oh, a little while now. I think it's from the sugar sickness, you know? The diabetes.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. It’s good you mentioned the diabetes – that is certainly important information. When you say “a little while now,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe in June? Yes, June, after my grandson’s birthday. He turned five. A small sore then, barely noticeable. Now… now it’s quite big and it’s very painful when I walk. I try not to walk much, but… you know, gotta get to the store.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, the sore began in June, following your grandson’s fifth birthday, and has gradually worsened, becoming increasingly painful with ambulation. Could you describe the sore to me?
PATIENT: It's… red around the edges, mostly. And in the middle… it's kinda… raw looking. Not smooth, you know? And it sometimes… leaks a little. Not a lot, but enough to get on my sock. It smells a little too, I think. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it's hard to reach. It’s on the bottom of my foot, near my heel.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Stoegbauer. Redness, a raw appearance, some drainage, and an odor – all located on the bottom of your foot near the heel. And you’ve noted it’s difficult to reach for cleaning. I’d like to perform a physical examination of your foot, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll need to visually inspect the sore, and I may gently palpate the area to assess its depth and surrounding tissues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s alright. I trust you. It hurts to touch, I warn you, but if you need to look, go ahead. Just be gentle, please. I’m an old man, bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Stoegbauer. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer. I’ve examined your foot. The ulceration is approximately two centimeters in diameter. There’s redness and some firmness around it, and a small amount of drainage. It is tender to the touch, and the pulses in your foot are weak. The capillary refill is also slow. This is concerning. It suggests there may be reduced blood flow to the area, and there is evidence of possible infection. Do you currently have any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or chills. And no aches, not really. Just the foot, of course. It’s always aching, but that’s just the sore. I haven't felt sick otherwise. I sleep alright, eat alright… just this foot. It’s been keeping me up a little at night, because of the pain.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. So, no systemic symptoms like fever, chills, or body aches. Primarily localized pain with the foot ulcer, and some disturbance of sleep due to the discomfort. Given your history of diabetes, the weakened pulses, delayed capillary refill, and the characteristics of the ulceration, I am concerned about a possible foot infection and potential compromise of blood flow to the area. This requires prompt attention to prevent further complications. I would like to order some blood tests to check for signs of infection, and I recommend we get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. We also need to check your blood sugar level. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. Tests sound good. I want this foot fixed. It’s stopping me from doing things. And I don't want to lose my foot. My wife… she always said I had big feet.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Stoegbauer. We will do everything we can to get this addressed. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar, and an X-ray of your left foot. I'll also send a sample for wound culture to identify any specific bacteria present. In the meantime, it's very important that you keep weight off of your left foot as much as possible. I will provide you with a walking boot to help with this, and I’ll give you instructions on proper wound care. We’ll also discuss offloading strategies to reduce pressure on the ulcer. I will have the lab technician draw your blood now, and then we’ll get the X-ray performed. Once the results are back, we can discuss the best course of treatment. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medicine. I take a little pill for my blood sugar, that's all. Metformin, I think it's called. I get it from the pharmacy, every month. And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it a while back. Said it was getting too low.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Stoegbauer. So, you currently take Metformin for your diabetes, and you previously took medication for blood pressure but it was discontinued. Excellent. I will document those medications. I'm going to write an order for the blood tests and the foot X-ray now. The lab and radiology technicians will guide you through the process. After those tests are completed, please return to the examination room, and we'll discuss the plan for offloading and wound care in more detail. I will also provide you with a prescription for the walking boot. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've explained everything very clearly. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And will this boot be… comfortable? I don't want to be stuck inside all the time.
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Mr. Stoegbauer. The lab results should be available within a few hours, and the X-ray results typically come back even faster. Once I have those results, I will review them and discuss the best course of treatment with you. The walking boot may take some getting used to, and it won’t be as comfortable as your regular shoes, but it’s crucial for offloading pressure from your foot and allowing it to heal. We will adjust it to ensure a proper fit, and I'll provide instructions on how to wear it correctly. The goal isn't to keep you stuck inside entirely, but to limit weight-bearing on the affected foot as much as possible during the initial healing phase. We can discuss strategies to maintain some level of activity while protecting your foot. I'm going to have the technician come in now to draw your blood and get you set up for the X-ray. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort or have any questions during the process. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so well. Alright, let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. I will be right here, reviewing your chart, and I will see you shortly after the tests are completed. Please don't hesitate to call out if you need anything.
PATIENT: .
