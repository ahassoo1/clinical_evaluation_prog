DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s…trouble going to the bathroom, mostly. I just…can’t get it all out, you see? It’s been happening for a little while now. Not real bad at first, but it’s getting harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're experiencing difficulty with complete bladder emptying, and it's been gradually worsening. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It feels like…like there’s always some left in there, even after I try. I have to…strain a lot, sometimes. And I gotta go back again pretty soon after I just went. It’s…uncomfortable, you know? It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it’s not good.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Hilber. That sounds frustrating. So, no pain with urination, just a feeling of incomplete emptying and needing to return relatively quickly. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It started…maybe three, four months ago? Not too bad at first, just a little slow. But in the last month or so, it’s gotten worse. Like I said, having to go back a lot. It’s…worrying me a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over three to four months, with a noticeable worsening in the last month. Have you noticed any other changes in your urinary habits, such as increased frequency during the day, or getting up more often at night to urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been getting up more at night. Used to be I’d sleep right through, but now…usually one, sometimes two times I gotta get up. And during the day, I seem to be going…more often than I used to. Not a lot more, but I notice it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased frequency during the day and nocturia – getting up at night to urinate – along with the incomplete emptying and straining. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself?
PATIENT: The stream? Hmm…it’s…weaker than it used to be, I think. Not a strong push, you know? Takes me a bit longer to get going, too. I used to just…go. Now I gotta think about it a little, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Hilber. A weaker stream, hesitancy – difficulty starting the flow – along with the other symptoms you've described. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And my belly doesn’t hurt. It’s just…this bathroom trouble. It’s mostly just…annoying and worrying. I don’t like feeling like I can’t…get everything out, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mr. Hilber. It's good to know there's no fever or abdominal pain. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well…I don’t have diabetes, not that I know of. My blood pressure…the doctor told me it was a little high a few years back, but he gave me some pills and it seemed to be okay. As for…prostate problems…I don’t know anything about that. Never been told I had any. I mostly just see the doctor when I gotta for something, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Hilber. So, you were diagnosed with high blood pressure in the past and are currently taking medication for it. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think…I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago. And I broke my leg once, skiing. But that was…years and years ago. No other surgeries, not that I remember. And haven’t been in the hospital for anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy and a broken leg in the past. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure. A little white one, I think. I take it every morning with my breakfast. And…sometimes a little something for my arthritis in my hands, but not every day. Just when it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a white pill for blood pressure daily, and an occasional medication for arthritis. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, but not every day. Mostly just water, really. I like my water.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, and minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. And I don’t have allergies to pollen or anything like that either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hilber, that’s very helpful. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A…digital rectal exam? Oh. Well…I’ve heard of those. It’s…not something I’m looking forward to, if you don’t mind me saying. But if you think it’s important, I suppose I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just…try to be quick, if you could.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I understand your apprehension, and I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. It’s a standard part of evaluating urinary issues, and it will help me gather important information. Alright, everything sounds normal there. Now, if you could please lie on your side… We'll proceed with the rectal exam. Okay, Mr. Hilber. The prostate feels somewhat enlarged, and it’s slightly firm. This could be contributing to your symptoms. I didn’t feel any obvious nodules or tenderness, which is good. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to further evaluate your prostate health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An enlarged prostate…that sounds…serious. Is that bad? And a blood test…okay, I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. What does the PSA test tell you? And will I need to…fast for the blood test?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Mr. Hilber, but it’s common as men age. An enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, can cause the symptoms you're experiencing – difficulty urinating, frequency, and urgency. The PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can indicate prostate enlargement, but also sometimes suggest inflammation or, less commonly, prostate cancer. That's why we need to check it. You don't need to fast for the PSA test, but please avoid vigorous exercise for 24 hours before the test, as that can temporarily elevate the levels. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for you before you leave today. We'll also collect a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: No vigorous exercise…okay, I can do that. I don't do much exercise these days, to be honest. Just a little walking. And a urine sample…yes, I can do that too. So, we're checking for infection, and seeing how big my prostate is. And what happens if the PSA test is…high? Will I need more tests?
DOCTOR: That's right, we're checking for infection and assessing your prostate size. And if the PSA test comes back elevated, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer, Mr. Hilber. Many things can cause a higher PSA level. If it is elevated, we would likely refer you to a urologist, a specialist in urinary health, for further evaluation. They might recommend additional tests, such as a prostate MRI or, potentially, a prostate biopsy to determine the cause. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll start with these initial tests, and then discuss the results and next steps together. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…reasonable. Don’t jump to conclusions…I like that. I don’t want to worry about things before I need to. So, the nurse will draw my blood and I’ll give her a urine sample? And then we wait for the results? How long will that take?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Hilber. The nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It typically takes a few days to get the results back – usually around three to five business days. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, are there any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve explained everything pretty well, Doctor. Just…thank you. It’s good to know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. And thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, or inability to urinate – please contact the clinic immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and we’ll be in touch soon.
