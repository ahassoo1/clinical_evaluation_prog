DOCTOR: Hi Enrique, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… uh… I keep getting very red in the face. Like a flush. It happens sometimes, not all the time. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a flushing sensation, that's good to know. And you said it happens sometimes, not all the time. Can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Sometimes after I eat… spicy food, maybe? But not always after spicy food. And… sometimes when I get… excited? Like, good excited, or… uh… a little worried. It’s very strange. I don’t know what causes it. I just feel the heat come up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be linked to both eating—specifically spicy foods, though not consistently—and your emotional state, both positive and negative excitement. That gives us a starting point. About how long does this flushing last when it happens?
PATIENT: Usually… five, maybe ten minutes? It builds up… gets very red… and then slowly goes away. Not right away, you understand? It fades. It doesn’t… hurt, exactly. Just… warm. And embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it lasts for about five to ten minutes, gradually fading. And it’s more of a warm sensation than pain, and understandably embarrassing. Have you noticed anything else that happens when you flush?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my heart… beats faster. Not very fast, but I can feel it. And… my palms… they get a little sweaty. Just a little. And… uh… I think I sometimes feel a little… dizzy? But that doesn’t always happen. It’s hard to remember. Everything happens so quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the flushing, you’ve noticed a faster heartbeat, some slight sweating of the palms, and occasionally a bit of dizziness. That's helpful. Now, Enrique, have you had this happen before, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: Oh, this is not new. I… uh… it started maybe six months ago? It didn't happen much at first. But lately, it's been… more frequent. Before, it was like once a month, maybe. Now… maybe two or three times a week. It’s getting worse, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been happening for about six months and is increasing in frequency. That’s definitely a good reason to get it checked out. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. My wife… she took care of all that. She always remembered everything. I… I don’t have any problems. I go to the temple regularly. I eat mostly vegetables. I… I don’t really go to the doctor much. This flushing… is new. I used to be very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. And it's perfectly alright if you don't have a detailed medical history readily available; we can work with what you remember. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. My wife… she had some trouble with her heart, a few years ago. She was in the hospital then. But me… no. Just the usual… colds, maybe? Nothing serious. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior surgeries or hospitalizations for you. And you’ve generally been healthy, aside from occasional colds. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No pills. My wife… she took some for her blood pressure, but… I don't take anything. I drink a little ginger tea sometimes, for my stomach. But that's it. Nothing the doctor prescribed. I don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements – just occasional ginger tea. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. My wife always asked me that question. She was very careful. I eat… mostly everything. Sometimes spicy food gives me heartburn, but that’s not an allergy. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known allergies. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a hard one. My family… we are from India. We don’t really… talk about medical things much. My mother… she had some trouble with her… stomach, when she was old. My father… he was very strong. He lived a long life. My wife’s family… they had some problems with their… hearts, maybe? But I don’t know details. She handled all of that. It’s not something we discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited information regarding family medical history, with some potential issues with stomachs and hearts on both sides. That's alright, we'll proceed with what we have. Finally, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, no. Never. My wife… she didn’t like any of that. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink. And… I definitely don’t do drugs. Never have. I like a quiet life. Temple, vegetables, a little ginger tea… that’s all. I’m a simple man.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Enrique. That’s very helpful. So, to summarize: you've been experiencing flushing episodes for about six months, increasing in frequency to two or three times a week. These episodes are triggered by spicy food and emotional excitement, last about five to ten minutes, and are accompanied by a faster heartbeat and occasional sweating and dizziness. You have no known medical conditions, allergies, or medications. You’ve never had surgery or been hospitalized and have a limited family medical history. You live a very healthy, quiet lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if there are any obvious signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I want to find out what’s happening. My wife… she would want me to get it checked. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Okay, heart sounds are regular, a little fast now, but that’s likely due to some anxiety. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. We’ll want to monitor that. Skin appears normal, no rashes. I do notice some mild redness in your face currently, even at rest. Alright, everything seems within normal limits, but the elevated blood pressure and the redness are something to consider. I’d like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel – just to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests… okay. My wife… she always said it’s important to know what’s going on inside. Will the tests… hurt?
DOCTOR: No, they won’t hurt at all, Enrique. It’s just a simple blood draw. A nurse will come in and take a small sample of blood from your arm. You might feel a little pinch, but it's very quick. While we’re waiting for the results, and to get a clearer picture, I’m going to tentatively consider a few possibilities. These symptoms – flushing, rapid heartbeat, sweating, dizziness – could be related to several things, including anxiety, a medication side effect , a thyroid issue, or, less commonly, something called rosacea. It's also possible this is related to your blood pressure. That’s why the blood tests are important. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me more about your daily routine?
PATIENT: Okay, no hurt… that’s good. My daily routine… it’s very simple. I wake up early, around six o’clock. I pray at the temple. Then I eat a little breakfast – usually oatmeal or toast. I take a walk in the park, maybe an hour or so. Then I come home and read. I like to read history books. I eat a simple dinner, mostly vegetables. Then I pray again before bed. It’s very quiet. I don’t see many people. I miss my wife. I used to go to the market with her. Now… I just stay home.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Enrique. It's understandable that you miss her. It's a big adjustment losing a loved one. Thank you for sharing your routine with me. It sounds peaceful, but also quite isolated. Sometimes, changes in lifestyle – like less social interaction – can contribute to anxiety, which, as we discussed, could be a factor in your symptoms. Now, I want to be thorough, so let’s go through a quick review of systems. This is just a series of questions to check for any other symptoms you might be experiencing that we haven’t discussed yet. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t weighed myself, but my clothes… they fit the same. I eat mostly the same amount, you understand? Not much change. I don't have much of an appetite, but I still eat. My wife always made sure I ate enough. I think I might have lost a little weight, but it’s not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant weight change. Have you been experiencing any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. And no chills. Sometimes I get a little warm before bed, but that’s just the blankets. And… no, no night sweats. I sleep… okay. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night, but that’s just because I miss my wife. I don’t sweat much when I sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats. How about any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness, aside from what you’ve already mentioned with the flushing?
PATIENT: No headaches. My vision… it’s a little blurry sometimes, but I have glasses. I wear them when I read. And… the dizziness… it only happens when I flush. It’s not all the time. Just a little… lightheaded. Like I might fall, but I never do. It goes away quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision is likely related to your glasses, and the dizziness is only associated with the flushing episodes. Have you noticed any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations, aside from the rapid heartbeat you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: No chest pain. And I don’t get short of breath. My heart… beats fast sometimes, like you said. But it doesn’t… hurt. Just… races. It stops quickly. I walk every day, you know? I try to stay active. My wife always said walking was good for the heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chest pain or shortness of breath. Have you been experiencing any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No. No stomach trouble. I eat mostly vegetables, like I said. And I drink plenty of water. I'm very careful with my diet. My wife… she always said a healthy diet was important. No nausea, no vomiting, no diarrhea, no constipation. Everything… is regular. I haven’t changed my diet much since she passed.
DOCTOR: Okay, no gastrointestinal issues. Finally, have you noticed any joint pain, muscle aches, skin rashes, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No. My joints… sometimes a little stiff in the morning, but that’s just because I’m old. No muscle aches. And I already said no rashes. And… I’m tired sometimes, but that’s just because I miss my wife. It's not… fatigue, exactly. Just… sadness. I sleep okay, but I wake up… missing her. I don't think it's a medical problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, Enrique. Thank you for answering all of those questions so thoroughly. To summarize: you're experiencing flushing episodes accompanied by a faster heartbeat and occasional sweating and dizziness. You’ve noticed no fever, chills, weight changes, headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal issues, joint pain, muscle aches, skin rashes or fatigue. You also mention feeling sadness and missing your wife. Given your symptoms and the examination findings, my initial thought is that a combination of factors might be at play – potentially anxiety, possibly exacerbated by the loss of your wife and the resulting social isolation, alongside a need to monitor your blood pressure. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, which is why I ordered the blood tests. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a few things. First, try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine – perhaps gentle exercise like yoga or tai chi, meditation, or spending time in nature. It sounds like you enjoy walking, which is excellent. Second, if you're comfortable, I'd recommend exploring some support groups or counseling services to help you cope with your grief. I can provide you with some resources. Finally, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the blood test results and adjust the plan as needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. Stress-reducing activities… I used to walk with my wife. Maybe… maybe I can do that again. Support groups… I don't know. It's hard to talk about… But… okay. I’ll try. A follow-up appointment… yes. One week. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I miss my wife very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Enrique. It’s perfectly alright to be hesitant about support groups. There’s no pressure at all. Just know that there are resources available if you feel like you could benefit from them. And I understand how much you miss your wife. Grief is a process, and it's okay to take your time. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood, and then we'll schedule that follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Thank you again. You’ve been very kind. I’ll see you next week. .
