DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi Doctor...Stilaire, right? Look, it's...it’s my stomach. Been bleeding. Not a good time, not a good thing at all. It started a couple days ago, just thought it was something I ate, but it hasn't let up. Frankly, it's a bit messy.
DOCTOR: I see. Bleeding from the stomach is certainly concerning, and I understand your worry. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the bleeding a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? What do you mean specifically? It's…blood. Comes out when I, well, you know. Look, I'm not a doctor, I just know it's not right. It's darker than usual, not bright red like a cut or anything. And there’s…more of it than there should be. Is that specific enough for you? I work with…things all day, I know what normal blood looks like and this isn't it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Gentz. That is helpful. Darker blood can indicate bleeding from higher up in the digestive tract, which is why it’s important we investigate. When you say “a couple of days ago,” can you recall exactly when it started?
PATIENT: Honestly? Tuesday, I think. Yeah, Tuesday morning. I had that lamb shawarma from the place downtown. Usually I’m fine with it, been going there for years, but…maybe it wasn’t fresh? Though I doubt it. They're usually pretty good about that. It was definitely by Tuesday afternoon I noticed it. Look, I’m a simple man, I don't keep calendars about my…bathroom habits. Tuesday. Definitely Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And has the bleeding been constant since Tuesday, or has it varied in amount?
PATIENT: Varied. It was… lighter at first. Just a little. I thought it would pass, you know? But then it got worse. Yesterday was…bad. Today…well, it's still happening. Not as bad as yesterday, but definitely not getting better. It comes and goes, but it's always there, you know? Like a… drip. A slow, unpleasant drip. It's hard to explain. I'm not a doctor. I just know when things aren't right.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. You’re describing a slow, ongoing bleed with some variation in amount. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bleeding?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think. I've been…tired. More tired than usual, I guess. Working with…the deceased takes a lot out of you anyway, but this is different. And…my stomach's been upset. Not just the bleeding, but…cramps. Dull aches, mostly. And I haven't been very hungry. Usually I've got a good appetite. Not much interest in food these days. Everything just feels…off. Does that make sense? I'm not one for complaining, but it's been a rough few days.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Gentz, and thank you for sharing that with me. Tiredness, stomach cramps, and loss of appetite are all symptoms that can be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as ulcers, gastritis, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Gastritis…that ring a bell. Something the old doctor mentioned, years back. Said my stomach lining wasn't happy, something like that. He gave me some pills, I took ‘em for a bit, then stopped. Didn’t seem to be doing much good, to be honest. Ulcers? No, not that I know of. And that…inflammatory business? Never heard of it. I'm a pretty straightforward guy, Doctor. Not much goes wrong with me usually. Mostly just…the work. It's a tough job, takes a toll. Don’t go around getting fancy diseases.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. And have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Surgery…hmm. Let me think. Had my tonsils out when I was a kid, back in Yemen. That’s about it. No other surgeries. Hospitalized…not really. A bad flu once, maybe, but I just stayed home and rode it out. Never been one for doctors or hospitals, if I can avoid it. Always seemed to be a waste of time. Until now, I guess. This bleeding…this is different. It’s…worrying. It feels serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz. And you are right to be concerned about the bleeding. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Nothing. Not a one. I don't like taking pills. Never have. Always try to tough things out myself. Vitamins? Maybe some multivitamins a while back, but I stopped taking those too. Too much fuss. Herbal supplements? No. I don't go for that stuff. Just…water, mostly. And coffee, of course. Gotta have my coffee to get through the day. But that’s it. Nothing else. Plain and simple. I pride myself on being a healthy man, despite what’s going on now. This whole thing is…disappointing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Gentz. And I understand your preference to avoid medication. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as stomach cancer, ulcers, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… tricky. My father, he passed when I was young. Something with his heart, I think. And my mother…she had stomach problems, always complaining of aches and pains. Never really knew what it was. They didn't have much in the way of doctors back then, in Yemen. Just…old wives' tales and herbal remedies. As for cancer or bleeding disorders…I don't recall anyone specifically having those. They didn’t talk about those things much. It wasn’t something you discussed openly. Frankly, most of my family is… gone now. So, it's hard to say for sure. It's not a particularly healthy lineage, if that's what you're asking. Lots of hard work, not much healthcare.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information with me, Mr. Gentz. Now, a few questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Disgusting habit. Alcohol…occasionally, a glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Not often. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I'm a law-abiding man, Doctor. Never been one for trouble. I work hard, I provide for myself, and I try to live a clean life. That’s always been my philosophy. This bleeding…it’s throwing everything off. It’s… unnerving. I don’t like feeling unwell. It’s a sign of weakness, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Mr. Gentz. It's commendable that you prioritize a healthy lifestyle. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing that I know of. I’ve always been pretty resilient, to be honest. I eat just about anything. I can handle spicy food, I don't get sick easily, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. Though, I’m starting to wonder if that constitution is failing me now, with this bleeding. It's… frustrating. I don’t understand why this is happening. I take care of myself, I work hard, and I don’t cause any trouble. I don’t deserve this.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gentz. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to conduct a physical examination. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and I’ll also need to perform a rectal exam to assess the bleeding. I understand this may be uncomfortable, but it's important for me to get a complete picture of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Rectal exam? Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to figure this out, I really do. But…that’s a bit much, isn’t it? I mean, I understand you’re a doctor, but…that’s a very personal examination. And frankly, it’s undignified. I’m a grown man, I know my own body. Can't we just…skip that part? Maybe run some tests instead? Blood work, scans, something less invasive? I'm not trying to be difficult, but that just feels… unnecessary. It’s a bit much, even for a doctor. I’m already feeling weak and vulnerable, and that would just…humiliate me. Please, Doctor. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Gentz, and I absolutely respect your feelings. You are right to voice your concerns. A rectal exam is often helpful in determining the source and severity of gastrointestinal bleeding, allowing me to assess for signs of blood in the stool and identify potential abnormalities. However, it’s not the only avenue for investigation. Given your reluctance, we can proceed without it for now. We will start with a comprehensive blood workup, including a complete blood count to check for anemia, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a coagulation panel to evaluate your blood clotting ability. We can also order a stool sample analysis to check for blood and potential infections. However, please understand that if the blood work and stool analysis are inconclusive, we may need to reconsider the rectal exam, or consider further investigations, such as a colonoscopy, to accurately diagnose the cause of your bleeding. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… Look, I’m not fond of any of this, but if it means avoiding…that other thing, and the colonoscopy sounds… unpleasant, but… alright. Blood work and a stool sample. Let's start with that. As long as we’re avoiding poking around where the sun doesn't shine, I suppose that’s acceptable. But if the tests come back inconclusive, I expect you to be honest with me. Don’t try to push me into anything I’m not comfortable with. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it, without any unnecessary…invasions. Can we get started with the blood work then? The sooner we know something, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Gentz. I understand your concerns, and I will certainly respect your wishes. We will proceed with the blood work and stool sample analysis first, and we will discuss the results thoroughly before considering any further investigations. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions for collecting the stool sample. It's a fairly straightforward process. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Straightforward for you, maybe. But alright. No, I don’t think so. Just tell Sarah to be… gentle with the needle. I’m not a fan of needles, to be honest. And make sure she explains the stool sample thing clearly. I don't want to mess that up. Honestly, this whole situation is… aggravating. I just want to get this over with and get back to work. It’s a tough job, and someone’s got to do it. But I can’t do it if I’m feeling weak and…bloody. Just get the tests done, Doctor. And let's hope they tell us something useful.
DOCTOR: I will certainly convey your wishes to Sarah, Mr. Gentz. She's very experienced and will be as gentle as possible. She'll also provide clear instructions for the stool sample collection. While we wait for Sarah, is there anything else on your mind, any further symptoms you’ve noticed, or any concerns you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Hm. Now that you mention it… My appetite’s been…worse than I thought. I tried to eat something yesterday, just a little bit of rice, but it didn’t sit right. Felt… bloated afterwards. And I've been a bit…winded. Just walking to the bathroom takes more effort than it should. I hadn’t thought much of it, figured it was just the tiredness, but now that you ask… yeah, it’s been worse. Everything feels… off. It's not just the bleeding, it’s like my whole body is shutting down. It’s unsettling, to say the least. It's making me worry, Doctor. And I don't worry easily.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Gentz. Those are both important symptoms to note – the bloating and shortness of breath – and they could certainly be related to your bleeding and overall condition. Bloating could indicate a build-up of fluids in your abdomen, and shortness of breath could be a sign of anemia, which can occur with significant blood loss. We will keep a close eye on these symptoms. Now, one final question, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any dark, tarry stools recently?
PATIENT: Dark, tarry stools…? Now that you mention it… yes. The last couple of days. Not all of them, but… definitely darker than usual. Stickier, too. I just figured it was something I ate. Bad coffee, maybe? But…if you're saying that’s important…? It wasn't bright red, that's for sure. It was…blackish. Like…melted asphalt, I guess. Is that bad? It's all starting to sound very ominous, Doctor. Frankly, I’m getting a bit scared. I just want to get back to normal, but this whole thing is… escalating. It's unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so forthcoming, Mr. Gentz. The dark, tarry stools, known as melena, are a significant finding and strongly suggest bleeding higher up in the gastrointestinal tract – likely in the stomach or duodenum. This, combined with your other symptoms – the bleeding, the bloating, the shortness of breath, and the loss of appetite – is concerning. While we initially planned to start with just blood work, based on this new information, I strongly recommend a more immediate investigation. We can proceed with the blood work as planned, but I believe a colonoscopy is now necessary to determine the source of your bleeding and rule out any serious underlying conditions. Would you be open to discussing that further?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? Look, Doctor, I told you I wasn't fond of poking around where the sun doesn't shine. But…if you're saying it's necessary…if it's the only way to find out what's going on… alright. But I want you to be honest with me. What are we looking for? What's the worst-case scenario? I don't want any surprises. And I want to know exactly what's involved, what the preparation is like, what the risks are. I'm a simple man, Doctor, I just want to know the truth. And I want to get this over with as quickly and painlessly as possible. So, tell me everything. What am I getting myself into?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz, and I commend you for being so open and direct. It’s important to be fully informed. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera attached into your rectum to visualize the entire colon and identify any abnormalities, such as polyps, ulcers, inflammation, or tumors. The worst-case scenario, although rare, could be the discovery of a cancerous growth. However, it’s important to remember that polyps are common and often benign, and early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment if cancer is present. The preparation involves a thorough bowel cleanse to ensure a clear view during the procedure. You’ll need to follow a special liquid diet for 24 hours before the colonoscopy and take a strong laxative to empty your bowels. It’s not pleasant, but it’s essential. The procedure itself is usually performed under sedation, so you won't feel any pain. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes. The risks are relatively low, but they can include bleeding, perforation of the colon, or a reaction to the sedation. We take every precaution to minimize these risks. I understand this is a lot to take in, Mr. Gentz. But based on your symptoms, I believe a colonoscopy is the best course of action to determine the cause of your bleeding and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Sedation… does that mean I won't be… aware of what's going on? Because frankly, the thought of someone poking around down there while I'm conscious is… unsettling, to say the least. And what about after? Will I be able to… function normally afterwards? I have a job, Doctor. I can’t afford to be laid up for weeks. And… if they do find something… what then? What are the treatment options? Surgery? Radiation? I’m not a young man, Doctor. I don’t have a lot of time to waste. I need you to be honest with me. No sugarcoating. What are the chances of this being… serious? And what are the realistic expectations if it is serious? I just want to know the truth, Doctor. Lay it all out for me. Don’t spare me the details. Because frankly, I’m getting a bad feeling about this. A very bad feeling.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask those questions, Mr. Gentz. It's important to be fully informed. Yes, the colonoscopy will be performed under moderate sedation. You won't be fully asleep, but you will be relaxed and comfortable, and you likely won't remember much of the procedure. We will closely monitor your vital signs throughout. Regarding recovery, most patients are able to return to their normal activities within 24-48 hours, although you may experience some mild cramping and bloating. We will provide you with detailed instructions to minimize discomfort. Now, regarding the possibility of finding something serious… it’s impossible to say definitively without performing the colonoscopy. However, based on your symptoms – the bleeding, the dark, tarry stools, the bloating, and the loss of appetite – we need to rule out more serious conditions, such as colon cancer or severe inflammatory bowel disease. If we do find a cancerous growth, the treatment options will depend on the stage of the cancer and your overall health. These options can include surgery to remove the affected portion of the colon, chemotherapy to kill cancer cells, radiation therapy to shrink tumors, and targeted therapies to block cancer growth. I understand this is a lot to process, Mr. Gentz. It's important to remember that early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. We will discuss all of your options in detail if we find anything concerning. Right now, the most important thing is to get the colonoscopy done. It will give us the information we need to make an informed decision about your treatment. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Surgery… chemotherapy… radiation… It's all… too much. I'm an old man, Doctor. I've lived a long life. I don't want to spend my remaining days in a hospital bed, undergoing painful treatments. But… if it's necessary… if it's the only way to get some relief… alright. I'll do it. I'll get the colonoscopy done. But I want you to promise me something. If it turns out to be something serious… if the treatment options are… too invasive… I want you to respect my wishes. I don't want to be kept alive artificially. I want to die with dignity, in my own home, surrounded by my family. Is that too much to ask? Promise me, Doctor. If it comes to that, I want you to respect my wishes.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your concerns completely. It takes courage to face these difficult questions, and I commend you for being so open and honest about your wishes. I absolutely promise you that I will respect your wishes. If the colonoscopy reveals a serious condition, and the treatment options are invasive or offer a poor prognosis, we will discuss all of your options in detail, and I will fully support your decision. You have the right to refuse any treatment, and we will ensure you receive the best possible palliative care if you choose to focus on comfort and quality of life. We will also work with your family to ensure your wishes are honored. Right now, let’s focus on getting the colonoscopy done. It will give us the information we need to make an informed decision about your treatment. We will take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety, and we will support you every step of the way. Now, let’s get the process started. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to discuss the preparation instructions and answer any questions you may have. Do you have any further concerns before we begin?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gentz. I will have Sarah come in shortly to assist you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. .
