DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve noticed some… swelling, and it’s a bit concerning. It’s rather difficult to explain precisely when it started, if I’m honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jahaad. It's common for things to not be perfectly clear when recalling when something began. We'll figure it out together. Could you tell me where you're noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: Primarily… around my jaw, I believe. And perhaps a little on my neck. It’s not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit uncomfortable, if I eat anything too crunchy. It comes and goes, really. Some days it’s barely there, other days… well, like today. I’m not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Jahaad. Fluctuating symptoms are quite common. So, swelling around the jaw and neck, comes and goes, worse with crunchy foods… Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I’ve been feeling… a little more tired than usual, perhaps? It’s hard to say if that’s related, though. I work quite long hours. And… now that you mention it, maybe a slight ache in my ear on the same side as the most noticeable swelling. But again, it's not constant. I really wish I could be more precise! I apologize for my vagueness.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize at all, Jahaad. We're getting there. It's helpful to have any information, even if it's not perfectly clear. Fatigue and an ache in the ear on the same side as the swelling… Okay. And have you had any fever, chills, or any difficulty swallowing or breathing?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills, definitely not. And no difficulty swallowing or breathing, thank goodness. Eating is… manageable, just unpleasant with certain textures. It doesn’t feel like anything is blocked, if that makes sense. It’s more of a… discomfort, a dull ache when I chew. I haven’t lost my appetite, thankfully. I do enjoy my food too much for that!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your appetite. Alright, Jahaad. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your neck and jaw to check for any enlarged lymph nodes or tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement entirely. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I just want to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jahaad. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I do feel some slight swelling along your jawline, particularly on the right side, and a few of the lymph nodes in your neck are a little enlarged and tender to the touch. Nothing dramatically concerning, but enough to warrant further investigation. I'm also noting some mild redness on the skin over the swollen area of your jaw. Do you have any history of recent infections, like a sore throat or dental work?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s where it’s most tender. And you are right to ask about infections. I… I did have a tooth extracted about three weeks ago, now. It was a rather difficult extraction, actually. The dentist mentioned some… inflammation, but assured me it would subside with antibiotics. I took the full course, as prescribed. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as the swelling didn’t appear immediately after, but perhaps that’s relevant? I honestly can’t recall precisely when it began, as I said before. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That is very relevant, Jahaad. It sounds like the swelling may be related to the tooth extraction and the subsequent inflammation. It's not uncommon for swelling and tenderness to persist even after completing a course of antibiotics. To be on the safe side, and to rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order a complete blood count – just to check for signs of infection – and potentially a CT scan of your neck to get a clearer image of the area. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A CT scan and blood work, yes. I'm happy to do whatever you recommend. It's reassuring to have a plan. Will the CT scan involve any… radiation? I try to avoid unnecessary exposure, if possible. And if it’s alright to ask, what are you hoping to find with the scan? I apologize for my inquisitive nature, but I find it helps to understand what's happening.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Jahaad. It’s important to be informed. Yes, a CT scan does involve a small amount of radiation, but we use the lowest dose possible to get a clear image. The benefits of ruling out other potential causes, like a deeper infection or other abnormalities, outweigh the small risk. With the scan, I’m hoping to get a better look at the soft tissues in your neck, particularly around the area where you had the tooth extracted. We'll be looking for any signs of abscess formation, fluid collections, or any involvement of the deeper lymph nodes. I want to be thorough and make sure we’re addressing the root cause of the swelling. We'll get the results back within 24-48 hours, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of a stronger antibiotic, just in case it's a persistent infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… excellent, Doctor. A stronger antibiotic and a CT scan. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease. Yes, please, go ahead with the prescription. And thank you for your patience with my… fragmented recollections. I really do apologize for making your job more difficult. Perhaps I should bring a family member with me next time. .
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Jahaad. It's my job to piece things together, and you've given me plenty to work with. Bringing a family member next time is a great idea, if you think it would be helpful. I’ll have the prescription sent to your pharmacy now. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen before we get the scan results. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way.
