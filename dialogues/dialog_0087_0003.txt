DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I told the girl on the phone, it’s my hand. It shakes. Been happenin’ a while now. Don’t have time for a whole lot of questions, to be honest. Just…shakes. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, I understand you’re experiencing a tremor in your hand. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “A while now” is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me roughly when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Roughly? Geez. I dunno. Years, probably. A long time. Before…before my wife passed. Maybe? It comes and goes, see? Sometimes it’s bad, sometimes it's not. Doesn’t bother me too much, mostly just embarrassing when I try to eat soup. Honestly, I'm not good with dates. Never have been.
DOCTOR: Okay, years, predating your wife’s passing. Intermittent, worse at times, impacting fine motor skills like eating. And it’s primarily in one hand, or both?
PATIENT: It's… this one. Mostly this one, yeah. Sometimes the other one gets a little shaky, but not like this. It’s my right hand, the good one! I used to be able to do things with this hand… used to direct everything, you know? Now… well, never mind.
DOCTOR: Primarily the right hand. And you mentioned directing… were you in a profession where fine motor skills or precision were important?
PATIENT: Look, I was a director. In film, television. Big stuff, you wouldn’t even believe. Lots of… pointing. Important pointing! You gotta be precise when you’re tellin' people what to do. But that was a long time ago. These hands, they built things, you know? Now they just… wobble. Don't see what that has to do with anything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Baide. And knowing your history is helpful. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying the tremor?
PATIENT: Accompanying? What do you mean? Like, does it come with a parade? No. It just… happens. Sometimes it’s worse when I’m nervous, I guess. Or tired. But mostly it's just… there. It’s annoying. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, not a parade, Mr. Baide. I’m trying to determine if there are any other symptoms. For example, have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Stiffness? No. Not really. They… ache sometimes, I suppose. Old age, you know? Everything aches. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. Just… old. What is this, a quiz? I'm not good at quizzes.
DOCTOR: It’s not a quiz, sir. I just need to gather information. Any changes in your handwriting?
PATIENT: Handwriting? Honestly, I haven’t looked at my handwriting in years. Why would I? I have people for that! Used to, I could sign a contract, a whole movie deal, with one flourish. Now? Probably looks like a spider crawled across the page. Don’t bother asking me to demonstrate.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any slowness in your movements generally?
PATIENT: Slowness? What kind of question is that? I'm eighty years old! Everything's a little slower! I can't exactly run a marathon, you know? I move at a reasonable pace for a man my age. Honestly, I’m starting to think this is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. Let's try a quick physical exam, if you’re willing. I just want to assess your reflexes and muscle tone. It won’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I don't like being poked and prodded. Never have. But fine, get it over with. Just… be quick about it. I have things to do. And don't expect me to cooperate much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please extend your arms, palms up. Now, I'm going to gently tap on your tendons to check your reflexes. Just relax. Good. And now, please follow my penlight with your eyes. No need to strain. Hmm. And can you tap your finger to your nose repeatedly with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Now this is ridiculous. I feel like a child at the doctor. Alright, alright, I'm tappin'. There. Happy now? It’s not easy, you know. This hand… it's not what it used to be. Just get on with it! I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Baide. Now, I’m going to palpate your hands and arms, just to check for any tenderness or rigidity. There’s a slight tremor at rest, as we’ve observed, and some rigidity, particularly in the right hand. No acute tenderness. Based on this brief examination, your symptoms—the tremor, rigidity, and slowness of movement—are suggestive of a possible essential tremor or, less likely, early Parkinson’s disease. It's too early to say definitively.
PATIENT: Parkinson's?! Parkinson’s?! Now hold on a minute! My father had that… it was awful. No, no, that can’t be. I just have a shaky hand! I've always been perfectly fine! What are you suggesting?! Don’t tell me I'm gonna end up… like him.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, please. It’s far too early to make a diagnosis. Many conditions can cause tremors. We need further testing to determine the cause. I’m going to order a neurological consultation with Dr. Anya Sharma, she's an excellent specialist. And I’m also ordering a DAT scan, which will help us visualize the dopamine transporters in your brain. That will help us rule out Parkinson’s, or confirm it. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Dopamine…transporters… Honestly, you doctors and your fancy words! Fine. Fine, whatever you think is best. Just… get it over with. And don’t expect me to understand any of it. And make sure this Dr. Sharma is good. I don't want just anyone poking around in my brain. And hurry up, will you? I'm losing patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Here's the referral to Dr. Sharma. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. The DAT scan will require a separate order from radiology; I’m submitting that now. I’m also prescribing a low dose of propranolol to help manage the tremor while you wait for the consultation. It's a beta-blocker that can sometimes reduce tremor severity. Finally, I’ll need you to complete a brief questionnaire about your symptoms and medical history. It will help Dr. Sharma prepare for your appointment. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Propranolol… beta-blocker… Another pill to take, great. And a questionnaire? Really? I already told you everything. Fine. Just… get me out of here. I don't like hospitals. Or doctors. Or pills. And I certainly don't like answering questions. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Baide. Please let the receptionist know if you have any difficulty scheduling the appointment. I wish you all the best. Stop.
