DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I’m Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Hmm… my wife, she want… baby. We old, you know? But she still want. I think… she want me to be… strong enough? For baby. I make little things with metal, plastic. Not strong like… before. Maybe you can help?
DOCTOR: I see. So, your wife desires to become pregnant, and you’re concerned about your… physical capabilities?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Exactly. I not so young. I make models. Very small work. Not… running, jumping. My body… slow. She say maybe something wrong. Maybe I need… check? I forget what she say. Something about… make sure all okay? Before… baby come.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good you're thinking about this proactively. It is important to ensure you're in good health if you're considering starting a family, regardless of age. Let’s start with some basics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical… that is… hard to remember. Long time ago, in… Somalia, maybe? I think… I had fever, very bad. But they give me… something. I forget the name. Here… in this country… I go to doctor when I hurt my hand, making models. Small cut. Nothing big. I think I have… pressure, sometimes. High blood pressure, my wife say. She worry a lot. But I feel okay most times. Do you… write it down? Maybe you know?
DOCTOR: Let me pull up your records… Ah, yes. I see a note from 2018 regarding a hand laceration, as you mentioned. And, yes, there is a history of hypertension, diagnosed in 2019, currently managed with…amlodipine, 5mg daily. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Amlodi… something? Yes, yes, the little white pill. Every morning. My wife, she make sure. I forget sometimes. But she… very good at remembering. She say it’s for the… the push. The pressure. She say it's important. Is that… bad for baby? I worry about that. If the little white pill… not good.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal to be on medication while trying to conceive, Mr. Carlotta. However, uncontrolled high blood pressure is far more dangerous during pregnancy than a properly managed condition. We need to make sure your blood pressure is stable. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family—parents, siblings—had heart problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… Somalia, very far away. Long time ago. I think… my father, he had… weak legs. Old age, I think. Not running, not walking so good. My mother… she strong woman. Very strong. No… problems, that I know. My brother… he gone. Long time ago. I forget how. But he… healthy man. I think. Maybe. It’s… hard to remember. So many years. Do you… need to know more? About my family in… Africa?
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to have that information, Mr. Carlotta, but vague recollections aren’t particularly useful. Alright. Let’s focus on you, now. Besides the high blood pressure medication, are you taking any other pills, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, no pills. Only the little white one, for pressure. And… sometimes, my wife give me… fish oil? For the brain. She say I forget things. Is good for the brain, she say. Small yellow pill. But not every day. Just… when she remember. And… no, that is all. I drink tea. Lots of tea. And eat… rice. My wife cook very good rice. But not… medicine. Only tea and rice. And the little white and yellow pills sometimes. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fish oil, occasionally. Okay. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never smoke. My wife… she no like smoke. Alcohol… sometimes, small glass of wine, with dinner. Very small. Only on… special days. Birthday, maybe. Or… holiday. But not every day. And… no, no other things. I make models. Not… party. Not… those things. I very quiet man. Just models, tea, rice, and my wife. Is all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Carlotta, while I appreciate you sharing this information, it’s becoming clear that your recall is… less than precise. Before we proceed with any discussions about family planning, we need a more comprehensive assessment of your overall health. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam and order some blood work. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Exam… and blood. If that help. I want to make my wife happy. If blood and exam… make sure I strong enough… for baby. Then… okay. Whatever you think, Doctor. I trust you. But… it hurt? The blood… and exam?
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a small prick, Mr. Carlotta. A minor discomfort. The physical exam is… routine. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perform a basic neurological assessment. Nothing to be concerned about. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please take a seat and relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I sit. Relax… I try. But… my mind, she wander. Somalia, long ago. Models… my wife. Is hard to relax. But… I sit. You… do the thing. The blood pressure. Whatever you need. I trust you. But… tell me if it hurt. Just a little… tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally, Mr. Carlotta. 150 over 92. Not ideal. As I suspected. A bit elevated, as your wife has probably told you. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Please place your hands on your lap, palms up. Reflexes are… diminished. That could be age-related, or indicative of a neurological issue. We’ll need further testing to determine the cause. Now, I'm going to need a blood sample to check your kidney function, liver function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol wipes?
PATIENT: No latex… I think. My wife, she buy everything. I no ask. And… alcohol wipe… small sting? I feel small sting on hand sometimes. But… no big allergy. Just… small sting. She use it when I hurt my finger, making models. Is okay. Small sting. Not allergy. But… maybe tell my wife? When she come? She know everything. About allergy. About… everything. But small sting, Doctor. Not allergy.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll proceed with the blood draw. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Based on this preliminary exam and your medical history, there are several areas we need to investigate further before we can determine if you are fit to conceive. Your blood pressure is elevated, your reflexes are diminished, and your overall recall is… unreliable. We need to rule out any underlying neurological conditions, assess your kidney and liver function, and ensure your cholesterol levels are within a healthy range. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG. Additionally, I recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more thorough evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neurologist… that is… brain doctor? Many tests? Is… scary? My wife, she worry so much. She say I need to be strong. But… so many tests. So many doctors. I understand… you say. About blood and tests. But… scary. Is bad for my heart, all the worry? Can I… talk to my wife? Before… all the tests? Maybe she understand better. Maybe she ask good questions. I… I no understand so much.
DOCTOR: A neurologist specializes in the brain and nervous system, Mr. Carlotta. And yes, there will be further testing. It's standard procedure. I understand your wife is concerned, and it’s perfectly reasonable to discuss this with her. However, I need you to understand the importance of these evaluations. Worrying is detrimental, but delaying necessary testing is far more harmful. Look, I’m not trying to frighten you, but we need to be proactive. I’ll order the tests now. The lab will contact your wife to schedule an appointment. I also have a referral form for a neurologist. I suggest she call to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. In the meantime, continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And please, try to reduce your stress levels. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… no more questions now. Too much… many things. I… tell my wife. She know what to do. She always know. Blood, tests, brain doctor… She handle it. I… I just want to make baby. If I can. If I strong enough. Tell my wife. She handle it. Thank you, Doctor. I go now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have your wife contact the clinic to schedule the necessary appointments.
