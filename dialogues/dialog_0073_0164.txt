DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired and…yellowish, I guess you could say. It started a few days ago, and I think it has something to do with fava beans. I ate some with dinner last week and then started feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Fava beans, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, fava beans. My mother used to make a stew with them, and I hadn’t had them in years, so I thought I’d try it. But now…well, now I’m just feeling awful. It's not just the tiredness and the color of my skin, either. I feel a bit weak, too.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And when you say "yellowish," where are you noticing this discoloration?
PATIENT: Oh, um…well, mostly my skin, I think. And the whites of my eyes. It’s hard to say exactly, but my daughter noticed it first. She said I looked…pale and a bit yellow. She’s very observant, thankfully. I hadn’t even realized it at first.
DOCTOR: Right. And besides the fatigue, weakness, and the yellowing…any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! My pee has been really dark, like tea colored. And… I think my stomach has been a bit upset, too. Not full-blown sick, just…not right. Kind of nauseous sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up.
DOCTOR: Dark urine and nausea... Okay. Have you experienced any pain, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not really. Just…uncomfortable. And really, really tired. It's the tiredness that's the worst part, I think. It’s hard to get anything done when you feel like you’ve run a marathon and haven’t slept for a week.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t have any major health problems. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was years ago. I’m generally quite healthy, to be honest. I try to eat well, I walk every day… It’s just…this has been very strange and sudden. I don’t usually get sick. Do you think it is the fava beans? It sounds silly, saying it’s the beans, but that’s the only thing I’ve changed recently.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to consider dietary factors, Ms. Haggar. Though it's rarely just the beans. Now, have you ever been told you have any…blood disorders, anemia perhaps?
PATIENT: Anemia? No, I don’t think so. No one has ever told me that. I’ve had blood tests before, with my regular doctor, but they always said everything was fine. I don’t even know what anemia is, really. Is that something serious? Could that explain why I’m so tired? Because that really is the biggest problem.
DOCTOR: Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells, yes. It can cause fatigue, among other things. Now, let’s move on to family history. Do any of your relatives have similar issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, he was always… pale. And he was often tired, I remember that. But he was an old man, so we just thought it was old age. No one ever talked about anything like… a blood problem. My mother, she’s still alive and healthy, as far as I know. No problems with her. I really don’t think so. It’s just… strange. I’m starting to get worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever I need to. I just want to figure out what’s wrong and feel better again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It doesn’t hurt when you press. Just… feels a little sensitive, maybe. Not pain, like a sharp ache, but…just not quite right. Is that normal? I sometimes feel a little bloated, too, but I thought that was just because of the stew I ate. Oh, that’s a little uncomfortable. There. Just a bit.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your liver and spleen…seem a little enlarged. Not dramatically, but noticeable. And your sclera – the whites of your eyes – are indeed slightly yellow, as your daughter noted. I’m also noting some pallor. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a bilirubin level. We’ll need to rule out a few possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Enlarged… everything? What possibilities are we ruling out, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm getting quite worried now. I just want to feel normal again. And what about the fava beans? Do you still think they have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: It’s premature to panic, Ms. Haggar. The tests will give us a clearer picture. Enlargement can be caused by a number of things, not all serious. And as for the fava beans… they could be contributing. There’s a genetic condition called G6PD deficiency, which can cause hemolytic anemia triggered by certain foods, including fava beans. That's what we need to investigate. We'll also rule out other liver and gallbladder issues. I’m going to have the lab draw those tests now. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Oh, G6PD…that sounds complicated. I've never heard of it. No, I don’t have any allergies to medication, thankfully. None that I know of, anyway. I can take most things without a problem. Is it a long process to get the results back, Doctor? I have a bit of a trip planned next week, and I'm hoping I'll be able to go.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within 24-48 hours. Until then, I advise against any strenuous activity and…perhaps reconsider your trip, just to be safe. We need to know what we’re dealing with before you travel. I’ll have the lab technician give you the instructions for fasting before the tests. Do you have any questions for me right now, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… and maybe cancel my trip… Oh dear. That’s…disappointing. But I understand. Safety first, I suppose. Fasting… okay, I can do that. Um… well, just one question. What if it is this G6PD deficiency? Is it…curable? Or is it something I’ll have to live with?
DOCTOR: G6PD deficiency isn’t “curable” in the traditional sense, Ms. Haggar. It’s a genetic condition, meaning you’re born with it. However, it’s often manageable with certain lifestyle changes – avoiding trigger foods like fava beans, certain medications, and chemicals. Most people live perfectly normal lives with a proper diagnosis and careful avoidance. I’ll explain everything in detail once we have the test results. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. The lab technician will call you when your results are available. .
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Avoiding things… I can do that. I think. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. I’ll go find the lab technician, then. And I'll wait for the call.
