DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I am Dr. Hembrey. It says here you're with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our practice. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s Sharifa. And honestly, it’s ridiculous I even have to be here. I just got over a little cold – nothing major, you understand – and now my legs feel like jelly. Like I might just…collapse. It's quite inconvenient, really. I'm a tour guide, you know. Can't very well show people around if I can't stand.
DOCTOR: A little cold, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little cold. Runny nose, a bit of a cough – the usual. Nothing that would require a visit, certainly. I usually just tough it out with some tea and rest. But then, a couple of days ago, I went to walk, and…well, my legs just weren’t there. It wasn't painful, just…weak. Like they’re filled with water or something. It’s very unsettling, Doctor. And frankly, a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. However, even seemingly minor illnesses can sometimes lead to unexpected complications. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. When you say your legs feel weak, can you describe that feeling in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, details. Fine. It's not like I have all day to analyze my leg muscles, but I suppose I can try. It’s…hard to explain. It's not a burning weakness, or a cramping weakness. It’s just…heavy. Like I’m trying to lift weights with my legs constantly. And unstable. I feel like I’m going to stumble, even when I'm just standing still. It's mostly in my thighs, I think, but it’s creeping down towards my knees. Does that make any sense? Honestly, it’s just…not normal. I've never felt anything like it, and I’ve had plenty of colds in my life.
DOCTOR: Alright, "heavy" and unstable, primarily in the thighs, radiating towards the knees. And this began a couple of days after the resolution of your cold symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The cold itself was…let’s say five days ago? Six? Something like that. And I felt completely fine for a day or two after it cleared up. Then, yesterday morning, I went to get ready for a tour, and that's when I noticed it. It wasn’t sudden, exactly. More of a gradual…giving way. I thought maybe I hadn't slept well, but it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s actually a bit worse this morning, if I’m being honest. I had to practically drag myself here. Honestly, I’m not one to complain, but it's rather concerning.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, while I appreciate your attempts to minimize this, these symptoms do warrant investigation. We need to rule out several possibilities. Let’s start with a basic review of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions—diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, please. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I walk all day for my tours. Do you think I could do that if I had…what did you say, diabetes? No. Absolutely not. My mother had some…trouble with her blood pressure when she was older, but that was her. I get a yearly check-up, everything is always fine. I eat reasonably well, though admittedly, sometimes the food options on tours aren't the best. But nothing serious. Really, I suspect it's just some lingering effect of the cold. A nerve thing, perhaps? I’m not a doctor, but that’s my theory. Though, I do appreciate you…investigating, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve managed to avoid all that, thankfully. I believe in taking care of myself, Doctor. A good diet, plenty of exercise – the usual. I broke my arm when I was a child, climbing a mango tree, but that’s it. A simple fracture, nothing serious. It healed perfectly. I don't go in for all these…medical interventions unless absolutely necessary. Honestly, it seems like everyone is always trying to get you to take a pill for something these days. It’s rather alarming, really. But no, no surgeries, no hospital stays. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Though currently experiencing this…inconvenient weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure all this is necessary? My mother lived to be eighty-five, and she was mostly fine until the very end. A little arthritis, some trouble with her memory, but nothing major. My father…well, he wasn't very good at taking care of himself, if I’m honest. Smoked too much, drank too much. He passed away young. And my siblings are all…average. No heart problems, no diabetes, no…whatever else you’re looking for. Just normal people. Honestly, I don't think there's anything in my family history that's relevant. It’s a perfectly ordinary family. A bit dramatic, perhaps, but certainly not prone to any serious illnesses. It really just feels like a fluke, Doctor. A lingering effect of the cold. Can we please focus on getting me back to work? I have a tour tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your frustration, but a thorough history is crucial, even if you believe it is unremarkable. Now, let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. I told you, I don’t believe in all that. A little tea when I’m feeling unwell, that’s it. Maybe some vitamin C during cold season, but that’s about it. I prefer to let my body heal naturally. All these medications just have side effects, you know? And then you have to take more medications to counteract the side effects. It’s a vicious cycle! No, I don’t take any regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. I’m a perfectly healthy person, as I’ve repeatedly stated. Though currently experiencing this…rather inconvenient leg weakness. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to think there’s nothing wrong with me at all. Perhaps I just need some rest. Can we please consider that as a possibility?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, with all due respect, your insistence that this is "nothing" is making it difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Allergies now? Really, Doctor? It's becoming quite the interrogation. No, I don't have any allergies. Never have. I eat everything. I've traveled all over the world, tried all sorts of foods, and I've never had a reaction. No hives, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Perfectly fine. I'm not allergic to anything. Absolutely nothing. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite insulted that you’re implying there's something seriously wrong with me. It’s a little cold, Doctor, a little cold. And now my legs feel weak. It’s not exactly a medical emergency. Can we please just focus on finding a simple solution? Perhaps some physical therapy? Or maybe just a good night’s sleep? I have a tour tomorrow, you know. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical exam, then. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. I also want to listen to your heart and lungs, just to rule out anything obvious. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Oh, fine. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. Honestly, I’ve never understood the point of all these…tests. It just feels like poking and prodding for no reason. But very well, do whatever you need to do. Just…be gentle, please. And try to hurry. I have a tour tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in…and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Right leg…and now the left. Both reflexes are present and equal, though a bit diminished. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you resist me pushing down on your thigh like this?
PATIENT: Honestly, it's not exactly a struggle. You're barely pushing. But very well. It's…difficult, I suppose. Not painful, just…heavy. Like I'm trying to lift something incredibly dense. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a muscle weakness, exactly. It’s more like…a lack of power. Like the engine is sputtering. And it’s mostly in my thighs, as I said before. It’s creeping down towards my knees, but it’s not as pronounced there. Honestly, I’m not sure what you’re hoping to find. It’s just…weakness. Plain and simple. And it’s getting rather tiring, lying here being poked and prodded. Can we please move on? I have a tour tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to palpate your thighs…feeling for any tenderness or swelling. Hmm…There is some slight tenderness on the medial aspect of both thighs, but no obvious swelling or warmth. Now, can you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Oh, careful now. It’s rather unsteady. See? It’s just…weak. Like I’m going to fall over any minute. Honestly, it’s quite alarming. It’s not a sharp pain, or anything like that. It’s more of a…wobbling sensation. Like my legs are made of jelly. And it’s getting worse the longer I stand. Honestly, Doctor, I think you need to take me seriously. This is not just a little cold. Something is definitely wrong. Can we please get some answers? I have a tour tomorrow, you know. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few steps, if you can. That’s good. I noticed a slight waddle to your gait, and some weakness with dorsiflexion of your feet. Your reflexes are diminished, and now with the gait assessment, I'm noting weakness. It’s concerning. I'm going to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level—to rule out any underlying deficiencies or infections. Also, an MRI of your lumbar spine is needed to assess for any nerve compression. Ms. Firestone, I understand your concerns about missing your tour, but we need to investigate this further. These symptoms are not typical of a simple cold, and we need to rule out more serious possibilities.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Blood work and an MRI. Just what I needed. Honestly, it’s always something, isn't it? First, it’s nothing, then it’s everything. I swear, doctors just like to make things complicated. And an MRI? That’s going to take hours, and it’s terribly uncomfortable. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I suppose…I suppose I have no choice. But I’m telling you, it’s going to ruin my tour. It’s a very important tour, you know. A group from Germany. They’ve been looking forward to it for months. Honestly, I’m starting to get quite upset. And what about the results? How long will it take? I need to know if I can still lead the tour. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. A very good reputation.
DOCTOR: The blood work results should be available within 24-48 hours. The MRI will take longer to schedule, likely within the next week, and the results will take another 24-48 hours. I understand your concerns about your tour, Ms. Firestone, and I’ll do my best to expedite the process. However, we need to get a clear diagnosis before we can determine if it’s safe for you to lead it. In the meantime, I recommend you refrain from any strenuous activity, including leading tours. I’m going to write you a prescription for a short course of muscle relaxants to help with the discomfort, and I’ll provide a referral to a physical therapist for evaluation and treatment once we have the MRI results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxants? Honestly, that sounds…cloudy. I need to be alert for my tours, you know. I have to be quick-witted and engaging. I can't be…drowsy. And physical therapy? That's going to take weeks, maybe months! Honestly, it's a disaster. But…very well. I suppose I have no choice. But if I miss this tour, it's on your head, Doctor. A very important tour, you know. So, what do I need to do? Where do I go for the blood work? And for this…MRI? And what about the physical therapist? I need specifics, Doctor. I don’t have time to waste running around aimlessly. And please, tell me they don't require me to wear one of those ridiculous hospital gowns. Honestly, it's mortifying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. The blood work can be done at any Quest Diagnostics location. I will print out a requisition form for you. As for the MRI, I will have the scheduling department contact you directly to arrange an appointment at a facility convenient for you. They will explain the preparation process. As for the gown, I cannot guarantee that you will not be required to wear one, but I will make a note on your referral requesting that it be avoided if possible. Here is the blood work requisition. I’ll also provide you with a list of recommended physical therapists in the area, and the scheduling department’s contact information. They will also coordinate the MRI appointment. Do you have any questions about the requisition form or the contact information?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Quest Diagnostics, you say? I’ve heard…mixed reviews. Well, fine. I suppose I have no choice. And the scheduling department? Honestly, I dread dealing with bureaucracy. So, what should I tell them? What exactly do I need to say to get an appointment quickly? And what about the MRI itself? Is it painful? Claustrophobic? I’ve heard horror stories. Honestly, Doctor, you’re not reassuring me at all. This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. I need specifics, Doctor. Clear, concise specifics. I have a tour to plan, you know. A very important tour.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, I understand your anxieties. When you contact the scheduling department, simply inform them you have a referral from Dr. Hembrey for an MRI of the lumbar spine. They will handle the details and find the earliest available appointment. As for the MRI itself, it is generally painless. You will lie on a table inside a large magnet, and it can be somewhat noisy. Some people do experience claustrophobia, but the technicians are trained to accommodate those concerns. They can provide earplugs and, in some cases, even mild sedation if necessary. The main thing is to remain still during the scan, as any movement can affect the image quality. This handout contains more detailed information about the procedure, including what to expect and how to prepare. It also includes contact information for the radiology department if you have any further questions. I assure you, the technicians are highly skilled and will do everything they can to make you comfortable. We are taking this seriously and will work together to determine the cause of your symptoms. .
