DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this nausea, see? Been happening most mornings now, for a few weeks. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. Especially with my heart, you know? Makes me worry it’s somethin’ serious.
DOCTOR: I understand. Nausea, especially when you have concerns about your heart, is definitely unsettling. We'll get to the bottom of this. To start, can you tell me a little more about this nausea?
PATIENT: Aye. Right. Well, it usually starts soon after I wake up, before I’ve even had a chance to get a proper cup o’ tea. It’s not… violent, if you know what I mean. Not chuckin’ up, thankfully. Just a really queasy feeling, and a bit of… a cold sweat sometimes. It usually lasts an hour or so, then fades away. But it's enough to ruin me appetite for the rest o’ the mornin’. I've noticed it seems worse if I lie flat for too long. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Mr. Benic. And it’s helpful to know it’s not accompanied by vomiting, and that it seems related to lying flat. You mentioned it affects your appetite for the rest of the morning. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea – anything like abdominal pain, changes in your bowel movements, dizziness, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Aye, I have, actually. Now that you mention it… I have been a wee bit dizzy now and then, mostly when I stand up quickly. Not fallin’ over dizzy, just… a bit light-headed. And, I’ve not been weighin’ myself, but my trousers feel a bit looser than usual, so I suppose I might have lost a bit o’ weight. I haven’t been feelin’ up to cookin’ much with the nausea, so I’m likely not eatin’ as much as I used to. No pain, though. Not in me belly, not anywhere. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. The dizziness upon standing and the unintentional weight loss are important things to note. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – perhaps anything related to your heart, as you mentioned?
PATIENT: Aye, that I do. I have heart failure, diagnosed about five years ago now. It’s… managed, mostly. I take a few medications for it – ramipril, bisoprolol, and furosemide, if that means anything to you. I see the cardiologist every six months or so, and they say it’s stable. I also have a touch of arthritis in me knees, but that's just a nuisance. Other than that… I’ve not been terribly ill, thankfully. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothin’ major.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heart failure managed with ramipril, bisoprolol and furosemide, and arthritis in your knees. Good to know you're under the care of a cardiologist. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than routine matters?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had me appendix out when I was a young lad, back in ‘68, but that was it. And a wee overnight stay once when I broke me wrist fallin’ off a ladder, but nothin’ serious. Otherwise, I’ve been lucky enough to avoid the inside of a hospital, to be honest. I try to stay active, walk the dog every day, you see. Keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, staying active is very important. Now, thinking about your family... is there anyone in your family with a history of heart problems, stomach issues, or anything else significant medically?
PATIENT: Aye, there is, actually. Me father had a bad heart, and he ended up needin’ a bypass operation when he was in his sixties. And me mother… she suffered from terrible indigestion her whole life, always complainin' about a burnin’ sensation in her chest. The doctor said it was acid reflux, but she never really got it under control. And me brother… he has diabetes, type 2, but that's about it, I think. I’ve never been tested for it myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems, acid reflux, and type 2 diabetes. Good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a proper allergic reaction, thankfully. I can eat most things, and I’ve never had any trouble with medications. I've been on these heart pills for years, as I said, and never had any issues. I do get a bit of a stuffy nose sometimes in the spring, but that's just hay fever, I think. Not an allergy, exactly, more of an annoyance. Is that all right? I'm tryin' to remember everything!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Benic, you're doing very well. No known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that's fine by me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to bein' poked and prodded, with the heart condition and all. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. Though, warn me if you're gonna touch me knees, they're a bit creaky!
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be gentle with your knees. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 88 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight murmur, which is consistent with your history of heart failure. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. I notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Alright, Mr. Benic, everything seems stable, but the ankle swelling and elevated blood pressure are things we need to address. The nausea is concerning enough to investigate further. Do you mind if I order a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid levels?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood test is fine by me. Kidney function, electrolytes, and thyroid… all right. I don’t mind at all. Just tell me where I need to go, and I’ll get it done. And thank you for explainin' it all so clearly. It puts me mind at ease a bit, knowin' you're lookin' into it. Especially the ankles, they’ve been a bit puffy lately. Is that somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I can put your mind at ease. The ankle swelling can be related to your heart failure, as fluid can build up in your body when the heart isn't pumping as efficiently. However, it's important to rule out other causes as well, which is why we're doing the blood test. Here’s a form with instructions for the blood draw. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’ll need this form, and it's best to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – so no breakfast before you go. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds perfect, Doctor. Fast for eight hours… I can manage that. I’m used to early mornings anyway. Room 203, right. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. And thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. It means a lot. I’ll head down to the lab now then, and get it sorted. Just let me know if there’s anything else I need to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm happy to help. No, that's all for now. Just head to the lab when you’re ready, and they'll take good care of you. We'll be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
