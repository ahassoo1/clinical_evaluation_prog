DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Blim. I see you’re 86 years young. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, doctor. Waste time? I no waste time. They told me come for check, after… after all that dust at the mine. No sickness, mind you. Just… check. They payin’ for it.
DOCTOR: A “check” after dust exposure at a mine. Very well. Although, I assure you, a comprehensive medical evaluation is never a waste of time. Tell me, Mr. Bigger, how long have you been working at this mine?
PATIENT: Long time. Too long, maybe. Fifty years… maybe more. I lose track these days. Started when I was just a young man, strong as an ox. Now… well, now I just do the work. Loadin' and movin', that’s what I do. Not much choice, you know? Gotta eat.
DOCTOR: Fifty years of dust exposure… an exceedingly long duration. And were you provided with, and did you consistently use, any respiratory protection during this time?
PATIENT: Respiratory… what now? You talkin’ ‘bout mask? Sometimes. When the foreman tell us. Not always comfortable, you know. Hot, make you sweat. And… and sometimes they didn’t have enough for everyone. We got work to do! Can’t be messin’ with masks all day. Besides, I been breathin’ dust my whole life. Never hurt me yet.
DOCTOR: “Inconsistent respiratory protection.” A predictable oversight. And have you experienced any changes in your breathing recently, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Changes? No. I breathe. It go in, it go out. Same as always. That cough? Old cough. Always had it. Dust, probably. Like I said, I breathe dust! What you expect? You want me to not breathe?
DOCTOR: Let's attempt a more precise assessment, shall we?
PATIENT: Assessment? You gonna poke and prod me now? Look, I ain’t got all day, doctor. And I ain't good with fancy pokin’ and proddin’. Just tell me if I’m okay or not. That’s all I need to know. I got things to do. Things a man gotta do.
DOCTOR: Very well. A brief auscultation then. Please remove your shirt and take a seat. This will allow me to listen to your lungs, and determine if there are any… irregularities. Do you have any discomfort in your chest?
PATIENT: Irregularities? What kind of irregularities? Look, doc, I'm an old man, things ain't regular anywhere no more. No, no chest pain. Just…old. Everything is just old. You gotta be quick with this, alright? My shoulders ache when I take my shirt off. This is a bother.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and again. I detect some… diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes, bilaterally. And some mild wheezing. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or chronic bronchitis, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bron-what-now? No, no doctor never told me no fancy names like that. I just… cough sometimes. When the dust is bad. And when it’s cold. And when I’m tired. It's just a cough, doc! I told you! Old man cough. This ain't nothin’ serious. I can still work, you know. Still strong. Mostly.
DOCTOR: "Old man cough" is rarely benign after decades of dust exposure. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, Mr. Bigger?
PATIENT: Shortness of… well, sometimes when I climb the stairs. But who doesn’t get a little winded climbin' stairs at my age? It ain’t nothin’ to worry about. Just…slowin' down, that's all. Happens to everyone eventually. You makin' a big deal outta nothin’, doc. A man’s gotta live his life. And I gotta work to live.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, while I understand your desire to continue working, we must address these respiratory symptoms. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests. These will give us a clearer picture of the extent of any lung damage. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Not that I know of. Never taken much. Bit of painkiller for my shoulder now and then. Dust usually takes care of most aches, you know. Builds character. X-ray? Tests? More pokin' and proddin'? What’s the point, doc? You just gonna tell me I'm old and full of dust? I already know that! Fine. Do your tests. But don't expect miracles. And don't tell me I gotta stop workin'. I need that money.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will escort you to the radiology department. I will review the results and contact you with a plan. However, I must strongly advise against strenuous activity until we have a definitive diagnosis. Ignoring these symptoms could lead to irreversible lung damage. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Irreversible… Fine, fine. I hear you. Less…strenuous. But I still gotta do somethin’. Can’t just sit around and… rot. I’ll be careful. Always am. Now, can I put my shirt back on? It’s chilly in here. And this talkin’ about irreversible… it’s makin’ my shoulder ache worse. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will assist you. Please be sure to follow up with your primary care physician as well. Decades of exposure… predictable. Utterly predictable.
