DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Asami, you said? Hmm. Well, it’s not that I want to be here, you understand. My niece, bless her heart, insisted. She said I needed to “get this sorted.” Sorted! Like I’m a pile of laundry. It’s about… well, they want me to have… things done. Things I don't need.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. It sounds like there’s some concern from your niece about your health, and perhaps some recommendations that you’re not comfortable with. That’s perfectly alright. We'll take things at your pace. Could you tell me a little more about what "things" they want you to have done?
PATIENT: Oh, it was a whole parade of… tests, mostly. And then… some man kept talking about “interventions.” Interventions! Like I’m an addict or something. Honestly, the nerve! Something about my feet, I think. They said they weren't… optimal. But they feel fine to me. Mostly. A little ache now and then, what do you expect at my age? I've lived a long life, you know. A long life.
DOCTOR: A long life indeed! That’s wonderful, Wynell. And it’s completely reasonable to be hesitant about tests or procedures you don’t feel you need. So, it sounds like the concern is primarily with your feet. You mentioned a little ache now and then. Can you tell me more about that ache?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand? More of a… dull throb. Comes and goes. Mostly when I’ve been standing for a while. Or if I wear the wrong shoes. My niece keeps buying me these… sensible shoes. They look like boxes! And they don't help, honestly. It aches regardless. It's just… old age creeping in, I suppose. You can't stop the tide, can you? I remember when I could dance all night…
DOCTOR: No, you can't stop the tide, Wynell. And it's perfectly normal to experience aches and pains as we get older. It's good that you're able to describe it as a dull throb that comes and goes, and that it's worse with standing or the wrong shoes. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me where exactly on your feet you feel this ache?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Everywhere, really. No, no, not everywhere everywhere. But mostly… the bottom of my feet, I think. And my heels, a little. It’s hard to pinpoint, honestly. They all sort of… blend together. It’s like… a general discomfort. You know? I haven’t really looked at my feet in years. Not closely, anyway. What’s the point? They just carry me around.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Wynell. A general discomfort in the bottom of your feet and heels. It's very common for those areas to become sore as we get older. I’d like to take a quick look at your feet, if you don’t mind. Just a visual exam to see if I can identify anything obvious going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must you? I suppose… if you have to. I don't like anyone fussing with my feet. They’re… private, you know? But… alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle. And don’t take too long. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. With the ladies.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. I’ll be as gentle as possible and won’t take long. Okay, I see some dryness and a little bit of callusing on your heels, which is very common. Your toenails appear a bit thick, which can also happen with age, and there’s some mild swelling in the ankles. I also notice a slight inward curve to your arches. Do you experience any pain when I gently press here?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, you’re poking around a lot! Yes! That’s… a bit tender, actually. Not terrible pain, but… noticeable. It’s like… a dull ache, again. Everything seems to be a dull ache these days. My niece said something about… flat feet. Is that what this is? Flat feet? Honestly, it sounds ridiculous. I used to be able to run for miles! It's just age, Doctor. Plain and simple. Don't go making mountains out of molehills.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Wynell, and I apologize if I caused any pain. You're right, it's likely a combination of age and some natural changes in the foot structure. You mentioned your niece saying something about flat feet. What you're describing—the inward curve and the tenderness—could suggest a degree of arch flattening, which is also known as pes planus. It’s quite common, and the severity can vary. However, it doesn’t necessarily cause problems for everyone. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your overall health. Have you ever had any problems with your joints – like arthritis, for example?
PATIENT: Oh, arthritis… My mother had something awful with her hands. Couldn’t even hold a teacup, poor woman. I don't think I've ever been diagnosed with anything. The doctor… back in the day… he just told me to keep moving. “Use it or lose it,” he said. A little stiffness now and then, especially in the mornings. But who doesn’t have that at my age? I've always been active, you know. Walking, gardening… trying to keep busy. I certainly don't want to end up like my mother.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you’ve been staying active, Wynell. That’s very important. It’s understandable that you’re concerned about your mother’s condition, and it’s good you’re aware of your family history. So, no official diagnosis of arthritis, just some morning stiffness. Have you ever had any injuries to your feet or ankles?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me think… Back in my younger days… I twisted my ankle dancing. A long, long time ago. It swelled up like a balloon! The doctor put it in a cast for weeks. But I recovered, of course. I was young and resilient then. And… I think I stepped on a piece of glass once. Barefoot, on the beach. But that wasn’t serious. Just a little cut. Nothing that required much attention. Honestly, Doctor, I've led a full life. A very full life. A few aches and pains are to be expected, aren't they?
DOCTOR: They absolutely are, Wynell. A very full life indeed. And it’s good to know about the twisted ankle and the cut on your foot. Now, just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just my water pill, the one for my… the swelling. The doctor prescribed it a few years back. And… oh, yes, a little something for my blood pressure. It goes up and down, you know. Here. You can look if you like. But don’t go changing anything without asking me first! I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Wynell. I appreciate you letting me review these. Alright, I see you’re taking hydrochlorothiazide for swelling and amlodipine for blood pressure. Do you experience any side effects from these medications?
PATIENT: Oh, side effects… Sometimes my ankles feel a bit… puffy. But I just put my feet up. That usually helps. And… oh, yes! I get a bit… lightheaded sometimes, when I stand up too quickly. But it doesn't last long. It's just a little dizzy spell. Nothing to worry about, I suppose. It’s just part of getting old, isn’t it? Everything feels a bit… off these days. But I manage. I always manage.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of those side effects, Wynell. The puffiness and lightheadedness can be related to the medications. Now, one last set of questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of. I used to get a bit of a rash when I was a child, but that was years ago. Nothing serious. And… oh! I can’t stand the smell of mothballs! It gives me a terrible headache. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled all over the world… I haven’t had any bad reactions. No, I don't think I have any allergies. I'm a pretty sturdy woman, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Wynell. No known allergies. Alright, based on everything we’ve discussed – your history of foot pain, the swelling, the mild lightheadedness, and your medications – it sounds like you're experiencing some typical age-related changes in your feet, likely contributing to some discomfort. The flatness of your arches could be playing a role, and we'll want to monitor your blood pressure and swelling. I don’t think there’s anything urgently concerning, but I’d like to recommend a few things. Would you be open to discussing those?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist, Doctor. But I don't want any complicated procedures, you understand. And no needles! I detest needles. Just tell me what you think, and I’ll decide if it’s worth bothering with. I have a luncheon to get to, you know. And the ladies won't be pleased if I'm late. Just keep it simple, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. No complicated procedures or needles unless you specifically want them. I recommend a few things that are quite simple. First, let's focus on footwear. I understand you don't like the sensible shoes your niece buys you, but supportive shoes are important. We can discuss options that are both comfortable and provide good arch support. Second, I'd like you to try some gentle stretching exercises for your feet and ankles. I can show you a few simple ones to do at home. And finally, let's keep an eye on your blood pressure and swelling. I’d like you to check your blood pressure at home a couple of times a week, and if you notice any significant increase in swelling, please let me know. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh, stretching… I suppose I could try that. And I’ll see about the shoes. But I'm not promising anything! My niece will be thrilled, I’m sure. Always telling me what’s best for me. And checking my blood pressure… well, alright. But I don’t want to become obsessed with it! A little peace of mind is one thing, but I don’t need to worry about every little fluctuation. So, that’s it? No poking and prodding? No endless tests? If that's all, then I suppose I can agree to it. But no promises, Doctor. No promises.
DOCTOR: That’s it, Wynell. No poking, no prodding, and no endless tests unless absolutely necessary. We'll start with these simple steps, and see how you feel. If things don't improve, or if new symptoms develop, we can always revisit the discussion and consider other options. I have a pamphlet here with some simple foot stretches you can try at home, and a blood pressure log to keep track of your readings. Before you go, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Hmmm… these pictures are awfully small! No, I don't think so. Just… don't expect miracles, Doctor. I’m an old woman. Things wear out, you know? And I’m not one for fussing. But I appreciate you listening to me, I suppose. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must be going. The ladies will be wondering where I am. Thank you, Doctor. And… try not to overthink things, alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. I understand completely. Thank you for coming in today. Take care, and enjoy your luncheon. .
