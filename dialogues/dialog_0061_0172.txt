DOCTOR: Bula! Good morning, Candice. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well. Honestly, it’s rather…necessary. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare wanted me to establish care, and he…well, he fusses. It’s all very bureaucratic, isn’t it? I suppose I’m here to fulfill requirements.
DOCTOR: It certainly can be, Candice. It’s good of you to come in, and your husband is right to be proactive about establishing care. It's helpful to have a baseline, even if everything feels alright right now. Let’s just go through a few things to get to know your health a bit better, okay?
PATIENT: Baseline… Honestly, I’ve been quite healthy my entire life. I don’t recall any…significant issues. Though, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Ask your questions, dear, but don’t expect a detailed accounting. It was a long time ago, most of it. And truly, I'm not one for dwelling on the past.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Candice. We'll take things at your pace. No pressure at all. Let's start with what's been going on recently. Have you noticed any new symptoms or changes in how you’ve been feeling – anything at all – over the past few months?
PATIENT: Recent…well, the weather, for one. It’s terribly humid here. And my joints ache a bit, but that’s hardly new. Old age, I suppose. And I get…tired. Everyone gets tired, don’t they? Honestly, I can’t recall anything particularly noteworthy. Is there a specific ailment you’re looking for? Because I haven't been sick – truly sick – in decades.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. When you say your joints ache, where exactly are you feeling that discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm…everywhere, really. My knees, mostly. And my hands. Sometimes my shoulders. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a…dull throb. It’s worse in the mornings, and after…activity. Though I don’t do much of that anymore, thankfully. It's just…the general wear and tear of a long life, I imagine. Is this truly necessary to catalogue? It’s hardly a medical marvel.
DOCTOR: It’s good to get a clear picture, Candice, even if it seems like normal wear and tear. It helps us rule things out and make sure nothing else is going on. Now, about that fatigue – is it just feeling a bit tired at the end of the day, or is it something more?
PATIENT: Something more… Honestly, dear, I’m not one for describing my bodily functions in detail. It’s simply…a lack of energy. I used to be able to do so much more. Now, a simple walk tires me out. I sleep…sufficiently. It’s not like I’m collapsing from exhaustion, if that’s what you’re asking. Can we please expedite this process? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. We'll keep things moving. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Must we? I assure you, I’m perfectly intact, for my age. But…very well. Get it over with quickly, if you please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. It will be quick and straightforward, just a general check-up. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t understand the point of all this poking and prodding. But…fine. Do what you must. Though I warn you, I am rather sensitive. And do be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds clear on both sides. Heart rate is regular, but a little on the slower side, which is common at your age. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, just a quick look in your ears... Ears look clear. Any history of allergies, Candice?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I grew up on a farm, dear. A little dust never hurt anyone. Though…I believe I had a mild reaction to some sort of pollen last spring. A bit of a sniffle, nothing serious. My husband brewed me some tea, and that cleared it right up. Honestly, I don’t recall the specifics. And please, less poking. It’s rather…undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, noted. And are you currently taking any medications, Candice?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… Just a little something for my arthritis, occasionally. Ibuprofen, I believe. When it flares up. And a small dose of something for my blood pressure, prescribed by my previous physician. But I can’t recall the name of it. My husband handles all of that, you see. He’s very organized. It's…a small white pill, I think. Does that help? Honestly, I don’t like taking pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Do you know the dosage of either medication?
PATIENT: Dosage? Honestly, dear, do you expect me to remember the precise amount of chemicals I ingest? I take what my husband gives me. He’s very careful. I believe it's…200 milligrams of the ibuprofen. As for the blood pressure pill…I truly couldn’t say. He has it all written down, I’m sure. It's all very efficient. Can we please conclude this examination? I’m starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. We'll finish up soon. Just a few more quick questions about your history, then we can discuss a plan. Have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed, decades ago. And…I believe I had a hysterectomy, when I was younger. It was…necessary, at the time. Beyond that, nothing significant. A few stitches here and there, but nothing that would require a lengthy medical record. Honestly, I've always been quite lucky with my health. It's all rather tedious, isn't it? Recalling these things. Can we please move on?
DOCTOR: Alright, almost finished. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? A rather depressing topic, if you ask me. My mother passed away young, from…something. I don’t recall the specifics. Heart trouble, perhaps? And my father lived a long life, but he wasn't terribly robust. Mostly just…old age. It wasn’t a particularly remarkable lineage, if you must know. Honestly, I try not to dwell on such things. It’s all rather morbid. Can we be done now? I have errands to run and a bridge game to attend.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Just a few final questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My husband would never allow it. And alcohol…occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. A small indulgence. It helps with digestion, you see. And keeps the bridge game lively. Honestly, it’s hardly a vice. Is this truly relevant? It seems rather…invasive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. That’s all the questions I have for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated and you report some fatigue and joint aches. Your memory seems a little affected as well, which is not uncommon at your age. I recommend we start with some blood work to check your thyroid levels, kidney function, and rule out any underlying inflammation. We'll also monitor your blood pressure at home. I can have the nurse show you how. And perhaps consider a low-impact exercise program if you’re able, for the fatigue and joint pain. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work? More poking and prodding? Honestly, dear, it's all rather exhausting. And exercise? At my age? I find it…difficult to believe. But…very well. If you insist. As long as it doesn’t involve any strenuous activity. And I suppose monitoring the blood pressure is reasonable. But please, let’s get this over with as quickly as possible. I have a very busy schedule. And I trust my husband will be most displeased if I'm delayed. Can we discuss when I can have these…tests performed?
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. The blood work is fairly quick, and we can schedule it for tomorrow morning at the clinic. The nurse will give you instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home and we can review the readings at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. I’m going to write you a referral to a physical therapist, just for an evaluation. They can create a gentle exercise program tailored to your needs. You don’t have to commit to therapy if you don’t want to, it’s just to get some expert advice. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… Honestly, this is becoming quite the ordeal. Very well. But I make no promises about following their…instructions. And two weeks? That seems an excessively long time to wait for a follow-up. Can't it be sooner? Perhaps next week? I trust my husband will be most anxious to hear your diagnosis. And please, let's get this referral completed so I can leave. I have errands to run, you see. And a bridge game to attend. Is there anything else you require before I depart?
DOCTOR: I understand, Candice. I'll see if we can get you in for a follow-up appointment next week, let me check the schedule. Alright, how about Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Wednesday afternoon will suffice. As long as it doesn’t interfere with my bridge game. And please, ensure the waiting room is comfortable. My back isn't what it used to be. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe that concludes our…consultation. Where do I find the nurse for the blood work instructions? And the physical therapy referral? Perhaps a map would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Candice. The nurse's station is just down the hall to your left. She'll go over the blood work instructions and answer any questions you may have. The map will show you exactly where to go. It was a pleasure meeting you. And if anything comes up before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and enjoy your bridge game!
PATIENT: Very well. I trust your staff is competent. And I expect a prompt response to any inquiries. Good day to you as well. Honestly, all this fuss over a few aches and pains… It’s utterly ridiculous. .
