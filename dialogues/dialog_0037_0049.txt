DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Just… things haven’t been so clear lately, you see? My hearin’, it ain’t what it used to be. Seems like folks are mumblin’ more, or maybe I just… can't quite catch everything. It’s a bother, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with your hearing. That is a bother, and very common as we get older. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this starting?
PATIENT: Oh, gee. When did it start… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe last year sometime? Or the year before? Everything kinda blends together, you know? I used to be able to hear a pin drop, my mother always said. Now… well, now I ask folks to repeat themselves a lot.
DOCTOR: I do understand, time can certainly fly and memories can blend. So, it’s been at least a year, potentially two. And you've noticed you're needing people to repeat themselves more often. Is this difficulty with hearing constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not always bad. Some days are better than others, ya know? When it’s quiet… like in here… I can usually hear alright. It's more when there's a lot of noise, or when people aren’t lookin’ at me when they talk. Like in a restaurant, forget about it! And sometimes… it just feels… muffled. Like someone put cotton in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse with background noise and when you can’t see the speaker’s face, and you sometimes experience a muffled sensation. That gives me a little more information to work with. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or hissing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. Not all the time, mind you. Just… now and then. It comes and goes quick, like a little cricket chirpin’ in the distance. I never thought much of it, to be honest. Just figured it was… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, a high-pitched ringing sound that comes and goes. That’s important to know. Have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises, either at work or in your hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… hmm. Well, I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, Lord, must be forty years! Lots of machines, clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. They gave us earplugs sometimes, but I don't think I always wore ‘em. And I used to go dancin’ with my friends, back in the day. Lively music, it was. But nothin' too loud, I don’t think. Mostly just… regular work noise.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of noise exposure with the shoe factory work and some social noise exposure with dancing. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, bless my soul, that's a lot to remember. Let me think… I got my Medicare, so I must have somethin’… The doctor told me a few years back my blood pressure was a little high, but they gave me some pills for it, and I take 'em regular. Other than that… I don't recall much. I try to stay active, you know? Walkin’ and such. But I ain’t one for goin’ to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, you manage high blood pressure with medication, and generally try to stay active. That's good to hear. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I take somethin’ for my arthritis, in my hands. Makes ‘em ache somethin’ awful sometimes. Little white pills, I think. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little somethin’ for that, too. Just a half a pill, usually. It helps me drift off, ya know? I get a bit restless if I don't.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for high blood pressure, arthritis, and occasionally for sleep. That's good to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never really had much trouble with that. I used to get a bit itchy when I was a kid around cats, but that was a long time ago. I eat pretty much anything, too. Not a picky eater, I’ll tell ya!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That simplifies things. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just be gentle, alright? My ears are a little sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm just going to look inside your ears with this instrument, called an otoscope. It has a light on it. I’m also going to listen to some sounds near your ear to assess your hearing. It won’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ear canals, which could be contributing to your difficulty hearing. The ear drums themselves look intact. I’m going to perform a quick hearing test now. Alright, the hearing test confirms some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, in both ears. This is consistent with age-related hearing loss, and likely exacerbated by the wax buildup.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Wax buildup, huh? Well, I suppose that makes sense. I don't clean ‘em much, you know? Always thought you were supposed to leave ‘em alone. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? Will I go deaf?
DOCTOR: No, don't worry, it doesn't mean you're going to go deaf. It's very common, especially with age. The wax buildup is likely blocking some of the sound waves, making it harder to hear clearly. And the hearing test showed a mild to moderate hearing loss, which is also typical with age and noise exposure. The good news is that we can address both of these things. First, I can safely remove the wax buildup. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Then, we can discuss options for managing your hearing loss, which might include hearing aids if it’s significantly impacting your quality of life. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Well, that don't sound so bad. Gettin’ the wax out sounds good. I’d like to be able to hear better, for sure. I miss hearin' my grandkids when they come to visit. Hearing aids… now that sounds a bit fancy. I don't know… are they expensive? And would they be comfortable? I got small ears, ya know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. Hearing aids can be an investment, yes, but there are many different styles and price points available, and we can find something that fits your budget and your ears. Many insurance plans, including Medicare, do offer some coverage for hearing aids. We can help you navigate that process. As for comfort, that’s a very valid concern. There are many different sizes and styles available, including very small, discreet options that fit comfortably inside the ear canal. I would start by doing a hearing aid evaluation to determine the best option for your specific type of hearing loss. We'll take impressions of your ears to create custom-fitted aids. And we can always adjust them to ensure a comfortable and secure fit. Would you like me to schedule you for a hearing aid evaluation?
PATIENT: Alright… sounds like a lot to think about, but it’s good to know there’s options. If it means I can hear my grandkids better, I reckon I’ll give it a try. Yes, please. Let’s schedule me for that evaluation. When are you free? And how long does it take? I got a bridge game on Tuesdays, so… not then, if you can help it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's see… I have an opening on Thursday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Thursday at 2:00 PM… yes, that should be alright. I can get my friend Martha to drive me. I don’t drive much anymore, ya know? Alright, Thursday it is. Is there anything I need to bring with me? Just my Medicare card, I suppose?
DOCTOR: Yes, just your Medicare card is perfect. And if you have a list of any medications you're currently taking, that would be helpful, but not essential. It will take about an hour and a half for the evaluation. We’ll do some more detailed hearing tests, discuss your hearing goals, and talk about different hearing aid options. I'll have the receptionist schedule that for you now. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that covers it for now. You been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you kindly. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly. I was a bit worried at first, but I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I’m glad I could ease your worries. It’s my pleasure. We’ll take good care of you. I'll see you on Thursday at 2:00 PM. Have a good day, and I look forward to meeting you then.
