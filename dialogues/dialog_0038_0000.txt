DOCTOR: Good morning, Sharifa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… alright to meet you, I suppose. Honestly, it’s my legs. They just feel… weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. Not a big deal, usually, but this weakness… it's not going away. It’s in both legs, which is odd, isn’t it? I mean, usually things happen on one side, not both.
DOCTOR: It is good to meet you, Sharifa. And you're right, weakness in both legs at the same time is a bit unusual after a cold, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a bit more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t walk, exactly. It’s just… harder. Like trying to push through thick mud, you know? And I feel like they might give out if I try anything too strenuous. I had to really concentrate to get out of the car this morning, and even then I was a little wobbly. It’s just… concerning. I don’t usually have trouble with things like that. I used to hike all the time, before… well, before things.
DOCTOR: Okay, "pushing through thick mud" is a good way to describe it. And the wobbliness this morning is helpful to know. Before things… can you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Oh, don't bother. It's just… my ex-husband. He wasn't exactly supportive of my… hobbies. Always saying I was going to hurt myself, or wasting my time. It’s a long story, and really not relevant to my legs. I haven’t hiked in a couple of years, is all. But I was perfectly fit before him, and I haven’t done anything to make this happen. I keep thinking it might be something serious, and I really don’t have time for that. I have tours scheduled. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sharifa. It sounds like a stressful situation, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. While the past is important context, we'll focus on what's happening with your legs now. It’s good you're thinking ahead and taking your responsibilities seriously. Let’s try to pinpoint this weakness a bit more. When did you notice it starting after the cold?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The cold itself… it ended maybe four days ago? I was feeling a little better, then, but that evening, I noticed my legs felt… heavy. Just a little bit, at first. I thought I was just tired, but it’s gotten progressively worse each day since then. It’s… it’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. It’s more like… resistance. Like someone’s put weights on them, even when I'm just standing still. And it’s both legs, equally. It's very unsettling. Honestly, I feel like I’m falling apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about four days ago, after the cold resolved, and has been gradually worsening. And it’s an equal heaviness and resistance in both legs, not pain. That's very helpful. Now, thinking about the cold itself, do you recall any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, the usual. Runny nose, sore throat, cough. Nothing terrible. I just figured it was a bug going around. I didn’t even bother going to the doctor for it. I always get over colds quickly. I took some over-the-counter decongestants and just… rested. I had a mild fever for a day, maybe 100.5, but that went away quickly too. It was just a typical, annoying cold, honestly. And now this. It just doesn’t make any sense. I'm usually so healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, typical cold symptoms with a mild fever. And you recovered well from that, until this weakness started. Let's move on to some other things. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. That’s what’s so strange about it! It’s not like they’re falling asleep, or anything. It’s just… weak. Heavy. Like I said, resistance. It’s hard to describe. It's not a nerve thing, I don't think. I have full feeling in my feet and legs. I can wiggle my toes, and everything. It's just… they don't want to move as easily. Honestly, you’re asking a lot of questions, and I still don’t know what’s going on. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out, Sharifa, and I apologize if I'm overwhelming you with questions. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on. The absence of numbness or tingling is good to know, though. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago, but that was a one-time thing and I recovered just fine. I don’t take any regular medications. I'm generally very healthy. I eat reasonably well, I get enough sleep when I can… I’m just… not now. I'm starting to worry this is something serious. I have tours booked for next week, and if I can't walk… honestly, I don't know what I'll do. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, otherwise healthy, no regular medications. That’s helpful. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had some sort of heart trouble. Nothing specific, I don't really remember. It was a long time ago. He didn't take very good care of himself. And my grandmother… she had arthritis, I think. But other than that… not really. We’re not a particularly sickly family, honestly. I’m starting to feel like I'm wasting your time. It’s probably just a pulled muscle or something. But it’s both legs. It just doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and arthritis in your grandmother. And you're right, weakness in both legs makes a pulled muscle less likely. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Never have. I find it disgusting. And I rarely drink. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, once a week. I'm not one for vices, honestly. I prefer to be in control. This whole situation is just… infuriating. I'm a very active person. I need to be on my feet. I have responsibilities. And now… this. It's just… unacceptable. I'm starting to get a headache. I need to get back to work soon, and I can't if I can barely walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very limited alcohol consumption. That's good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I haven’t taken many medications, as I mentioned. I pride myself on being healthy enough to avoid all that. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I’ve told you everything. What are you even looking for? It’s a cold, then weakness in both legs. It’s not rocket science. I need a diagnosis, and I need it now so I can get back to my tours. People are counting on me. I’m starting to feel quite anxious.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be frustrated, Sharifa, and I apologize for the lengthy questioning. I understand you’re anxious about your tours and getting back to work, and I want to assure you I’m doing my best to figure out what’s going on. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information. Given the history of a recent cold followed by symmetrical leg weakness, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do. But if it's going to involve poking me with needles, you can forget it. I hate needles. Honestly, I'm starting to regret even coming in here. It’s probably just a waste of time. But do whatever you need to do, I suppose. Just be quick about it. And please, no needles.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. Just a quick assessment with my hands and a stethoscope. Okay, if you could sit on the examination table, that would be great. First, let's check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I'm going to tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't hurt. Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, let's check your strength. Can you please try to push your foot against my hand like you're pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is… undignified. But fine. There. Happy now? It’s not like I’m incredibly strong, as if you couldn’t tell. I’m a tour guide, not a weightlifter. Honestly, this is taking too long. Just tell me what’s wrong with my legs and let me go. People are counting on me, and I’m wasting valuable time sitting here being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sharifa. I understand your frustration, and I’m trying to be as quick as possible. It’s important for me to get a good sense of your strength to understand what’s going on. Okay, your strength is a little weaker than expected, but not significantly diminished. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It will just take a moment. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Finally, can you stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Fine. But if I fall, you’re catching me. There. See? I can walk. Not perfectly, perhaps, but I’m not completely incapacitated. Honestly, this is ridiculous. It’s probably just a temporary weakness. I'll rest, and it'll go away. Just tell me what you think, and let me go. I have things to do, and I'm wasting valuable time here. People are counting on me. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Sharifa. I appreciate your patience. Based on your history and the physical exam findings—the recent cold, symmetrical leg weakness, diminished reflexes, and slightly reduced strength—it's possible you are experiencing post-viral weakness, potentially Guillain-Barré syndrome . It's a rare condition where the immune system attacks the nerves, often after a viral infection. However, it's too early to say definitively. Other possibilities include a prolonged post-viral fatigue, or less likely, a more serious neurological condition. To be certain, we need to run some tests. I’d like to order a complete blood count , electrolyte panel, and nerve conduction studies . NCS will help assess the function of your nerves. I also want to order an MRI of your spine to rule out any other underlying causes. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré… syndrome? Are you serious? That sounds… terrifying. And an MRI? I hate enclosed spaces. Honestly, this is getting worse and worse. I just came in here with a little leg weakness, and now you’re talking about… terrifying syndromes and… machines? Look, I appreciate you trying to figure things out, but… is there any chance this is just… a really bad muscle strain? Or maybe I just need some rest? I have tours scheduled for next week. People are counting on me. I can’t be stuck in a hospital bed having tests done. This is… unacceptable. Honestly, I'm starting to feel very anxious. Is this going to affect my ability to work? I have responsibilities.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Sharifa. It is a frightening diagnosis to hear, but it’s important to remember that we don’t have a definitive diagnosis yet. The tests will help us rule things in or out. It’s also important to remember that even if it is GBS, there are treatments available, and many people make a full recovery. And to answer your question, the tests will help us understand how your legs are functioning, and whether or not you need further treatment. The MRI is generally well-tolerated, and the technicians are very experienced in helping patients who are claustrophobic. If you’re truly uncomfortable, we can discuss medication to help you relax during the scan, or explore alternative imaging options, though those may not provide as much detail. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and getting plenty of rest. We’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail, or perhaps provide you with some resources about GBS?
PATIENT: Resources about… GBS? Honestly, I don’t want resources about terrifying syndromes. I want reassurance that this is just a temporary weakness and I’ll be fine. I need to get back to work. People are counting on me. Look, I appreciate your… efforts, but I’m not sure I want to go through all these tests. It sounds… invasive and scary. Is there anything else I can do? Maybe some physical therapy? Or… medication to make my legs stronger? I don’t want to be stuck in a hospital bed. I have responsibilities. Honestly, I’m starting to feel very overwhelmed. Can we just… postpone the tests for a few days? See if my legs improve on their own? I need time to process this. I have tours scheduled for next week. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I respect your wishes. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to explore less invasive options first. While I still strongly recommend the tests to rule out GBS, we can postpone them for a few days, as you requested. However, it’s important to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening of weakness, new symptoms such as numbness or tingling, difficulty breathing, or changes in bowel or bladder function, you need to seek immediate medical attention. In the meantime, physical therapy can be helpful, but it's important to be cautious and avoid overexertion. We can get a referral for a gentle PT program, but it's crucial that the therapist be aware of our concerns and adjust the exercises accordingly. I can also prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants to help with any discomfort, but these won’t address the underlying cause. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in three days to reassess your symptoms. If you don’t experience any improvement, or your symptoms worsen, we’ll proceed with the testing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Three days… Yes. That sounds acceptable. But if I don’t improve, I’m still not sure about all those tests. And I don’t want anything invasive. But… three days. I can rest, and see if it improves. And yes, a referral for gentle physical therapy would be good. But they have to be gentle. I don’t want to make things worse. Honestly, I just want to get back to normal. People are counting on me. And… muscle relaxants… yes, that sounds good. Anything to help with the discomfort. Okay. Three days. Follow-up appointment. Gentle physical therapy. Muscle relaxants. But no tests unless I get worse. Is that… clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Sharifa. Three-day follow-up appointment. Referral for gentle physical therapy, with instructions for the therapist to proceed cautiously. And I’ll write you a prescription for a short course of muscle relaxants. I’ll also give you a handout with information about GBS, just in case, but please don’t feel pressured to read it if it causes you anxiety. I want to assure you that we’ll proceed at your pace, and I’ll support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s everything. Just… please, no needles. And I really need to get back to work. People are counting on me. Thank you… I think. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sharifa. And absolutely no needles, I promise. Please, take it easy over the next few days, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any changes in your symptoms. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
