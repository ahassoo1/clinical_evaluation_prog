DOCTOR: Hello, Lilliana. Welcome. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um… well, my joints. They’re just… stiff in the mornings, you know? It’s not bad bad, just… hard to get going. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. It’s been a while, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, stiff joints in the mornings. That’s…common. And you said it’s been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Not… sudden. Just sort of… always there, a little bit. More in the mornings, definitely. I mostly just try to move around and it gets better, but… it's annoying, you know? I forget what I do to help it sometimes, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal for things to feel a little…fuzzy sometimes. We'll take our time. So, these stiff joints… where exactly are you feeling it?
PATIENT: Oh, um… everywhere, almost. My hands, mostly. And my knees. Sometimes my shoulders too. It's hard to say… it just feels like… old age, I guess. I don’t really know what to tell you. It’s not a sharp pain, just… tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hands, knees, and sometimes shoulders. Tightness, not sharp pain. And it’s better with movement. Let's do a quick exam, if that's alright with you. Just so I can get a better idea of what's going on. We'll check the range of motion in those joints and feel for any swelling or tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I don’t mind. I hope it doesn’t take too long, though. I have to get home to… well, I forget what I have to do, actually. But something.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Alright, let’s start with your hands. Can you open and close them for me, nice and slow?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. There. It feels a little… stuck, sometimes. Especially in the mornings. Like I haven’t used them in a while. Do you… want me to do it faster? I don't know what you need.
DOCTOR: No, slow is perfect. I’m just watching how you move. I see what you mean about feeling stuck. And I notice a little bit of swelling on the knuckles of both hands. Not a lot, but it’s there. Now, can you gently squeeze my hand, as firmly as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Like that? Is that enough? It’s a little… sore. Not bad, but… I don’t want to hurt myself. I don’t remember if I’ve ever squeezed anyone this hard before.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Lilliana. No need to force anything. Just letting me feel. Yes, I notice the grip is a little weaker than I'd expect, and a bit different between your hands. Now, let's move on to your knees. Can you sit back and extend your legs out straight for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Like that? It feels… tight. And a little… crunchy, maybe? I don’t know if that makes sense. I don’t really pay attention to my knees, to be honest. Is everything okay? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, I notice a little bit of crepitus – that’s the crunchy feeling you described – and some mild tenderness when I press here. No significant warmth or swelling, though. It sounds like we're dealing with some likely osteoarthritis, which is very common as we get older. But let’s just quickly check your shoulders to complete the picture. Can you raise your arms out to the sides, and then lift them up above your head, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh. Osteo… what was that? Is that bad? Like this? It hurts a little. Not… terrible, but… I don’t usually do this. I mostly just keep my arms down. I don’t remember ever being told about my shoulders before.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis just means some wear and tear on the joints, Lilliana. It's very common, and usually manageable. It doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, just that the cartilage in your joints is starting to break down a little. Okay, I feel some mild tenderness in your shoulder muscles, but no major swelling. So, to summarize, we have stiffness and mild pain in your hands, knees, and shoulders, worse in the mornings, and better with movement. There's some swelling in your hands, and crepitus and tenderness in your knees and shoulders. It sounds like osteoarthritis is likely, but to be sure, and rule out anything else, I'd like to order some simple blood tests and X-rays of your hands and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests and… X-rays? That sounds… complicated. I don’t like needles. And I don’t really understand about… X-rays. What will they show? Is it going to hurt? I don't have insurance, either. Will it cost a lot of money? I forget where I keep my… everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. It can seem complicated, but we'll take it one step at a time. The blood tests are just to rule out other possible causes for your joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis. The X-rays will show us the condition of the bones in your hands and knees, and help confirm if it's osteoarthritis. They don’t hurt at all - you just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. And you’re right to ask about cost. Because you don’t have insurance, we can discuss options to make it more affordable. I can check if the clinic has any financial assistance programs, or if there are lower-cost imaging centers nearby. We can also prioritize which tests are most important, and potentially start with just the blood tests to get a clearer picture before doing the X-rays. Would it be helpful if I wrote down what we’ve discussed so far, and the options for testing?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, writing it down would be good. I forget things so easily. The financial assistance… that would be very helpful. I don’t have much money, to be honest. And I really don’t like needles. Maybe… maybe just the blood tests for now? If that’s okay? I just want to… feel better, you know? I forget what it’s like to not feel stiff all the time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lilliana. We can definitely start with just the blood tests. That’s a very reasonable approach. I’m writing down the tests we’ll order: a complete blood count, an inflammatory marker called ESR or CRP, and a rheumatoid factor test. These will give us a good starting point. And I’ll have the nurse give you information about the financial assistance programs available at the clinic. She can also help you schedule the blood draw. We'll need a small sample of blood, and it’s usually done at the lab next door. It might sting a little, but it's very quick. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds okay. A quick sting is better than… everything else. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I forget… I forget how to say thank you properly sometimes. But thank you. What happens after the blood tests? How long will it take to get the results? I have to… I have to pick up something later. I just can’t remember what.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lilliana. It’s my job to help. And you don't need to worry about saying thank you properly. I appreciate your trust. The blood tests usually take a few days to come back – typically 2-3 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. We can then decide on a treatment plan – that might include things like pain relievers, physical therapy, or exercises you can do at home. In the meantime, try to stay active, and continue doing things that help relieve your stiffness. Gentle movement is good, but don’t overdo it. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. I forget… oh, never mind. It’s probably nothing important. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. And writing everything down is wonderful. I’ll… I’ll try to remember where I put it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to… go. I just have to… remember where I parked.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. Take your time. And don’t worry about remembering everything. That’s what we’re here for. The nurse will escort you to the lab, and she can also help you find your car if you need it. It was a pleasure meeting you. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, Lilliana.
