DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Welcome. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my son, he signed me up. Somethin’ about… a tryout? For… sports. I forget what kinda sports, now. Old man brain, you know? He said I needed to get checked out first. Just makin’ sure I don’t… fall apart, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, a check-up before starting a new activity is always a good idea. It's smart of your son to be proactive. “Old man brain” happens to the best of us – don’t worry about forgetting details, we’ll take our time. So, even though you don’t recall the specific sport, your son felt a general check-up was a good idea?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s right. He kept talkin’ about… team stuff. And bein’ able to… keep up. I told him I used to walk a lot, back when I was guidin’ tours. Lots of walkin’. And liftin’ suitcases, sometimes. Heavy ones! But that was… a long time ago. I mostly sit now. With my wife. Watchin’ the TV.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of being quite active with the tour guiding – walking and lifting, which is good to know. And now, a more sedentary lifestyle. That shift can definitely affect things. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me if you've noticed any specific changes since you stopped the tours?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes… let me think. Well, my knees, they get a little… creaky, you know? Especially when the weather’s bad. And I get outta breath easier. Climbin’ stairs, it’s not like it used to be. Not that I do much stair climbin’ anymore. Mostly just flat floors now. And… sometimes my back feels a little stiff. But, you know, old age.
DOCTOR: Those are all important things to mention, Mr. Murph. Creaky knees, shortness of breath with exertion, and some back stiffness… those are common changes, yes, but we want to understand what’s going on. Have you experienced any pain with these symptoms, or is it more of a discomfort or limitation?
PATIENT: Pain… sometimes. Not all the time. The knees, they ache if I walk too much. Like, if I try to go to the store with my wife and we walk a long distance. And the back… sometimes a sharp pain if I bend over wrong. But mostly it's just… uncomfortable. Like somethin’s tight. I try to ignore it, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And do you notice any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet, or any weakness when you walk?
PATIENT: Numbness… no, not really. Sometimes my feet feel a little… cold. But mostly just cold. Weakness… hmm. I don’t think so. I mean, I don’t go runnin’ marathons, you know? But I can walk around the house fine. I can get up and down from the chair. Not as quick as I used to, maybe. My son always says I shuffle my feet a bit. He says I gotta watch my step. But he worries too much, that boy.
DOCTOR: It's good that you’re still able to get around and perform your daily activities. Your son sounds like a caring man, and it’s always good to be aware of changes, even if they seem small. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… the doctor, years ago, he said somethin’ about my blood pressure bein’ a little high. He gave me some pills for it. I took ‘em for a while, but… I forget now if I still do. My wife handles most of the pill stuff. And… I had a bad fall a long time ago, broke my wrist. That healed up okay. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, I thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure and a past wrist fracture. It’s alright that you’re unsure about the details of your medication; we can look that up. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think I take somethin’ for my stomach. Heartburn, sometimes. Little white pills. And my wife gives me a vitamin every mornin’. Somethin’ with… C in it? I think. And sometimes, if my knees are achin’ bad, I take one of those… ibuprofen pills. The orange ones. But not very often. Just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. My wife makes me try new things all the time. Sometimes I don’t like ‘em, but I don’t get sick from ‘em. I do sneeze a lot in the spring, with all the flowers bloomin’. But that’s just… spring, you know? I’ve never had a bad reaction to a pill or nothin’. That I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had a bad heart. He had to have… surgery, I think. A long time ago. And my mother, she had… I don’t know, somethin’ with her bones. She broke a lot of ‘em when she got older. And my sister… she had cancer, I think. But that was a long time ago, too. I don’t remember all the details. It was sad. My wife knows more about that stuff. She keeps track of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like there's a history of some significant health conditions in your family. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, like I said, I mostly sit now. Watch TV with my wife. We eat pretty regular, she’s good about that. Not much exercise, though. I used to walk a lot, but not anymore. I don't smoke, never did. And I don't drink much, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. That’s about it, I guess. Pretty boring, really. Not like I used to be, runnin' around showin' tourists the sights.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good picture, Mr. Murph. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sure, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what I gotta do. I’m not very good at… fancy medical stuff. As long as it doesn’t involve too much bendin’ or liftin’. My back ain’t what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: No bending or lifting required, I promise. We’ll take it slow and easy. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. Blood pressure is 145/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, could you please sit up and let me check your range of motion in your shoulders, elbows and wrists?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… 145… that sounds high. Like my wife always says. Shoulders… elbows… wrists… okay. Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. These are a little… creaky, you know? Like old doors. They haven’t been used much lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a little crepitus, but nothing too concerning. Now, could you please stand up for me, and I’ll check your gait and balance?
PATIENT: Stand up… okay. This is kinda scary, you know? I don’t wanna fall. My son always says I shuffle, like you said. He worries too much, that boy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what your son means. A slightly shuffling gait, and a bit of a wider base, but you’re doing alright. It’s good you’re aware of it. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, could you sit back down?
PATIENT: Okay, sittin’ down now. Whew. That was… exercise. I don’t think I’m cut out for sports anymore, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Murph. We're not necessarily trying to get you ready for the Olympics! I just needed to get a better understanding of your overall physical condition. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you have some age-related changes in your joints and a slightly elevated blood pressure. Your gait is a little unsteady, but not alarming. I recommend we monitor your blood pressure regularly, and I’d like to order some blood tests just to get a baseline and rule out any other underlying conditions. We can also discuss some simple exercises to improve your strength and balance. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Monitor the blood pressure… exercises… that sounds sensible. I don’t wanna be fallin’ down all the time. Blood tests… whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. My wife always says I gotta listen to the doctors. So, no sports then? That’s okay with me. Maybe I’ll just stick to watchin’ ‘em on TV.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a perfectly reasonable plan, Mr. Murph. No pressure to do anything you’re not comfortable with. I'll write up the orders for the blood tests now. They’ll check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a few other things. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll let you know when the results are ready. It usually takes a few days. I'll also print out a sheet with some simple exercises you can do at home. Start slowly and listen to your body. If anything causes pain, stop immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions… I don’t think so. You explained everything pretty clearly, Doctor. I guess… how long will it take to get the results? And… will you call me if somethin’s wrong? My wife worries, you know. She always wants to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. The lab will likely contact you directly when they’re available. I will also review them when they come in, and if anything is concerning, I will personally call you to discuss it. And, of course, I'll call with the overall results, even if they're normal. I understand your wife worries, and I'm happy to keep her informed as well, with your permission. Is it alright if I have your wife's contact information?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. Thank you. She’ll be very happy to know that. Yes, you can have her number. It’s… It’s right here in my contacts. Her name is Elena. She’s a worrier, like I said. But a good one.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have it now. I’ll be sure to reach out to both of you when the results are available. For now, I’ll go ahead and print out these instructions on the exercises and the lab requisition form. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Murph?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to an old man like me. And thank you for not makin’ me run any marathons. I think I’ll just stick to sittin’ with my wife and watchin’ TV.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Murph. It was my pleasure. And absolutely no marathons required! Remember, taking care of yourself is about finding what works for you. Here are those instructions and the lab form. If you have any questions or concerns after you get the results, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day, and give my best to Elena.
PATIENT: .
