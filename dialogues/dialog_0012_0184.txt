DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Trendler, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to meet you too, I suppose. Look here, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. I come 'bout… well, it’s my belly. It just… hangin’ too much. Always been a thin man, you see. Used to be. Now it look like I swallowed a watermelon. And it ain’t a good look. I want it fixed. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're concerned about a change in your abdomen – it feels larger than it used to be, and you'd like to figure out what’s going on. That's perfectly reasonable. When did you first notice this change in your belly, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Oh, must be... six months now? Maybe a little more. Hard to say exactly. Time flies when you get old, you know. But definitely after last Christmas, I noticed my trousers feelin’ a bit tighter. And it ain’t from gainin’ weight, I tell you! I eat the same. Maybe a little less, even. It just… appeared. Like magic. Bad magic.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your diet or appetite?
PATIENT: No! I told you. Same food. Maybe a smaller portion now and then, but nothin’ drastic. I like my rice and beans, my fish on a Friday. That ain’t changed. I ain’t been eatin’ any more sweets neither. Never been one for cakes and puddings. It’s just... the shape of me, Doctor. It’s gone wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, so consistent eating habits. Have you noticed any other changes along with this change in your abdomen?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes you talkin’ 'bout? I ain’t been feelin’ sick or nothin’. No pain, no trouble breathin’. Just... this. Everything else workin' like it should. I still can pile drive, you know. Though it take a bit longer these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no shortness of breath, and you're still active. That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Doctor, you askin’ a lot of personal questions, you know. I… I go to the bathroom when I need to. Same as always. Regular enough. Ain’t got time to be dealin’ with that kind of problem when I got work to do.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel personal, Mr. Trendler. I just need to gather as much information as possible to understand what's going on. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes be related to abdominal changes, but it’s okay if you’re not comfortable discussing them in detail. Let's move on then. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or heartburn?
PATIENT: Nausea? Vomiting? Good heavens, no! I ain't sick! I told you that already. And heartburn… well, sometimes a little after a spicy meal, but that’s just the pepper. Everyone gets that. I ain’t been throwin’ up or nothin’ like that. Look, is there a way you can just… look at it? And tell me what's wrong? I ain't got time for all these questions.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Mr. Trendler. Let’s take a look. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on it to feel for anything unusual. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Also, I’ll want to take a look at your medical history. Do you have a list of any medications you're currently taking, or any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual things for an old man. A little somethin’ for my knees, you know. And a blood pressure pill, the doctor gave me last year. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with nothin’. Wait. I broke out in a rash once after eatin' some mangoes, years ago. But that was just mangoes! Here, let me see... This might have the names. Doctor gave me a list, but I ain’t good with rememberin’ these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let’s start with the physical exam. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first. Just breathe normally. Sounds are… normal. Not overly active, not diminished. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. I’ll start here on the right side.
PATIENT: Hmph. Feels like you’re pokin’ around in there. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It’s always been a bit soft, you see. Ooh, a little there, yes. But that’s probably just where I used to pull a muscle with the pile driver. Used to be a strong man, you know. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, likely musculoskeletal as you mentioned. I'm feeling a slight fullness, but no hard masses or anything immediately concerning. I also notice some slight swelling around your ankles. Have you noticed that yourself?
PATIENT: Swelling? A little, maybe. Thought it was just from the heat. Been a hot summer, you know. I wear boots all day for work. Boots can make your feet swell. Ain’t never bothered me much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, looking at your medical history here, I see you're taking Lisinopril for blood pressure and Meloxicam for knee pain. Do you take these medications as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Usually. Sometimes I forget, to be honest. Old age, you know. But I try to take 'em regular. Doctor told me not to skip 'em. Lisinopril... that's the blood pressure one, right? And Meloxicam… for the knees. It helps a little. Doesn't take away all the pain, but it's better than nothin'. Been takin' them for... oh, must be five years now, maybe more.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your concerns about the abdominal fullness, the slight swelling in your ankles, and your medications, I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to do a blood test to check your kidney and liver function, and a complete blood count to see if there are any signs of infection. I also think a CT scan of your abdomen would be helpful to get a detailed look at your internal organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More waitin’ around, more pokin’ and proddin’. I ain’t got time for all these tests, Doctor. But… if you think it’s necessary. Fine. Do your tests. Just… hurry it up, alright? I got work to do. And I ain't gettin' any younger.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab right away, and we’ll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. It’s best to rule out anything serious. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, or difficulty breathing, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll also have the nurse come in to take your blood pressure and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the tests. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Nurse, tests, results… I got it. Don't want to be lyin' around sick. Gotta keep workin’. Hurry up now, alright? The day's wastin’. .
