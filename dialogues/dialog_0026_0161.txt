DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… a little embarrassing to talk about, but my daughter, Layla, she told me I should come in and ask about something to help keep me safe. She does a lot of reading, you know? Something about… preventing HIV. I don’t really understand all the details, but she was very insistent.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of Layla. It’s not embarrassing at all to discuss preventative health, and it’s good she’s encouraging you to take care of yourself. It sounds like she’s concerned about HIV prevention, and that’s a perfectly valid reason to come in. Just to be clear, and don’t feel like you have to share anything you’re not comfortable with, can you tell me a little bit about why Layla brought this up?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been… dating a bit. After my husband passed, it’s been… nice to have company. But it’s been a while, you know? And Layla… she worries. She just said I should be careful and get tested, and then she mentioned this… PrEP thing. She said it’s a pill I can take to really be safe. I haven’t been with anyone regularly regularly, just a few dates here and there, but… it’s better to be safe than sorry, I guess. I just don’t know much about it.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of you to come in and discuss this. It is always better to be safe, and Layla sounds like a very caring daughter. PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis – is a very effective medication to prevent HIV, and it’s something we can definitely talk about. Before we get into the specifics of PrEP, I like to get a bit of a broader picture. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. When I first started dating again, my doctor at the time suggested it, and I did it. And then… maybe two years ago, when I met someone new. Both times came back negative. I don’t remember exactly when, though. It was… Dr. Khalil, I think. He retired last year. He was over on Elm Street.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Let me just see if I can pull up any records from Dr. Khalil’s office… Ah, yes, here we are. It looks like you had tests done in March of 2023 and again in January of 2020, both negative. That’s helpful. Now, just to confirm, are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Not… a lot, like I said. A couple of dates a month, maybe. Mostly just dinner and a movie, you know? But there has been some intimacy. Nothing serious, just… casual. I use protection, usually. But… Layla made me think about it. About whether “usually” is enough.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and Layla is right to encourage you to consider all your options. Even with consistent condom use, there's still a small risk, and PrEP can significantly reduce that risk. To help me determine if PrEP is right for you, I'd like to ask a few more questions. First, do you have any underlying health conditions like kidney problems, liver disease, or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder taken out about ten years ago, but that's it. And I have a little arthritis in my hands, but it's not too bad. Just a bit stiff in the mornings. My general doctor, Dr. Amin, says I’m pretty healthy for my age. She does a full check-up every year, and always says my blood pressure and cholesterol are good. I'll be 56 next month, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That’s all good information, thank you. No gallbladder, some arthritis, and good health checks with Dr. Amin. Being 56 doesn't matter at all – in fact, it's wonderful that you're proactive about your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some ibuprofen for my arthritis, when it flares up. And I take a multivitamin every day, the one my daughter gets me from the health food store. She swears it has everything I need. That's it, really. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and a multivitamin. That’s helpful to know. Alright, Helaina, based on what you've told me so far, you are a candidate for PrEP. Before we discuss starting it, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and order some blood tests just to make sure everything is functioning well and that there are no contraindications. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing. And to feel safe, you know? A physical and some blood tests… alright. Let's get it done. The sooner the better, I suppose. I have a dinner date on Friday, and… well, I'd feel a lot better knowing where I stand.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible attitude. We'll get everything done as quickly and efficiently as possible. First, I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief physical exam. Then, we’ll draw some blood for the tests. It will take about 10-15 minutes, and the lab results usually take a few days. If you could please sit back and relax for me…
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have to pick up Layla’s son from school on Friday afternoon, and… well, you know how it is. Time just seems to slip away. But I'm glad I came in. Really, I am. Even if it just puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear, and blood pressure is 130/80, which is good. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything seems normal so far. Reflexes are normal and coordination is good as well. Now, I just need to draw a little blood for the tests. It will be a quick pinch. Do you have a preference for which arm?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's reassuring to hear. Everything's normal... that's a relief. My left arm is usually better for blood draws, I think. It doesn't bruise as easily. I'm not a big fan of needles, to be honest. But I'll manage. Just… try to be quick, if you can?
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Left arm it is. This might sting for a moment… Alright, we’re almost done… There you go. All finished. Just keep pressure on that for a few minutes, and you should be good to go. We’ll get those results sent to the lab right away. Do you have any questions while we’re waiting?
PATIENT: Oof. That wasn't my favorite. But it's done now. Thanks, Doctor. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… what happens when the results come back? And if everything is okay, what's the next step with this PrEP thing? How do you even take it? I feel a bit clueless, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to feel a bit clueless! It’s good you're asking. Once the results come back – usually within 2-3 business days – we’ll review them together. We’re mainly looking to make sure your kidney function is normal and that you don’t have any underlying conditions that would prevent you from taking PrEP. If everything is okay, PrEP is a simple daily pill. It's taken every day to be most effective, even if you're not planning on being sexually active. It’s part of a broader prevention strategy, so consistent use is key. There are two different medications approved for PrEP, and we can discuss which one might be best for you based on your health and preferences. We’ll also talk about the potential side effects – they’re generally mild, like nausea or headache, but it’s important to be aware of them. And, importantly, PrEP doesn't protect against all sexually transmitted infections, so we’ll also discuss safe sex practices and regular STI testing. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a lot more sense. Daily pill, every day… okay, I can manage that, I think. I'm pretty good with routines. And mild side effects… that's good to know. I’d rather deal with a headache than… well, you know. Two different medications… I guess I’ll leave that up to you, Doctor. Whatever is best for my body. And regular STI testing… that makes sense too. Layla would be happy to hear me taking this seriously. So, I just wait for the results, and then we talk more? Is there anything I need to do in the meantime? Any changes to my diet or anything?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You just wait for the results, and then we'll talk more. No changes to your diet are needed, and you don't need to restrict any activities. Just continue with your normal routine. The lab results will be sent directly to my office, and my staff will contact you as soon as they're available. It usually takes a few days, but if you haven’t heard anything within a week, please don’t hesitate to call and check in. In the meantime, if you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Do you have any other concerns or anything else you’d like to discuss before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You've been very helpful, Doctor. I feel a lot better now, knowing what to expect. And knowing I'm being proactive about this. Thank you. I guess I’ll just go home and… try not to worry too much. And maybe Layla will be relieved to hear I actually came in and did something.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I'm glad I could help. And it's wonderful that Layla is encouraging you to take care of your health. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again when the results come back. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
