DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Squiers, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. Velda Squiers. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, isn’t it? I hope I’m pronouncing that right.
DOCTOR: It’s… acceptable. Let’s not dwell on names. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, I’m planning a cruise, you see. A lovely one around the Mediterranean. And they need… information. Medical information, that is. Just to be sure I’m fit enough to travel, you understand. A form to fill out, mostly. I thought it best to get a doctor to do it, rather than try and remember everything myself.
DOCTOR: A cruise. Right. So, you’re looking for a general fitness-for-travel assessment. And a completed form. Let’s start with the basics then. Any significant medical problems I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… significant? Not that I’m aware of, no. I had a touch of the flu last winter, but everyone gets that, don’t they? And my knees ache a bit when it’s cold, but that’s just getting older, I suppose. My late husband always said I’d know the weather better than any forecast with my knees. Nothing the doctor ever needed to look at, though.
DOCTOR: “A touch of the flu” can sometimes be… more than a touch. And knee pain, even if attributed to weather, warrants some inquiry. Have you ever been formally diagnosed with anything?
PATIENT: Formally diagnosed… no, not really. I’ve never been one for fussing with doctors, to be honest. My husband, bless him, he did all the organising of that sort of thing. He always said I was “too stoic” for appointments. He took me when he thought something was wrong. So, I haven’t any papers or anything to show you, if that’s what you mean. Just the aches and pains of a… well, a woman of my age.
DOCTOR: Right. No formal diagnoses. And you haven’t seen a physician regularly?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. Just when I broke my wrist, oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. And when I had the flu, of course. But otherwise… no. My husband was very healthy, and I always figured… well, I always figured I was too. He handled all that sort of thing. It’s a bit strange now, being here on my own.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I eat most things. Sometimes a bit of indigestion, perhaps, if I have something too spicy, but that’s just common sense, isn’t it? Not a proper allergy, like swelling up or anything. I do like a nice bit of chocolate, and that hasn’t hurt me yet. Though my waistline might disagree.
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies, no food allergies resulting in significant reactions. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Never have been a fan of taking pills, if I can avoid it. Just a cup of chamomile tea before bed sometimes, if I’m feeling a bit restless. That’s all. Perfectly healthy, as far as I’m concerned. Though, admittedly, it’s been a bit longer since a doctor last had a good look at me.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Let’s do a brief physical exam, just to… confirm your assessment of your health. Blood pressure first.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I suppose a quick check can’t hurt. Though I always thought I had a perfectly good idea of how I was doing. Just try not to poke too hard, if you would. My skin’s a bit sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 148 over 92. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, though your breathing is somewhat shallow. Weight is 109 pounds. That’s… below average for your height. Any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, is it? I hadn’t realised. My husband always did the worrying about those things. And weight… well, I haven’t been keeping track, to be honest. I eat a good enough breakfast, and a nice bit of lunch. Perhaps I’ve just… lost my appetite a little, these past few months. It's hard to say. Everything feels a bit different since… since he passed. I suppose I haven’t been as focused on eating properly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to address that blood pressure. And the weight loss. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a bit tired, certainly. More tired than usual. And sometimes my hands feel a bit… numb, especially in the mornings. But I just put that down to getting older, you know? Old age creeping up. And… oh, yes. My memory isn't quite what it used to be. I sometimes forget where I put my glasses, even though they’re on my head! Though, to be fair, I’ve always been a bit forgetful.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, numbness in hands, cognitive complaints… Right. I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. We need to rule out some underlying causes for these symptoms. It’s just… prudent. We’ll also need an EKG to assess your heart.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… quite a lot. Blood work and an EKG? Is it something serious, Doctor? I just wanted a form signed for my cruise, not… a full investigation. I’m not sure I understand why all this is necessary. It’s just a nice holiday, a bit of sunshine… Surely that’s not so dangerous?
DOCTOR: It’s a standard precaution, Ms. Squiers. Your symptoms warrant investigation. Elevated blood pressure, unexplained weight loss, fatigue… these aren't things to be dismissed. Especially before embarking on a trip that may be… stressful on the body. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now, and we can schedule the EKG for tomorrow. The nurse will explain the procedure. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, that’s all. I thought I was perfectly healthy. But if you think it’s necessary… Very well. Lead the way. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Though I still don't quite understand why all this is needed for a simple cruise. But if you say so… I suppose I’d best get this done.
DOCTOR: It’s always best to be thorough. The nurse will take it from here.
