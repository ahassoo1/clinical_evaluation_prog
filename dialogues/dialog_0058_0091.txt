DOCTOR: Alright, Bianca, good to meet you. So, you're here today... what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, is good to meet you too. I been feelin' a little... off. I does be very, very thirsty, even when I drink plenty water. And I does be hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just don't seem right, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Thirsty and hungry, even with drinking and eating. Okay. And how long have you been feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me see now. It start maybe...two, three months ago? Not sure the exact time. It start slow, just a little more thirsty than usual. Then the hunger come, and it get worse and worse. Now it just...always there, you know? I does try to drink more water, eat a little more, but it not help much.
DOCTOR: Two or three months… okay. And are you noticing any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Well, I does feel a little tired sometimes, more so than usual. Not all the time, but like...weak. And I does have to go to the bathroom more often, to pee. Does that make sense, doctor? I not sure if that have anything to do with the thirst, but… it happenin' too.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness, frequent urination… and you’ve already mentioned increased thirst and hunger. Have you noticed any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Now that you mention it… yes, maybe a little blurry sometimes. But I does wear glasses already, you know? I thought it just need adjustin'. It not bad enough to bother with, I just… squint a little when I read. Is that what you mean, doctor?
DOCTOR: Squinting, blurry vision... right. And are you experiencing any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss... hmm. Now, that is a good question. I don't think so. Maybe a pound or two, but not much. I does try to keep my weight steady, you know? I like my food too much to lose weight! But I not sure, doctor. Is hard to say for sure. I not weigh myself every day.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any sores that are slow to heal, or any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Slow to heal sores… no, not really. I get little cuts and scrapes sometimes, like when I workin' with the pipes, but they heal up normal. Numbness in my hands and feet… no, doctor. Not that I notice. I does feel a little ache in my back sometimes, from liftin' things, but not numbness or tinglin'. Is that all you need to know for now? I hope is nothin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms—increased thirst, frequent urination, hunger, fatigue, blurry vision—we need to run some tests to rule out a few possibilities. It could be something simple, but we need to check your blood sugar levels to see if everything is in order. I'm going to order a basic metabolic panel and a fasting glucose test. Do you have any known allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Medication allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, doctor. I never had any problems with any medicine before. I does get a little dizzy sometimes after takin' pills, but I think that just 'cause I not used to them. I try to stay away from medicine if I can, you know? I prefer to rest and drink plenty water when I feel sick. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. Okay, I’m going to need to draw some blood. We'll send it off to the lab, and we should have the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I want you to try and maintain a consistent diet and drink your usual amount of water. Don't drastically change anything. The nurse will come in and take you to the lab. I'll review the results when they come back and we'll discuss the next steps then. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh…okay. So, you think is my blood sugar? Is it somethin' serious, doctor? And how long will I have to wait for the results? A few days is how long, exactly? I does get worried easily, you know. And… will the nurse tell me what happen? I just… I does like to know what goin' on. Is that alright to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, I said “rule out.” We don’t know if it’s your blood sugar yet. That's why we're doing the tests. It could be something else entirely. As for how long, "a few days" generally means 2-3 business days. The lab needs time to process everything. And the nurse will likely just tell you they've drawn the blood and it's being sent to the lab. They won’t give you results. I will contact you when they're back. I understand you're worried, but jumping to conclusions won't help. We need to be patient and wait for the results. Is there anything else I can address right now?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. I get it. No jumpin' to conclusions. Patience. Right. Sorry, doctor. I just get anxious easy, that's all. No, I think that's all for now. Thank you, doctor. You been very helpful. I just… I hope is nothin' too bad. I does have a lot of work to do. I need to keep the water pumps runnin', you know? I will wait for your call. Thank you again.
