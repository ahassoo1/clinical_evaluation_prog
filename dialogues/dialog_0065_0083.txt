DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card, maybe? Or something encouraging. My… friend, she’s not been feeling too well, and a card from a doctor… well, it would mean a lot. More than anything I could say, you understand.
DOCTOR: A medical note… as encouragement?
PATIENT: Well, not a medical note, exactly. Just… a little something official. With your name on it. You know, to show it’s serious. People listen to doctors. It’s… common sense. I don’t need a diagnosis or anything. Just a few words. A simple “Get well soon” from Doctor Duplichan. It's for a friend, a very good friend.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. My role is to provide medical care, to assess and treat illnesses, not to… compose greeting cards. That’s… outside the scope of my practice, and frankly, a little unusual. I’m concerned that you're seeking this from me instead of, perhaps, a personal expression of support. Is there something else going on here?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. Unusual? It’s not unusual. It’s… thoughtful. And I am expressing support! By asking you to do it! You’re a doctor! You have… authority. Words from a doctor carry weight. My friend, she's… she’s a bit down, and frankly, she doesn't listen to me much anymore. She needs someone… respectable to tell her things will be alright. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you want to help your friend, but using my professional standing in this way is… inappropriate. It creates a conflict of ethics. It implies a medical endorsement of something I haven't assessed. And, honestly, it's a misuse of my time and resources. I need to focus on patients who require actual medical attention. Now, is there a medical reason you’re seeking my assistance today?
PATIENT: Misuse of your… time? I'm paying for your time, aren't I? And it's not like I'm asking you to perform surgery! A few words, that's all! You make it sound like I'm asking for a kidney! And what “ethics”? What ethics are being broken by a little kindness? I just thought… well, I thought a doctor would want to help people. Even with something small. It’s… disappointing, Doctor. Very disappointing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate you are a paying patient, that does not grant you the right to dictate the use of my professional credentials in a manner that is not ethically sound or clinically relevant. A doctor’s words hold weight precisely because they are based on medical assessment and expertise. A random “Get well soon” from me, devoid of any context, is misleading. It suggests a medical opinion where none exists. Furthermore, it undermines the trust patients place in the medical profession. I am here to provide healthcare, not to act as a… personal encourager. Now, are you experiencing any health concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture about “trust” and “ethics”. I just wanted a little card! I’ve heard good things about you, Doctor. Thought you’d be more… accommodating. This is ridiculous. Fine. You don’t want to help. I’ll find someone else. Someone who understands common courtesy. I suppose I wasted my co-pay.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, please. I understand you're frustrated, but frankly, this conversation is becoming unproductive. If you are not experiencing a medical issue that requires my attention, then I suggest you seek assistance elsewhere. I am a physician, not a… stationery service. I wish you and your friend all the best, but I cannot fulfill your request. I’m afraid this consultation is over.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. You're a very… rigid woman, Doctor. I was just trying to do something nice. A little kindness goes a long way, you know. But you wouldn't understand that. I hope your patients appreciate all your “ethics”. .
