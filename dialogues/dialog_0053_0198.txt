DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s nice to meet you. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about… well, just trying to feel a bit more centered, I suppose. I was hoping to talk about mindfulness or meditation. I’ve heard it can be helpful, and I’d like to explore if it might be a good fit for me.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness…right. Well, that's…certainly a choice people make. Before we delve into that, though, let's get a proper medical history. I'm a doctor, not a life coach. Are you experiencing any specific physical symptoms that are causing you stress?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand completely, Doctor. You’re right to ask. No, not really physical symptoms, not exactly. It’s more… a feeling of being scattered, I guess? Like my mind is always racing. I don't have any pain or anything like that. It’s just… hard to switch off, you know? I work with the tracks, so it's important to be focused, but even when I’m not working, it’s hard to relax. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tracks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, signal and track switches. It’s… well, it's a responsibility, keeping things running safely. Lots of details to remember, schedules to keep. It’s not a bad job, not at all. It's just… demanding, I suppose. I’ve been doing it for over twenty years now. It’s just recently this feeling of being… overwhelmed has started to bother me.
DOCTOR: Twenty years... Right. And before we go any further, have you had a recent physical?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one just last November with Dr. Petrova. Everything was… well, everything was normal. Blood pressure a little high, she said, but nothing to worry about yet. She just told me to watch my salt intake. I have Medicare, so I get everything checked regularly, you know? She didn’t mention anything about my… feelings, though. It’s just something new, this mental restlessness.
DOCTOR: "BP slightly elevated - November 2024." Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for that, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. Dr. Petrova said to try and manage it with diet first. More vegetables, less salt, you know the drill. I’ve been trying, honestly, but it doesn’t seem to be making a huge difference. And really, it's not that high, she said. Just a little bit on the higher side. It’s this… racing mind that’s really bothering me. I suppose I’m hoping that if I could calm that down, maybe my blood pressure would come down too? Does that sound… silly?
DOCTOR: It sounds… optimistic, let's put it that way. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, at least not that was serious enough to require a doctor. I’m pretty good with most foods, no issues there. I can eat shellfish, I don’t have a pollen allergy, nothing like that. My mother always said I had a strong constitution, and I think she was right! It’s the mental stuff that’s getting to me, not the physical.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. My mother lived to be 85, very healthy all her life, as I said. My father, he had some heart trouble later in life, but he also smoked for most of his adult life, so I don't know if that’s relevant. My brother is fine, as far as I know. No history of… mental illness, or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains as people get older, you know? Nothing major. I suppose I'm a bit of an anomaly, worrying about my mind when everyone else had physical problems.
DOCTOR: And your lifestyle, Ms. Sugino?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, I’ve been single for quite a while now. I mostly keep to myself. I like to read, and I enjoy cooking. I walk when the weather is nice. I don't really go out much. I don’t drink, and I definitely don't smoke. It’s a pretty quiet life, honestly. I have a few friends from work, but we don’t see each other much outside of the job. It's… routine, I suppose. A very predictable routine. Is that what you mean by lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Predictable, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very. I wake up, I have breakfast, I go to work, I come home, I cook dinner, I read a bit, I go to bed. Weekends are mostly the same, just without the work. It's not a bad life, I enjoy it. But I've been thinking lately that maybe… maybe I need to shake things up a bit. That's why I was hoping to talk about mindfulness. I thought maybe learning to be more present, to focus on the now, might help me feel less… scattered.
DOCTOR: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. You say you feel ‘scattered’. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. It’s like… my thoughts are always jumping around. I'll be trying to focus on something, like reading a book, and my mind will just drift off to something else. Or I’ll be at work, and I’ll be thinking about what I need to do later, instead of focusing on the task at hand. It's like I have too many tabs open in my brain, all at once. And it makes it hard to relax, hard to fall asleep. I just can't seem to quiet it down. It’s not anxiety, I don't think. It’s just… a constant stream of thoughts, and it’s exhausting. And sometimes, I find it hard to remember things, even simple things. It's frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: So, you're experiencing difficulty concentrating and some forgetfulness. Are these difficulties interfering with your job performance?
PATIENT: Well, not yet, thankfully. I've been very careful. I double-check everything, I write things down, I ask my colleagues to confirm things with me. It takes a bit more effort, definitely. But I haven’t made any serious mistakes, not yet. That’s what worries me, though. I’ve been doing this job for so long, I’m usually very efficient. But lately, I find I have to concentrate much harder to get the same results. And the forgetfulness is… subtle, but it's there. Like forgetting where I put my tools, or forgetting the details of a schedule change. It's not a big deal, but it's enough to make me nervous. I don’t want to make a mistake that could put someone in danger, you know? That’s why I wanted to address it now, before it becomes a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. Let’s run a few basic cognitive tests. It's standard procedure, and will give us a baseline to work from. Then, I'll order a complete blood panel, including thyroid function. It's always best to rule out any underlying medical causes first. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and find a way to feel more like myself again. So, the cognitive tests and the blood panel… alright. Let's get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I have a short series of questions here. Please answer as accurately as you can. First question: What is today's date?
PATIENT: Today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Please tell me the words.
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, try to remember those. I'll ask you to recall them later.
PATIENT: Okay, apple, table, penny. I’ve got them. Apple, table, penny. I’ll try my best to remember.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of simple math questions. Please do them in your head, and tell me the answers. What is 7 times 8?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… 7 times 8 is… 56.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, subtract 13 from 27.
PATIENT: 27 minus 13 is… 14.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to name as many animals as you can in one minute. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. Okay, let’s see… dog, cat, lion, tiger, bear, elephant, giraffe, monkey, zebra… cow, pig, chicken, sheep… oh, and a horse! And a dolphin… and a whale… um… a kangaroo…
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough. Now, can you recall the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… um… was it… orange? No, that's not right. One was… apple, I remember that. And… and something with metal… penny? Yes, penny. And… table! It was apple, table, and penny. I think. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this initial assessment, your short-term recall is somewhat diminished, but your general knowledge and calculation skills are intact. We'll need to run the blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to this. I'll have the lab technician draw some samples now. And then, we'll discuss the results and develop a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds… thorough, Doctor. It’s just a little unsettling to hear about the short-term recall. But I understand you need to rule things out. Blood work sounds good. So, the lab technician will come in next? Okay. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send her in momentarily. We’ll also discuss lifestyle factors once we have the results, but I suspect a bit of mental stimulation might be beneficial in any case. Don’t worry too much, Ms. Sugino. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll be back shortly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will try not to worry. .
