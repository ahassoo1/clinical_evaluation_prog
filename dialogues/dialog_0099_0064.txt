DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Chelberg, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's my chest, you see. It's been… bothering me. Not all the time, but enough to worry an old lady like me. It's a pain, kinda. Not a bad bad pain, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, right. Vague symptoms are… less than helpful, you know. Alright. How long has this “uncomfortable” feeling been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right, sorry. It's hard to explain. Let me think… maybe, oh, a week now? A little over, maybe. It started just a little twinge, and it's gotten… more noticeable. It comes and goes. Not when I'm doing anything hard, just… sometimes when I'm sitting. Or even walking slow. It’s funny, really.
DOCTOR: “Funny” isn’t usually the word I’d use to describe chest pain, Ms. Chelberg. But alright. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry again Doctor! I didn't mean funny ha-ha. Just… strange. It’s… like a squeezing. Not real tight, but… like someone is holding my chest a little too firm. And it feels… heavy sometimes. Not like a weight, but… hard to breathe when it’s happening, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Heavy”?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… when you’re really, really sad, and your chest feels… full? Like it’s hard to take a big breath. Not like I can't breathe, but… I don't want to, because it feels… tight. Maybe it’s just my nerves. I worry a lot, you see. My husband, he tells me to stop! But it’s hard.
DOCTOR: You said a week. Is this constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Definitely. It's not… all day long, no. More like… a few times a day. Maybe three or four times. And it doesn’t last long. Just a few minutes, then it goes away. Sometimes it happens when I’m sitting and watching the television, sometimes when I’m making dinner. Nothing special seems to make it happen, really.
DOCTOR: And you said it doesn't radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Oh… I don’t know what that means, Doctor. Does that mean… spread? It doesn’t… go into my arm or my back, no. It just stays right here. <points to her chest> Right in the middle. Sometimes a little on the left side, but mostly just in the middle. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… again… in… and out… Lungs sound clear enough. Heart rate is… regular, but a little elevated. Let’s check your blood pressure. <Takes blood pressure, muttering the numbers under his breath.> 140 over 90. A little high. And your oxygen saturation is… 96%. Perfectly acceptable. Now, have you noticed any shortness of breath, any nausea, sweating, dizziness?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Sweating… well, it’s August, Doctor! It’s hot! I sweat a little, but that’s normal. No, no nausea or dizziness. And I haven't felt… faint or anything like that. I did feel a little tired yesterday, but I think that was just from the heat. It was a very warm day, you know. I did a lot of cleaning. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: You mentioned cleaning. Any recent illness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. I haven’t been sick. Not a cold, not the flu, nothing. My husband, he had a little sniffle last month, but I stayed away from him! I always do, you know? Don't want to catch anything. I am careful. No, no illness at all. Just this chest thing. And being an old lady and worrying too much! <chuckles weakly>
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That's a long story, Doctor! My mother, she had… trouble with her heart, later in life. Not sure what kind of trouble. She didn’t go to doctors much. Old-fashioned woman, she was. My father, he was healthy as a horse, until he wasn’t, you know? Just… stopped one day. My sister, she has… high blood pressure, I think? She lives in Bogotá, so I don't see her much. Does that help? It’s a big family, and I don't remember everything. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It always matters, Ms. Chelberg. Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None. I haven't taken much medicine in my life. Just… pain pills for my arthritis sometimes, but nothing special. And I don't react to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband, he's allergic to… something in peanuts, I think? But not me. No, no allergies. Just old age! <forces a smile>
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Chelberg, based on what you've told me… it could be musculoskeletal pain, perhaps aggravated by the heat and your activity. Or, given your family history, we should rule out cardiac causes. I’m going to order an EKG, a chest X-ray, and some blood work, including cardiac enzymes. I also want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a lot of tests, Doctor. <fidgets with her hands> But yes, I understand. EKG, X-ray, and blood work. And come back next week. And go to the emergency room if it gets bad. I will. I’ll try not to worry too much, but it’s hard, you know? Where do I go for those tests? Is it here in the building?
DOCTOR: The lab is just across the hall. The radiology department is down the hall to your left. The receptionist will schedule the appointments for you. They'll provide you with the necessary paperwork. I will have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them next week. And yes, Ms. Chelberg, try not to worry. It is likely nothing serious. But we need to be thorough. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You explained it all very clearly. Across the hall for the lab, and down the hall for the X-ray. And come back next week. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor Overgaard. You've been very patient with me. I do worry too much, you know. <smiles weakly> I’ll go find the receptionist now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Don’t hesitate to call if you experience any changes in your condition. And try to get some rest, Ms. Chelberg. .
