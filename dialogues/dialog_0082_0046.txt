DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some…pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me enough that I thought I should come get it checked out. It’s been happening for about a week now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure for about a week. That's good information to start with. Can you tell me a little more about the pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe exactly. It’s not painful, not really. More like a constant fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. And sometimes I feel like I need to go, urgently, even if there isn’t much actually there. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. A constant fullness and that urgency even after emptying… unsettling is a good way to put it. And how often are you finding yourself needing to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Well, normally, I go about every three or four hours, perhaps with one overnight. But this past week…it’s been closer to every hour or two, even if it’s just a small amount. It's disrupting my sleep a bit, and frankly, it's hard to concentrate at work. I'm a graphic designer, so I need to be able to focus.
DOCTOR: Every hour or two, disrupting sleep and work… alright. And when you do go, is it easy to start, or do you have to strain?
PATIENT: It’s usually easy to start, thankfully. No straining or difficulty there. The flow seems normal, it's just…the frequency is the problem, and that feeling of needing to go so often. It just doesn’t feel right. I don't have any pain during urination, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination, easy to start, normal flow… just the frequency and the fullness. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t specifically been looking, if that makes sense. But I don’t recall seeing any blood, and the color seems normal – a typical light yellow. I haven’t noticed any unusual smell either, thankfully. It’s all been very… subtle, aside from the feeling itself. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. No blood, normal color or smell… alright. Now, let's back up a little. Have you had any fever, chills, or any pain in your back or side recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no fever, chills, or any back or side pain. I've been feeling otherwise perfectly healthy, just this bladder issue. I haven't had any nausea or vomiting, either. I’ve been keeping a close eye on things, just in case, but everything else seems perfectly normal. I did have a small cold about a month ago, but that was it, and it resolved quickly.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, back pain, nausea… just the cold about a month ago that resolved. Okay. Now, thinking about your medical history… Have you ever had any urinary tract infections, bladder problems, or kidney stones before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I've always been quite healthy, honestly. I've never had a UTI, never been diagnosed with any bladder issues, and thankfully, never had kidney stones. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course, but nothing major. My doctor back home always said I had a very robust immune system. I have Medicare, and I’ve been keeping up with my annual check-ups, so everything has always been good.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior UTIs, bladder problems, or kidney stones. Robust immune system, regular check-ups… good to know. Now, before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. I don't take any regular medications. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements regularly. I try to eat a balanced diet, and I drink plenty of water. I haven't changed anything in my routine recently that I can think of. It’s quite puzzling, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Okay. And do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, and I don’t have any food allergies. I can eat pretty much anything. It’s one of the things I’m grateful for! My husband sometimes jokes that I’ll eat anything put in front of me. But it’s true, I haven’t had any allergic reactions in my life, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's good. Now, just a couple more questions about your family history… Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of bladder problems, kidney disease, or frequent UTIs?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had some urinary incontinence later in life, after having children, but that was quite a long time ago. And my grandfather had kidney stones, but that was also many years ago. He was a very active man and didn’t drink enough water, according to my grandmother. Aside from that, I don’t recall any other significant bladder or kidney issues in my family. My husband's family is…well, we don't see them very often, so I'm not really aware of their medical history.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with incontinence, grandfather with kidney stones… alright. Now, thinking about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions – and I absolutely do not use any recreational drugs. I'm very health-conscious, as you can probably tell. My husband and I enjoy hiking and being outdoors, and we try to maintain a healthy lifestyle. That’s why this is so concerning. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or activity level that would explain this.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs, active lifestyle… Okay. Well, Marialena, thank you for providing all of this information. It's helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve listening to your abdomen and a brief pelvic exam, just to rule out any obvious issues. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I understand, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this. A physical exam sounds fine. Please let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Great. No special preparation needed. Just relax. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then we’ll move onto the pelvic exam. I'll explain everything as I go. If you could lie down there, we’ll get started. Alright, everything sounds normal here – no unusual sounds or tenderness. Now, I’m going to proceed with the pelvic exam. I’ll let you know each step as I go, and please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you feel any discomfort. Okay, everything appears normal visually as well. I don't feel any masses or tenderness. However, I do note some mild inflammation. It's subtle, but it's there. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you may have a mild urinary tract infection, or possibly some sort of bladder irritation. To be sure, I'd like to order a urine sample for a lab analysis. That will help us identify any bacteria present and determine the best course of treatment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. A urine sample to confirm seems like a very logical next step. I’m happy to provide one. Hopefully, it will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I must admit, I was a bit concerned it might be something more serious, so I’m relieved to hear it might be something treatable. Do I need to do anything special when collecting the sample?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. You'll receive a sterile cup and instructions in the restroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-way through. This helps avoid any contamination. I'll have the nurse bring that over to you now. While we wait for the results, I'll also review your EHR to see if there is anything relevant. Are there any concerns you’d like me to prioritize when looking at your history?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect. I appreciate you checking my history, Doctor. Hmm…I don’t think there’s anything specific to prioritize, I suppose. I’ve always been quite healthy, as we discussed. Perhaps just check for any past instances of colds or flu? It’s a long shot, but I’m grasping at straws, trying to understand what might have triggered this. Otherwise, please just review everything thoroughly – you’re the expert, and I trust your judgment. It’s more helpful for me if you consider all possibilities.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll review everything thoroughly, including any past instances of colds and flu. It’s always good to consider all possibilities. Okay, I’m looking at your EHR now. There’s nothing significant to note – a few routine check-ups, a childhood vaccination record… Your history is remarkably unremarkable, as you said. The nurse is here with the cup for your urine sample now. Once you’ve collected it, hand it to her, and she’ll send it to the lab. We should have the results back within a few hours. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to help flush out your system. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Drinking plenty of fluids makes perfect sense. I’ll go ahead and collect the sample now, then. Thank you for being so thorough and patient with me. I feel much better knowing we’re taking the right steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marialena. That's what I'm here for. Don't hesitate to call if you experience any increased pain, fever, or chills while you wait for the results. I’ll be in my office if you need anything. Take your time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
