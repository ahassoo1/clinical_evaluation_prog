DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just hasn't gone away. It’s all over, really – my arms, my legs, even my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, “itchy skin all over” for several weeks. And you said it’s affecting your arms, legs, and back specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, those are the worst places. It’s not just those places, mind you, but those are where I really notice it. It's a dry itch, not like…a bug bite itch, you know? Just…constant. It makes me want to scratch all the time.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. I haven't started using any new soaps or lotions, not that I can remember. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. Oh! Well, my granddaughter came to visit for a week, and she brought a new laundry detergent. Maybe…could that be it? It smelled very strong, floral, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, new laundry detergent used during a recent visit from your granddaughter. That’s helpful. And when did she leave?
PATIENT: She left about a week ago, maybe a little more. Right around the time I think the itching really started getting bad. She stayed with me for about seven days, I believe. A good girl, but she likes her strong perfumes and things!
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the itching, have you noticed any rash, bumps, blisters, or changes in the color of your skin?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It’s just…redness, sometimes, from all the scratching. But no bumps or anything. It doesn’t look…bad, just irritated. And definitely itchy!
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. I sleep alright, eat alright… I feel fine, otherwise. Just this awful itching. It’s really getting to me, Doctor. It's distracting, you know? Hard to concentrate on my work when all I want to do is scratch!
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I’m not on any regular medications, either. I try to stay away from them if I can. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's about it. No, I can’t think of anything, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we're dealing with a possible irritant contact dermatitis, likely from the laundry detergent. However, it’s important to rule out other things. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this itching to stop!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take a look. Please loosen your clothing so I can examine your arms and back. I'll start with your arms. I'm looking for any signs of inflammation or rash. Do you feel any pain or tenderness in this area?
PATIENT: No pain, just the itch, Doctor. It's really bad when you touch it, actually, makes it worse. And it feels…rough, almost scaly. It’s hard to describe. Like…old leather, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing some diffuse redness and mild scaling on both forearms. No visible blisters or welts. And you're right, the skin does feel rough to the touch. Similar findings on your back—redness, mild scaling, and some areas of excoriation, which is consistent with scratching. Alright. It does appear to be a fairly widespread dermatitis. We can take a closer look at the areas with a Wood's lamp to rule out fungal infections.
PATIENT: Oh, a lamp? Is that going to hurt? I don’t mind a little poking and prodding, but I really don’t like things that shine in my eyes. It’s just…sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt at all, Ms. Cassimatis. It doesn't shine in your eyes, it shines on your skin. It uses ultraviolet light to see if there’s a fungal infection that isn’t visible to the naked eye. It’s a quick, painless test. Would you like me to explain more about why we do it?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Not in my eyes, that's good. And it’s to check for…something else hiding under the skin? Okay. Yes, please, explain a little. I always like to know what's going on. I might not understand all the fancy words, but just the general idea is helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Some fungal infections actually glow under ultraviolet light, even if you can’t see them with the naked eye. It's a quick way to rule them out. If it doesn’t glow, it’s very unlikely to be a fungus. It doesn’t change anything about how we treat it, it’s just helpful information. Okay, let's take a look. No fluorescence detected. And the same on your back. So, it doesn’t appear to be a fungal infection. That makes irritant contact dermatitis even more likely.
PATIENT: Oh, good! No glow, that's good. I’m glad it’s not…one of those things. So, the laundry detergent then? That’s what’s making me itch?
DOCTOR: It's very likely, Ms. Cassimatis. It fits the presentation perfectly. New laundry detergent, widespread dermatitis, no signs of infection… it all points that way. We can confirm it with a patch test, but given the history, I'm fairly confident. To start, I recommend stopping use of the new detergent immediately and switching back to your previous brand. And I’m going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and relieve the itching. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Stop the detergent, cream for the itch… I can definitely do that. I don’t even want to look at that detergent again! Is the cream something I get at the pharmacy? And…is it anything strong? I don’t like taking things that have a lot of side effects.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a prescription cream you’ll get at the pharmacy. I’m prescribing a mild potency topical corticosteroid—hydrocortisone 2.5%. It’s generally very safe and has minimal side effects when used as directed. The most common side effect is temporary thinning of the skin at the application site, but that's rare with this strength, and it’s easily avoided by using it only as directed. I'll write down clear instructions on the prescription. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for two weeks. If it doesn’t improve after that, we can consider a stronger cream, but let’s start with this. And avoid scratching as much as possible—easier said than done, I know, but it will help prevent infection and allow the skin to heal.
PATIENT: Okay, hydrocortisone 2.5%, twice a day for two weeks, and no scratching. I can try my best on the scratching part. It’s just so itchy! But yes, I can definitely stop using that awful detergent. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what to do. Do I need to make another appointment?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'm glad I could help. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how the cream is working. If it’s significantly improved, we don’t need to come in. But if it's not, or if you develop any signs of infection—increased redness, pain, pus, fever—call the office immediately. Here's a summary of everything we discussed, along with the prescription details. And my nurse will schedule that follow-up appointment for you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Deschane. Thank you so much for listening and explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Now I just need to get home and throw out that detergent!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad I could help. And yes, getting rid of the detergent is a good first step! Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
