DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Londell. Well, I’m getting on in years, you know? Sixty-nine this last spring. I figured it was time to see if everything’s still… running right, for lack of a better way to put it. My daughter, bless her heart, she kept on me about a “men’s health optimization visit.” Seemed like a good idea, honestly. Just want to make sure I’m doin' things right and stayin’ healthy as long as I can.
DOCTOR: Yes, a preventative visit is always a good idea, Londell. "Optimization" is…a term. We'll certainly see what's going on. So, are you experiencing any specific symptoms that prompted this visit, or is this mostly a check-up?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ specific, thankfully. No aches or pains I can’t explain with just gettin’ older, you know? Sleep ain't quite what it used to be, but who at my age can complain about that? Mostly just want to make sure things are tickin’ along like they should. My energy levels feel alright, but…well, it's just good to have a doctor take a look, I suppose. Haven't been to one in a good while, to be honest. Mostly just tried to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no complaints, per se…just a general wellness check. You mentioned sleep. Is it difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or just not feeling rested when you wake up?
PATIENT: It's mostly stayin’ asleep, I think. I can usually drift off alright enough. But I wake up…oh, two, three times a night sometimes. And then it takes a bit to get back under. Not every night, mind you. But enough that I don't feel as sharp in the mornings as I used to. Used to be I could jump outta bed and get right to work on my etchings. Now… well, it takes a bit more coaxin'. It don’t really bother me too much, but it's there. And like I said, my daughter, she worries.
DOCTOR: Etchings, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. Been doin’ it for… well, close to fifty years now. Started with woodcuts, mostly. Then got into copper plate and zinc engraving. It’s quiet work, you know? Peaceful. I sell some at local art fairs, mostly. Keeps me busy, keeps my hands movin’. My grandfather taught me, he was a Cherokee artist too. It’s kinda a family thing. Always somethin’ to be learnin' with it, different techniques and such.
DOCTOR: That’s…nice. A good hobby. It's important to stay active, mentally and physically. Now, regarding this sleep disturbance…has anything changed recently that might be contributing?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really, not that I can think of. I haven't changed my routine much in years. I try to keep a regular bedtime, same thing every night, mostly. Read a bit, maybe listen to some quiet music. I do drink a cup of chamomile tea before bed, always have. The only thing…well, my daughter moved back in with her two young ones a few months ago. They’re good kids, don't get me wrong, and I love havin' 'em around, but it’s…busier around here now, that's for sure. More noise. Maybe that's got somethin' to do with it. I wouldn’t want to blame the grandkids, though.
DOCTOR: It's reasonable to suspect a change in your environment could be contributing. Alright. Let's go through some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve had the usual shots, flu and tetanus and such. No real medical history, either. Just the normal bumps and bruises that come with gettin’ older. I broke my wrist when I was a boy, fallin’ outta a tree, but that healed up alright. Otherwise, pretty good health, all things considered. My mother lived to be ninety-two, so I reckon good genes are on my side.
DOCTOR: Good. No significant medical history is helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never needed any. Knock on wood. Always been lucky enough to avoid the need, thankfully. Just small things, like gettin' stitches a few times when I was a kid, but nothin’ major. My grandfather always said a strong body heals itself, and I reckon he was right. I try to stay active, like I mentioned, and eat right. Not fancy, mind you, just good wholesome food. Mostly what my wife used to cook. It’s been a few years since she passed, so… I still try to eat what she did. It's…comfortin'.
DOCTOR: I see. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. My regular doctor prescribed it a few years back, somethin' about keepin' the blood thin. And sometimes I take an over-the-counter sleep aid, just the kind with diphenhydramine in it, when I’m really havin' trouble gettin' back to sleep. But I don't take it every night, just when I absolutely need to. That's it, really. I prefer to avoid medication if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother's side, there was a bit of diabetes. Not in her generation, but her mother and a couple of her siblings had it. Heart trouble too, a few cases of that. My father’s side, not much I know of, really. He didn't talk much about his family. He was a quiet man, like me. He did have some arthritis in his hands later in life, but that's about it. It’s funny, I always thought I might get the arthritis, with all the detailed work I do with my etchings. But so far, so good. They feel alright, thankfully. Though sometimes a bit stiff after a long day.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been a widower for about five years now. My wife, bless her heart, she passed away after a long illness. We didn't have any children, so it's just me and the memories these days. I live alone in the house we shared, out in the county. I keep busy with my etchings, like I said, and I’m a member of the local Cherokee Nation chapter. We have meetings a couple times a month and do some community work. And now with my grandkids around more, I spend time with them, readin’ stories and such. I used to smoke a pipe, a long time ago, but I gave that up when I got married. And I don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner every now and then. Pretty quiet life, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat.
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. I haven't had a good physical in… well, a long while. I reckon it's a good idea to get checked out. Go ahead when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, a little fast, but within normal limits for your age. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142/88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Ears look clear. Throat looks clear. No visible signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits, Londell. A little elevated blood pressure, but nothing alarming at this point.
PATIENT: That's…reassuring to hear, Doctor. I always worry about my blood pressure, my wife had some trouble with that towards the end. Just tryin’ to stay healthy, you know? I’ve been feelin’ alright, like I said, but it’s good to know everything’s tickin’ along. What do you think about that sleep issue? Is there somethin’ I can do besides takin' those over-the-counter pills? I don't like relyin’ on ‘em too much.
DOCTOR: It's good you're proactive about it, and avoiding medication when possible is wise. Your sleep disturbance could be related to a number of factors, and it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing, as could stress – even subtle changes like having your grandkids around, as pleasant as they are. We could try a few things. First, I’d like you to keep a sleep diary for the next two weeks. Note what time you go to bed, what time you wake up, how many times you wake up during the night, and anything that might be affecting your sleep—what you ate, how much exercise you got, what you were thinking about before bed. We also need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I'd like to order some basic blood work to check your thyroid function, blood sugar, and vitamin D levels. And a PSA test, just as a baseline. Do you have any objections to those tests?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all, Doctor. Sounds sensible to me. Blood work is fine, and I can definitely keep a sleep diary. Never done one before, but I can give it a try. I reckon writin' things down will make me think about it more, too. See if I can spot any patterns. And you think it could just be stress with the grandkids? It is nice havin’ 'em around, but it’s a bit different than just me bein' quiet in the house. Old habits, I suppose. Alright. Let’s do the blood work. And I’ll start writin’ down my sleep stuff tonight. Just tell me where to go for the blood work, and I’ll get it done as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the right. They’ll take care of everything. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we can discuss them at your follow-up appointment in two weeks. In the meantime, try to establish a relaxing bedtime routine—warm bath, reading, quiet music. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed, and try to keep a consistent sleep schedule, even on weekends. We'll see what the bloodwork shows, and go from there. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me. It's good to know I'm not just bein' an old worrywart. I’ll go get the blood work done right away. And I’ll start that sleep diary tonight. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. It was a pleasure meeting you. If anything changes or you develop any new symptoms, don't hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
