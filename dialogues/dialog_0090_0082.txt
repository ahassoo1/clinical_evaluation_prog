DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Odell. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... travel? I need... something for travel. My wife... she liked to go places. Now... now I go. For her. It was... her birthday trip, you know? August 15th. I think. Somewhere warm.
DOCTOR: Right. A trip… for your wife. And you need… something for it?
PATIENT: Yeah. Like… shots? Pills? I don't know what she took. She always handled all of this. I just… built the planes. You know? Big planes. Not… little travel stuff. It’s...important to be safe, right? For the trip?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course, safety is paramount. It sounds like you’re a bit unsure of what you might need, which is perfectly alright. Let's try to figure it out. First, where exactly are you traveling to?
PATIENT: Somewhere… with beaches. Lots of sun. And… water. I think it was… Mexico? Or… maybe Florida? She liked both. It had… fancy hotels. And… food. Good food. I just... followed her. I don't remember the name of the place. It was… expensive. Very expensive.
DOCTOR: Alright. Mexico or Florida… both warm destinations. Knowing where specifically will help me determine what vaccinations or preventative medications you might require. Do you have any documentation – a plane ticket, hotel reservation, anything at all with the name of the resort or city you're visiting?
PATIENT: Um… I think this is it. A picture of the hotel… and some bills. See? It says… “Paradise Cove.” And… Cancun? Is that in Mexico? I think she booked it online… I don’t know how to use the computer very well. She did everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Cancun is in Mexico. Okay, that helps a lot. Now, besides vaccinations, we should also discuss things like traveler's diarrhea prevention and mosquito-borne illnesses. Have you traveled internationally before?
PATIENT: Just… with her. A few times. Europe, once. And… Hawaii. But she always took everything. Little pills, creams… she had a whole bag. I didn’t even look at it. I just… fixed the planes. Big planes. Safe planes. This… this is different. So much smaller. And… I don't want to get sick. Especially not now.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's alright to feel overwhelmed. Since this is your first time managing this on your own, we'll go through everything carefully. Let's start with your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not that I know of. I’m pretty strong. I build planes, remember? Big, strong planes. I lift heavy things all day. I get tired sometimes… but that’s just… work. Doctor says my blood pressure is okay. Last time he checked… a few years ago. I don’t go to the doctor much. Unless something’s broken. Planes break sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. To stay awake. For the planes. And… sometimes a painkiller for my back. It hurts sometimes, from lifting. The pills… they're blue. Small blue pills. I buy them at the store. Not… a doctor’s prescription. Just… from the store. They help. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… not that I remember. She always asked me that. Before giving me anything. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat everything. She liked to try new foods… I just ate whatever she gave me. No problems. Never had a reaction. I think. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes? But that was probably just the sun.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about the trip itself. When are you leaving for Cancun?
PATIENT: August 15th. That’s… her birthday. I already told you. I booked the plane… the same day she booked the hotel. She wanted everything to be perfect. I… I just want to go. I promised her. It’s… important. I need to go.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's do a quick physical exam just to make sure everything is alright before we discuss specific medications. Could you step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I'm not very tall, you know. But I'm strong. For building planes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your height is 155 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah. That's… about right. Not very tall. But strong. I can lift heavy things. You know. For the planes. Is something wrong? Are you… worried? I just want to go to Cancun. For her.
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing to worry about yet. Just gathering information. Now, let’s check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please have a seat on the exam table.
PATIENT: Okay. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. For the trip. I need to pack. And… remember things. She always remembered everything. I don't… I don't know what I'm forgetting.
DOCTOR: It won't take long. Just a few quick checks. It's a little elevated, but not concerning. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Everything sounds clear, but your breathing is a little shallow. Do you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Um… no. Not really. Sometimes… tired. But that’s just the planes. Long days. Heavy things. I don't… I don't get chest pain. Never had that. Maybe… a little cough sometimes? But that’s just… dust. From the planes. A lot of dust. Is something wrong? You’re worrying me now. I just want to go to Cancun. For her.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant findings so far. Now, let's just take a look at your throat and ears. Everything looks clear. Now, one last thing… do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Um… Sometimes… a little. But that’s just… standing all day. At the planes. Long days. Heavy things. It goes away when I sit down. Is something wrong? You’re making me nervous. I just want to go to Cancun. For her. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Odell, everything looks generally okay, but I am a little concerned about your weight and some of your symptoms. It’s important to address these before your trip to ensure you’re healthy enough to travel safely. I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. And I think it would be beneficial to get a chest x-ray as well.
PATIENT: Blood tests? X-ray? Is something wrong? Am I… sick? I just want to go to Cancun. For her. I don’t want to be sick. I promised her. I can’t… I can’t get sick. I build planes. I’m strong. I don’t need tests. I just need… the pills. For the trip. What pills do I need? Can you just give me the pills?
DOCTOR: Odell, it’s not about you being sick right now. It’s about making sure you stay healthy on your trip. These tests will help us identify any potential issues and prevent them from becoming serious. They're a standard precaution, especially with travel to a new environment. I understand you're anxious, and I want to help you feel safe and prepared. We can't just give you pills without knowing what's going on. That could be dangerous. Think of it like inspecting a plane before takeoff – we need to check everything to ensure a smooth and safe flight. We'll get these tests done quickly, and then we can discuss the necessary medications for your trip. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Inspect… the plane. Yes. I understand that. You check everything. But… the pills. She always had the pills. For everything. Malaria, diarrhea… everything. What pills do I need for Cancun? For the mosquitoes? For the… the stomach problems? I don't want to get sick. I promised her. Can we just… focus on the pills first? Then maybe… the tests? I don’t like tests. They make me nervous. I build planes, I don’t… I don’t do tests.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. We can focus on the pills for now. For Cancun, you'll likely need medication for malaria prevention, something to help with traveler’s diarrhea, and potentially some antibiotics in case you develop an infection. Let's start with malaria. There are a few different options, and we'll discuss the best one for you based on your health and the specific areas you'll be visiting. However, before I prescribe anything, I need to ask you a few more questions about your medical history to ensure these medications are safe for you. Have you ever had any problems with your liver or kidneys?
PATIENT: Liver? Kidneys? Um… no. Not that I remember. She always asked me that. Before giving me anything. But I don’t think I’ve ever had problems with my… liver. Or kidneys. I drink coffee. Lots of coffee. Is that bad for the liver? I lift heavy things. Is that bad for the kidneys? I just… build planes. I don’t know anything about livers or kidneys. I just want to go to Cancun. For her. Are the pills safe? Will they make me sick?
DOCTOR: Coffee is fine in moderation, Odell. And lifting heavy things doesn't typically cause problems with your kidneys unless you're not properly hydrated. It’s good that you're aware of your health. Now, have you ever had any allergic reactions to medications?
PATIENT: No… not that I remember. She always asked me that. Before giving me anything. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I eat everything. She liked to try new foods… I just ate whatever she gave me. No problems. Never had a reaction. I think. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes? But that was probably just the sun. Is the sun an allergy? I just want the pills. For Cancun. For her. Are they… small pills? I don’t like big pills. They get stuck in my throat.
DOCTOR: The sun isn't an allergy, Odell. We're just trying to make sure you’re safe. The pills are relatively small, and we can discuss different formulations if you're concerned about swallowing them. Before I prescribe anything, I really need to understand your overall health. Let's go back to the basics. How about this: can you tell me approximately how much coffee you drink each day?
PATIENT: Lots. A big mug. Several times. In the morning. And… sometimes in the afternoon. To stay awake. For the planes. It helps me focus. She made it strong. Very strong. Is that bad? Is the coffee why you're asking so many questions? I just want to go to Cancun. For her. She would have already given me the pills. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, several strong mugs of coffee. That's helpful. Now, just one more question before we discuss the medications. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Never. She didn't like it. It's bad for your lungs. She always said that. I build planes. I need good lungs. Strong lungs. I don't smoke. Never have. Just coffee. And… building planes. Are we almost done? I want to go to Cancun. For her. She… she would have already had everything ready. The pills. The everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. You don't smoke, you drink several strong mugs of coffee a day, and you build planes. I appreciate you sharing that with me. Look, I understand you're anxious to get to Cancun for your wife. And I want to help you make that happen. But before I prescribe any medications, I need to do a quick check of your weight and blood pressure again. It's just a standard procedure, and it will help me ensure these medications are safe for you. And then, we can discuss the best options for travel to Cancun. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Check my weight. Check my blood pressure. Just… hurry. I want to go to Cancun. For her. She… she would have already known what to do. She always did. Just… please hurry. I just want the pills. And… to go home. To go to Cancun. For her.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Your blood pressure is a little higher than it was earlier, and your weight is still a concern. I'm going to be honest with you. Based on these readings, and everything you've told me, I'm hesitant to prescribe any medications right now without doing some further testing. I'm concerned about your overall health and want to make sure you're strong enough to handle a trip to Cancun. It’s not about denying you the trip, it’s about making sure you’re safe. I understand you’re anxious, but we need to address this first. Would you be willing to consider a simple blood test and a chest x-ray?
PATIENT: No! No tests! She always said… she always knew what to do. I don’t like tests! They make me nervous! I just want to go to Cancun. For her. Please… just give me the pills. I’ll be careful. I promise. I’ll be careful. Don’t make me do tests. Please. I just want to go home. To go to Cancun. For her. She’s waiting for me. She’s… she’s waiting. I just want to be with her.
DOCTOR: Odell, please, take a deep breath. It’s okay. I’m not trying to upset you. I understand you’re anxious, and I want to help. But I can’t just give you medication without knowing what’s going on. It’s not safe. Look, how about this: we don’t have to do all the tests right now. Let’s start with a simple blood test. Just to check your basic health. That’s it. No x-rays. No big tests. Just a simple blood test. We can do that quickly, and then I can give you the medication you need to travel to Cancun. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Just… just the blood test? No x-rays? You promise? She… she always said I was strong. But I feel… weak. What will the blood test show? Will it show I'm… sick? I just want to go to Cancun. For her. Please… just tell me it won't be long. And that it won't show anything bad. Please. I just want to be with her. She’s waiting. I promised her.
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell. Just a simple blood test. No x-rays. We'll get it done quickly, and it will give me a better understanding of your overall health. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. It’s just a precaution. And it won't take long. We can do it right here in the office. It will only take a few minutes. Look, I'm going to be honest with you. I'm concerned about your weight and your blood pressure, but I'm also concerned about your anxiety. If the blood test shows something is wrong, we can address it together. But if everything looks normal, I can give you the medication you need to travel to Cancun and help you feel confident and prepared for your trip. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, a blood test. Just a blood test. No x-rays. You promise? And then… then you’ll give me the pills? For Cancun? For her? Please… just get it over with. I just want to be with her. I promised her. Get it over with. Hurry. Please. I just want to go home. To go to Cancun. For her. She’s waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. Let's get this done quickly. I'll need to clean your arm first, and then we'll just take a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes, and then we can get you set up with the medication you need for your trip. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I understand you're anxious, and I want to make this as easy as possible for you. Just relax, take a deep breath, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We're almost there, Odell. We're almost there.
PATIENT: Just… hurry. Please. Don’t make it hurt. I just want to be with her. She’s waiting. Hurry. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell, almost done. Just a little prick… and then it's over. I know it's not pleasant, but you're doing great. Alright, all done. See?
PATIENT: Is it… is it over now? Will it hurt for long? I just want to be with her.
DOCTOR: Yes, Odell, it's over now. It will only hurt for a few minutes. Just keep pressure on the bandage, and it will stop bleeding shortly. You did great. Really. Now, we need to send this sample to the lab, and it will take a few hours for the results to come back. In the meantime, let’s talk about the medication you'll need for your trip. We'll start with malaria prevention…
PATIENT: Wait… a few hours? I need to go. I promised her. She's waiting. I can't wait a few hours. I need to go. Now. I need to go to Cancun. For her. Please… just give me the pills. I’ll be careful. I promise. Please.
DOCTOR: Odell, please, sit down. I understand you’re anxious to get to Cancun, but I can’t just give you medication without knowing what’s going on. It’s not safe. We’re almost done here. The lab results won’t take long, and in the meantime, we can discuss everything you need to have a safe and enjoyable trip. We can go over the potential side effects of the medication, and I can give you some tips on how to prevent traveler’s diarrhea. Look, I’m a doctor. I’m here to help you. I want to make sure you’re safe and healthy. But I can’t do that without gathering some information first. Please, just sit down and let me help you. We’re almost there, Odell. We’re almost there.
PATIENT: No! No, I can’t wait! She… she’s waiting for me! I promised her! I need to go now! I don’t care about side effects! I don’t care about traveler’s diarrhea! I just need to be with her! Please… just give me the pills! I’ll sign anything! I’ll do anything! Just let me go to Cancun! For her! Please! Please! Please! She’s waiting!
DOCTOR: Odell, please, sit down. You’re upsetting yourself, and I don’t want that. Look, I understand you’re anxious to get to Cancun, but I can’t just hand out medication without knowing if it’s safe for you. That could be dangerous. I’m going to call the nurse to come in and help me calm you down. We can talk about this together, and we’ll figure out a solution. We’re not going to leave you here alone. We’re going to help you get to Cancun safely. Just sit down, Odell. Please. It’s okay. We’re here to help you. Nurse, could you come to exam room three, please?
PATIENT: No! No nurse! No more tests! No more waiting! Just… just give me the pills! I don’t need a nurse! I don’t need tests! I just need to go to Cancun! For her! She’s waiting! Please… please… just let me go! Please! She’s waiting! Please! Just let me go home! To her!
DOCTOR: Odell, please look at me. It's okay. You're safe. I’m not going to hurt you. I understand you're upset, and I'm here to help. I’m not going to give you any more tests right now. We can forget about the tests. Just breathe, Odell. Take deep breaths. I can see you’re very anxious about getting to your wife. Let's focus on that. I’m going to call your emergency contact. Is there anyone I can call for you?
PATIENT: No! No one! She’s the only one! Just… just let me go! Please! I need to go to her! I promised her! Please… just let me go home! To her! Please! Just let me go! She’s waiting!
DOCTOR: 911, what’s your emergency?
