DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my back… it’s been botherin’ me. Lower back, mostly. Hurts to stand for long, and bendin’ over… forget about it! It’s been goin’ on for a bit now, nothin’ sudden, just… slow and steady worsen’.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual onset of lower back pain, worsening over time. That's helpful to know. Could you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like a… a cut or somethin’. More like a dull ache, you know? And sometimes it feels… stiff. Like when I get outta bed in the mornin’, I gotta move slow. It's better when I'm sittin', usually. Not always, but mostly. Does that make sense? I ain't good with explainin' these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Vankampen. A dull ache with stiffness, relieved somewhat by sitting. That helps me build a picture. And you mentioned it's been going on for “a bit now”. Could you estimate roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six months ago? Somethin’ like that. I didn’t pay it much mind at first, just thought I was gettin’ old. But it’s definitely not gettin’ better. I'd say, six months, maybe a little longer. It’s hard to remember exactly. It wasn’t like one day it started, just… slowly got worse.
DOCTOR: Six months of a gradually worsening lower back pain. Thank you for clarifying. Now, has anything specific brought on the pain or made it worse?
PATIENT: Well… liftin’ things, for sure. My grandkids, they’re lovely, but they like to be carried! And bendin’ over to tie my shoes… that’s a no-go sometimes. And long walks, too. I used to enjoy a good walk, but now… not so much. Not without a lot of achin’ afterwards. It's not like one thing always does it, but those things make it worse, for sure.
DOCTOR: So lifting, bending, and prolonged walking seem to exacerbate the pain. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about other areas of your body. Have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Not like a shootin’ pain, or nothin’. Sometimes my legs feel a little… heavy, you know? Like tired. But no pain goin’ down them. No numbness, either. Just kinda… heavy. And sometimes a little achy, but not like the back. Does that make sense? I’m tryin’ to remember… I had a little twinge in my right leg once, but it went away quick.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Mr. Vankampen. Leg fatigue, occasional mild aching, but no radiating pain or numbness. And just a brief twinge in the right leg, which has resolved. I appreciate you detailing that. Now, have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. I can walk, I can climb stairs… not as fast as I used to, maybe. But I haven’t tripped or nothin’. I just get tired easier, I guess. It's hard to explain. I can still do most things, just… slower. And I gotta sit down more often. I haven’t noticed any droppin’ things or not bein’ able to lift my feet when I walk.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no noticeable weakness, just increased fatigue. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: Oh… well, that’s a personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… no, not really. Everything’s been… regular, you could say. No trouble goin’ to the bathroom, no changes in… well, you know. Sorry to be so blunt. I ain’t used to talkin’ about these things with doctors.
DOCTOR: You have no need to apologize, Mr. Vankampen. These questions are important for a complete picture, and I understand they can be personal. I appreciate your honesty. "Regular" bowel and bladder function is good to hear. Now, I’d like to ask about any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss you may have experienced recently.
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And I think I've actually gained a little weight, if anything! My daughter keeps tellin’ me I need to watch what I eat. But no, no weight loss. Definitely not. I eat pretty good, mostly. Not much changed there.
DOCTOR: No fever, chills, or weight loss. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back that I have… osteoporosis. That’s what she called it. Weak bones, she said. Something about not gettin’ enough calcium when I was younger. She gave me some pills for a while, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. They upset my stomach. And… I had high blood pressure for a bit, but that's under control now, I think. My regular doctor checks it every year. That’s about it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, osteoporosis and previously diagnosed, now controlled, hypertension. Thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… oh, goodness, must be sixty years ago! And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist a few years back. Fell down the stairs. Nothing major, but they had to set it. That’s about it, I think. No other surgeries or hospital stays.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a wrist fracture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis in my hands. It’s a cream, mostly. And sometimes I take a pain reliever for my back, but just when it’s really bad. Just ibuprofen, the regular kind. Not every day, just when I need it. Oh, and I take a vitamin D supplement, because of the osteoporosis. The doctor said it helps with the bones. That’s about it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed, topical cream for arthritis, and vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or other substances?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I can eat peanuts, I can eat shellfish… no problems there. I've never had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction, or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father had heart trouble, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. And my mother… she had arthritis, like me. Bad arthritis in her hands. And I think my sister had some kind of cancer, but it was a long time ago. She lived in Lebanon, so I didn’t see her much. That’s about all I know, really. We didn’t talk about these things much when I was younger.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Vankampen. That’s helpful. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I'm retired now, so I don't do much workin'. I live alone, my wife passed away a few years back. I enjoy spendin' time with my grandkids, when I can. I used to garden a lot, but it's hard on my back now. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to stay active, but it's hard with the pain.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Vankampen. That gives me a much better understanding of your situation. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if possible. We’ll start by checking your back and assessing your range of motion. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I'm used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’. Just be gentle, if you would. My back’s a little sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back for me. I’m going to start by palpating your spine to assess for any tenderness or muscle spasms. I'm starting with your lower back now. Can you tell me if any of this feels particularly tender or painful?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… right there. That’s where it hurts the most. When you press there. Not all the time, but when you push… yeah, that's it. And a little bit to the left too, but not as bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness at L4-L5, more pronounced on the right side. I’m also checking for any muscle spasms. I do notice some mild tightness in the muscles on both sides of your spine, but no significant spasm. Now, I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, reaching towards your toes. Just go as far as you comfortably can. Let me know if you experience any pain with this movement.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… difficult. It hurts in my lower back when I do that. Not sharp pain, but a dull ache. And I can’t go very far. I used to be able to touch my toes, but not anymore. It's stiff, you know? Just… stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited forward flexion with a report of dull ache. And you noted stiffness. Now, let’s try bending backward. Again, just go as far as you comfortably can, and let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a little better. Not as painful as bending forward, but still a little uncomfortable. And I feel a little pinch in my lower back when I do that. Not a sharp pinch, just… a pinch. And I can't go very far back either. It feels like somethin’s blockin’ me.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited backward flexion with a mild pinch. Now, let's try bending to each side. First, let’s bend towards your right.
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not too bad. I can go a little further that way than the other way, I think. Still feels a little stiff, but not much pain. Just a stretch, really. It's hard to explain. It's just… easier to bend to the right than the left.
DOCTOR: Okay, greater range of motion on the right. Now, let’s try bending to your left.
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… tighter. I can't go very far that way. It feels… stuck. And there's a little pain there. Not sharp, but a dull ache. It's like somethin’s holdin’ me back. Yes, that’s definitely tighter and more painful on the left side.
DOCTOR: Okay, significantly limited range of motion and pain on the left side. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your reflexes and sensation in your legs and feet. This will help me rule out any nerve involvement. Your reflexes are normal bilaterally, and your sensation is intact in both feet. Alright, Mr. Vankampen. That completes the physical exam. Based on my findings, you have limited range of motion in your lower back, with tenderness at the L4-L5 level, and more significant restriction and pain on the left side. Your neurological exam is normal, which is reassuring. This suggests a musculoskeletal issue, likely a strain or sprain, possibly with some facet joint irritation. It's not likely a serious nerve problem, but further imaging may be needed to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh… well, that sounds… complicated. A strain or sprain… is that bad? And what's a facet joint? Does that mean I need… surgery? And what about the osteoporosis? Does that have somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: It sounds more complicated than it is, Mr. Vankampen. A strain or sprain simply means you’ve stretched or torn the ligaments or muscles in your back. It’s a common injury, especially as we get older. A facet joint is a small joint in your spine that helps with movement and stability. Sometimes these joints can become irritated or inflamed, causing pain. And no, it doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. In fact, most back strains and sprains can be treated conservatively with physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. Surgery is usually reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to conservative treatment. And yes, your osteoporosis could be a contributing factor. It weakens your bones, making them more susceptible to fractures, and can contribute to back pain. However, we can address that as well. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I recommend getting an X-ray of your lower back. This will help us rule out any fractures and assess the alignment of your spine. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… hmm. I don’t know… I don’t like bein’ exposed to all that radiation. Is it really necessary? And what if it does show a fracture? Then I definitely need surgery, right? I just want somethin’ to make the pain go away. And I don’t want to end up bedridden. Is there anything else we can try first? Maybe some stronger pain pills? Or a different kind of therapy?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the radiation, Mr. Vankampen. The amount of radiation from a single X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis usually outweigh the risks. It helps us to be sure of what we are dealing with and to tailor the treatment appropriately. And no, a fracture doesn’t automatically mean you need surgery. Many fractures can be treated with bracing, pain medication, and physical therapy. Before we proceed with the X-ray, we could try a few other things. We can start with a course of stronger anti-inflammatory medication, such as naproxen, to help reduce the pain and inflammation. We can also explore physical therapy, which can help strengthen your back muscles, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper body mechanics. I can write you a prescription for the medication and provide a referral to a reputable physical therapist in the area. However, if your pain doesn’t improve with these measures, or if it gets worse, we may need to consider getting the X-ray to get a more definitive diagnosis. Would you like to try the medication and physical therapy first?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds better. I don’t want to rush into anything. Medication and therapy first, that sounds good. And a good physical therapist, someone gentle. I don't want anyone makin' the pain worse. And how long will it take for the medication to work? And what if it doesn’t work at all? What kind of side effects should I be lookin’ out for? I just want to be able to walk my grandkids again without feelin’ like I’m gonna break in two.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Vankampen. We’ll start with a course of naproxen, which is an anti-inflammatory medication that can help reduce the pain and inflammation in your back. It usually takes a few days to a week to start feeling the full effects of the medication. I’ll write you a prescription for 500mg twice daily for two weeks. As for side effects, the most common side effects of naproxen are stomach upset, heartburn, and nausea. It’s important to take the medication with food to minimize these side effects. More serious side effects are rare, but can include stomach ulcers, bleeding, and heart problems. If you experience any of these symptoms, you should stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a highly recommended physical therapist, Mrs. Eleanor Vance, who specializes in gentle, therapeutic exercises. She is known for her compassionate approach and her ability to tailor treatment to individual needs. We’ll monitor your progress closely. If your pain doesn't improve within a few weeks, or if it gets worse, we’ll reassess the situation and consider further testing, such as the X-ray. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this moment, Mr. Vankampen?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And thank you for listenin’ to my concerns. I’ll try the medication and see the physical therapist. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything goes wrong. I appreciate your help, Doctor Bakan. I really do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s the prescription for the naproxen and the referral to Mrs. Vance. I wish you all the best, Mr. Vankampen. And I hope you feel better soon.
