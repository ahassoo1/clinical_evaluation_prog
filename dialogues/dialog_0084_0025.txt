DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I want to know more about… where I come from, you know? My family, long time ago. I hear you can do a test… with spit, maybe? To see what people I’m related to, way back?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing – learning more about your family history through DNA. Yes, we can arrange that. It's becoming more common, and can be quite interesting. Before we go ahead and order anything, though, let’s talk a little bit about why you’re wanting to do this now, and what you hope to learn. It's good to have realistic expectations. Also, it's important to understand what the tests can and cannot tell you. We want to make sure this is right for you. First, just generally, have you ever had any genetic testing done before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is… new for me. I just… I’m Marshallese, you know? And things… things change. Lots of people come and go. I want to know where my family really come from. Before all the changes. Before… everything. I don’t need to know everything, just… a little bit more. Is that okay? I don't understand… what it can't tell me, though. That's what worries me.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay, Mr. Scobie. It's very understandable to want to connect with your roots, especially with changes happening over time. It's good you’re thinking about what you want to get out of it. Okay, so these tests look at your DNA – the information passed down from your parents, and their parents, and so on. They can give you an estimate of your ethnic origins – what parts of the world your ancestors likely came from. For Marshallese people, this can be a bit complex, because there's been a lot of mixing over generations, and different islands have their own unique histories. What the tests can't do is tell you specific names or relationships. They won't say "this person was your great-grandfather." They provide probabilities, estimates, and broad ancestral groups. Also, the results aren’t always 100% accurate, and can change as the databases get bigger. It's a good starting point for research, but not a definitive answer. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… so no names. Just… places? Like, maybe it will say "some family from… Samoa?" Not who from Samoa? That's okay, I guess. I don’t really expect names. Just… a feeling, maybe? Knowing something more. The databases… are those like… lists of people? And they get bigger, so it gets better? I don’t know much about computers… sorry. I just want to know if it’s worth the money, you know? It costs money, and I don't have much.
DOCTOR: You're not silly for asking, Mr. Scobie. It's good to be cautious. And you’re right to think about the cost. Yes, the databases are essentially very large collections of DNA information from people all over the world who have submitted their samples. As more people participate, the databases become more comprehensive, and the results become more refined. Think of it like a family tree that keeps growing – the more branches you add, the more complete the picture becomes. As for whether it’s “worth it,” that really depends on what you’re hoping to get out of it. If you're looking for concrete family history information like names and dates, this probably isn't the best option. But if you're interested in learning more about your broader ethnic origins and potentially connecting with distant relatives who have also submitted samples, it could be valuable. The cost for a typical ancestry DNA test is around \$99 to \$199. Medicare generally doesn't cover it, as it’s considered an elective test. Before we proceed with ordering anything, let's quickly go through some other things – just to be thorough. Do you have any known allergies, especially to latex or other materials used in sample collection?
PATIENT: No allergies. I'm pretty healthy, for an old man. Just… old. I eat good fish, mostly. And taro. Taro is good. But no allergies. And… what do I do with the spit? Do I mail it? I don’t have a computer… can I do it at the clinic? Or do I have to send it away? I’m a bit worried about sending things in the mail… sometimes things get lost.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear about your health, Mr. Scobie! Taro is good. Okay, so you don’t need to worry about mailing anything. We can actually do the sample collection here at the clinic. It’s a very simple process – you just provide a saliva sample in a small tube. We send the sample to the lab for analysis, and the results will be sent to me electronically. I’ll then go over them with you in detail. You don’t need a computer at all. There are a couple of different companies we can use. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are the most popular. They both offer similar services, and the cost is roughly the same. 23andMe also offers some health reports along with ancestry information, but those aren't necessarily the focus here. Do you have any preference between those two companies, or would you like me to recommend one?
PATIENT: Hmm… no preference. I don’t know anything about them. If you have a suggestion… that would be good. I trust you, Doctor. You seem to know what you’re doing. As long as it doesn't cost too much… and you can explain it to me… that's good enough. And… it's okay if it takes a little while? I don’t rush things.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Mr. Scobie. I recommend AncestryDNA. They have a particularly large database, which can be helpful for Marshallese ancestry. They also have good customer support if you have any questions. The cost for AncestryDNA is \$99, plus a small fee for shipping the sample to the lab, around \$10. It does take a little while – usually about 6-8 weeks to get the results back. I'll explain everything to you step-by-step when we get them. Before we go ahead and order the test, just one more thing – are you comfortable with the possibility that the results might reveal information about your family history that you weren't expecting?
PATIENT: Hmm… unexpected information? Like what? If it's bad news… I don't know. I'm an old man. I've seen things. But… if it's something that will upset my family… maybe not. I don't want to cause trouble. Mostly, I just want to know where I come from, not… secrets. Is that silly? I guess I'm worried about opening a can of worms.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Scobie, that’s not silly at all. It’s very wise to think about that. The “unexpected information” could be anything – for example, discovering ancestors from a different region than you expected, or learning about previously unknown family connections. In rare cases, the results could also reveal information about potential health risks, although this isn’t the primary purpose of an ancestry test. It’s important to understand that these tests don’t provide absolute answers, and there’s always a degree of uncertainty. And you are right to be concerned about the potential impact on your family. To be clear, we won’t be looking for any specific health information with this test. We’re focusing solely on your ancestral origins. If you're comfortable with those limitations, we can proceed. But if you have any hesitation, we can definitely hold off for now. It's important to make a decision you’re comfortable with. Would you like me to print out some more information about AncestryDNA for you to read over before you decide?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Print the information. I like to read things… slowly. And think about it. I don't want to rush. Maybe I'll show it to my niece, too. She's good with things like this. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient. I appreciate it. It's good to have someone explain things… so I can understand.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. I'm happy to help. That’s what I’m here for. It's always best to take your time and make a well-informed decision. Here you go. It has information about what the test includes, how it works, and some of the potential limitations. And definitely feel free to show it to your niece – a second opinion is always a good idea. Take as long as you need to read it over. When you're ready, just let me know, and we can decide whether to proceed. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very kind. I'll read this over… and talk to my niece. Maybe we'll see you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And I look forward to seeing you again, whenever you're ready. Have a good day, and please take care. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
