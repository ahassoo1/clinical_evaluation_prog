DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’m kind of yellow. Not a good yellow, if you know what I mean. And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I had some last week and it was pretty bad, and then it happened again just a couple of days ago.
DOCTOR: Tired and… yellow, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, tired, like… really drained. And my skin and the whites of my eyes are getting yellow. It’s not something I’ve ever experienced before. It's quite alarming, to be honest. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a… relative term, Ms. Haggar. And the fact that it correlates with fava bean consumption is… noteworthy. Do you experience any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting with this… discoloration?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no pain or vomiting. Just… really tired and yellow. A little bit nauseous sometimes, but I think that’s more from worrying about everything, if you know what I mean? It's just… unsettling to look in the mirror, to be honest. And I don’t know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And has this happened with other foods, or specifically just fava beans?
PATIENT: No, just fava beans. I eat pretty much everything else without any problems. I had beans – kidney beans, black beans – last week, and I was fine. It's definitely just the fava beans. My grandmother used to make a stew with them, and I always loved it, but I haven’t had it in years until recently. I guess… maybe something changed?
DOCTOR: It sounds… suggestive. We’ll need to investigate further, of course. Let's go through your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, Ms. Haggar?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox when I was a child, like everyone else, and I had my tonsils out when I was younger, but that’s about it. Nothing major, I don’t think. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I don't take any medications regularly either. Just… over-the-counter pain relievers when I have a headache. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. My family always said I had a pretty strong stomach. Though, maybe not so much with these fava beans! But seriously, no allergies.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some heart trouble when she was older, but that was years ago. My father was healthy as a horse until he passed away. And I don't really know much about my grandparents' health, to be honest. They lived in Romania, and we didn't see them very often. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s not something we really talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, let’s move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all! I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol - maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’ve never been interested in any of that. I'm a fairly simple person, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s perform a quick physical examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll need to examine your abdomen and check your skin tone. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Here we go...
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are… regular, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No hepatosplenomegaly appreciated. As expected, there is noticeable jaundice present in the sclera and skin. It’s mild, but definitely present. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72. Respiration is normal. Your vitals are within normal limits, Ms. Haggar.
PATIENT: Okay. That doesn't sound too bad, does it? Is that… good news? What does all that mean? I’m starting to get a little worried now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Good news” is… premature, Ms. Haggar. The findings are… suggestive of a possible enzymatic deficiency, specifically a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, often associated with… fava bean ingestion. It’s not uncommon in individuals of Mediterranean descent, though… it requires laboratory confirmation. We need to order a complete blood count and a G6PD enzyme assay. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… complicated. Is that serious? And what does that even mean exactly? I’m sorry, Doctor, I don’t really understand all of that medical language. Is it something I should be very worried about? I just want to know what’s going on, and what I need to do. And… does this mean I can’t eat fava beans anymore?
DOCTOR: Ms. Haggar, it means your body has difficulty processing certain substances, triggering a reaction when exposed to specific triggers, in this case, fava beans. The lab tests will confirm the diagnosis. If confirmed, it means avoiding fava beans, and certain other substances. It’s… manageable, but requires diligence. It's not an emergency, but it needs to be addressed. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. We'll proceed from there. Do you have any other questions, or shall we simply move forward with the testing?
PATIENT: Okay… avoiding fava beans. I can do that, I guess. It’s just… I always enjoyed them. And what other substances? Are we talking a lot of things? I just want to be prepared. And is this something my children need to be tested for too? They both have a Mediterranean heritage as well. I feel so helpless, not knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: A limited number of substances, Ms. Haggar. Certain medications, specific dyes. We’ll discuss the full list if the tests confirm the diagnosis. As for your children, yes, they should be tested if they also have a history of fava bean consumption. It’s a simple blood test. The nurse will provide you with the necessary information and requisition forms. I suggest you schedule appointments for them as soon as possible. Now, is there anything else before I conclude the examination?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing what we’re looking at, even if it’s not entirely good news. I’ll talk to my children and we'll get the tests done. And I'll definitely avoid the fava beans. Thank you again. I’ll wait for the nurse then.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you momentarily. Have a… satisfactory day, Ms. Haggar.
