DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Hembrey. I see you're here today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, I've noticed a lump… a mass, I suppose, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: A mass in the lower abdomen, you say. And how long exactly has it been there, Mr. Raghunathan?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. Probably… around three months, maybe a little longer. At first, I didn't think much of it, honestly. But it hasn’t gone away, and it doesn’t feel like it’s getting smaller.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. And has it been consistently the same size during that time, or have you noticed any changes—growth, discomfort, anything at all?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I think it has gotten a bit bigger. Not dramatically, but definitely noticeable if I’m really paying attention. And… there’s been some mild discomfort, a sort of dull ache, especially if I’m doing something active. Nothing severe, but it's there.
DOCTOR: Dull ache with activity, noted. And where precisely in your lower abdomen is this mass located?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's… kind of in the center, just below my belly button. A little to the left, perhaps. It’s hard to describe exactly. It’s not on the side, more… in the middle, lower down.
DOCTOR: Center, just below the umbilicus, slightly left of midline. Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this mass and discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No fever, no weight loss, no changes in my bowel habits… nothing like that. Just the lump and the occasional ache. I haven’t noticed anything else unusual, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No associated symptoms. Very well. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, to get a more complete picture, I'm going to need to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about five years ago, and I take medication for it. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual colds and flu, nothing serious. My wife keeps me well-fed, so I’m generally quite healthy!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And what medication are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it's Lisinopril, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for a few years now and it seems to be keeping things stable. I get it refilled regularly with my primary care doctor.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. Never had any surgeries, thankfully. No hospital stays either. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible, to be honest, but this… this felt like something I needed to get checked out.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful to know. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My father had diabetes, and my mother had some heart problems later in life. I don’t know much beyond that, to be honest. My family isn’t very open about health issues, and I wasn’t particularly close to many relatives. I have a sister, but I haven’t seen her in years. I wish I knew more, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: I see. Limited family history. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. My wife likes to try new recipes, and I’m always willing to be a guinea pig. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, Mr. Raghunathan, before we proceed with a physical examination, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don’t smoke, haven’t ever smoked. I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a choreographer, Doctor, I need a clear head for my work!
DOCTOR: A choreographer. Interesting. And how physically demanding is your work?
PATIENT: Quite. It’s… demanding, actually. Long hours on my feet, a lot of lifting and demonstrating movements, working with dancers… it keeps me very active, but it also puts a strain on my body. That’s probably why I’m a bit achy sometimes, not just from this mass.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. Now, I’m going to perform a physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen to assess the mass more thoroughly. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the examination.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds sensible. I will let you know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m going to start now. Please relax as much as possible. Hmm. I do feel a distinct mass approximately three centimeters in diameter, located slightly left of the midline, as you described. It is firm, but not particularly hard. It’s somewhat mobile, which is a positive sign. There is mild tenderness to palpation, but no rebound tenderness. No guarding or rigidity noted. Lymph nodes are not palpable in the inguinal region. Alright. I’ve completed the abdominal exam. Now, I recommend some imaging to further investigate this mass. A CT scan would be the most appropriate next step. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. A CT scan. Yes, I believe so. If that’s what you recommend, then I trust your judgment. What exactly would a CT scan show? And… is it painful? I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: A CT scan will provide a detailed cross-sectional image of your abdomen, allowing us to determine the size, shape, and location of the mass with greater precision. It will also help us identify if it’s solid or fluid-filled, and whether it’s affecting any surrounding organs. As for pain… it’s generally painless, Mr. Raghunthan. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You may be asked to hold your breath for a short period of time. There is exposure to a small amount of radiation, but it’s within acceptable limits. It's a standard diagnostic procedure. The radiologist will interpret the images and provide a report. Based on those findings, we can determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I will write a referral for the CT scan. Do you have any preferences for where you would like to have it performed?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That… that makes me feel a little better, knowing it’s not usually painful. And no, I don’t have a preference. Anywhere convenient, really. Perhaps close to my home? I live in the city center, near the art district. If there’s a facility nearby, that would be ideal. And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m a little anxious about waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will refer you to City Imaging, they have a convenient location in the art district, as you requested. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to be reported. Once I receive the report, my office will contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand these instructions, Mr. Raghunthan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. City Imaging, 24 to 48 hours for results, and contact my office to schedule a follow-up. And… seek immediate attention for severe pain, fever, etc. I’ve made a mental note. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have a plan of action. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Forms to fill out, perhaps? Or payment arrangements?
DOCTOR: Yes, my assistant will provide you with the necessary paperwork regarding the CT scan referral and insurance pre-authorization. There is a co-pay of $150 due at the time of the scan. And please, if any new symptoms develop before your follow-up appointment, do not hesitate to contact the office. I believe that covers everything for today. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Raghunthan. We will be in touch soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time and attention. I will see what my wife thinks about the scan and get it scheduled as soon as possible. Have a good day to you as well. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Goodbye, Mr. Raghunthan.
