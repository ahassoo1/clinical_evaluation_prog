DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hey, good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Uh, well, it's kinda just a check-up, I guess. Not really sick or anything. Just wanted to see what’s up, you know? Never really been to a doctor just to see, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Preventative care is a good idea. So, no specific complaints or symptoms bringing you in today?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing like that. Feel alright, mostly. Work's work, you know? Long hours on the boats, but I'm used to it. Just thought I should get checked out, being divorced and all… gotta make sure I'm okay for myself, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s very sensible. We’ll do a thorough check-up then. Just to get a baseline, and make sure everything is functioning as it should. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. Never been told anything like that. I had the usual kid stuff, you know, colds and stuff. Broke my arm once when I was little, climbing a tree. But never anything a doctor said I had to keep up with. Does Medicare keep records of stuff like that? I don't really remember everything.
DOCTOR: Medicare does keep records, yes. We can access those, but it’s always helpful to get your recollection first. Okay, so no chronic conditions diagnosed as an adult. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the arm, when I was a kid. They put a cast on it, and it healed up fine. Nothing since then. Never needed anything else taken out or put in, if that makes sense. Pretty lucky, I think. Mostly just bumps and bruises from workin' on the boats.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Uh, family… my mom, she's okay, still livin'. She's got a little bit of trouble with her knees, but she mostly just takes it easy. And my dad… he passed away a few years back. He worked on the docks his whole life. He was pretty strong, but… he had some problems with his lungs towards the end. I don’t know what kind of problems, exactly. Just… coughin' a lot, mostly. Never really talked about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Lung issues in your father, and knee trouble with your mother. That’s helpful to know. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work a lot. Like, a lot. Mostly on the water, movin' stuff around. Not much time for hobbies, to be honest. I don’t really drink much, maybe a beer now and then with the guys after work. And I don’t smoke. Never liked it. Eat pretty regular, whatever the cook makes on the boat usually. It’s not fancy, but it fills you up. I try to get some sleep when I can, but it’s kinda hard with the shifts.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much whatever. And I haven’t taken any medicine in… well, a long time. Maybe some pain relievers for headaches, but nothing serious. I try to avoid takin’ pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin' at all. Just water, mostly. Gotta stay hydrated when you're workin' in the sun all day, you know? I don't really believe in all that stuff, to be honest. If you eat right and get enough sleep, you should be okay. That's what my dad always said, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if anything feels weird or somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear, but I do hear some slight wheezing on exhale. Not significant, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath… Wheezing, huh? Maybe it's just the dust from the boats? We're always movin' stuff, and it gets pretty dirty sometimes. It doesn't bother me much, usually. Just a little tickle in my throat.
DOCTOR: Okay. Throat looks clear. No signs of infection. Ears are clear as well. Now, let’s check your pulse. Pulse is normal. Let me palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin'. Feels okay. Maybe a little bit there, but nothin' major. Just… a little sensitive sometimes. It's probably just somethin' I pulled workin'. Happens every now and then.
DOCTOR: Alright. A little tenderness in the left flank. We'll keep that in mind. I'd like to order some routine bloodwork – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest x-ray. Just to get a baseline and rule out anything concerning, given the slight wheezing and flank tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A chest x-ray and some bloodwork… okay. I trust your judgement. Where do I go for that? And how long does it usually take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll send the orders to the lab at City General Hospital – it’s just down the street. They should be able to get you in today, or tomorrow at the latest. As for the results, it usually takes about 24-48 hours for everything to come back. The lab will notify me once they’re available. I’ll give you a call to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, City General… got it. 24-48 hours… alright. Shortness of breath, chest pain, fever… yeah, I'll remember that. Um… actually, yeah. Just… with the wheezing, is it somethin' I should be worried about now? Like, should I slow down at work or somethin'? I kinda need the money, so…
DOCTOR: That's a fair question. The wheezing is mild at this point, and could be related to dust or irritation. I wouldn’t say you need to stop working completely, but I would recommend taking breaks when you can, and avoiding any strenuous activity if it makes the wheezing worse. If it gets significantly worse, or you develop a cough, please call the office immediately. We’ll have the x-ray results back soon, which will give us a clearer picture. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Take breaks, avoid strenuous activity, call if it gets worse… I can do that. I appreciate you tellin’ me that, Doctor. Makes me feel a little better. I didn’t want to worry my mom, so… Thanks again for checkin' me out. I guess I'll head over to City General now and get those tests done.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, you’re very welcome. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. And I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a good day, Mr. Heindel.
