DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Skarbek, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Sink, thank you for seeing me. It’s about… a friend of mine. He’s hoping to get his visa sorted out, you see. And I believe he needs some… shots? Vaccinations? To make that happen. I’m trying to help him figure out what all he needs to do.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you're not the patient, you're here on behalf of a friend. And he needs vaccinations for a visa. Honestly, I deal with actual medical issues. Not paperwork for immigration. But… alright. Do you have any documentation outlining which vaccinations are required?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I didn't mean to cause trouble, Doctor. No, I don't have any papers. He just mentioned needing them, and I thought… well, I thought a doctor would know what’s required for a visa. He's a bit overwhelmed with everything, you see. He’s not very good with… official things. Is there somewhere else I should be going? Perhaps a government office? I apologize for taking up your time.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Skarbek, with all due respect, visa requirements are not a medical matter. I’m a physician, not an immigration lawyer. I can tell you what standard vaccinations are advisable for an adult, but I have no idea what a specific visa application demands. Perhaps the consulate or embassy of the country he’s applying to would have that information. Honestly, I have patients with real health concerns waiting. Is there anything you are experiencing that requires medical attention, or is this solely about your friend's visa?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I understand. You’re right, of course. I just… I wanted to help. He’s a little lost, and I thought maybe you could point us in the right direction. No, I’m not here for anything for myself. Just trying to be a good friend. I apologize again for the confusion, Doctor. I’ll try to find out where he should go for the visa paperwork. Thank you for your time, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, don't waste my time, or your own, with things that aren't medical. Have a good day, Mr. Skarbek. And please, next time, be certain who your appointment is for.
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. I understand. Thank you, Doctor. Have a good day to you as well. .
