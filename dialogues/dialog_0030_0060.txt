DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it's…family history, mostly. My mother's side. A lot of…problems. I want to make sure I don’t end up the same way, you know? Preventative stuff, I guess. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very proactive of you to think about preventative care, especially with a concerning family history. That’s excellent. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about these “problems” on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: It’s…complicated. Lots of heart issues. And…well, mental instability. My aunt was…difficult. Spent a lot of time in institutions. My grandmother…dementia, I think. It wasn’t pretty. Honestly, they weren’t the brightest bunch. It’s probably genetic, to be frank. I’ve always been…more logical than they were, but you never know, do you? It’s just…a lot of bad genes. I'd like to get some tests done, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Theriot. It’s helpful to have a clear picture of your family’s medical background. We can certainly discuss testing options. To help me determine the most appropriate tests, could you tell me a bit about your own medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve always been relatively healthy. I exercise, I eat a sensible diet. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I broke my arm once, when I was, oh, ten? Skiing. Skiing is a bit dangerous, really. Beyond that… nothing much. I had a routine checkup last year, everything was fine. Blood pressure is always good. I don’t smoke, barely drink. I’m very… disciplined, you see. I take care of myself. What kind of tests are we even talking about? I don't want to waste my time on things that are irrelevant.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Theriot. It sounds like you are very conscientious about your health, which is fantastic. Given your family history and your desire for preventative care, I'd recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel – that checks your organ function – and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. We can also discuss genetic testing, although that's a more involved process. Would you be comfortable with those initial blood tests?
PATIENT: Genetic testing… that sounds expensive. And frankly, a bit…dramatic. I mean, I haven’t even got any symptoms. Is it really necessary? The other two… fine, I suppose. Organ function, cholesterol… that’s reasonable. But I’m not paying for a full DNA sequencing just because my aunt was…eccentric. Explain the cost, though. Be specific. I need to know exactly what I’m getting into. I’m an engineer, you know. I like details.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Theriot. And you are right to ask about costs. Genetic testing can be quite expensive, and it’s not always necessary. We wouldn’t proceed with it without a thorough discussion of the potential benefits and drawbacks. The comprehensive metabolic panel and lipid panel will each cost approximately $125, totaling $250. Medicare should cover a significant portion of that, likely leaving you with a copay of around $50-$75, depending on your specific plan. Genetic testing, specifically a panel focusing on cardiovascular and neurological predispositions, would be approximately $3,000. Medicare coverage for that is more limited, and would require pre-authorization. We can explore which specific genes to test if you are interested, to potentially lower the cost. For now, let’s focus on the initial blood work. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Three thousand dollars… pre-authorization… no. Absolutely not. The $250… fine. As long as it’s mostly covered. And you will double-check with Medicare before drawing any blood, I presume? I don’t want any surprises. What’s the procedure for getting the blood drawn? And how long does it take to get the results? I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. I can't just sit around waiting for lab reports.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I assure you we will verify your Medicare coverage with the lab before proceeding with any blood work. We wouldn't want any unexpected costs. As for the procedure, our phlebotomist, Ms. Ramirez, will draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It's a quick and relatively painless process, usually taking about 10-15 minutes. You’ll be seated comfortably, and she’ll explain everything step-by-step. The results typically take 5-7 business days to come back from the lab. Once they are available, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We can also arrange for you to access the results electronically through our patient portal. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright. That's…acceptable. Five to seven business days is…tolerable. And the patient portal… yes, that’s convenient. Make sure Ms. Ramirez is experienced. I don’t want any botched needle sticks. And please, double-check everything with Medicare. I’m a very busy man, and I don’t have time to deal with billing errors. Let's proceed, then. Get the blood drawn.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll personally ensure Ms. Ramirez is aware of your preferences and will double-check the Medicare coverage before proceeding. I'll also add a note to prioritize the billing verification. Please, follow me, and I’ll introduce you to Ms. Ramirez. She'll get you set up right away. It was a pleasure speaking with you, Mr. Theriot, and I look forward to discussing your results next week.
