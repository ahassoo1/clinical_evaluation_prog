DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this… feeling full really fast when I eat. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's a bit of a bother, to be honest. I don't seem to be able to eat a proper meal anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm, feeling full quickly… for a few weeks you say?
PATIENT: Yep, a few weeks now. Maybe six, seven weeks? It’s hard to say exactly, I don't keep close track. But it’s enough that my wife, Elsie, started noticing I wasn't finishing my plate. She always makes such good food, too.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this fullness accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Not really pain, no. Sometimes a bit of… well, not sick exactly, but kind of blah after eating. Not every time, though. Just a bit tired, maybe? And I haven't lost any weight, if that matters. Elsie keeps an eye on that sort of thing. She’d definitely say something if I was getting too thin.
DOCTOR: "Blah," alright. And when you say tired… is that just generally, or specifically after you eat?
PATIENT: Mostly after eating, Doctor. Not all day long, just… after a meal. Like I said, I don’t get a proper energy boost from it anymore. It's like my body just… stops wanting more, even if I know I haven't had enough. It's a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet generally, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Well, Elsie does most of the cooking, so it's usually pretty good, healthy stuff. Lots of fish, salmon mostly, we’re Haida, after all. Some rice, vegetables… not much for sweets, I don't have much of a sweet tooth. We try to eat traditional foods when we can, too. Nothing too fancy, just good, solid meals. I wouldn’t say I’ve changed anything about what I eat lately.
DOCTOR: And any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… no, not really. Everything goes down alright. It’s not like I’m choking or anything. It just… fills me up too fast. Like there's not much room, even if I’m not eating a huge portion. It's hard to explain. It's not a blockage, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? Oh. Well… not really. Everything’s pretty regular, if you want to know. Elsie always says a good routine is important. Sorry, that’s probably not what you wanted to hear.
DOCTOR: No, that's fine. I just need to cover all the bases. Now, have you had any previous medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I had a bit of a cough a few years back, but that cleared up on its own. And my knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just old age, I reckon. Nothing serious, never been in hospital or anything like that. Elsie might know better, she remembers everything. I’m not always the best at keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess. Elsie always says I’m too stubborn to lay still long enough for a proper operation.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hm. Family history… Well, my mother lived to be a good age, 85, I think. She had a bit of trouble with her heart in her later years, but that’s about it. My father… he didn’t live as long, unfortunately. He worked on the boats, tough life. I don’t really know much about his medical history, things weren’t talked about much back then. Elsie would probably know more, she’s good at remembering those sorts of things. We didn't have a lot of doctors visits in our family. Mostly just tried to tough things out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to stay healthy, get a bit of exercise when I can, eat good food. That’s always been my way. Elsie keeps telling me to take something for my knees, but I refuse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few moments.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Happy to get it checked out. Elsie always says it’s best to be safe. Let’s get on with it.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Mild fullness noted in the epigastric region, but no significant distension. No rebound tenderness.
PATIENT: So, what do you think, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m getting a bit worried now, to be honest. It's just this…full feeling, but it’s been bothering me. Elsie will be relieved to know you checked me over.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Obarr, based on the exam, it doesn't appear to be anything immediately life-threatening. However, the feeling of fullness after only a small amount of food, coupled with the mild fullness I detected in your upper abdomen, suggests we need to investigate further. It could be something as simple as decreased stomach capacity due to age, but it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. I also want to order an upper endoscopy to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. That will allow us to rule out any structural issues or inflammation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work, okay. I can handle that, I suppose. But an…endoscopy? What exactly does that involve? I've never had one of those before. Sounds a bit…invasive. Elsie won't be happy if I have to go through something unpleasant. Is it really necessary?
