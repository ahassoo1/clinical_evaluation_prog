DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Right, well, I asked for a test. An HIV test, specifically. Just want to get it checked, you know? Better safe than sorry, and all that. Though, honestly, I doubt it'll be anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. An HIV test. Okay. And just to clarify, is there a reason you're requesting the test specifically, or is this purely preventative, as you say?
PATIENT: Preventative, mostly. Though… well, my wife and I, we travel a bit. Not anything risky, mind you – mostly cultural tours, temples, that sort of thing. But you meet all sorts while travelling, don't you? And you can't be too careful with these things. It’s just… sensible. Honestly, some of the places we've been... you wouldn't believe the standards of hygiene. It's better to just know, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Sensible, yes. It is always best to be informed. Cultural tours... right. And how long have you and your wife been travelling together?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… about eight years now, I’d say. Started properly after we got married. Before that it was just weekend trips, mostly. But once we had a bit more time and money, we really started to explore. We were in Nepal, of course, for a long time – that’s where I’m from, originally. Then India, Thailand… bits and pieces all over Southeast Asia, really. It's a wonderful life, if you can afford it. Though, as I said, you do see things… things that make you appreciate a good disinfectant.
DOCTOR: And have you had any… instances during those travels, or at any other time, that would lead you to be concerned about potential exposure?
PATIENT: Concerned? Not exactly. Look, I'm a married man, very happily so. My wife and I are… devoted. Let's just say I’m not the sort to be… reckless. But as I mentioned, hygiene standards aren't always what you'd expect. Shared needles at a dodgy street dentist in Bangkok, questionable medical care in rural India… things like that. Small things, really. But these things linger in your mind, don’t they? It’s just… peace of mind, that’s all. I'm a Compliance Officer, you know. Risk assessment is my job. It’s practically professional curiosity.
DOCTOR: Right. Compliance Officer. I see. And have you ever had an HIV test before this?
PATIENT: No, never. Honestly, it wasn't something I ever considered needing. Back home, in Nepal, these things weren't openly discussed, you know? It was… a quiet issue. And even after we started travelling, it didn’t really cross my mind. It’s only recently, with… well, everything that’s been going on in the world, that it felt… prudent. Plus, my wife – she's quite insistent on these things. Always thinking ahead, that one. A good woman, but… sometimes a bit overcautious, if you ask me. But that’s marriage, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Given you’ve never been tested before, and considering your travel history, requesting the test is… reasonable. I'll need to ask a few standard questions regarding your medical history, allergies, and current medications before we proceed. Then we can do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, and I'll order the blood work. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Get it over with, get the results, and put my mind at ease. I appreciate the efficiency. Don't bother with a long physical, though. I'm in pretty good shape. All this travelling keeps me active, you know. Just the basics will do. No need to waste time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. A bit of the flu now and then, the occasional stomach bug from dodgy street food… nothing a bit of rest and a strong cup of tea couldn’t fix. Honestly, I’ve been quite lucky with my health. My wife is the one who’s always visiting doctors, always worrying about something or other. She’s convinced she’s allergic to everything. It’s exhausting, frankly. I'm mostly just here to tick a box, you know? For her peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, no chronic illnesses. And any surgical procedures?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was… oh, about twenty, I think. But that was a long time ago, and it was a very routine procedure. Local anesthetic, in and out in an hour. Nothing to write home about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy individual. You’re wasting your time asking about illnesses. I just want the HIV test, please. It's getting a bit tedious, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, with all due respect, a thorough medical history is not a waste of my time. It is standard procedure, and it allows me to provide you with the best possible care. Even if you consider yourself to be in excellent health, it is my professional obligation to ask these questions. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Look, I understand it’s procedure. But honestly, the implication that I’m somehow being… difficult? It's a bit much. I’m just trying to be efficient with our time. I've never been hospitalized. Not even for a broken bone. I’m a very careful man, as I've said. And frankly, the constant questioning feels… condescending. I requested a test, I’m here to get it done. Let’s just move things along, shall we? Is it possible to just skip the rest of this and get on with it? I have a rather busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand you are busy. However, I am obligated to ensure I have a complete understanding of your medical background before proceeding with any test. Skipping these questions is not an option. Now, let's proceed. Do you have any family history of chronic illness, particularly autoimmune diseases or cancers?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. My grandfather, on my mother’s side, had… something with his heart, I think. But he smoked like a chimney for sixty years, so it hardly counts. And my aunt, she had breast cancer a few years ago, but she was a smoker too. Honestly, the whole family has questionable habits. It's not exactly a genetic predisposition to good health, is it? Look, is this really necessary? I'm perfectly healthy. I can assure you. I eat well, I exercise, I’m a responsible adult. The test is a formality, that’s all. I’m wasting my time here. Can we please just get it over with? My wife will be furious if I'm gone much longer. She's already convinced I've caught some exotic disease.
DOCTOR: Family history of heart disease and cancer. And do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. I pride myself on not needing any. A bit of ginger tea for a sore throat now and then, but that’s hardly a medication. I believe in maintaining a natural lifestyle. All these pharmaceuticals… they just mask the symptoms, they don’t address the root cause. Honestly, Doctor, you’d be hard-pressed to find someone healthier. I even avoid sugar whenever possible. It’s quite a feat, let me tell you. Especially given my wife’s fondness for sweets. But I digress. No medications. None whatsoever. Can we please proceed now? This is becoming ridiculous. I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. No medications, no allergies, no chronic illnesses, family history of heart disease and cancer. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, I need to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? You're asking me about that now? Honestly, this is bordering on offensive. I've answered all your questions, I've provided a complete medical history, and now you're insinuating… what exactly? That I’m some sort of… degenerate? It's appalling! I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner – a very occasional glass, mind you. And I absolutely do not use recreational drugs! I am a Compliance Officer, for goodness sake! My entire career revolves around upholding standards of integrity! I find this line of questioning utterly inappropriate and frankly, insulting. I'm beginning to regret coming here. Can we please just get this test done? This is utterly preposterous. I think I deserve an apology.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, I understand your frustration. However, these questions are a standard part of a medical assessment, regardless of your profession or personal beliefs. They are essential for me to understand your overall health and potential risk factors. I apologize if my questions have offended you, but they are not intended to be judgmental. They are simply a necessary part of my job. Now, to clarify, when I asked about alcohol consumption, I was simply trying to ascertain your typical intake. Occasional wine with dinner is not necessarily a cause for concern, but it's important for me to have a complete picture. Now, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: That’s it. I’ve had enough. This is completely unacceptable. You are being incredibly condescending and intrusive. I came here for a simple HIV test, not a personal interrogation. I’ve answered your ridiculous questions, I’ve provided a complete medical history, and now you’re asking about my private life? This is beyond inappropriate. I demand to speak to your supervisor. I will be filing a formal complaint. Honestly, I’ve never encountered such unprofessional behavior in my life. I will not be answering any further questions. I am leaving. Good day.
DOCTOR: Patient refused to answer further questions and terminated consultation. Significant distress and defensiveness displayed. Recommend referral to a mental health professional for evaluation of anxiety and potential health-related paranoia. .
