DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, you know? A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I’ve been feeling rather…low energy, and not quite as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, “stuck” and “low energy.” I understand. And when did you start feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It wasn’t a sudden thing, more gradual. If I had to pinpoint… maybe six months ago? It started with just feeling tired more easily, and then…well, it’s just gotten a little worse since then. It's hard to say exactly when it started, truly.
DOCTOR: Right, six months, gradually worsening. And can you describe what you mean by “not as sharp?
PATIENT: Oh, well… things just take longer, you know? Remembering names, focusing on tasks… little things. I used to be able to juggle quite a lot, and now… I find myself writing things down constantly, just to keep track. It’s…frustrating. And honestly, a little worrying. I don’t want this to become the new normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with memory and concentration. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite during this six-month period?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sleep… it's not as restful as it used to be. I wake up several times during the night, and sometimes I have trouble falling asleep in the first place. And my appetite… it fluctuates. Some days I have no interest in eating, others I'm ravenous. It’s rather odd, really. Not a consistent thing, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, fluctuating appetite and disrupted sleep. Are you experiencing any other symptoms – perhaps any headaches, dizziness, changes in your weight, or mood swings?
PATIENT: Headaches occasionally, yes. Not severe, more like a dull ache at the back of my neck. And… I suppose my mood hasn’t been the best. I find myself feeling irritable more easily, and just…not as enthusiastic about things I used to enjoy. As for weight, I haven't really noticed a change, no. I haven't been weighing myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're getting a clearer picture. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for the past five years, at least. Aside from that…nothing major. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing chronic. I do take a daily vitamin, and I try to eat a healthy diet.
DOCTOR: Alright, well-controlled hypertension. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. I’ve been fortunate, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations. I try to stay on top of things, you know? I believe in preventative care. Though, clearly, something is going on now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No surgeries. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father… he had some heart problems, I believe. Nothing too specific, honestly. It was a while ago, and we didn’t really discuss medical details much. I know there was something with my grandmother on my mother’s side, but I couldn’t tell you what. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of diabetes and heart problems. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally – perhaps once or twice a week – but nothing excessive. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. I lead a fairly quiet life, all things considered. Mostly focused on my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lastly, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. I've never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. I'm pretty good with most things, I think. Though, I always make sure to tell my pharmacist about any new medications I’m taking, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No allergies. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your expertise. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is good, well-controlled as you said. Heart rate is 72 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Reflexes are normal. Balance is slightly off, but not significantly. I'm also going to take your temperature. Temperature is 98.6. No fever. I’m going to gently palpate your thyroid gland. Thyroid feels normal. Okay, Ms. Pitzel. Everything appears normal on the physical exam, but your slightly off balance warrants further investigation. Given your symptoms and the family history, I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. Blood work seems like a good next step. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Will you be explaining the results to me directly?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I will personally review the results with you once they come back, and we can discuss the best course of action. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back from the lab. I'll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you. In the meantime, are you experiencing any new or worsening symptoms?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing new. Just the same low energy, occasional headaches, and trouble concentrating. And the slightly off balance, of course, but that hasn’t gotten worse, just… remains. I will certainly let your nurse know immediately if anything changes before the follow-up. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Pitzel. Good. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as you can, and maintain a healthy diet. Avoid any strenuous activity. We will get to the bottom of this. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule that follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I really appreciate your time and attention. I’ll see you at the follow-up. Thank you again.
