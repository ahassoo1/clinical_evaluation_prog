DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Pitmon. Yeah, uh, tryouts. I'm trying out for a team. Need to get checked out, make sure I'm still… you know… able. Hopefully that's all this is. Don't have a lot of time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Tryouts. And how old are you, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Sixty-two. Yeah, I know, I know. Old for tryouts, probably. But I keep myself in shape. Been active my whole life. Mostly just… regular stuff, hiking, walking, that kind of thing. Not a professional, never was. Just want to make sure nothing's gonna break if I push it a little.
DOCTOR: "Regular stuff" is… vague, Mr. Kingan. We need specifics. When you say “push it a little,” what exactly does that entail?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Look, it’s a basketball team, okay? A local league. It’s not the NBA. But it involves running, jumping, shooting… you know, basketball. I've been doing some drills with some younger guys, just to see if I could still handle it. No full games yet, just practicing. It’s been… a little harder than I remember, to be honest. That's why I'm here. Don’t want to pull a muscle or something.
DOCTOR: Basketball, at your age... alright. And when you say "harder," can you be specific?
PATIENT: Well, my knees. They get a little stiff afterwards. Not painful, exactly, just…tight. And I get winded quicker. Used to be able to run all day, now… not so much. Recovery takes longer, too. A couple of days of feeling pretty sore. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Just… old. Is that a good enough explanation? Look, can we just get this over with? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: "Old" isn’t a diagnosis, Mr. Kingan. We need to rule things out. Have you had any previous injuries to your knees, or any other joints, for that matter?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. Nothing major. I twisted my ankle playing volleyball when I was younger, but that was… decades ago. Healed up fine. I think I maybe pulled a hamstring once, running track in high school. Again, ages ago. Honestly, Doctor, I've been pretty lucky. I just want to make sure I’m not about to do something stupid. Do you need to… bend my knees or something? Can we skip all the history stuff?
DOCTOR: We’re not skipping anything, Mr. Kingan. It’s standard procedure. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No, never. No one in my family has it, as far as I know. My mother had… well, she had some aches and pains, but she was old. Everyone has aches and pains when they get old, right? I really don’t understand why we’re going through all this. Is a simple check-up not enough? Look, I need to know if I can play basketball, not my entire medical history. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan. Let's do a quick physical exam then. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table, please. We’ll start with your knees. And I strongly recommend you be more forthcoming with information in the future. It helps me help you.
