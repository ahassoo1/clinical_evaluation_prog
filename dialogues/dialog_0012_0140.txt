DOCTOR: Hi Antoine, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, to start us off, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's… a bit embarrassing, frankly. A growth. In my mouth. It’s uncomfortable, and my wife insisted I come. I haven’t much time for these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is good your wife encouraged you to come in – it’s always best to get things checked out. And no need to be embarrassed at all – we see all sorts of things here. So, a growth in your mouth that's causing discomfort. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It’s… white. Patches, really. On my tongue, mostly. And it hurts when I eat anything sweet, or acidic. Though, truthfully, everything tastes… off. It’s been going on for about a week, I suppose. I haven’t been sleeping well because of it. Honestly, I thought it was just a bit of indigestion. You know how it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, white patches on your tongue, discomfort with sweets and acidic foods, and a change in taste… and it’s been going on for about a week, affecting your sleep. That definitely warrants a closer look. Alright, Antoine, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a quick look inside your mouth. It will only take a minute. Could you open wide for me, and stick your tongue out as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Must you? It's… rather personal, isn't it? I suppose if it’s necessary… Really, doctor, this is quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see what you mean. There are indeed some white patches on your tongue, primarily on the sides. They appear somewhat raised, and there's a little redness around them. It doesn’t look acutely concerning, but we'll need to figure out what's causing it. Does that feel tender when I touch it like that?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, it does. Not agonizing, but… unpleasant. Like a burning sensation, almost. Honestly, I'm starting to lose my patience. Is this going to take much longer? I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to the touch and a burning sensation. That gives us a bit more information. And I apologize for the discomfort, Antoine, and I understand your concern about your meeting. I’ll try to be as quick as possible. Given the white patches, tenderness, and change in taste, it could be a few things. The most common possibilities would be oral thrush, a form of yeast infection in the mouth, or something called lichen planus, which is an inflammatory condition. It could also be something else, but those are the most likely culprits. To help narrow it down, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I told you, it hurts and tastes awful! What more do you need to know? My wife says I've been a bit… irritable lately. But that's hardly a medical symptom, is it? And no, nothing else. No fever, no trouble swallowing… Just this. And the inconvenience.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no trouble swallowing. Irritability is good to know, though – it can sometimes be a symptom, or a result of the discomfort. I'm just quickly checking your medical history here... I see you haven't had any recent illnesses or surgeries. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I'm a very healthy man, usually. I eat well, I exercise… This is likely just a temporary thing. A bit of stress, perhaps. Honestly, doctor, are you going to give me something for it, or am I wasting my time here? I need to know. I can’t spend all day in a waiting room.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Antoine. I want to assure you that you’re not wasting your time. We will get to a solution. Given your history of good health, and the relatively recent onset of symptoms, I’m leaning towards a mild fungal infection, like oral thrush. However, to be absolutely certain, I'd like to take a quick swab of the area. It's a very quick and painless procedure – we just use a cotton swab to collect a sample to send to the lab. That will give us a definitive answer. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Must you? Honestly, this is becoming quite… invasive. Very well, get it over with quickly. But I warn you, if this takes long, I will need to reschedule. I have important clients waiting. Just… be gentle. And fast.
DOCTOR: Okay, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Briefly. Now, what? How long until I get these… results? And what if it is some terrible illness? I have a business to run, doctor. I can't afford to be ill.
DOCTOR: Okay, the lab usually takes about 2-3 business days to return the results. I will have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, to help manage the discomfort, I’m going to recommend a mouthwash called nystatin. It’s an antifungal rinse, and even if it doesn’t end up being a fungal infection, it won’t cause any harm. Rinse your mouth with it twice a day after meals. I'm also going to recommend avoiding sugary foods and acidic drinks for now, as those can irritate the area. And stay well hydrated. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A mouthwash… Very well. And avoid sugar? That’s hardly practical. But fine, I’ll try. Will this… mouthwash require a prescription? Because frankly, I don’t have time to be running back and forth to pharmacies. And if it’s something serious, I expect a referral to a specialist immediately. Do you understand? I have responsibilities, doctor. This must be resolved efficiently.
DOCTOR: Yes, the mouthwash does require a prescription, but I’ve already sent it electronically to your preferred pharmacy. You should be able to pick it up within a few hours. And yes, I absolutely understand your concerns, and I assure you I will be efficient. I'm already documenting everything in your chart, and if the lab results indicate something more serious, I will immediately refer you to a specialist. For now, let’s try the mouthwash and see if it provides some relief. If your symptoms worsen, or don’t improve within a few days, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic, and we’ll reassess. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… make sure this is over quickly. And don’t waste my time with unnecessary procedures. I have a meeting, doctor. A very important meeting. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I understand. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. The nurse will walk you out. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
