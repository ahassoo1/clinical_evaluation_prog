DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It is… Marija Chilla. I was informed by the receptionist that you handle… these matters. My husband and I were discussing, well, planning, and I believe I require one of those forms. An… Advance Directive, I think she called it. For when one is… unable to speak for oneself. It seems a sensible precaution, though frankly, I find it rather morbid to dwell on such things.
DOCTOR: It is sensible, Marija, and you’re very proactive thinking about this now. It's much better to have these conversations before a crisis. An Advance Directive, also called a living will, lets you outline your wishes for medical care if you can’t speak for yourself. We can definitely get that sorted out for you today. Just to be clear, are you feeling unwell currently, or is this entirely preventative?
PATIENT: Preventative, Doctor, entirely preventative. As far as I am aware, I am in perfect health. One does not simply wait until one is ailing to consider such… arrangements. It is a matter of responsibility. My husband, he worries. He is a good man, but… prone to unnecessary anxieties. I am merely attempting to alleviate them. I assure you, I am not here due to any… physical complaint.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It's wonderful that you're thinking ahead and planning for your future, and that you and your husband are having these important discussions. It's a sign of a very strong relationship. Just to get a full picture, and because I always do a quick overview with new patients, would you mind if I ask a few general health questions?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I came for a form. I did not schedule an appointment to provide a comprehensive medical history. I assure you, my general health is of no concern in this instance. Unless these questions are directly relevant to the completion of this… directive, I would prefer to forgo them. My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Marija. I apologize for pushing. It’s a habit, and I get carried away sometimes. Let’s focus on the Advance Directive then. To start, do you have any existing documents outlining your healthcare wishes, or is this completely new territory?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. If I had such documents, I would not be here. My husband mentioned something about a POLST form as well… is that different from this Advance Directive? Honestly, the terminology is rather confusing. He said it's more… immediate, should something unexpected occur. Perhaps you could clarify the difference? I’d like to understand what I am signing, naturally.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. You're right to ask – the terminology is confusing. An Advance Directive, like we discussed, outlines your overall wishes for medical care – things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatment. It’s a broader document. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is more specific. It's a medical order, based on your current wishes, and it tells healthcare providers what to do in an emergency. It’s often used by people with serious illnesses. Since you’re primarily thinking about planning for the future, it sounds like an Advance Directive is the right way to go for now. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… clarifies things somewhat. So, this directive… does it cover everything? For example, should I become… incapacitated abroad? My husband and I travel frequently. And what if… a difficult decision needs to be made regarding, shall we say, the prolongation of life in a hopeless situation? I need to be certain it is comprehensive and legally sound. I will not have my wishes disregarded simply because of bureaucratic oversight.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Marija. You’re right to think through those scenarios. A standard Advance Directive can address out-of-state and international concerns, but it’s often best to have a portable healthcare power of attorney as well. That document specifically names someone to make decisions on your behalf, and it’s recognized more widely. As for difficult decisions about life prolongation, the Advance Directive will outline your values and wishes in those situations. We can include as much detail as you’re comfortable with, such as specific treatments you would or wouldn’t want. We can even discuss what quality of life means to you, so your wishes are clear. Before we start filling out the form, do you have a designated healthcare proxy in mind – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to?
PATIENT: Naturally, Doctor. My husband, of course. He is a perfectly reasonable man, though occasionally… overzealous in his concern. He understands my… preferences. Though I must insist, he will not be dictating my wishes. This is my directive, and I intend to express them clearly and without interference. I suppose he can be present, if you deem it necessary, but I expect him to refrain from… offering unsolicited opinions. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. This is your directive, and your wishes are paramount. Your husband is welcome to be present, but we’ll ensure this remains focused on your preferences. Before we proceed, just so I have a complete picture, are there any specific religious or cultural beliefs that should be considered when making these decisions?
PATIENT: Doctor, I am Moroccan. My beliefs are… private. Suffice it to say, I have a strong sense of… dignity and a firm belief in the sanctity of life. I do not require aggressive intervention to prolong suffering unnecessarily. I value a peaceful and natural end, should it come to that. I trust my husband understands these principles. I don’t see the need to delve into theological specifics with you. Is there a draft of this form I can review before we begin? I prefer to understand the precise wording.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here is the form. It’s fairly straightforward, but we can go through each section together. You'll see sections for appointing your healthcare proxy, outlining your treatment preferences, and noting any specific wishes. We'll start with appointing your husband as your healthcare proxy. It's important to include his full name, address, and contact information. Then we can move on to outlining your preferences for things like life-sustaining treatment, pain management, and end-of-life care. We can also add a section for your values and beliefs, if you'd like, summarizing your preference for a peaceful and natural end. Does that sound like a good approach?
PATIENT: It appears… excessively verbose. All these legal disclaimers and bureaucratic jargon! It's enough to give one a headache. Very well, Doctor. Let's begin. My husband’s full name is Karim Chilla. His address is… and his contact number is . As for these "treatment preferences"... I believe a simple statement outlining my desire to avoid prolonged suffering should suffice. I do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is no reasonable prospect of recovery. Is there a space for a concise declaration of that principle? I abhor unnecessary complexity.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Marija. There's a section for outlining your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. We can definitely keep it concise and focus on your desire to avoid prolonged suffering. Here, we can write something like, "I do not wish to receive life-sustaining treatment if there is no reasonable hope of recovery, and I prioritize comfort and a peaceful end of life." Does that capture your wishes accurately?
PATIENT: Adequate. Though the phrase “reasonable hope” is rather ambiguous. Perhaps “no prospect whatsoever” would be more precise. I do not wish to leave room for interpretation. My wishes must be unambiguous. And what about the matter of… resuscitation? Should my heart cease, I do not wish to be subjected to aggressive measures. I prefer to allow nature to take its course. Add that as well, Doctor. And please, ensure it is clearly stated. I do not want any misunderstandings.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. We can absolutely be more precise. Let's change that to, "I do not wish to receive life-sustaining treatment if there is no prospect whatsoever of recovery." And we'll add a statement regarding resuscitation, stating, "I do not wish to be resuscitated if my heart ceases." Just to be absolutely clear, this means you would not want CPR, chest compressions, or any other measures to attempt to restart your heart. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. I understand the implications of my wishes, Doctor. I am not… uninformed. I have considered this matter carefully, and I do not wish to be subjected to invasive and ultimately futile procedures. I prioritize dignity and a peaceful transition, not a prolonged and artificial existence. Now, is there anything else? I find this process rather… draining, and I would like to conclude it as expeditiously as possible.
DOCTOR: No, we’re making excellent progress, Marija. We’ve covered your healthcare proxy, your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment and resuscitation, and we’ll include a section summarizing your overall values and preferences. Before we finalize the form, would you like to include any specific instructions regarding pain management or other comfort measures?
PATIENT: Comfort measures, Doctor? Of course. I expect to be kept comfortable. Adequate pain management is a given. I do not wish to suffer needlessly. But I do not require a detailed recitation of every possible palliative care procedure. A simple statement indicating my desire for comfort and pain relief should suffice. I trust your medical judgment in that regard. Is that acceptable? I find this level of scrutiny… somewhat insulting, frankly. I am not requesting a catalogue of pharmaceutical options. Just ensure I am comfortable. That is all. Now, can we please conclude this ordeal?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I simply want to ensure your wishes are clearly documented. We'll add a statement indicating your desire for comfort and adequate pain management. Here we are. This is the signature section. You'll need to sign and date the form to make it legally binding. Do you have any questions before you sign?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. I trust this document adequately reflects my wishes. Please ensure it is securely filed and accessible to my husband, Karim. I would like a copy for my records as well, naturally. And now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other commitments. This has been… a rather lengthy process.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here is your copy. I’ve also made a note in your chart indicating the location of the original document, and your husband will have full access to it. I’m glad we were able to get this completed for you. Do you have any questions about what to do with the form going forward – for example, should you travel or be hospitalized?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: No, Doctor. I believe I am adequately informed. Thank you for your assistance. .
