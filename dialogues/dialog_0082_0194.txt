DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Terasa. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, I think. Well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And… dizziness. It comes and goes, you know? It's hard to explain. My daughter, she said I really should come in. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, ears and dizziness. I understand. It is good your daughter encouraged you to come in. Dizziness can be quite unsettling. Let's start with your ears. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on with them?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes… sometimes it just feels like everything’s muffled. Like there’s cotton in them. And then, other times… it’s like a rushing sound. Not painful, exactly… just… strange. It doesn't last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe an hour. Honestly, it comes and goes so quickly, it’s hard to pin down. And then the spinning… Oh dear. It’s awful when it happens. Makes me feel quite sick.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, a rushing sound, and dizziness… and the dizziness makes you feel sick. Alright. And when did you first start noticing these symptoms, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… That’s a tricky one. It’s been… a while. Maybe a few months? It started gradually, I think. I remember thinking it was just… old age. But it’s been happening more often lately, that's why I’m here. My husband… he used to get something similar, years ago. But I don't remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A few months, gradually getting worse… and your husband had something similar. That’s helpful information, thank you. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I’ve noticed, really. Sometimes it happens when I’m… busy. Like at the bingo hall. Or just… when I’m doing things around the house. I don't think there's anything special. Maybe when I turn my head quickly? But I'm not sure. It feels random, mostly. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily bad, Terasa. It’s good we’re trying to pinpoint it. Random occurrences can still give us clues. Let's move on to a few other things. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… Let me think. Sometimes, yes. A very faint ringing. It's not constant, and it's not very loud. I usually don't even notice it unless it's very quiet. Like when I’m trying to sleep. Does that… matter? I don’t usually bother anyone about it.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Even faint ringing can be important. Now, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting with the dizziness, or just the feeling of sickness?
PATIENT: Just the feeling of sickness, usually. Not vomiting. But sometimes… I feel very sweaty when it happens. And I have to lie down. I can’t really… do anything when I’m feeling dizzy. It’s just awful. I don’t like it at all. Makes me feel very weak.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sweaty, feeling weak, and needing to lie down. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, Terasa?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me see. I have… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor put me on some pills for it, years ago. And… arthritis, in my hands. Makes them a bit stiff. Other than that… not much, I don't think. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat good food, mostly. I'm on Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and arthritis. That’s good to know. And you’re on Medicare, yes, that’s helpful. Do you remember what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. I have so many pills, you know? My daughter helps me with them. I honestly can't remember the name. It's a small white one, I think? But I take it every morning. I’m terrible with names. It’s probably written down somewhere, but… I don’t know where. I really rely on my daughter for these things. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Terasa. It's very common to have trouble remembering medication names. We can look it up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but that's not really an allergy, is it? I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, let me see. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, years ago. Other than that… not that I remember. It was a long time ago, you know? Things get a bit fuzzy. I hope that answers your question.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal and hysterectomy. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother… she had heart problems, I think. And my brother… he had diabetes. And… my husband’s father had something with his ears. A ringing, I think. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember the details. Honestly, it’s hard to keep track of everything. Things get a bit muddled, you know? It's been a long time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Terasa. Heart problems, diabetes, and ear issues in the family. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I only have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. And recreational drugs? Never! I’m a churchgoing woman, Doctor. I hope I don’t have to answer any more questions like that! It’s a bit… personal.
DOCTOR: Of course, Terasa. I apologize if that was too personal. It's just standard procedure. Now, before we proceed, let me take a quick look at your electronic health record to see if I can find any more information about your medications and past medical history. Just one moment. Alright. It seems you have been prescribed Lisinopril for your high blood pressure. And it confirms you had a hysterectomy in 1988. Now, let's do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril… That sounds familiar, I suppose. My daughter probably told me. A physical exam… Yes, alright. I don't like going to the doctor, but… I suppose it's necessary. Just… be quick, please? I have bingo tonight.
DOCTOR: Of course, Terasa. I'll be as quick as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to examine your ears. Your ear canals are clear, but there's some mild redness in both eardrums. No fluid buildup visible. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please close your eyes and extend your arms. A slight wobble when standing, but generally stable. Now, just a quick neurological check… Your reflexes are normal. Alright, Terasa. The exam revealed some mild redness in your ears, a slight wobble in your balance, but otherwise everything seems normal. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a mild case of labyrinthitis, an inner ear infection causing inflammation and balance issues. However, it is difficult to confirm without additional testing.
PATIENT: Labyrinth-what-now? An inner ear… infection? That sounds… serious. Is it contagious? And what does that mean for my bingo? Will I have to stop going? What kind of testing do I need? I really don't want to spend a whole day at the doctor's office.
DOCTOR: It’s not usually serious, Terasa, and it’s not contagious. It’s more of an annoyance than anything. And we'll try to minimize any disruption to your bingo nights! It’s an inflammation of the inner ear, often caused by a viral infection. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order an audiogram – a hearing test – and possibly a vestibular function test to check your balance more thoroughly. The audiogram is quick and painless – you just wear headphones and listen for sounds. The vestibular test takes a little longer, but it’s also not invasive. It involves tracking your eye movements while you're in different positions. We can schedule these tests at the clinic. It shouldn’t take an entire day. We can get you in next week. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and avoiding sudden movements. I can also prescribe some medication to help with the nausea and dizziness if you’d like. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More tests… Oh dear. But alright, next week is probably okay. As long as it doesn't interfere with bingo. What about the medication? Does it have any side effects? I don't want to feel more sick than I already do. And… will the tests tell me why this is happening? Is it something I did? I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Alright, we’ll schedule those tests for next week, and we’ll make sure it doesn’t conflict with your bingo schedule. The medication I'm considering is meclizine. It's an antihistamine that helps with motion sickness and dizziness. Common side effects include drowsiness, so you shouldn't drive or operate heavy machinery while taking it. Some people experience dry mouth, but it's usually mild. The tests should give us a better understanding of the cause of your symptoms. It could be a viral infection, fluid imbalance in the inner ear, or, less commonly, a problem with your vestibular nerve. It's not something you did. These things can happen. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. I’ll write you a prescription for meclizine, and I’ll give you some instructions on how to take it. I also recommend avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and stressful situations. We’ll review the test results next week and discuss the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Alright, meclizine it is. No driving, no caffeine… it’s a lot to remember. But I suppose I can try. No bingo is out of the question, right? I need my bingo. And… will I have to see a specialist if these tests don’t help? I really don’t want to go to another doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: No bingo is not out of the question, Terasa. We’ll see how you feel after starting the medication and getting some rest. If your symptoms don’t improve or worsen, we’ll re-evaluate. If the tests are inconclusive, or if we suspect a more serious underlying condition, I may refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for further evaluation. However, let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’m writing you a prescription for meclizine now. Take it as directed, and try to get plenty of rest. I’m also giving you a handout with information about labyrinthitis and some tips on managing your symptoms. We’ll schedule your tests for next week, and we’ll review the results then. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… please make sure the tests don’t take too long. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to help me. I just want to get back to my normal life. I suppose I’ll go home and rest now. And maybe skip bingo for a night or two. It’s just… hard to stay away. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I understand how important bingo is to you. We’ll do our best to get you back to your normal life as quickly as possible. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and take care. We’ll see you next week.
