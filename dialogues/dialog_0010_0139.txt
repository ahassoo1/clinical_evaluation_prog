DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I’m Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. Is… for the job. I want to be sure I okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fitness evaluation for a job. I understand. To clarify, you mean a physical exam to ensure you meet the physical requirements for a position?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Physical… is good. Need to run, jump, maybe… wrestle a little? Is for… sports. I need paper say I strong enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a sports physical with a focus on running, jumping, and some contact, potentially wrestling. We can definitely do that. Before we get started, let's go over a little bit of your medical history. Have you been seen by a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Not really. My wife… she take care of things. She… passed away last year. I haven't… been sick. Just… normal. A little tired sometimes, but work is hard.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Shanor. That must be incredibly difficult. It's understandable if things have been…disrupted. It's good you're prioritizing your health now. “Normal” is good to hear, but "tired sometimes" is something we should explore a bit. Just to be thorough. Do you recall when you started feeling more tired than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… after wife… gone. Maybe six, seven months ago? I work a lot. Long hours. Refractory… is hot work. Makes you tired. I drink water. Try to eat okay.
DOCTOR: Six to seven months ago, coinciding with your loss, and long hours at work. Refractory work… is that related to furnaces or something high-temperature?
PATIENT: Yes. Furnaces. Big ovens. For… steel. Very hot. Lots of lifting. Is… hard on body. Is why I need check, yes? Make sure I not… breaking.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It's very responsible of you to get this checked out. Lifting and heat can certainly take a toll. Before we do a physical exam, let's quickly go over a few other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I eat everything. My wife… she always check when I try new things. But… I never had problem. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… used to take something for back, long time ago. But I stop. Doctor… wife’s doctor… said I try stretching. Stretching help. Now… no pills.
DOCTOR: Stretching is good! That's excellent. Okay, Mr. Shanor, let’s move on to a physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then we’ll take a look at your joints and muscles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, okay. Sounds good. Quick, please? I got work this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the table here. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just relax and breathe normally. I'm hearing regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs or abnormal sounds. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Pulses are strong and regular. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Reflex… is like… hitting knee with hammer? My wife told me about that.
DOCTOR: That's right, that's one way to check them. It’s a quick test to see how your nerves are functioning. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'd like to check your range of motion in your arms and legs. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? A little… tight. Shoulder… sometimes hurts when I lift heavy things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a little bit of restriction in your range of motion, and you’re right, there is some tenderness here. We should take a closer look. And how about your legs?
PATIENT: Legs… okay. Waist… a little stiff. Like old man. Not so good. I lift a lot. Bricks. Big heavy bricks.
DOCTOR: I understand. Lifting heavy bricks can certainly take a toll on your back. There’s some muscle tightness here, and I do feel some tenderness. Can you lift your leg straight up while I hold it?
PATIENT: Ow! Stop, please. That… hurts. Lower back… burning.
DOCTOR: Okay, stop right there. That's good to know. That suggests some possible nerve irritation in your lower back. Given the pain with that maneuver, and the tenderness in your lower back and shoulders, I'm concerned about a potential muscle strain or even a mild disc issue. I’m going to order some X-rays of your lumbar spine to get a better look. We should also consider an MRI if the pain doesn’t improve. Do you have any other pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: X-ray? MRI? Is… serious? I just want paper say I okay for referee. No… no other pain. Just back. Always back.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking. The X-ray and potentially MRI are just to rule out anything serious, Mr. Shanor. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The pain you’re describing, combined with the limited range of motion, warrants further investigation. I understand you need a paper for your job, and we will get there. However, we need to ensure your safety first. We can’t clear you for strenuous activity without knowing what’s going on with your back. I’m going to write you a temporary work restriction note excusing you from heavy lifting and bending. We’ll schedule the X-ray right away. Would you prefer to do that at this clinic, or a facility closer to your home?
PATIENT: Clinic… is fine. Closer is… too much trouble. Just… tell me when. I need job.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll schedule the X-ray for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM here at the clinic. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those, we’ll review them and discuss a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for the pain, and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Here’s the temporary work restriction note. It specifies no heavy lifting, bending, or twisting for one week. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: One week? No lifting? Is… bad. But okay. No questions. Just… get X-ray. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Shanor. We’ll get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if your pain worsens, or if you have any other concerns. Here’s the number for the radiology department if you need to reschedule the X-ray. I’ll see you tomorrow. And remember, taking care of your body is the most important thing. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. .
