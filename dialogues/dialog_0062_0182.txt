DOCTOR: Hi Werner, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. Took long enough to get an appointment. It’s about this… procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up first. Says I’m too old to be making decisions for myself, honestly. It's a bit of a facelift, if you must know. Don't see why it needs a doctor's permission, but here I am. Let’s just get it over with, alright?
DOCTOR: It’s good of your daughter to be so involved in your care, Werner. And you’re right, it is good to get a check-up beforehand, even for elective procedures. We want to make sure you're healthy enough and that there aren't any underlying issues that might affect things. So, a facelift. Okay. Before we talk specifics about the procedure itself, let's just go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Just so I have a complete picture. First, have you been feeling generally healthy lately?
PATIENT: Generally healthy? At my age, “healthy” is relative, don’t you think? I get up in the morning, I don’t fall over… that’s a good start. No, I haven't been sick sick. A bit of creaky joints, a touch of the arthritis, but that comes with the territory. I don’t go around complaining. Always been a sturdy Norwegian, you know? Though, truthfully, I haven't been as active this last year... since Martha passed. It’s… hard to keep up with things when you’re on your own. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does, Werner. And I understand completely. Losing a partner is… a huge adjustment. It’s perfectly normal to have changes in activity level and energy after something like that. And you are right – healthy is relative, especially as we get older. So, creaky joints and a touch of arthritis – have you been officially diagnosed with arthritis, or is it more of a self-diagnosis?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. I didn’t bother with the doctors for that. What are they going to do, tell me I’m old? I know I’m old! My father had it, his father before him… it's just in the family. Rub some liniment on it, take a few painkillers when it flares up, that’s what we always did. Never needed a fancy doctor’s name for it. Honestly, all these tests and labels… seems like a waste of time and money. Can we just get to the point of whether I'm fit enough for this… improvement, or not?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your directness, Werner. And you’re right, sometimes a formal diagnosis isn’t necessary, especially if you’ve managed things effectively on your own for a long time. But for a procedure like a facelift, even a minor one, it’s important to rule out any underlying conditions that could affect healing or increase the risk of complications. Let’s put it this way - it’s not about whether you need a diagnosis for your joints, it's about making sure we’ve covered all our bases for your safety. Okay, let's switch gears a bit. Have you had any other significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Well, I broke my wrist once, fell off a ladder while fixing the roof. That was… forty years ago, maybe more. Healed up fine. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. Besides that… I've been remarkably lucky, if you ask me. Strong constitution, you see. I haven't spent much time in doctors' offices, thankfully. Look, are you going to ask me about every sniffle and scrape I've ever had? Because I’ll be here all day. Just tell me if I'm cleared for this thing or not. My daughter will have a fit if I keep postponing it.
DOCTOR: No, I certainly don't need a detailed history of every sniffle and scrape! You've given me a good overview, and it sounds like you've been very healthy overall. The appendix and broken wrist are helpful to know, thank you. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Just a few things. I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Small dose, doctor put me on it a few years back. And I take a fish oil supplement – daughter insists, says it’s good for the heart. Otherwise, no. I don't believe in loading up on pills if I can avoid it. Honestly, I’d rather just have a good, healthy diet. And a little bit of willpower. Are we still on this list of questions? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and a fish oil supplement. That’s good to know, thank you. It's helpful to have a complete picture of everything you're taking, even vitamins, because they can sometimes interact with anesthesia or affect healing. Now, one more question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I used to get hay fever as a boy, but that was decades ago. I can’t say I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy skin sometimes, but that’s about it. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. Is this going to take much longer? I’m starting to feel a bit… fidgety. Let's just get on with it, alright? My daughter scheduled a luncheon with her friends after this. I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: We’re almost there, Werner. Just a few more quick questions, then we’ll do a brief physical exam. It won’t take long, I promise. Okay, last question about your background - have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removal and broken wrist repair?
PATIENT: No. None. Just the appendix when I was a boy, and the wrist, like I said. I’ve always been careful, you see? Avoided risky activities. Never needed to go under the knife before. Really. What possible relevance could past surgeries have to a little facelift? It’s not like they’re rebuilding my face from scratch! Frankly, I’m losing patience here. Are you finally going to look at me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Werner. No additional surgeries. That’s good to know. And you’re right, a facelift isn’t a major reconstruction. I apologize if these questions seem tedious, but I just want to make sure I have all the information to ensure your safety and a smooth recovery. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the area where the facelift will be performed. It will only take a few minutes. If you could just sit up for me, that would be great.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s get this over with. Just don't poke me too much. And try to be quick about it, alright? I have a reputation to uphold with my daughter's friends. It's not easy being the most handsome man in the room, you know. Hurry up, then.
DOCTOR: I assure you, I'll be as quick and gentle as possible, Werner. And I have no doubt you are the most handsome man in the room. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 76. That’s a little elevated, but not alarming, given your nerves. And now, just a quick look at the skin here… Everything looks good, healthy skin. Some expected laxity for your age, but nothing concerning. No unusual moles or lesions. Alright, Werner, that’s all I needed. Everything looks good from a quick physical exam. Now, let’s talk about your medical history, the facelift procedure itself and what we can do to keep you safe during and after the procedure.
PATIENT: Finally! Good. Now that you've poked and prodded enough, let's get to the important part. What exactly are you going to do to my face, and what’s involved? And how long is this whole ordeal going to take? I have a tee time next week, you know. Don't want to miss that. And be clear. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Werner. No surprises, I promise. Let’s talk about the facelift procedure. Based on what I’ve seen today, you’re a good candidate for a limited facelift – also sometimes called a “SMAS facelift.” That means we’ll be tightening the deeper tissues of your face, specifically the SMAS layer, which is a supportive membrane beneath the skin. This helps restore a more youthful contour and reduce sagging. We’ll make small incisions along your hairline and around your ears, so they will be hidden as much as possible. We’ll then lift and tighten the SMAS layer, remove any excess skin, and redrape the remaining skin. The incisions will be closed with very fine sutures. The procedure usually takes between two to three hours, depending on the extent of the work needed. It’s typically performed under local anesthesia with sedation, meaning you’ll be awake but comfortable and relaxed. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Incisions? You're going to cut me? Even if they are hidden, that doesn't sound very pleasant. And what about the pain? I have a low tolerance for that sort of thing. And… sedation? Will I be out of it? I don't want to be rambling incoherently in front of anyone. Honestly, it sounds rather… invasive. Is there any way to just… tighten things up without all the cutting and slicing? A little bit of magic, perhaps? Is that even possible? I’m not sure I like this very much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Werner. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about any surgical procedure, even a relatively minor one. You’re right, it does involve incisions, but they are carefully planned to minimize scarring and are placed in areas where they’ll be hidden as much as possible. We use very fine sutures and take great care to ensure the best possible cosmetic result. As for the pain, we’ll definitely manage that. We use a local anesthetic to numb the area completely before and during the procedure, and we can also provide pain medication afterwards to keep you comfortable. The level of discomfort is usually quite manageable, and most patients describe it as more of a pressure or tightness sensation. Regarding sedation, it's not a full general anesthesia. It’s a light sedation that will help you relax and feel more comfortable during the procedure, but you'll still be awake and able to respond to questions. You won't be rambling incoherently, I assure you! As for tightening things up without cutting, there are non-surgical options like radiofrequency or ultrasound treatments, but they typically provide more subtle results and aren’t as effective for addressing significant sagging. They won't deliver the same level of rejuvenation as a facelift. Before we proceed, I want to make sure you’re completely comfortable and have all your questions answered. What are your biggest concerns right now?
PATIENT: My biggest concern is ending up looking… worse. Or like one of those people you see on television who’ve had too much work done. All stretched and… unnatural. And the recovery time? I have social engagements, you know. I can’t just disappear for weeks. And what if something goes wrong? Infection? Nerve damage? I’ve read things online… terrible things. Honestly, the more you explain it, the less I like the sound of it. Are you sure I need this? Maybe I'm just fine the way I am. Perhaps a new hat is the answer. Or a really good barber.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Werner. It’s good you’re asking these questions. It’s my job to address them and make sure you feel completely informed and comfortable with any decisions you make. Let me address them one by one. First, regarding looking “worse” or unnatural – that’s a risk with any cosmetic procedure, but it’s minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon—like myself—who prioritizes natural-looking results. I’m very careful to preserve your natural facial contours and avoid over-correction. We'll also discuss your goals very specifically to make sure we're on the same page. Regarding recovery time, most patients experience some swelling and bruising for a week or two after a facelift, but you’ll be able to resume most of your normal activities within a couple of weeks. Social engagements are generally fine after that, although you may want to avoid strenuous activities for a month or so. As for complications like infection or nerve damage, they are rare, but they are possible with any surgery. We take every precaution to minimize those risks, including sterile technique, careful surgical planning, and post-operative care. We'll discuss all potential risks in detail before you proceed, and I’ll be available to address any concerns you have during your recovery. Ultimately, the decision to undergo a facelift is a personal one. You are absolutely right—a new hat or a good barber might be all you need! I wouldn’t want you to proceed with something you’re not comfortable with. To help you decide, perhaps it would be helpful for me to show you some before-and-after photos of my previous patients?
PATIENT: Before-and-after photos, you say? Hmm… I suppose that wouldn't hurt. But only if they look… natural. No stretched faces or bizarre angles. And if they look anything like those people on television, I want no part of it. Honestly, I’m still leaning towards the new hat option. But I’m willing to take a look, if you insist. Just promise me, no scary pictures. And if they're too graphic, I reserve the right to change my mind immediately. Alright, show me what you’ve got. But be warned, I have very discerning taste.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Werner. I completely understand. I’ll only show you photos of patients who have achieved natural-looking results, and I’ll be happy to explain the techniques I used to achieve those outcomes. Here are a few examples. This first patient was concerned about sagging along the jawline and cheeks. As you can see, we were able to restore a more youthful contour without creating a stretched or unnatural appearance. Notice how the natural folds and lines are preserved. This next patient wanted to address some wrinkles and improve the overall texture of her skin. We used a combination of techniques to achieve a more refreshed and rejuvenated look. What are your thoughts so far?
PATIENT: Hmm… those aren’t terrible. They look… reasonably natural. Not like those people on television, thankfully. The first one is probably the most convincing. Though, she does look a bit… stiff. Is that normal? And what about the downtime with this procedure? I have a bridge game every Tuesday, and I absolutely refuse to miss it. Honestly, if I have to spend weeks hiding in my basement, I'm out. It's a matter of principle, you understand. And how much does all this cost? Don’t tell me it’s going to bankrupt me. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I can’t be seen scrimping and saving.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candidness, Werner. You're right to ask about the stiffness – it's common to experience some initial tightness after a facelift, but it usually subsides within a few weeks as the swelling goes down and the tissues settle. We also do facial exercises to help restore your natural range of motion. Regarding downtime, most patients can resume most of their normal activities within two weeks, though you may want to avoid strenuous exercise or heavy lifting for a month. So, your bridge game shouldn’t be affected! There might be some mild swelling or bruising, but it can be concealed with makeup. As for the cost, a limited facelift typically ranges from $8,000 to $12,000, depending on the extent of the work needed and any additional procedures you choose. That includes the surgeon’s fee, anesthesia fee, and facility fee. We do offer financing options to help make it more affordable. We have a financial counselor who can go over those options with you in detail. Before we move forward, I want to make sure you have all the information you need to make an informed decision. Do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: Financing options, you say? Hmm… that’s something to consider. I suppose I could part with a few thousand dollars, if it means restoring my youthful appearance. But I need to be certain that it's worth the investment. And what about guarantees? If I don't like the results, can I get a refund? Or another procedure? Honestly, I’m a bit of a perfectionist, you understand. I expect nothing less than flawless. And I need to know what happens if something goes wrong during the procedure. Infection? Nerve damage? I’ve read terrible things online, you know. Honestly, the more you explain it, the more nervous I become. Perhaps a new hat is the answer.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Werner. It’s perfectly natural to feel nervous, and it’s good you’re asking these questions. Regarding guarantees, while we can’t guarantee a specific outcome – every patient’s anatomy is different – we do offer revisions if you’re not satisfied with the initial results within a certain timeframe. We want you to be completely happy with your outcome. We have a very thorough pre-operative assessment to minimize the risk of complications. And if something were to go wrong, we have a team of experienced surgeons and nurses who are prepared to handle any situation. We also have a strict infection control protocol to prevent any post-operative complications. However, if you’re feeling uncomfortable or unsure about proceeding, a new hat is absolutely a valid option! Your comfort and peace of mind are my top priorities. It's always best to choose the option that feels right for you. If you'd like, I can provide you with some information about financing options and a consultation with our financial counselor. Or, if you prefer, I can simply provide you with a referral to a reputable milliner. What would you like to do?
