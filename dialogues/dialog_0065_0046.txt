DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I've been having a lot of pressure in my bladder lately, and it’s been… well, it’s quite bothersome.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Bladder pressure. Okay. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it started, I believe, around the end of May. So, roughly two months now, maybe a little longer. It comes and goes, but it’s been more frequent the last couple of weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months, increasing in frequency recently. Can you describe the pressure?
PATIENT: It feels…full, even right after I’ve gone to the bathroom. It's not painful, exactly, more like a constant, heavy feeling. And sometimes it’s hard to… fully empty my bladder, if that makes sense. Like there’s always a little bit left.
DOCTOR: Right, a feeling of fullness despite recent voiding, and incomplete emptying. I see. And how often are you urinating during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Usually around six or seven times, I think. Maybe eight on days when the pressure is worse. It’s definitely more than it used to be. I don't usually have to get up at night, thankfully. Not unless I drink a lot of water before bed.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight times daily, no nocturia unless there’s increased fluid intake. Do you notice any burning or discomfort while you urinate?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No burning at all. Just the pressure and that feeling of not being completely empty. It's… unpleasant, but not painful, like I said. I don’t have any pain in my back or sides either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no dysuria, no flank pain. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, everything seems normal there. The color is usual, and I haven't noticed any odd smells. It's just the pressure that's different. Is this something serious, Doctor? I’m a little worried.
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, Ms. Creagh. It’s rarely anything immediately serious, but we need to investigate to be sure. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it's well-controlled with medication. Other than that, no, nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing lasting. My doctor is Dr. Ramirez, she’s in town. Does that affect anything, do you think?
DOCTOR: Hypertension, well-controlled… good. It can sometimes contribute to kidney issues, which could, indirectly, affect bladder function, so it’s relevant information. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I’ve been very fortunate, thankfully. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I had my tonsils removed when I was a little girl, but that was it. It was a long time ago. I try to stay healthy. I eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, and I try to exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgical history. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had high cholesterol. Neither of them had any problems with their bladder, as far as I know. My younger sister is perfectly healthy. I don’t believe there's any history of kidney disease or urinary issues on either side of the family, but I could ask them to be sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of urological issues. Now, could you tell me about your social habits?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m married, and I don’t smoke. I drink… occasionally, maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. And I work from home as a graphic designer, so I'm mostly sedentary during the day, though I try to take breaks and walk around. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, occasional alcohol use, sedentary work. Good. And finally, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No known allergies to medications, food, or anything else. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty good about avoiding things that might cause problems, if I can. I’ve always been careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Thank you for that thorough information, Ms. Creagh. Now, I’m going to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll start with your vital signs and then do a brief abdominal exam. Afterwards, I'd like to do a quick pelvic exam to assess your bladder and surrounding structures. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I understand you need to examine me to find out what’s going on. Just… please let me know what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind? I get a little anxious with medical things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I proceed. First, let’s take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6. Within normal limits, consistent with your reported hypertension control. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths. Bowel sounds are normal. I’m now going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. No significant tenderness to palpation. Abdomen is soft, non-distended. No masses appreciated. Now, to assess your bladder more directly, I will need to perform a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step as I go. I'll use a speculum to visualize the vaginal canal and cervix, and then perform a bimanual exam to assess the uterus and ovaries. It may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds alright. You’ve explained it very clearly. Just… take your time, if you would? And, as you said, please tell me what you’re doing as you go. I… I just want to be prepared. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Creagh. We'll proceed at your pace. I’ll let you know before each step. I’m now gently inserting the speculum. You may feel some pressure. Cervix appears normal, no signs of infection. Now, I’m going to insert one finger, and then two, into the vagina to assess the uterus and ovaries. This may cause some mild discomfort, but please let me know if you experience any pain. Uterus is normal in size and position. Ovaries are palpable and appear normal. However, I do note some mild tenderness with palpation of the bladder itself. It’s subtle, but it’s present. There’s no palpable mass. Okay, that's all. Based on the exam, the tenderness of your bladder is concerning. It suggests some inflammation, though it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to check for any infection. I also recommend a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. This will help determine if you’re fully emptying your bladder. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I'm happy to do. A urinalysis and a post-void residual volume test… I'll do those right away. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. What happens after the tests, Doctor? Will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Good. I'll write the orders for those tests now, and the nursing staff will assist you with collecting the urine samples. The post-void residual volume test can be done in the clinic after you urinate. We will need you to empty your bladder as completely as possible. As for follow-up, I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. If the urinalysis and urine culture come back positive for an infection, we’ll start you on antibiotics. If the post-void residual volume is elevated, we may need to consider further testing, such as urodynamic studies, to evaluate your bladder function more comprehensively. I'll also want to see if the tenderness has resolved. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, lower back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or the follow-up plan?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think I understand everything. Urinalysis, urine culture, and a post-void residual volume test. Follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results. And contact the clinic if I have any fever, chills, or blood in my urine. Thank you so much, Doctor Duplichan. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly and making me feel comfortable. I feel much better knowing we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I’m glad I could help. The nursing staff will be in shortly to assist you with the urine samples. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
