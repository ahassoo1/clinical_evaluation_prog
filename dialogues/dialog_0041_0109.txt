DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for... maybe three days now? Not so bad at first, but now... more. It’s a dull ache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, getting more noticeable… and you describe it as a dull ache at the back of your head. That’s good to know. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More... hmm. It feels… tight. Like a band. Around the back. Not on the sides, not in the front. Just… back. And when I lie down, it doesn’t really go away. Maybe a little better, but not much. Does that make sense? I sometimes forget how to explain things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Brum. A tight band around the back of your head, not really relieved by lying down… No problem at all with explaining; these things can be tricky. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. Not that I know of. I been… working. Like always. I work with the trains, you see? Been doing that a long, long time. Maybe that? Lifting things… sometimes heavy things. But I always been careful. I don’t think so. Nothing new happened. Just... the headache came. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work with the trains, lifting occasionally, but no recent changes in your work or any specific injury that you can recall. Let’s talk a little bit more about the headache itself. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain right now?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. Ten would be… awful. I had a bad fall once, broke my arm. That was a ten, for sure. Right now… I’d say a… maybe a five? It’s not stopping me from doing things, but I know it’s there. Keeps me… thinking about it. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: A five, okay. Noticeable, interfering with sleep a little, but not completely disabling. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the headache, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No, not really. No dizziness. No blurry vision. No… feeling sick to my stomach. Just… the headache. And… maybe a little tired. But I’m old! I’m always a little tired. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts, Mr. Brum. It’s good to know what your usual baseline is. No dizziness, no vision changes, no nausea... That's helpful. Now, have you ever had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I get little headaches sometimes, like a tension headache, if I’m worried about something. But this… this is different. More constant. More… in the back. It’s… a new kind of headache. I’m worried it's something bad. Old men get… things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Brum. It's always a good idea to get checked out when something feels new or different, especially as we get older. Just to be thorough, let's quickly go through some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a problem with any medicine. Doctors gave me things for my arm when I broke it, and things for my… well, things old men get. No reaction. Always been fine. I’m a tough old bird, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… a little something for my arthritis. The pills… help my hands, you see? They’re small, white pills. I take two every morning. That's all. And sometimes, a little something for my stomach, if it bothers me. But not often. It’s just… for when I eat something bad. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for arthritis and occasional something for your stomach. We’ll get the name of those shortly. Now, can you tell me about any past medical problems you've had?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. The arm, of course. That healed okay. And… I had a little trouble with my heart a long time ago. Not so bad, they gave me pills for it, too. Took them for a while, then stopped. The doctor said I was okay. And… just the usual old man things. My knees bother me sometimes. And… well, I'm just old. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Brum. You had a past issue with your heart, which was treated and resolved, and you currently manage some knee pain. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the arm. When I fell, it broke real bad. Had to put pins in it. A long time ago. And... maybe something else when I was a little boy. A little thing. I don't remember much about it. My mother took care of it. I was very small. Just a little cut, I think. Nothing like the arm.
DOCTOR: Okay, surgery to repair your broken arm and a childhood surgery, the details of which you don't recall. And finally, are there any major medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. My mother… she had trouble with her heart. Like me, but worse. She was always tired. And… my father… he had trouble with his sugar. He had to watch what he ate. And… my sister… she had something with her blood pressure, I think. I don’t remember exactly. We didn’t talk about it much. Just… old man things.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Brum. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle with my arm, okay? It still bothers me sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And… I'm a little ticklish, if you're poking around.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brum. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We can go slowly. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, heart sounds good. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Hmm. There’s some tenderness here, at the base of your skull. And I’m going to check your range of motion. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. When I turn my head… to the right… that’s where it hurts the most. Not so bad, but… I can feel it. And… when I look up… it’s a little stiff. Like something is… tight. It's not awful, Doctor, but I feel it. It's the same ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pain and stiffness with head movement, especially to the right and looking upwards. There’s some tightness in the muscles along the back of your neck. I don't feel any obvious lumps or abnormalities. Ears and eyes look fine. Okay, Mr. Brum, thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to some muscle strain in your neck. The tenderness at the base of your skull and the limited range of motion support that. However, given your age and your family history, I’d like to be cautious and rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Tension headache… that makes sense, I suppose. I do worry a lot. And my neck does feel tight. But… ruling out anything more serious… that's good. What do you suggest? Do I need… tests? Scans?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. I think it would be wise to get a basic blood test to check your general health, including your blood sugar and inflammation levels. And given the location of your pain and your age, I'd like to order an X-ray of your cervical spine – that’s the bones in your neck – just to rule out any arthritis or other structural issues. These tests are just precautionary, Mr. Brum. They will give us a clearer picture and help us to be sure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. Tests… scans… I trust you, Doctor. If it will make sure… that's good. I don’t like being worried. Can I still work while I get these tests? I need to work, you see. It keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. I don’t anticipate these tests will prevent you from working. They’re relatively simple and shouldn't interfere with your daily activities. We’ll need to schedule a quick visit to the lab for the blood draw, and then we’ll send you for the X-ray. The lab shouldn’t take long at all. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension in your neck and shoulders. It’s a low dose, and it should help with the pain and stiffness. I’ll also recommend over-the-counter pain relief – either ibuprofen or acetaminophen – if you need it. I’m also going to give you some instructions for self-care. Try applying a warm compress to your neck for 15-20 minutes several times a day. Gentle stretching can also help, but avoid any movements that cause sharp pain. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Warm compress… stretching… yes, that sounds… doable. A little stretching is good. And the pills… muscle relaxant… Will they make me sleepy, Doctor? I don’t want to fall asleep at work. That would be… bad.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Brum. Some muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness, but the one I’m prescribing is less likely to do so, especially at the low dose I’m recommending. However, it's always best to be cautious. I’ll start you on a low dose, and if you find it does make you sleepy, you can reduce the dose or stop taking it altogether. It's important to listen to your body. We can always adjust the medication if needed. Here’s your prescription and some instructions for the muscle relaxant and self-care. I’ve also included a list of red flags – things to watch out for that would warrant a call to the office immediately. Things like severe headache, fever, numbness, or weakness. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Red flags… yes, that's good. Numbness, weakness… I'll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I feel… a little better just knowing what's going on. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man. When should I schedule the tests? And… when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. It’s my pleasure. Let’s schedule the blood work and X-ray for as soon as possible. The receptionist at the front desk can help you with that. We usually get the blood work results back within a couple of days. The X-ray results may take a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A follow-up appointment… I'll remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve put my mind at ease. I think… I think I’ll be alright. I’ll go talk to the receptionist now.
