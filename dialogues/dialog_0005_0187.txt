DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Brings me in? My chest… it hurts. And it feels like… like a bird flapping inside. Also, the nurse, she say my blood pressure is… too much, yes? I no like that. Get it fixed, quickly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain and a feeling like something's "flapping" inside… and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. We’ll definitely look into all of that. “Too much” isn't very specific, though. Do you know what your blood pressure reading was, or roughly when the nurse took it?
PATIENT: Reading? No! I no remember numbers. She just… poke my arm and say “too high.” I tell you, I busy man. Important things. Not good to wait around all day for numbers. Just… fix it. Is that so hard? I come here because chest hurt, not for quiz.
DOCTOR: Right, right. I understand you’re busy and want this resolved quickly. But knowing how high it was helps me figure out the best course of action, Mr. Sobkowicz. Okay, let’s focus on the chest pain for now. Can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? It… ache. Like someone sitting on my chest. Sometimes sharp, sometimes just… heavy. It come and go. When I walk up stairs, it worse. And when I get… upset. My wife, she always yelling. Not good for the heart, you know? Makes it… flutter. Now, are we done soon? I have appointment. Very important.
DOCTOR: Okay, aching chest pain that comes and goes, gets worse with stairs and when you're upset, and you feel fluttering… that's helpful. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Long? Oh… a while. Maybe… six months? Hard to say. I no pay attention to small things. Just get on with life. But it's getting… more often. That's why I come now. Before it… stop everything, yes? Don't want to die on the stairs. My wife would complain even more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months, getting more frequent… We need to rule out some potential causes. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your pulse and blood pressure again. Then we’ll talk about some other questions. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just do it quickly. I no like people poking me. And make sure the number is good this time. My wife… she will not believe me if I say it’s still high. She always right, you know. Always. Get it done. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Deep breaths, please. Heart sounds… slightly muffled, but regular rhythm. No obvious murmurs. Lungs are clear, but you do seem a little short of breath. Pulse is a bit fast, and weak. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. Yes, significantly elevated.
PATIENT: 160? See! I told you! Too much! What does that mean? Is it bad? Just tell me straight. No fancy words. Is it going to… kill me? My wife will be very upset if I… you know. Very upset. She needs me to… fix the TV. It’s a very important TV.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, let’s not jump to conclusions. 160 over 95 is high, yes. It means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood. It doesn't necessarily mean you're going to… drop dead right now. But consistently high blood pressure can lead to serious problems like heart attack, stroke, or kidney failure. That's why we need to get it under control. Now, I need to ask you some more questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Hmm… doctor, long time ago, maybe? When I was young, in Korea. Different doctor. He gave me… little pills. White pills. I take for a while, then stop. I no like taking pills. Felt… weak. And my wife say they make me… grumpy. So I stop. No one tell me it was important to keep taking them. Just… fix the TV, that was important. Have you seen the new soccer game? Very exciting. Now, what was the question?
DOCTOR: Right. You took blood pressure medication in Korea, stopped because of side effects and… the TV. Okay. Do you remember what the doctor in Korea told you about why you were taking the pills?
PATIENT: No! I no remember. Old doctor, long time ago. He just poke me and give me pills. My wife, she handle all that. She always know everything. She say I no good at remembering things. Just… important to fix TV. Playoffs soon. Very important game. You watch soccer? Is very good. Now, my chest still hurt. Are you going to give me pills? I no want pills. Make me grumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Look, I understand you don't like pills. But ignoring this high blood pressure and chest pain is… not a good idea. We need to figure out what's causing the chest pain first. I'm going to ask you some questions about your family history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm… My father, he… strong man. Work hard. No sick. My mother, she… small woman. Always cooking. She… had problems with her legs. Swelling. But no heart problems. My wife’s father, he… loud man. Always yelling. She say he had… something with his stomach. Always complaining. Now, is chest pain going to stop soon? I have appointment. Very, very important. Must fix TV. Playoffs soon.
DOCTOR: Okay. Father strong, mother with leg swelling, wife’s father with stomach problems. Alright. Do you smoke, Mr. Sobkowicz?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! I no smoke. Bad for health, you know. My wife, she always yelling at people who smoke. Very bad habit. She say it make you smell bad. I like clean smell. And… makes TV smell bad, maybe. Important to keep TV smell clean. Now, are we finished? My appointment… must go now. Very important game.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz. No smoking, that's good. Last question – what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes. With dinner. A little bit. Rice wine. My wife, she like it too. Sometimes a lot. Especially when TV is broken. She say it help her forget about it. Now, I really must go. Very, very important. TV is waiting. Is chest pain going to go away? Do I need pills? Just tell me straight. No fancy words. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. Look, I need you to understand something. I can’t just wave a magic wand and make the chest pain disappear. Based on what you've told me – the chest pain, high blood pressure, family history – it could be a number of things. I’m going to write you a prescription for a blood pressure medication, a low dose to start. We need to get this under control. And I’m ordering an EKG and some blood work. You need to schedule those ASAP. I'm also referring you to a cardiologist. It's better to be safe. Here. Take this to the pharmacy and schedule those appointments. And please, Mr. Sobkowicz, try to cut back on the alcohol. And call my office if the chest pain gets worse. Now, I believe you have a TV to get to.
