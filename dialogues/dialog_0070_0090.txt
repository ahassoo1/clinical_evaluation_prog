DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Um… well, to be honest, it’s a bit… fuzzy. I believe I’m here for some sort of check-up before a surgery? A cosmetic one. I’m Mackenzi, by the way. Mackenzi Brightful. It’s difficult to recall all the details, I’m afraid. My… husband handled most of the arrangements.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly alright if details are a bit unclear. Many patients find the pre-operative process can be a bit overwhelming. And thank you for clarifying your name. So, you are here for a pre-operative evaluation for cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of cosmetic surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… is a good question. I really wish I could tell you. Something to do with… my face, I think? Perhaps my eyes? It was discussed at length, but… everything feels a bit like looking through a fog. I apologize for being so unhelpful, Doctor. It's terribly frustrating for me as well. He… my husband, he explained it all so clearly, but… it doesn’t seem to have stuck.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It's quite common for patients to feel a little anxious and have difficulty recalling details, especially regarding elective procedures. Let's see if we can piece things together. I’m going to access your electronic health record here. Perhaps it contains some information about the planned surgery. Ah, yes. It seems you are scheduled for a blepharoplasty – that’s an eyelid surgery – and a brow lift on August 15th with Dr. Ramirez. Does that sound correct?
PATIENT: Blepharoplasty… and a brow lift? …Yes. Yes, that does sound… right. Eyelids… and my brow. He did mention something about lifting… to make me look… less tired, I believe. Dr. Ramirez… is she a good surgeon? I didn’t meet her personally, just my husband did all the vetting. It's all very… hazy, truly. But thank you for finding that information. That’s a great relief.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent surgeon, highly regarded in the area. I work with her frequently and have complete confidence in her skills. Now, to ensure you’re a good candidate for surgery and to minimize any potential complications, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. First, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s another difficult one. I don’t think so, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Sometimes a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that’s just seasonal, I suppose. Nothing that requires medication, certainly. I used to take an antihistamine years ago, but I can’t recall the name now. Does that help at all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mackenzi. We'll note the possible seasonal allergies and the past use of antihistamines. It’s good you haven’t experienced any serious allergic reactions. Next, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don’t think so. Nothing regularly, at least. I keep a small bottle of ibuprofen for headaches, but I rarely use it. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. And occasionally, a sleep aid if I’m particularly restless… but it’s an over-the-counter one, the kind you get at the pharmacy. I don’t take it often. Everything feels so… fragmented, Doctor. I’m so sorry for being such a challenge.
DOCTOR: You’re not a challenge at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly understandable to have difficulty recalling these details. We're just trying to get a complete picture of your health. We’ll note the occasional ibuprofen and over-the-counter sleep aid. Do you recall the name of the sleep aid?
PATIENT: Oh dear… It was a blue bottle, I believe? And… a name that started with a ‘D’… or perhaps a ‘T’? It's terribly frustrating! It’s a common brand, I’m quite sure. He always bought it for me. I feel dreadful, I really do. It’s right on the tip of my tongue… I wish I could be more helpful. Perhaps it’s something the pharmacy can tell me if I give them my information?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable idea, Mackenzi. The pharmacy would certainly have a record of your purchases. We can make a note to check with them if needed. For now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hospitalizations… Oh, goodness. There was… when I was a child, I had my tonsils out. A very long time ago, of course. And… I broke my arm once, when I was in university, playing volleyball. A simple fracture, nothing too serious. And… I believe I was hospitalized briefly after giving birth to my son, but it was a very routine delivery, no complications that I recall. Is that all? It's such a blur, Doctor. Everything before… everything feels distant now.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mackenzi. We have tonsillectomy in childhood, a fractured arm, and a routine delivery. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And… she had some trouble with her heart later in life. My father… he was quite healthy, actually, for most of his life. But he did develop… something with his lungs near the end. And… my brother has asthma, I think. But beyond that… I don't really know much about my family’s medical history. We weren't very close, and health wasn't something we discussed openly. Is that… enough? It feels like I'm grasping at shadows, Doctor. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s common for families not to discuss medical history openly, and you’ve provided a good starting point. We have hypertension and heart issues in your mother, something with the lungs in your father, and asthma in your brother. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And I certainly don't use any recreational drugs. My husband… he enjoyed a good cigar sometimes, but I always preferred a quiet evening at home. No, I live a very… simple, healthy life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mackenzi. And thank you for sharing that. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me about any current symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, nothing that I’ve been particularly worried about. Just… a bit of fatigue, perhaps? I tire easily, but that could be my age. And… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, of course. But I wear glasses, as you can see. I suppose… a bit of dryness around my eyes sometimes, but I put in eye drops. Nothing significant, Doctor. I haven’t been feeling unwell, if that makes sense. I’m mostly here for the surgery, as I said.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mackenzi. Fatigue, worsening eyesight, and eye dryness. Those are all things we’ll need to consider. We’ll do a quick examination now, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks healthy. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment entirely. Just… let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your ears and eyes. I'll just gently look into your ears with this instrument. It won’t be uncomfortable. Your ear canals appear clear, and your eardrums look healthy. Now, I’m going to shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils and the back of your eyes. Please follow my penlight with your eyes. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. I do see some mild dryness in your eyes, which is consistent with what you’ve mentioned, and your retinal reflex is slightly diminished. We will monitor that. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 130 over 80, but nothing concerning at the moment. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Next, I'll listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Very well. That doesn't bother me at all. It's reassuring to hear that nothing is concerning, Doctor. I do worry sometimes, you know. It’s just… I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, and I always seem to be tired. But… a slightly elevated blood pressure isn’t too alarming, is it? As long as it's not anything serious… I trust your assessment. Please, continue with the examination.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Your thyroid feels normal as well. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. And your muscle strength is good. Overall, the physical exam is largely normal. We did note the mild eye dryness and slightly elevated blood pressure, but nothing immediately concerning. Given your fatigue and the upcoming surgery, I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful, Doctor. That’s a great relief to hear. Blood work sounds… sensible. Yes, please, order whatever you deem necessary. I just want to make sure everything is as it should be before proceeding with the surgery. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. I trust your judgment entirely. What will the blood work involve? Will it be a simple draw? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, it will be a simple blood draw. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid stimulating hormone – to assess your thyroid function – vitamin D and B12 levels, and a basic metabolic panel. It typically takes 24-48 hours for the results to come back. Once we have those, we can review them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing your usual eye drops for the dryness. And try to focus on getting adequate rest and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Adequate rest and hydration… yes, I can certainly manage that. That doesn’t sound too difficult. Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. Actually… yes, I do have one question. It’s a bit… personal, perhaps. But… I’ve been feeling… a little down lately. Just a general sense of sadness, I suppose. Is it possible that the surgery could… exacerbate that, or would it be more likely to improve it? I apologize for asking such a silly question.
DOCTOR: That is not a silly question at all, Mackenzi. It's very common to feel anxious or experience mood changes before a surgery, and it’s important to address those concerns. It’s difficult to say definitively whether the surgery will exacerbate or improve your mood. On one hand, the aesthetic improvement could boost your self-confidence and overall well-being. However, any surgical procedure carries some risk of emotional stress and recovery challenges. Given that you've been feeling down, I recommend discussing your concerns with a mental health professional. They can help you assess your emotional state and develop coping strategies. I can provide you with a referral if you’d like. It's always a good idea to prioritize your mental health alongside your physical well-being, especially before undergoing a surgery. Would you be interested in a referral?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be… very kind of you, Doctor. I haven’t… spoken to anyone about it yet, and it’s been weighing on my mind. A referral would be greatly appreciated. I suppose it's better to be proactive, as you say. Thank you for understanding. And thank you for being so… thorough and compassionate. I feel much better knowing that everything is being taken care of.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I'm glad I could help. Here’s a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a licensed therapist in the area. She specializes in pre- and post-operative emotional support. I’ve also included some resources on managing anxiety and depression. So, to recap, we’ve ordered blood work, and I’ve provided you with a referral for mental health support. Once the blood work results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and finalize the pre-operative plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: Dr. Vance… yes, thank you. That's very helpful. No, I don't believe I have any other questions at the moment, Doctor. You've been incredibly thorough and have addressed all of my concerns. I feel much more at ease now. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I suppose I'll just wait for a call about the blood work then?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The lab will contact you to schedule the appointment. The results will be sent directly to my office. We will call you as soon as we have them. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mackenzi. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. I appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: Have a wonderful day, Mackenzi. And please take care.
