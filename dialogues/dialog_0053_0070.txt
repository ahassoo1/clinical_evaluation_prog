DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, good morning to you too, Doctor... Pitmon, yes? Hmm. Well, I just… moved here. New place, you know? And the people at the… building… they said I need to come here. For… the health. Old people health. Medicare things. I don't really feel sick. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… good to know you’re not actively ill. But a check-up is always a sensible thing, especially when you’ve relocated. “Old people health,” as you put it, can sometimes sneak up on you. Let’s just get a baseline, alright?
PATIENT: Baseline? Like… a starting line? I used to be very good at running, you know. Back in… oh, never mind. It was a long time ago. So, you want to… look at me? Poke and prod? Just… try not to be too rough, okay? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Szmyd, a starting line is a good way to think of it. We'll do a physical exam – yes, a bit of looking and, as you say, some gentle prodding. It’s standard procedure. Now, before we get to that, let's talk a little bit about why you think you need this “baseline.” Are you experiencing any specific symptoms, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… well, my back aches sometimes. But that's… always. Since I was a boy, I think. And I get… tired. But everyone gets tired, right? Especially… older people. Oh! And my hands… they shake a little when I'm trying to… do the makeup. It makes it hard. That's important. My work is… was… very precise.
DOCTOR: Alright, back pain, fatigue, and a tremor in your hands, particularly when performing detailed work. And you mentioned this is impacting your… work?
PATIENT: Yes, the work! I am… was… a makeup artist. For the theater, mostly. Very important work. Making the actors look beautiful, or scary, or… old! Irony, yes? Now… it’s harder to keep the line steady. The brushes… they wobble. People don't like wobbly makeup. It looks… unprofessional. I haven’t… done much lately.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long have you noticed this tremor becoming more noticeable?
PATIENT: Oh… a while. Months, I think? Maybe a year? It’s hard to say. Time… it goes so fast when you’re busy. And then… not so fast when you’re not. I started noticing it… when I was working on Madame Evangeline. Very demanding actress. She wanted perfect lines. Always. And the shaking… it made it difficult. She complained. A lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the tremor, fatigue, and back pain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My… sleep. It’s not very good. I wake up a lot. And… sometimes I feel a little… confused? Like… I forget where I put things. Or… what I was saying. Not all the time. Just… sometimes. It's probably just old age, yes? My wife… she used to say that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sleep disturbances and some occasional confusion. Now, Mr. Szmyd, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, the doctor things… My wife always took care of that. She… she went to all the appointments. I just… did the makeup. I think I had… something with the blood pressure, maybe? She gave me pills. Little white pills. I still have some, somewhere. But I don’t really remember what it was for. And… there was a hospital visit, a long time ago. But it was just… a little thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like your wife managed most of your medical care in the past. That’s… not uncommon. Let’s see if we can clarify some of this. Do you recall what year you were hospitalized?
PATIENT: Hospital… oh dear. It was… cold. Very cold. And bright lights. It must have been… many years ago. Before Madame Evangeline. Hmm… maybe… the 1990s? Or… maybe the early 2000s? I am not good with dates. I just remember… they kept me for a few days. Something about my… heart, I think. But it wasn’t serious. My wife said so.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to try and get some official records to confirm all of this. Do you happen to know which hospital you were admitted to?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. It was… big. And grey. In… the city. Not here. Definitely not here. Oh! I think… it had a name with… Saint in it? Saint… something. Saint Luke's? Saint Michael's? It’s all very blurry. My wife… she always knew these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to do some digging. Now, let’s talk about medications. Aside from the little white pills you mentioned for blood pressure, are you currently taking any other medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? No, no supplements. My wife… she didn't believe in those things. Just the pills. Little white pills. I think I still have the bottle somewhere in the… kitchen. It's a mess, you know? I haven't really cleaned it since… well, since she… left.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to locate those pills later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t think so. I eat… mostly everything. My wife… she made me eat a lot of vegetables. I didn't like them very much. But she insisted. No, no allergies. Unless… sometimes my skin gets itchy when I use certain makeup. But that’s not… a real allergy, is it? Just… sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Szmyd, it sounds like we have quite a bit to sort out. Before we get any further, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your overall physical condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. The poking and prodding. Yes, alright. But be gentle, please. And… don’t make me take off my tie. It's my best one. My wife… she gave it to me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. We’ll keep your tie on. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Hmm. It feels… tight. Like a snake. My wife… she never liked snakes. Said they were evil. Is it… high? Is my blood pressure high?
DOCTOR: It’s a little elevated, Mr. Szmyd, but not dangerously so. 148 over 92. We’ll monitor that. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath… Breathe normally. Any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No, not really. Sometimes… when I climb the stairs. But that’s just because I’m… old. And out of shape. My wife… she used to make me walk. But I didn’t like walking. Too much effort. And… it was boring. Is something wrong? Do you hear something strange?
DOCTOR: I hear some mild wheezing, Mr. Szmyd. Not alarming, but it suggests some possible narrowing of your airways. Do you have a history of asthma, or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? Oh dear. I don’t think so. My wife… she never mentioned anything about asthma. Maybe… when I was a little boy? I had a cough once. But that was a long time ago. Just… a little cough. Nothing serious. She gave me some tea. That always helped.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… tickly. And… a little uncomfortable. I ate a big dinner last night. Too much… sausage. My wife… she always said I ate too much sausage. But it was so delicious! Is that… bad? Is it bad to eat too much sausage?
DOCTOR: It’s not ideal, Mr. Szmyd. A little bit of discomfort is understandable. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Ooh! That’s… surprising! Like a little shock. My wife… she always said I was easily startled. Is something wrong? Are my reflexes… bad? I used to have very good reflexes. When I was a boy. Playing… I don't remember what I was playing.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little diminished, Mr. Szmyd. Not drastically, but it’s something to note. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, based on this brief exam and our conversation, I’m concerned about several things. Your elevated blood pressure, the wheezing in your lungs, the diminished reflexes, and the occasional confusion. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s going on without further testing. I’m going to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: X-ray? Oh dear. Is that… dangerous? My wife… she never liked hospitals. Too many germs, she said. And… the X-ray machine. Is it… will it hurt? Will it make me glow in the dark? And… how long will it take? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, an X-ray is very safe. The radiation exposure is minimal, far less than you receive from natural background radiation. It won't make you glow in the dark. And it shouldn't be painful at all, just a quick image of your chest. It should take about 15-20 minutes at the imaging center. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. I also want you to schedule an appointment with a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation of your heart health. It’s better to be cautious, given your history. We’ll get everything sorted out. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Cardiologist? Oh dear. More doctors. My wife… she always said doctors just want to poke and prod. And… give you expensive pills. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But… can we do it quickly? I have… a cat to feed. And… things to… arrange. And… what about the cat food? Does the hospital sell cat food?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Szmyd, the hospital doesn’t sell cat food. But we'll try to make this as quick and efficient as possible. I'll have my nurse give you a list of cardiologists in the area and the contact information for the imaging center. She’ll also provide a requisition for the blood work. Let’s focus on getting those tests done first. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. And Mr. Szmyd, it’s important to remember that taking care of your health is essential. It’s not just about you; it’s about ensuring you can continue doing the things you enjoy, including feeding your cat. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Cat… yes. She’s a very demanding cat. Likes… salmon. And… a special blanket. Alright. Tests. Cardiologist. Salmon. Yes, alright. But… can I get a note… for the salmon? Maybe the hospital has… a special discount? For patients with demanding cats?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Mr. Szmyd, I don’t think the hospital offers discounts on salmon. But I can certainly write a note stating that maintaining a healthy diet for your pet is important for your overall well-being. Would that be sufficient?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… yes. A note. That’s… something. Yes. A note about the salmon. Very good. My wife… she would have appreciated that. She always said I was very good at… negotiating. Yes. A note about the salmon will do nicely. What about the blanket? Does the note cover the blanket as well? It’s… a very special blanket.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I can write a note stating that prioritizing your overall well-being, including ensuring your comfort and the comfort of your pet, is important. We can cover the blanket in that general statement. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Ah. Yes. “Overall well-being.” Very good. That covers… everything. The salmon. The blanket. The… demanding cat. Yes. That's… perfect. You are a very good doctor. My wife… she would have liked you very much. A note about overall well-being. That will do nicely. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I’m glad I could help. My nurse will bring you the requisition forms and the list of cardiologists. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, take care of yourself – and your demanding cat. .
PATIENT: .
