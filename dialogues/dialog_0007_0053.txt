DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez, but you can call me Valerie. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: It’s nice to meet you too, Valerie. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble… getting it going, you know? It takes me a while to start peeing, and it’s not as strong a stream as it used to be. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month or so now? It’s not painful, exactly, just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it’s taking longer to start urinating and the stream isn’t as strong as it used to be, and this has been going on for about a month. No pain with urination, just frustrating. Is that a good summary?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. You put it very well, actually. Not painful at all, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. And I do have to go quite often, even when I haven’t had much to drink, if that makes sense. It feels like my bladder is never really empty empty, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent urination, even with limited fluid intake, and a sensation of incomplete emptying. Got it. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. It’s the usual colour, I suppose. No blood, no funny smell… nothing like that. Just… normal pee. Though, I do sometimes feel like I have to push a little to get it started, even before the trouble with the stream. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, no changes to the urine itself, but you're experiencing some straining to initiate urination before the stream weakness started. Okay. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain at all?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no pain in my lower tummy, thankfully. I haven't felt unwell at all, other than this… bother with my waterworks. It's just… annoying, really. I'm a very active woman, you see. I like my gardening and walking, and having to worry about finding a bathroom all the time is a nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s definitely disruptive when something like this interferes with your daily life, especially when you're active. Let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… thirty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, that flares up now and then. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's it. The doctor said it was just age-related. And, of course, I have Medicare now. Is that helpful? I’m trying to think if anything else is important…
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, arthritis in your hands, and you're on medication for high blood pressure. Medicare is good to know. What’s the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see if I can remember... I keep the bottles in the kitchen. Just a moment… Ah, here we are. It’s Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. Been taking it for… oh, maybe five years now? It seems to keep things under control.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily for the past five years. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My mother was allergic to bee stings, but I don’t have that problem. I can eat anything, take any medicine… I’m pretty lucky, really. I've never had to worry about that sort of thing. It's one less thing to think about, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Alright, Kandy, now let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like bladder problems, kidney issues, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had some trouble with her kidneys when she was older, but I don’t know the details. She needed dialysis for a while, I think. And my brother had prostate problems, of course, but that’s… different, isn’t it? He’s a man. My father was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be 85. I don't recall anyone else having trouble with their waterworks, no. Though, we weren't a very close family, so I wouldn’t necessarily know everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had kidney problems requiring dialysis, and your brother had prostate issues. Knowing your family history is helpful. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to a quick exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband – God rest his soul – tried to get me to, when we were young, but I wouldn't have it. And I only have a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, maybe twice a week. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a very sensible woman. I believe in a good cup of tea and a nice garden. That’s enough excitement for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No smoking, minimal alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Alright, Kandy, with your permission, I’d like to do a brief physical exam now. Just to listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels… odd. I'm a bit ticklish, so be warned!
DOCTOR: Perfect. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's have you lie down on the exam table. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I’ll just do a few simple tests. It shouldn't take long.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go… a bit chilly on this paper, isn’t it? And do try to warn me if it's going to be cold! I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. But go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths for me, Kandy. Just relax. Everything sounds normal there. No unusual sounds or tenderness. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological check. Can you feel this on your left side?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. It's a bit cold, but yes, I can feel it. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. A bit like a pinprick, but nothing unpleasant. Oh, my knee's a bit creaky today. Arthritis, you know. But yes, I can feel it. What are you looking for, exactly? I always like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Just checking your reflexes and sensation, Kandy. It helps us rule out any nerve issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. Everything seems to be intact there as well. Your reflexes are normal, and your sensation is good on both sides. I'm going to perform a quick pelvic exam now, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? Well… I haven't had one of those in years. Is it really necessary, Doctor? I mean, I'm 66 years old. Is it likely to show anything useful? I suppose if you think it’s important… But I must warn you, I’m a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Kandy. It’s a fair question. A pelvic exam can help me assess the health of your bladder and urethra, and rule out any structural issues that might be causing your symptoms. It's also a good opportunity to check for any signs of prolapse, which can sometimes contribute to urinary problems. We can definitely skip it if you're strongly opposed, but I would recommend it for a more complete assessment, if you’re comfortable. It would only take a few minutes. I'll be very gentle and explain everything as I go. And of course, you can stop me at any time. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… you make a good point. I suppose if it could rule something out… and you promise to be gentle? And explain everything? I don’t like surprises, you see. Very well. Go ahead. But please, don’t rush. And warn me before you touch anything. I trust your judgement, Doctor. But be careful, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I promise to be very gentle and explain every step as I go. You are in control here, and I'll stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. I’ll start by having you lie on your back with your knees bent, just like for a regular exam. I'm just going to take a look at the external area first, then I’ll gently insert a speculum to get a better view of your cervix and vaginal walls. I'll be using a lubricant to make it more comfortable. Remember, you can tell me to stop at any time. Let me know if you feel any pressure or discomfort…
