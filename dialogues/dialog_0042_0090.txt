DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Vodzak, is it? It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, to be honest, it’s a bit… complicated. I’m here for a check-up before… a surgery. A cosmetic one. Though, I don’t recall all the specifics, unfortunately. My memory hasn't been the best lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Vodzak is correct. And please, call me Gara. That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It's not uncommon to feel a little foggy around details, especially with something you're planning for. We can certainly work through it together. So, you said a cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery you are scheduled for?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it has something to do with… my face? Perhaps my nose? Or… cheeks? It wasn’t a major operation, I don’t think. My late husband… he arranged everything. He said it was something I’d always wanted, but truthfully, I don’t have a strong recollection. I apologize for being so vague. It feels… frustrating, not knowing. Is that alright? Will this affect things?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright. It's actually quite common for patients to have some memory gaps, especially when dealing with procedures planned by someone else. We'll take our time and piece things together. Knowing it involves your face is a good start. Let's try to narrow it down. Do you recall why your husband thought you might want this surgery?
PATIENT: He… he always said I deserved to feel beautiful. He used to talk about… restoring a youthful appearance? Or something like that. He worried about lines, I think. And… symmetry? He was very particular about symmetry. I’m terribly sorry, Doctor. This is proving… difficult. I feel as though I’m grasping at smoke. Perhaps if you told me what I'm scheduled for, it would jog my memory?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Brightful. It's alright, we can definitely try another approach. Let me access your EHR information. Ah, here we are. It appears you are scheduled for a rhinoplasty and bilateral cheek augmentation with fat grafting on August 15th. Does that sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: Rhinoplasty… that’s a nose job, isn’t it? And augmentation… adding something? Fat grafting… taking fat from somewhere else? That… that does sound slightly more familiar. My husband did mention wanting to improve the shape of my nose. And he talked about… plumping my cheeks? He said I was losing volume. Yes… yes, I think that’s right. It’s all coming back in fragments. Thank goodness. Is that a big surgery, Doctor? I feel a little anxious just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct – rhinoplasty is a nose job, and augmentation involves adding volume. Fat grafting is a good way to achieve a natural look. It's not considered a major surgery, Ms. Brightful, but it is still a surgical procedure, so there are inherent risks, as with any surgery. It’s typically performed under general anesthesia. We'll discuss those risks in detail, of course. Before we get to that, though, let's get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. General anesthesia… that sounds a little frightening. But if you think it's safe, Doctor, I trust your judgment. Significant medical conditions… hmm. I had… a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but that was easily treated with antibiotics. And… I’ve always had slightly high blood pressure, but it’s well-managed with medication. I take Lisinopril, I believe. Oh, and I have seasonal allergies, terribly bad in the spring. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else comes to mind. Is that enough information? I’m sorry if I’m forgetting something.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Brightful. Pneumonia, managed blood pressure with Lisinopril, and seasonal allergies – good to know. And don’t worry about forgetting things; we’ll get through everything together. Just to confirm, are you currently experiencing any symptoms related to your allergies?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not at the moment, Doctor. It’s been fairly dry lately, which has helped immensely. Usually, I’m sneezing and congested constantly in the spring, but it’s been quiet this year. Although… now that you mention it, my nose has been a little stuffy the past few days. Very mild, barely noticeable. I just assumed it was the air conditioning. Is that something I should be concerned about, considering the surgery?
DOCTOR: It’s good that it’s mild, but it is worth noting, especially with the surgery approaching. A stuffy nose could indicate a cold or a minor sinus issue, and we want to minimize any risk of infection. Let's do a quick nasal exam to take a look. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s best to be cautious. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I’m rather anxious about anything delaying the surgery. My husband… well, he put a lot of effort into arranging this. Please, go ahead, Doctor. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It will be quick and painless. I’m just looking to check for any inflammation or blockage. Alright, Ms. Brightful. I do see a bit of mild swelling and some congestion inside your nasal passages. Nothing alarming, but enough to suggest a slight upper respiratory irritation. Your mucous membranes are also a little inflamed. It could be a very early cold, or simply irritation from the air conditioning, as you suspected. Let's listen to your lungs as well, just to be thorough. Your lung sounds are clear. No wheezing or crackles. But given the nasal congestion, I'd recommend postponing the surgery by one week to allow everything to clear up. Would that be possible?
PATIENT: Oh. One week… That’s… not ideal. My husband already booked the recovery house, and the surgeon has limited availability. But… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. I wouldn't want to risk complications. Yes. Yes, postponing for one week is… acceptable. It will be a bit of a hassle rearranging things, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. What do I need to do in the meantime? Should I take anything to help clear up the congestion? I have some over-the-counter decongestants at home. Would those be alright?
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible decision, Ms. Brightful. It's always best to be cautious. And rearranging things is worth it if it ensures a smoother recovery. As for the congestion, I would recommend against using over-the-counter decongestants right now. They can sometimes interact with anesthesia, and we want to avoid anything that could complicate the procedure. Instead, I suggest saline nasal sprays several times a day to keep your nasal passages moist. Warm showers and plenty of fluids are also helpful. If the congestion worsens or you develop a fever, please contact me immediately. In the meantime, let's also review your current medications. You mentioned Lisinopril for blood pressure. What dosage are you taking?
PATIENT: Saline nasal sprays… warm showers… and fluids. Alright, I can definitely manage that. No decongestants. I understand. Lisinopril… let me see… Ah, here it is. Ten milligrams, once daily. I take it every morning with breakfast. Is there anything else you need to know about my medications, Doctor? I apologize for being so forgetful. It’s terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ten milligrams, once daily. That’s good to know. And don't apologize, Ms. Brightful, it's perfectly alright. It’s important to be thorough, and I'm happy to help you piece everything together. Lisinopril is generally safe to continue before surgery, but we'll need to inform the anesthesiologist of the dosage. Now, let’s discuss your allergies. What specifically are you allergic to?
PATIENT: Oh, my allergies… that’s a long list, I’m afraid. Mostly pollen, I think. Trees, grasses, weeds… the usual springtime suspects. I also have a mild sensitivity to dust mites, and sometimes cats. I don’t have any severe allergies, thankfully. I don’t carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I just get terribly congested, runny nose, itchy eyes… the typical symptoms. I usually manage it with over-the-counter antihistamines, but I haven’t needed to take anything yet this year. Will my allergies affect the surgery, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Brightful, your allergies shouldn’t significantly affect the surgery, as long as they're well-managed. However, it's important to keep them under control before the procedure to minimize any potential for swelling or complications. Since you usually manage your allergies with over-the-counter antihistamines, it’s perfectly fine to continue taking those as needed, unless they contain decongestants. We've already discussed avoiding those. Now, before we finalize everything, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, Doctor, not at all. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that's it. And definitely no recreational drugs. My late husband… he wasn’t a fan of those, and I tend to agree with him. I’m a very… moderate person, Doctor. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book. Is that alright? I hope that’s a satisfactory answer.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Brightful. Thank you for being so open with me. It's good to know you have a healthy lifestyle. Alright, I think we've covered everything for now. To recap, we're postponing your rhinoplasty and cheek augmentation by one week to allow your mild congestion to clear up. Continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed and manage your allergies with over-the-counter antihistamines as needed – avoiding decongestants. I'll send a message to the surgeon and the anesthesiologist to inform them of the postponement and your current medications. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… perfectly organized, Doctor. Thank you so much for being so thorough and understanding. Hmm… let me see. Just one thing. What can I expect on the day of the surgery? Will I need someone to drive me home? And how long is the recovery process expected to last? I’m a little anxious about the pain afterwards. I apologize for asking so many questions. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Brightful. It's good to be informed, and I'm happy to answer anything you’re concerned about. On the day of the surgery, you'll need to arrive at the surgical center two hours before your scheduled procedure time. You'll meet with the surgeon again to review the details, and the anesthesiologist will discuss the anesthesia. You’ll also be asked to sign some final consent forms. Yes, you absolutely will need someone to drive you home, as you'll be under anesthesia and won't be able to drive safely. And you'll need someone to stay with you for the first 24-48 hours, as well. As for the recovery process, you can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort for the first week or two. I'll prescribe you pain medication to manage any discomfort. The majority of the swelling will subside within a few weeks, but it can take several months for the final results to become fully apparent. I'll provide you with detailed post-operative instructions, including wound care, medication schedule, and activity restrictions. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment one week after the surgery to monitor your progress. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: That… that sounds manageable, thankfully. A week of discomfort… I can handle that. And having someone stay with me is not a problem. My niece is very kind and has offered to help. Hmm… I believe that covers everything. You have been incredibly helpful, Doctor Vodzak. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate it. I suppose this concludes our consultation?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. And it's good to hear you have support from your niece. Yes, I believe we have covered everything for now. If anything unexpected arises before the surgery, please don't hesitate to contact my office. We look forward to seeing you next week. Have a restful week, and please take care.
