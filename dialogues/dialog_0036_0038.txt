DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bacy. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I… believe I need some forms prepared, regarding future medical care. Something to do with… what happens if I’m unable to make decisions myself. I think it’s called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to get this sorted, but I’m a little hazy on the details, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very responsible of you to think ahead and get this sorted. Advance Care Planning is important. You’re right, an Advance Directive – sometimes called a Living Will – and a POLST form are both options. Let’s clarify what each one does, and see which best suits your needs. First, do you have a primary care physician already?
PATIENT: A primary care physician… I… believe so. Yes. Though, I haven’t seen them in quite some time. I… Dr. Chen, perhaps? It’s… difficult to recall the specifics. I moved here a few years ago, and things… blurred a bit. Do you… have a way to check, perhaps? I wouldn’t want to give you the wrong information.
DOCTOR: Let me see what I can find. Okay, I see a Dr. Jian Chen listed. He’s about an hour away, in Willow Creek. Is that the correct Dr. Chen?
PATIENT: Willow Creek… yes, that sounds right. Dr. Jian Chen. Yes, that is him. Thank you for looking that up. My memory isn’t what it used to be, unfortunately. It's… frustrating. So, about these forms… what exactly is the difference between them? And which one would be… most beneficial, given my… situation?
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Evann. It’s common to feel a little overwhelmed by all the medical terminology. Essentially, an Advance Directive is a broad document outlining your wishes for future medical care, generally for situations where you can’t communicate those wishes but are not in an immediate life-or-death crisis. It covers things like what kind of treatments you want, or don't want, if you become seriously ill. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific medical order, usually for people with a serious illness or frailty. It’s based on your current wishes and is a direct order to healthcare providers about things like CPR, intubation, or artificial nutrition. It’s used when you are facing a medical crisis. Given you’re thinking about future planning, but aren’t currently facing an immediate health concern, starting with an Advance Directive might be the best approach. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: That… clarifies things somewhat, thank you. So, the POLST form is for… right now, if something were to happen, whereas the Advance Directive is… more long-term? It sounds as though the Advance Directive is the better choice, given my… circumstances. I’m not currently ill, and I’m hoping to plan for the future, rather than react to a crisis. But, if I understand correctly, I could potentially get both done? Would that be… advisable?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You've got it. And yes, you absolutely can have both done. Many people choose to do both, actually. The POLST form would essentially be a more specific extension of your Advance Directive. It's a bit redundant, but it ensures your wishes are very clear to emergency medical personnel if you were to become suddenly ill. We can start with the Advance Directive today, and if you’d like, we can discuss the POLST form at a later appointment. It involves a more in-depth conversation about your specific medical goals and preferences. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds reasonable. Starting with the Advance Directive feels like the logical step, yes. And discussing the POLST form later, once I have a better understanding of everything… that seems wise. Thank you for explaining it so clearly, Doctor. It’s a relief to finally have some clarity on the matter. Where do we begin?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. I’m glad I could help. Alright, so the Advance Directive form has several sections. First, we need to appoint a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… yes. That’s… important, isn’t it? My sister, I think. Her name is… Baatar. Baatar Buoniconti. She lives in… Ulaanbaatar, in Mongolia. It’s… a long distance, I realize. But she’s… the only person I truly trust with something so important. Would that… be acceptable? I can provide her contact information, if necessary.
DOCTOR: Baatar is a perfectly acceptable choice, Evann. Distance isn’t necessarily a barrier, as long as we have her current contact information. We’ll need her name, address, phone number, and email address. And it's important that she's aware you've designated her as your healthcare proxy, and willing to take on that responsibility. While we gather that information, I also want to ask you about your values and wishes regarding medical care. Specifically, are there any treatments you would definitely want, or definitely not want, even if your doctors recommend them?
PATIENT: Values… wishes… It’s… difficult to articulate. I… believe in respecting the natural course of things, if that makes sense. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. Prolonging suffering… that wouldn’t be my wish. No aggressive measures, if there’s no chance of a meaningful recovery. Comfort care… that’s what I would prefer. And… I would want my sister to be informed, at every step. She understands me… better than anyone. Is that… clear enough? I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very clear, Evann. You’ve articulated your wishes beautifully. “No aggressive measures if there’s no chance of a meaningful recovery” and a focus on comfort care—that's excellent information for your healthcare proxy and your medical team. And absolutely, we will ensure Baatar is kept informed every step of the way. Now, the form also asks about specific treatments—things like CPR, mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and dialysis. Do you have any particular preferences regarding those treatments, or would you like me to explain them in more detail?
PATIENT: Those… sound rather… intense. I confess, I don’t fully understand them. Perhaps you could explain them briefly? I… I wouldn't want to make a decision without knowing what I'm agreeing to. I apologize for being so… ignorant. My medical knowledge is… limited, to say the least.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Evann. It’s perfectly normal to not be familiar with all the medical terminology. That's what I'm here for. Let's go through them one by one. CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – is a procedure used to try and restart your heart if it stops beating. It involves chest compressions and rescue breathing. Mechanical ventilation is a machine that helps you breathe if you’re unable to breathe on your own. It involves inserting a tube into your airway. Artificial nutrition means receiving food and fluids through a tube, if you’re unable to eat or drink on your own. Dialysis is a procedure that cleans your blood if your kidneys are failing. For each of those, you can indicate if you want them performed, if you don’t want them performed, or if you want Baatar to make the decision if you’re unable to. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that clarifies things somewhat. It all sounds… rather invasive. I think… I would not want CPR if there was no realistic chance of recovery. And I would definitely not want mechanical ventilation or artificial nutrition in that scenario either. I believe it’s important to let nature take its course, in those circumstances. And I would trust Baatar to make the best decision, if the situation was… unclear. Would that be acceptable? It’s… a difficult topic, I realize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly acceptable, Evann. And it’s very thoughtful of you to consider these difficult questions. You've clearly given this a lot of thought. So, to confirm, you are declining CPR, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition if there is no realistic chance of recovery, and you’re designating Baatar as your healthcare proxy to make decisions in situations where the outcome is uncertain. There are a few other sections here regarding your religious or spiritual beliefs, and any other specific wishes you’d like to document. Would you like me to go over those with you, or are you comfortable with the information we’ve already discussed?
PATIENT: Religious… beliefs… No, I don't have any strong preferences regarding that. And… no, I don't think there's anything else I need to document at this time. I believe we've covered everything that's important. Thank you for being so patient and understanding, Doctor. It’s… a relief to finally have this sorted. What happens next? Will I receive a copy of this document?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I’m glad we were able to get this sorted. Here are two copies of the Advance Directive. One is for your records, and one will be placed in your medical file. We will also send a copy to your primary care physician, Dr. Chen, and we can forward one to Baatar if you'd like. It’s important to keep your copy in a safe place and let your loved ones know where it is. Also, it’s a good idea to review this document periodically, or if your wishes change. Now, as we discussed, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss a POLST form if you’d like. Or, we can simply revisit the topic at a future appointment. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… very reassuring. I believe I’ll… hold off on the POLST form for now. I want to… digest this information first, and perhaps discuss it with my sister. I apologize for being so… indecisive. I just want to… make sure I’m making the right decisions. But thank you again, Doctor Bacy. You’ve been incredibly helpful. I think… I’m all set for today. .
DOCTOR: You’re not being indecisive at all, Evann. It’s perfectly reasonable to take your time and consider all your options. That’s what responsible healthcare planning is all about. I'm happy to answer any questions you have in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a good day.
