DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though I must say, a pleasure it is not, having to come here. It’s this foot, you see. A terrible sore. Been bothering me for weeks now. Really quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes, I understand. Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, longer than weeks, truthfully. Months, I'd wager. Since... well, since right after my husband passed, I think. Everything just sort of blurred together after that. It started small, a little cut, probably from stepping on something in the yard. But it hasn't healed. And now it’s…well, it’s a mess. A very unpleasant mess. I keep it bandaged, of course, but it just seems to get worse, not better.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a wound on your foot that began several months ago, following a minor injury, and has not improved despite bandaging. Do you recall where on your foot the injury occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I remember perfectly. Right on the top, near my little toe. I was tending to my hibiscus, you see. Beautiful flowers, but those leaves fall everywhere. Stepped right on a piece, I think. Though honestly, it could have been a pebble. Doesn’t matter what it was, it just won't heal. And it’s quite painful, you know. Especially when I try to wear shoes. I have a church social next week, and I haven’t a single pair that fits comfortably. It’s a real problem.
DOCTOR: Right, top of the foot near the little toe. And the pain is exacerbated by footwear. Has the pain been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Worse when I’m on my feet, naturally. And worse at night, I find. Keeps me up, it does. Though, truthfully, I haven’t been sleeping well since…well, you know. It’s a dull ache most of the time, but when I put pressure on it…then it’s a sharp, stinging pain. Quite unpleasant, really. I don’t understand why it won’t just go away. I’ve always been a strong woman. Never had much trouble with my health, until recently.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this wound?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Well, my legs have been feeling a bit…tingly, sometimes. And I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. More thirsty than usual, that is. And I seem to be going to the restroom a great deal. Though I suppose that could just be from drinking so much water. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not quite sure what’s associated with what anymore. Everything feels a bit…muddled, if you understand. I just want this foot to feel better. It’s distracting me from…things.
DOCTOR: Tingly legs, increased thirst, and frequent urination. Those are…noteworthy. Now, Ms. Cannington, I'm going to need to examine your foot. Please remove your shoe and sock so I can get a better look. I also need to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes or poor circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, diabetes… Well, Dr. Kahananui, my old doctor, he mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high a few years back. He wanted me to watch my diet, you know, less coconut cream pie. But I didn’t really pay much attention. I felt fine, and I don’t hold with all these…restrictions. As for circulation… I don’t know. I’ve always been warm-blooded, if that’s what you mean. Now, let me just… This shoe is a bit tight, you know. I really need to get a new pair.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat on the table. Hmm. It appears you have a rather significant wound, Ms. Cannington. There's some redness and swelling, and the odor suggests a possible infection. Your pulses are…weak, but present. I'm going to need to document this thoroughly. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, I knew it was bad. Honestly, Doctor, I could have told you that myself. Weak pulses…that doesn’t sound good. Medications…well, let me think. Just the water pill Dr. Kahananui prescribed for my swelling. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it flares up. The orange one, I believe. I can’t quite recall the name. My daughter usually handles all that, you know. She means well, but she fusses over me too much. She keeps telling me I need to be more careful, but I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve always taken care of myself. Still, this foot is a real nuisance. A real nuisance. And it smells, doesn’t it? I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but… It’s not very pleasant, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Water pill and something for arthritis. We’ll need to get a list from your daughter. Now, Ms. Cannington, given the appearance of the wound, the weak pulses, and the potential for infection, I'm going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar and assess your overall health. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. This could be a sign of a more serious condition, and we need to address it promptly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… an X-ray… Honestly, Doctor, all this sounds rather dramatic. I just have a sore foot! But… if you think it’s necessary. I suppose I trust your judgment. Though I do wish Dr. Kahananui were still around. He was a sensible man. Yes, alright. I understand. Do what you need to do. But please, be gentle. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. And I have a church social next week. I really would like to be able to go. Will these tests tell you if I can wear my good shoes? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: The tests will help us determine the cause of the wound and the best course of treatment, Ms. Cannington. Whether you can wear your “good shoes” is secondary. I'm entering the orders for the blood work and X-ray now. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw blood, and we’ll send you to radiology after that. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a broad-spectrum antibiotic to start immediately, assuming you have no known allergies to antibiotics. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. No, I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been stung in decades. And I get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? It’s just a little…tingling. No, I don’t have any serious allergies. But please, be careful with that antibiotic. I don’t want to end up with a stomach upset. I have a sensitive constitution, you know. And I really would like to feel better before next week. This social is very important to me. I promised Mrs. Alika I’d bring my coconut cream pie. It’s her favorite.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. I’ll note that. Here’s the prescription for the antibiotic. Take it as directed, and if you experience any stomach upset, contact my office immediately. The lab technician will be in shortly. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss a plan of action. Is there anything else right now before the technician arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And please, be gentle with the blood draw. I don’t like needles. I suppose I should call my daughter and tell her about this. She’ll be terribly worried. Always is. But truly, Doctor, I appreciate you seeing me. Even if all this is a bit…overwhelming. And please, remember the coconut cream pie. It’s very important.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll inform the technician to be as gentle as possible. Patient anxious regarding potential disruption to social plans and pie delivery. We’ll do our best, Ms. Cannington. Now, please, just try to relax. .
PATIENT: .
