DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Paulino, is it? Yes… well, it’s about this… clearance. For the… performance. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. They just said I needed a check-up. Something about making sure I'm still… able. I usher at the theater, mostly. And sometimes sell tickets. That’s what I do.
DOCTOR: A performance clearance, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Though I don’t perform, perform. I mean, I help others perform. Look, is there a form I need to fill out? I'm not good with remembering things, and I’d like to get this over with quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a standard form. But before we get to paperwork, let’s just clarify a few things to ensure I have a complete picture. You mentioned ushering and ticket sales… How long have you been doing this work?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Decades, I think? Maybe… thirty years? Something like that. It feels like forever, honestly. I’ve been at the Grand Majestic for… well, a very long time. It all blurs together after a while.
DOCTOR: Thirty years… That's considerable. And in those thirty years, have you experienced any changes in your overall health?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, I’m… older, naturally. A bit stiffer in the mornings. My knees aren’t what they used to be. But nothing… serious. I don’t think so. I try to keep moving, you know? All that walking around the theater. It keeps the blood flowing. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but it cleared up on its own. Honestly, I can't recall much else. It all feels… distant.
DOCTOR: A cough last winter… Do you recall if you had a fever, chest pain, or shortness of breath with that cough?
PATIENT: Fever… hmm. Possibly? I think I felt warm a couple of times, but I didn't take my temperature. I definitely didn’t have chest pain. Shortness of breath… not really. Just tired, mostly. Very tired. You know, I really don’t get sick often. A little sniffle now and then, but that's all. Is this important? Can we just get this clearance done? I have a show to get back to… well, not in, but to.
DOCTOR: It’s important to be thorough, Mr. Krahn. We need to ensure you are fit to perform your duties. Now, let's move on. Do you have any significant past medical problems?
PATIENT: Past medical problems… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. And… a broken arm, when I was very young. Fell out of a tree, I believe. Other than that… nothing that I can readily recall. My wife… my ex-wife… she always handled the doctor appointments and all the medical paperwork. I just… showed up. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about any surgeries beyond the tonsillectomy and broken arm?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. No surgeries that I'm aware of. Perhaps a mole removed once? It was small, and didn’t hurt. But that was a long time ago. Look, Doctor, is there a form I can fill out myself? I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I'm clearly not helping you much with this questioning. I'd rather just write everything down.
DOCTOR: Fine. Here. Fill this out as thoroughly as possible. It includes a section for medications, allergies, and family history. Take your time. We'll proceed once you've completed it.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's much better. Medications… allergies… family history… right. I’ll do my best. This might take a few minutes.
