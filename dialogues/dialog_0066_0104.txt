DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Condray, is it? My throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now, I suppose. I just need to know what it is and how to fix it, quickly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore throat. I understand you want to get this sorted out quickly, and we’ll do our best. “A little while now” is a bit vague – can you tell me roughly how long it's been bothering you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really keep track of such things. Maybe… a week? More? It’s not important. It just hurts when I swallow. Like sandpaper. Is that good enough? I really don't have time for a detailed history.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or so with a sandpaper-like pain when swallowing. Noted. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Like what? I haven’t been feeling sick, if that’s what you mean. Just… the throat. Maybe a little tired, but who isn’t tired these days? I work very hard. Are you asking if I have a fever or something? I haven't checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly just the throat pain and some fatigue. No fever that you're aware of. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, body aches, or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Doctor, really. No cough. No runny nose. I told you, I haven’t been sick. A little ache, maybe, in my bones sometimes, but that's just from the work, I assure you. Difficulty breathing? No. I can breathe perfectly fine, thank you very much. Is this going to take much longer? I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Alright, no cough, runny nose, or difficulty breathing. Just the sore throat and some fatigue with a possible mild body ache. Have you had any changes in your voice, like hoarseness?
PATIENT: My voice? No, it sounds… normal. Maybe a little rough when I talk for a long time, but that’s just because I have to explain things to people all day. I’m a hard worker, you know. It strains my voice. Is this important? Because honestly, I’m not sure why you need to know all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no noticeable voice change beyond some strain from talking. Have you noticed any white spots or redness in the back of your throat when you look in the mirror?
PATIENT: Look in my throat? Doctor, I don’t go sticking my head around looking at my throat! How would I even do that? And why would I? I’m here for you to look at it. I can tell you this: I’ve been drinking plenty of water. Does that matter? I really think I just need something to make the pain go away.
DOCTOR: You're right, you're here for me to look at it. Apologies, that was a silly question. Okay, let's take a look. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, but no white spots or anything concerningly large. Any pain when I press down here?
PATIENT: Yes! That hurts. A little. Not terrible, but… yes. See? I told you it hurt. What is it? Is it serious? I need to know if I can go back to work tomorrow. This is very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, there's some tenderness when I press on your throat. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, it seems most likely you have pharyngitis – basically, a sore throat, likely caused by a viral infection. It can sometimes be bacterial, but given you don’t have a fever, cough, or significant white spots, viral is more probable. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: A viral… what now? Look, Doctor, I don’t understand all these fancy words. Just tell me what I need to do to get better. And allergies? No. I've never had any problems with medicine. Now, what is this going to cost me? I don’t have health insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, pharyngitis is just a fancy way of saying sore throat. Most sore throats are caused by viruses, like a common cold. They usually get better on their own with rest and fluids. To help with the pain, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen – follow the dosage instructions on the bottle. Gargling with warm salt water can also help soothe your throat. Plenty of rest and fluids are important too. As for the cost, let me check with the front desk to see what the charge for the consultation is. It's $75 for today's visit.
PATIENT: $75… Fine. As long as I can go back to work tomorrow. I can’t afford to be off. Is there anything else? Because I really need to get going. I have very important things to do, and I’m wasting precious time here. I’m a very productive person, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a couple more quick things. Do you have any difficulty swallowing solid foods or liquids?
PATIENT: Doctor, I told you I have trouble when I swallow, because it hurts. But I can swallow. I ate breakfast this morning, didn’t I? I can manage. Look, are we done yet? I really do need to go. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant difficulty swallowing other than the pain. Okay, based on everything, it sounds like you have a typical viral pharyngitis. It should improve in a few days with rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relief. However, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or severe difficulty swallowing – please seek medical attention immediately. I'll give you a printed summary of these instructions. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I understand. Rest, fluids, pain relief. I can do that. And if it gets worse, I'll come back. Though I highly doubt I will. Thank you. Finally.
DOCTOR: Okay, take care, Tammie. And don't hesitate to reach out if you do need anything. .
