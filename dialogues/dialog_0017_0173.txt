DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Blim. Well, I've just been getting the chills, on and off, for a couple of days now. It's a bit annoying, really. Not a fever, just…cold.
DOCTOR: “Chills,” you say. And for how many days precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I’d say about three days now? Maybe four? It started kinda subtle, I didn’t really pay much attention at first, honestly. It’s been more noticeable the last couple of days, though.
DOCTOR: “Kinda subtle.” Right. And have you been monitoring your temperature at all?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I don't really have a thermometer at home, to be honest. I just feel cold, you know? Not burning up or anything, just…shivering sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Well, relying on subjective feelings isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Aslan. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying these… “chills”?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but I always am a bit tired. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… Just the cold shivers and feeling a bit worn out. I did feel a little nauseous yesterday morning, but that passed pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Nausea… fleetingly. Very well. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing chronic. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing serious ever, thankfully. I had a bad bout of the flu a couple of years ago, but that was it. Oh, and I had a really bad migraine last year, but that hasn't come back.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. Never needed any. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that just needed a cast. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Um, okay. My mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes, but he managed it pretty well with diet and exercise. My grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis, I think. That’s all I can really think of right now, honestly. It's not something we talk about much.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. I don't smoke at all. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once or twice a week, but that's it. And I've never touched drugs. I'm pretty healthy, generally. I eat well and try to get enough sleep, when I can.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I took some antibiotics for a sinus infection a few years back, and I didn't have any reaction to those. And I can take pretty much any painkiller without issue. I don't really like taking medication unless I have to, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick listen to your lungs and take your temperature. It would be beneficial to actually confirm your subjective feelings with some objective data. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear, bilaterally. No noticeable tenderness. Temperature is… 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Your vitals are unremarkable. Honestly, Ms. Aslan, you're presenting with very vague symptoms. It’s likely a mild viral illness. Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers if needed. That's my recommendation.
PATIENT: Okay… so, it’s probably just a bug then? Is there anything I should be looking out for? Like, if it gets worse, or anything? I just didn't want to ignore it, you know? It’s just… been dragging me down a bit.
DOCTOR: If you develop a high fever – over 101 Fahrenheit – shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe dehydration, then, then you should seek medical attention. But frankly, I suspect this will resolve on its own within a few days. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Aslan. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, no, I think that's everything. Thank you, Dr. Blim. I appreciate you seeing me. I'll keep an eye on it, like you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. Get well soon, Ms. Aslan.
