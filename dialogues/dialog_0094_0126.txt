DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Right, well… I’ve just been awfully thirsty lately, and… oddly hungry too. It feels like I’m constantly drinking water and still feel parched, and I’m eating more than usual, but not gaining any weight, thankfully. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information to start with. Increased thirst and hunger over a few weeks… I understand. Can you tell me a little more about how much water you're drinking compared to your usual intake?
PATIENT: Well, normally I’d have… maybe two or three glasses of water a day? Just with meals, really. Now? I’m going through… I don't know… a large pitcher, easily. Perhaps two litres? It sounds ridiculous when I say it out loud. I’m constantly refilling it. And I find myself seeking out drinks even when I’m not particularly thirsty, just… wanting something to wet my mouth.
DOCTOR: Two litres is quite a bit more than usual, yes. And the constant feeling of needing to drink, even without actual thirst… alright. Are you noticing any other changes along with the thirst and increased appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not… not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I suppose I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to work, to be honest. Long hours. No, nothing else springs to mind. I haven’t been going to the toilet more often, if that’s what you’re asking. Not that I've noticed, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant change in urination… and fatigue that could be work-related. Let's talk a little bit more about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, for example?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. Aside from the usual childhood illnesses, nothing a doctor has ever needed to… diagnose, if that makes sense. No family history of diabetes that I’m aware of either. My parents were both… robust, shall we say. Never a sick day in their lives.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No personal or family history of diabetes is reassuring, but we still need to investigate the symptoms you're experiencing. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I avoid medication whenever possible, if I'm being honest. A bit of paracetamol now and then for a headache, that’s it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. Just… a strong cup of tea. Does that count?
DOCTOR: A strong cup of tea doesn't count, no. Alright, good. No medications or supplements. Finally, do you have any allergies to anything – food, medications, environmental factors?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, more or less, and never had a reaction. No issues with pollen, animals… nothing. I’m quite fortunate, really. I’ve always been able to eat whatever I like. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been trying much new lately. Work keeps me rather busy.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. No allergies, no medications, no significant past medical history... Okay, Christen, with your permission, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I’m quite happy to do whatever you think is necessary. The sooner we figure this out, the better, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Christen, everything seems normal so far. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your neurological exam is normal. However, given your symptoms of increased thirst and hunger, despite no weight gain, and the recent onset, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose level. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or other metabolic disorders. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough. Yes, please. If that’s what you recommend, I’m happy to go ahead with the tests. The sooner we get some answers, the better. I must admit, I’m a bit concerned, if I’m honest, but I’m glad you’re being so… diligent. Where do I go to have these tests done?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I am glad I can reassure you that we're being thorough. We'll draw the blood right here in the clinic. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. It will just be a standard blood draw, and it shouldn’t take long. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to drink water as you feel thirsty, but try to avoid sugary drinks. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… quite clear, actually. No, I don't believe I do. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and… investigate. I’ll just sit here and… wait for the phlebotomist, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll be right back after the phlebotomist has completed the blood draw to answer any questions you might have. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you feel unwell or have any concerns while you're waiting.
