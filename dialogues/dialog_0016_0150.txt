DOCTOR: Hi Angelle, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this, but my… well, it’s a long story. I want to have a baby. And I want it to be easy. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I’ve heard things… problems, difficulties. I want to avoid all of that if possible. Is that… is that what you help with?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Angelle. That's a very common concern, and definitely something we can explore together. Trying to conceive can feel overwhelming, and planning ahead is a really smart move. It's good you're thinking about this proactively. Let me pull up your chart here… Okay, Angelle Shteynberg, born… August 12th, 1974. Just confirming that's correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. August 12th. Though I don’t see why that’s relevant. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I exercise, I eat… reasonably well. I don’t smoke. What exactly are you trying to find with all this… data entry? It feels a bit… intrusive.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask, and I apologize if it feels intrusive. It's not about questioning your health, but about getting a complete picture. Knowing your medical history helps me understand any potential factors that could affect conception, or things we need to consider during pregnancy. It’s all confidential, of course. For example, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Goodness. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing a good rest and some chicken soup couldn’t fix. Divorced husband’s fault, probably. He brought something home. And honestly? That’s all I can think of. I’m a remarkably healthy woman. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child and a bout of the flu a few years ago. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Absolutely not. I avoid hospitals like the plague. Germs everywhere. And the food! Don't even get me started on the hospital food. I can assure you, I have never needed to be hospitalized. I am… was… married for twenty years, and not once did I end up in a hospital because of him. Are we getting somewhere with this, or are you just compiling a list of my life events?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Angelle. It feels like a lot of questions, and I apologize for that. It's important, though. Knowing your complete medical history, even things that seem unrelated, helps me ensure the safest possible path forward. We're trying to prevent potential issues, not just treat them if they arise. Let’s switch gears a bit. How about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What does my family have to do with anything? I’m the one who wants to get pregnant, not them. My mother had… well, she had a normal pregnancy, as far as I know. I was a perfectly healthy baby. My father… he was a doctor, actually. A very good one. But he's deceased. Is this going to become a genealogy project now? Honestly, I’m starting to regret this whole thing. I had hoped for a quick assessment, not an inquisition.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Angelle. It's not an inquisition, I promise. Family history can sometimes reveal potential genetic predispositions or inherited conditions that could affect conception or pregnancy. It’s about being as prepared as possible. If you’re not comfortable sharing, that's perfectly okay, but even a general idea can be helpful. For example, did either of your parents have any significant medical problems?
PATIENT: Significant? My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. Towards the end of her life. And my father… he worked with… chemicals, a lot of them. He developed some… breathing problems, later on. Nothing dramatic. He smoked, unfortunately. A terrible habit. Honestly, I really don't see how any of this applies to me. I am a sensible woman. I don’t do foolish things. This is wasting my time. Is there a way to just… get a checkup, determine if I'm "good to go", and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother and some breathing problems related to chemical exposure and smoking in your father. That's helpful, thank you. And you're right to be sensible. Let's talk about you right now. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I’m quite robust, actually. I can eat anything, take anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything in my life. Dust bothers me, a little, but that’s not an allergy, is it? It's just… dust. I keep a very clean house. Unlike some people I know. Are you writing all this down? It's rather… detailed. I swear, if you ask me about my childhood diet, I’m walking out.
DOCTOR: I am writing it all down, yes, it’s for your medical record and helps me build a complete picture. And no, I won't ask about your childhood diet! No known allergies – that's good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I take a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take… ibuprofen, I think it is. The blue one. That’s it. I don’t believe in relying on pills for everything. A good night’s sleep usually solves most problems. Honestly, I find this line of questioning rather… condescending. Are you implying I’m somehow unhealthy? Because I assure you, I am not.
DOCTOR: I’m absolutely not implying that you’re unhealthy, Angelle. I apologize if it feels that way. I’m just gathering information to ensure the safest possible outcome. Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and ibuprofen for headaches. Now, let's move on to some lifestyle questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Are you serious? I told you, I am a sensible woman. I do not partake in such… vulgar activities. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. A very small glass. And only on special occasions. My father would be appalled if I did anything else. Honestly, this is insulting. I thought doctors were supposed to be professionals, not… interrogators. I’m beginning to think I made a terrible mistake coming here. .
DOCTOR: Angelle, I sincerely apologize if I’ve offended you. That was not my intention at all. I understand your frustration and I promise I'll be more mindful of how I ask questions. It’s just that these details, even those that seem unimportant, can sometimes be relevant to your health. Before we completely stop, would you be open to a quick physical exam?
