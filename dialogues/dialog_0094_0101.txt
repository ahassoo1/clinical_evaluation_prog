DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Popova is the name, Aldine Popova. Lovely to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been gettin'. Right at the back of me head, mostly. Been botherin' me for a little while now, it has.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. A headache at the back of your head, that’s been bothering you for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It’s not a bad bad headache, you understand? More like a… a constant pressure. Like someone's sittin' on me skull, gently. And it comes and goes, nothin' regular about it. Some days it’s barely there, other days… well, other days I just feel a bit off, you know? Tired, mostly. And sometimes a bit dizzy, but that don’t last long.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A constant pressure, not a sharp pain, coming and going with some tiredness and occasional dizziness. When did you first start noticing this headache, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... It started... oh, must be 'bout three weeks ago, I reckon. Right 'round the time me wife and I went to visit me daughter in the country. Lovely place, but a bit of a drive, it was. I thought maybe it was just from the travel at first, but it’s still hangin' 'round.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about three weeks ago, around the time of your trip to visit your daughter. And it hasn't improved with rest?
PATIENT: No, not really. Restin' helps a little, but it always comes back. And it don't seem to matter what I'm doin'. Whether I'm sittin' still readin' me newspaper, or out in the garden tendin' to me tomatoes, it's just… there. Makes it hard to concentrate sometimes, especially when I'm doin' nails at the salon. You ever had a customer fidgetin' when you're tryin' to be precise? A headache don't help with that, lemme tell ya.
DOCTOR: No, I haven’t personally done nails, but I can certainly imagine how concentration is important! So, it's consistently there regardless of activity. Have you noticed anything that specifically makes it worse, or better, besides resting?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Now that you mention it, bright light seems to bother it a bit. Not like it causes it, but it definitely makes it more noticeable. And… oh, and stress. Workin’ at the salon, sometimes you get a real rush of customers, everyone wantin' somethin' at once. That always makes it worse. Not that I mind bein' busy, mind you. Just… stressful. I don't think nothin’ specifically makes it better, except maybe lyin' down in a quiet room. But that's not always possible, is it?
DOCTOR: Alright, so bright light and stress seem to exacerbate it, and quiet rest provides some relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Now that you ask… yeah, actually. I've been a bit more tired than usual, like I said, but also… me vision's been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, just… now and then. And I've been forgettin' things a bit more. Small things, mostly. Where I put me glasses, what I was just talkin' about… things like that. But I'm eighty-seven, Doctor! Forgetfulness comes with the territory, don’t it? I wouldn't have even mentioned it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You're right, some forgetfulness can be expected. But it's good you mentioned it. So, we have headache, tiredness, blurry vision, and some increased forgetfulness. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing, your balance, or any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No, no changes to me hearin'. Still hear me wife naggin' clear as a bell! Balance is alright, too. I still walk steady enough, though I don't move as fast as I used to. And no weakness in me arms or legs. I can still do me nails, can’t I? Takes a steady hand for that! No, nothin' like that at all. Just the headache and the little things I mentioned. It's just been botherin' me, that's all. Gettin' old ain't for the faint of heart, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Popova. And it’s good you’re able to still do your nails. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... High blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago, but he said it was just a little bit. Gave me some pills, I took 'em for a while, then he said I didn't need 'em anymore. Everything was alright after that. And no diabetes, no. Just the usual aches and pains that come with livin' a long life. I've never been a sickly man, really. Always been strong, always been workin'. Wife always tells me I work too hard, but what else is a man to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure in the past, but currently you're not taking any medication for it. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had the need for 'em, thankfully. Broke me arm once when I was a boy, fell out of a mango tree, but they just put it in a cast. That was a long time ago, though. Everything healed up just fine. Never been one for goin' under the knife, if I can help it. Prefer to keep me insides original, if you catch me drift.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Good question, Doctor. Me mother, she lived to be ninety-two, healthy as a horse right up 'til the end. Me father, he passed away when I was young, heart trouble, I think. And me wife’s mother, she had arthritis, real bad. Lots of pain, poor woman. As for siblings... I had a brother, but he passed away a few years back, cancer. No history of headaches, as far as I know. Everyone just got on with life, you know? Didn’t spend much time worryin’ about illnesses.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for that information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. Not a fan of takin' pills, as I said. I might take an aspirin now and then if I've got a real bad ache, but that's about it. And no supplements, either. I get me vitamins from me food, thank you very much. Good Jamaican food, best in the world, you know! Plenty of fruits and vegetables. Never needed nothin' extra. Just the occasional cup of strong tea, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, Doctor. Never had one in me life. I can eat anything, drink anything, breathe anything! Well, maybe not anything... but you get me drift. Never had a reaction to nothin'. Lucky, I suppose. Wife always says I'm too stubborn to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain't got nothin' to hide! Been a healthy man most of me life, as I said. Happy to let you have a look. Just try not to poke me too much, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Popova. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your heart rhythm is a bit irregular, but nothing immediately concerning. Your reflexes are a little slower than I’d expect, and your balance is a little unsteady, but this could be due to age or normal variation. I’m going to listen to your neck to check for any unusual sounds. I hear a slight bruit on the left side.
PATIENT: A bruit, you say? Never heard of that before. Is that bad, Doctor? Sounds serious. Me neck feels alright, though. Been workin' with me hands for years, always movin' me head around. Never felt no pain or discomfort. You sure that's somethin' to worry about?
DOCTOR: A bruit is just an unusual sound that can sometimes be heard with a stethoscope when listening to the arteries in your neck. It can indicate some narrowing of the artery, which can sometimes be a concern. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem, but it's something we need to investigate further. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, the irregular heart rhythm, the bruit, and your reported headaches, blurry vision, and some forgetfulness, I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, huh? Never had much luck with tests. Always seem to come back with somethin' wrong. But I suppose if you think it's best, Doctor, I'll go along with it. What kind of tests are we talkin' about? And will they be painful? I don't do well with needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Popova. We'll try to make it as comfortable as possible. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid function. We'll also do an electrocardiogram to get a better look at your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like you to have a carotid ultrasound to assess the blood flow in your neck arteries, which will help us determine the significance of the bruit I heard. The blood tests will involve a small needle stick, but it’s usually quick and relatively painless. The ECG is painless—we just attach some sticky pads to your chest. And the carotid ultrasound is completely non-invasive—it just involves using a probe on your neck. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… sounds… a lot, but if you say it’s necessary, Doctor, I’ll do it. Sticky pads I can handle, and a little needle stick I suppose I can survive. Ultrasound sounds alright too, as long as it don’t involve any pokin’. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And please, explain everything to me before you do it. I don’t like surprises. When can I get these tests done? And will I need a ride? Me wife usually does the drivin’, and I don’t want to bother her if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Popova. I'll explain everything thoroughly before each test, and we'll take it at your pace. And I completely understand your concerns about surprises. We can schedule the blood tests and ECG for tomorrow morning at the clinic. They usually take about an hour. The carotid ultrasound can be scheduled for later in the week at the imaging center across the street. As for transportation, you will need a ride for the ultrasound, as it's at a separate location. Do you have anyone who can drive you?
PATIENT: Well, me daughter, Sarah, she lives close by. She might be able to take me. Let me give her a call and see. She’s always been a good girl, Sarah. Always lookin' out for me. If she can’t, I suppose I’ll have to ask me wife. She gets a bit… flustered when she has to drive in traffic, though. So, tomorrow morning for the blood tests and ECG, you said? What time should I come in? And is there anything I need to do to prepare? Should I eat breakfast?
DOCTOR: Yes, tomorrow morning for the blood tests and ECG. Please come in at 9:00 AM. You can have a normal breakfast, but avoid anything too heavy or sugary. And please bring a list of any medications or supplements you've taken in the past, even if you're not currently taking them. I’ll also have my nurse, Maria, give you some paperwork to fill out before the tests. While we're waiting for the test results, I’d like you to monitor your blood pressure at home if you have a cuff. If not, that’s okay, we'll check it at the clinic during your follow-up appointment. And please let me know immediately if you experience any new symptoms, such as severe headache, dizziness, weakness, or vision changes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright… that sounds… manageable. Nine o’clock tomorrow, normal breakfast, bring a list of old pills. And check me blood pressure, if I can get hold of a cuff. Me wife might have one somewhere. I’ll ask her. And let you know if anything gets worse. You’re a good Doctor, you know. Very thorough. Makes an old man feel a little bit better, just knowin' you're lookin' after him. Right then… I suppose I'll head home and tell me wife all about this. Thank you, Doctor Gegan. And thank you for bein' so patient with an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before tomorrow. Get some rest, and I’ll see you then. Have a good day, Mr. Popova.
