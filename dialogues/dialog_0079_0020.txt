DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is... is Gonzalezperez, yes? It is nice to meet you too. Well, I am here for this... this phone visit. The one the nice lady on the telephone set up for me. I do not feel very well, but it is nothing too serious, I think. Just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, Gonzalezperez is correct. Though we are meeting in person today, it seems there was a prior arrangement for a telephone consultation. Regardless, I assure you, we will address your concerns thoroughly. To best understand what’s been troubling you, could you describe what is making you feel unwell?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I see. Perhaps I forgot. It is… it is my back. It hurts a lot, mostly when I stand for too long. I work with cars, you see. It is... it is hard work. And sometimes, it goes down my leg a little bit. Not all the time, but when I move wrong. It is a dull ache, not a sharp pain. Mostly just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. Back pain, exacerbated by standing and physical labor… radiating down the leg, and described as a dull ache. And it occurs intermittently, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Inter... inter-mittently. Is that right? Yes, that is a good word. It does not hurt all the time. Sometimes I wake up and it is okay, and then if I bend too much or lift something heavy at the shop… it starts. And it gets worse as the day goes on, usually.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. It comes and goes, you see? But… I think it started getting bad maybe… six months ago? Before that, it was just a little bit, after a long day. But six months ago, it really started to bother me. It was after I helped my neighbor with his truck, a very heavy truck. I think that did it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Six months of progressively worsening back pain, onset following a heavy lifting incident. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No, not really. I feel… tired, sometimes. But I work long hours, so that is normal, yes? My legs feel a little… weak sometimes, but I always think that is just from standing all day. No numbness, no tingling, no… what do you call it… shooting pains? Just the ache. And the tiredness. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Fatigue is always relevant, Ms. Benites. Thank you for mentioning that. And no numbness, tingling, or shooting pain radiating down your legs – that's good to know. Now, could you describe your occupation in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am a mechanic. I fix cars. I own a small shop in town, very small. I do everything… oil changes, brakes, engines… everything. It is hard work. I am on my feet all day, bending, lifting, sometimes crawling under cars. It is… it is a good job, but it is hard on the body. I have been doing it for thirty years.
DOCTOR: Thirty years is a significant commitment, Ms. Benites. And it sounds like a physically strenuous one. Have you had any previous injuries to your back?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes. When I was young, maybe twenty years old, I lifted a very heavy engine without using my legs correctly. It hurt very bad then, but it went away after a few weeks. I never thought much of it after that. Just a little bit sore sometimes after a long day. But this… this is different. This is more constant. And it goes down my leg.
DOCTOR: I see. A previous injury to your back, twenty years ago, now with a recurrence of pain six months ago, accompanied by leg pain. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of back problems, arthritis, or similar conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her hips when she got older. She needed a new hip, eventually. My father… he just got old, I think. He was always very active, but he did not have any trouble with his back. My brother… no, I do not think so. He is very healthy, still works on his farm. Arthritis… perhaps my grandmother had it in her hands, but I do not really know for sure. She lived far away. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Benites, thank you. And finally, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement, the nice lady at the pharmacy said I should. For the bones. And… that is it. No other medications. Allergies… no, I do not have any allergies. Not to food, not to medicine, nothing. I have never had a reaction to anything. I do have Medicare, if that is important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Benites. No current medications except for vitamin D, no known allergies, and you are covered by Medicare. Thank you for providing that information. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your back and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what is wrong, and what can be done about it. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you would please lie down on the examination table, face up. We will start with some basic range of motion tests. I will be palpating your spine and surrounding muscles as well, so please let me know if anything is particularly tender or painful. Okay, Ms. Benites, can you point your toes up and down?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Like this? Is that good? It feels a little stiff, but I can do it. It is a little bit uncomfortable when I bend my back like that. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is good. And you are correct, there is a bit of discomfort with forward flexion. Now, I am going to gently feel along your spine. Please tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness in a specific area. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: No… not yet. Just feels normal. Like… like pressing on bone, yes? A little bit sore, maybe, lower down, but nothing too bad. It is just… always a little bit sore there. I think. It is hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, and how about here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that one! That hurts. That is where it always hurts. It is tender… very tender. Does that mean something is wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, that localized tenderness is certainly significant, Ms. Benites. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in your legs. Please keep your legs relaxed. Okay, and your reflexes are… diminished bilaterally. Now, let’s assess your muscle strength. Please try to push your heel down against my hand. Don’t push too hard, just resist my force.
PATIENT: Okay, I am trying. It is hard to push… my leg feels… tired. And weak, yes? Is that bad? I am trying my best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites, you are doing very well. And it is good you are communicating that you feel some fatigue. Now, let’s try raising each leg up, keeping it straight. Okay, stop there. That causes pain, correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Oh, yes, that brings the pain down my leg. Just like when I bend over. It is the same pain. It shoots down the back of my leg. Is that… is that the nerve? The one that goes down my leg? It hurts. I do not like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Benites. Based on the examination findings – the localized tenderness, diminished reflexes, weakness, and the radiating pain with the straight leg raise – it is highly suggestive of sciatic nerve impingement, likely due to a lumbar disc issue. Now, to confirm this, and to rule out any other potential causes, I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: An MRI? What is that? Is it… is it safe? I do not like being closed in, Doctor. And what will it show? Will it tell us what is wrong? And… will it fix me? I am just worried. I want to know what is happening, but I do not want anything scary.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Benites. It is perfectly understandable to be apprehensive. An MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is a non-invasive imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the structures within your spine, including the discs, nerves, and muscles. It does not use any radiation, and it is generally very safe. You will lie on a table that slides into a large, open cylinder. It can be a little bit confined, I understand your concern about that, and we can discuss options to help you feel more comfortable if you decide to proceed. It doesn’t hurt, but you need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. The MRI will help us visualize exactly what is compressing your sciatic nerve, whether it's a bulging or herniated disc, or another issue. Knowing the specific cause will allow us to determine the best course of treatment. It won’t fix the problem immediately, but it will provide us with the information we need to create a plan to alleviate your pain and improve your function. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I think so. So it will show what is pushing on the nerve? And then you can see what to do? But… what if it is something bad? What if I need surgery? I do not want surgery, Doctor. I am old, I do not want to go through all of that.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the possibility of surgery, Ms. Benites. And I want to assure you, surgery is always the last resort. The vast majority of patients with sciatic nerve impingement improve with conservative treatment – things like physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. The MRI will help us determine the severity of the impingement and whether surgery is even necessary. If it's a mild to moderate case, we can often manage it effectively without surgery. We will discuss all of your options in detail before making any decisions, and I will never recommend a procedure unless it is absolutely necessary. Would you like me to order the MRI for you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, order it. I want to know what is wrong. But… can you give me something for the pain while I wait for the results? It hurts, Doctor. And… will the lady on the telephone call me to schedule it? I do not want to have to remember all of this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Benites. I will write a prescription for a mild pain reliever, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, to help manage your discomfort while you await the MRI results. It should help reduce the inflammation and ease the pain. And yes, the scheduling department will contact you directly to arrange the MRI. You won't need to worry about remembering the details. They will explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Here is the prescription. The pharmacy is just down the street, if you need to fill it right away. So, to recap: I've prescribed pain medication, ordered an MRI to determine the cause of your sciatica, and the scheduling department will contact you to arrange the appointment. Once we have the MRI results, we'll discuss all of your treatment options in detail. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I am still worried, but… I feel a little bit better knowing what is happening. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Benites. It is my pleasure to help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your MRI appointment. We are here to support you. Get some rest, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results. .
