DOCTOR: Hi Deloris, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Yes, well, it's about this… letter. For a pet, you see. A little something they need for… somewhere. Honestly, all this paperwork! It’s just… a bother, really. I can’t quite recall why I need it, but it has to do with a… a fluffy thing. Is that enough for starters?
DOCTOR: Okay… a letter for a pet. Right. And you're not sure what the letter is for exactly?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It’s one of those things… my ex-husband, he usually handles all this. Said something about rules, and… a boarding place? Or maybe travel? It's all a bit of a blur. I just need a doctor to sign something, don't I? It shouldn't be that complicated. He made it sound like a simple formality. Honestly, men and their… requirements.
DOCTOR: Okay. So it is related to travel or boarding for a pet. Do you know what kind of pet it is?
PATIENT: A… a dog, I think. Yes, a fluffy, little dog. A white one. Or maybe cream-colored? Oh, dear, it’s awful how the details escape me. He picked it out, you see. I just… provide the… affection. And occasionally the paperwork, apparently. It’s small, though. Very small. Not one of those… yappy ones, I hope.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me see if I can pull up any records for you… Do you happen to know the dog’s name?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The name… Now, don't tell me I’ve forgotten the poor thing’s name! He’s terribly fond of giving things… grand names. Something… French, perhaps? Or Italian? No… I truly can’t recall. Honestly, he’s the one with the memory for these things. It started with a 'B', I think. Barnaby? No, that doesn't sound right. Oh, this is just dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m not seeing any records for you, Deloris, or any pets associated with your name. Do you have the actual letter with you?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Yes, yes, I do. Somewhere... Here we are! It’s a bit of a mess, I apologize. Ex-husband, you know. Always leaving things to the last minute. Hopefully, that will jog your memory as well. It's all rather official-looking, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, this is a health certificate for international travel… for a Bichon Frise named Beau. It needs to be signed stating he’s healthy enough to fly. It's for travel to Nigeria. Do you remember Beau traveling to Nigeria?
PATIENT: Nigeria? Oh! Yes, yes, that rings a bell now. My sister, she lives in Lagos. He's going to visit her! That's right, Beau is going to stay with Auntie Ijeoma. Such a kind woman. But honestly, I didn’t arrange any of this. My ex, he’s always sending Beau back and forth. A bit disruptive, if you ask me. But Nigeria… yes, that makes sense now. So, you just need to sign that he’s… fit to fly?
DOCTOR: Okay. To properly complete this certificate, I need to perform a brief physical exam on Beau, just to confirm he’s healthy enough for travel. Has Beau been seen by a veterinarian recently?
PATIENT: A veterinarian? Well… I suppose he has. My ex is very particular about Beau’s… upkeep. He probably takes him to that fancy place downtown. The one with the… aromatherapy. Honestly, I haven’t a clue when he last went. He usually handles all of that too. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, he looks perfectly healthy, doesn't he?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Deloris. This is a legal document for international travel. It requires a veterinarian’s assessment to ensure Beau meets the health requirements for Nigeria. It protects him during travel, and ensures compliance with their import regulations. It won’t take long, just a quick check of his vital signs, eyes, ears, and a listen to his heart and lungs. Is Beau with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. He’s at home, I presume. My ex took him earlier. Said something about a… grooming appointment. Honestly, I haven’t seen him since breakfast. So, you mean I need to bring him here? That’s a bother, isn’t it? I was hoping we could just… sign something.
DOCTOR: Deloris, I understand your frustration, but I cannot legally sign this health certificate without examining Beau. It would be irresponsible, and potentially harmful to him during travel. You will need to schedule an appointment with a veterinarian—either your ex’s usual one, or another clinic—to have him assessed. Once they’ve completed the exam, and deemed him fit to fly, they can complete and sign the certificate. I can provide you with a list of local clinics if you’d like.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… inconvenient. Very inconvenient indeed. I suppose I’ll have to… speak to him. Yes, alright. A list of clinics would be… helpful. Though honestly, I have no idea what to look for. This is all rather a lot of trouble, you know. Just for a little dog. .
