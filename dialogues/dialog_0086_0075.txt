DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this tiredness. I keep falling asleep during the day, even though I’m using the machine they gave me for my sleep apnea. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I feel like I should be more rested.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Falling asleep despite using the CPAP machine… that is concerning. And unsettling, yes, I can understand that. Okay, let’s try to get a better picture of this. When did this increased tiredness start?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s been… oh, maybe three, four months now? It didn't happen right away when I started using the machine. I felt much better for a while, honestly. But then… gradually, this daytime sleepiness crept back in. It’s not like I’m nodding off constantly, but it's often enough to worry me. Especially when I'm just sitting and reading. You know, relaxing.
DOCTOR: Right, so it started after a period of improvement with the CPAP. That’s important. And it’s primarily when you’re relaxing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Not usually when I'm walking or doing things. It’s more… when I sit down to read, or watch a little television in the afternoon. Sometimes even just sitting at the table with a cup of coffee. It's just… a wave of sleepiness comes over me. It’s not like a struggle to stay awake, it just… happens. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how many hours of sleep are you getting at night, generally?
PATIENT: Well, that's a good question. I try to get to bed around ten, maybe ten-thirty. And I usually wake up around six, six-thirty. So, I suppose that's… seven or eight hours? But I do wake up a couple of times during the night, you know? Not every night, but often enough that it interrupts things. I don't think it's solid sleep, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: So, seven to eight hours in bed, but fragmented sleep. I see. And are you using the CPAP every night?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am. Every single night. I made sure of that after the technician showed me how to clean it and everything. It’s a bit of a nuisance, honestly, but I know I need it. I don't go anywhere without it. I even take it with me when I visit my daughter. It’s just… frustrating that it doesn't seem to be doing the job completely anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Good compliance, that's positive. Okay, let’s move on to other things. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, my wife used to say I snored terribly, but that's gone now with the machine, of course. I do feel a little… foggy sometimes, like my head isn’t quite clear. Not all the time, but more often in the afternoons. And… I’ve noticed I’m not as… enthusiastic about things as I used to be. Less interested in my hobbies, you know? I used to love gardening, but now… it feels like a chore sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Foggy thinking, reduced enthusiasm… okay. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. I’ve put on a few pounds in the last few months. Not a lot, maybe five or ten. It's probably just old age creeping up on me! I haven't been exercising as much either, now that I'm tired all the time, so that probably doesn't help. I used to walk every morning, but… it’s hard to motivate myself lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your appetite?
PATIENT: My appetite is… normal, I suppose. I haven't lost my appetite or anything. I still enjoy my food. My daughter makes a wonderful paella, you know. I always look forward to that. But... I do find myself craving sweets more often than I used to. Little things, you know? A cookie with my coffee, a piece of chocolate after dinner. Not a huge amount, but more than I used to.
DOCTOR: Right. Increased sweet cravings… Okay. Let's talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any medications, besides anything related to your sleep apnea?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Just the usual vitamins, you know, a multivitamin and some Vitamin D. The doctor recommended the Vitamin D a few years ago. But that’s it. No blood pressure medication, no diabetes pills, nothing like that. I pride myself on being healthy, or trying to be, anyway. It’s just this tiredness that’s got me worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. No medications, just vitamins. Good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your thyroid. Just standard things. Could you please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Go right ahead. I always try to be cooperative with the doctors. It’s the least I can do. I remember when the doctors used to make house calls… those were the days! But this is fine, of course. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. Thyroid is… slightly enlarged, and feels a little bit firm. I'm going to palpate your neck again. Hmm. It's subtle, but there’s definitely some enlargement and firmness. It wouldn’t explain everything, but it's something we need to investigate. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, thyroid panel, and a metabolic panel. We should also get a hemoglobin A1C to rule out diabetes.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Blood work… is that just a little prick in the arm? I don’t mind needles, really, but I always feel a little faint afterwards. Is there anything I should do to prepare for it? And… what exactly are we looking for with all these tests? You mentioned diabetes… is that a possibility?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little prick in the arm. And yes, we can have a nurse stay with you to make sure you don’t feel faint afterwards. We're looking for a number of things. The complete blood count will tell us if you have any anemia or infection. The thyroid panel will help us determine if your thyroid is functioning properly, which could be contributing to your fatigue. The metabolic panel will give us information about your kidney and liver function. And the hemoglobin A1C will tell us your average blood sugar level over the past three months, which is the best way to rule out diabetes. You mentioned your increased sweet cravings, and fatigue can be a symptom of diabetes, so we need to check that. It doesn’t mean you have diabetes, but it's important to rule it out. We're also going to do a vitamin D level, just to see where that’s at. It can sometimes contribute to fatigue as well. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. You’re very thorough. It's good to know what you're looking for. And yes, the nurse staying with me afterwards would be very kind, thank you. I do tend to get a little lightheaded sometimes. So, blood work, then? And then we wait for the results? I hope it’s nothing too serious. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Blood work, and then we wait for the results. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, and then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if your fatigue gets significantly worse, or you develop any other symptoms like chest pain or shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. The nurse will be right with you. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Paske. Let’s start with these tests.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate your help. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse, then.
