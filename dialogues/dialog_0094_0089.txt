DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. Oh, dear. It’s about my stomach, I suppose. It’s been… troubling me lately. Quite a bit of pain, down low. I do apologize, I’m not always the best at remembering details these days. I think it’s related to… well, the lupus. That's what my previous doctor said, at least.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph, that’s perfectly alright. We’ll take our time and get to the bottom of this. Lupus can certainly cause stomach issues, so that’s a good place to start. When you say “lately,” how long has this pain been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. “Lately…” That’s a tricky one. It comes and goes, you see. But… I’d say a few weeks, at least? Maybe a month? It’s hard to be precise. There are stretches where it’s barely noticeable, and then… well, then it really flares up. It feels like… a deep ache, mostly. And sometimes, cramping. I don’t recall if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Glymph. The coming and going pattern and the description of a deep ache with cramping gives us a better picture. Is the pain constant when it is present, or does it wax and wane throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely waxes and wanes. It’s rarely constant, thank goodness. It seems to be worse after I… eat, I think? Though sometimes it’s bad even on an empty stomach. It’s rather unpredictable, really. I’ve been trying to keep track, but my memory… isn't what it used to be. Is that alright? Is it important to know exactly when it happens?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. We'll work with what you can recall. It’s good you've noticed a possible connection with eating. Knowing it's worse after meals is helpful. To get a more complete picture, could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… a good question. I try to eat fairly healthily, I believe. Lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins… I enjoy fish quite a bit. And… well, I do indulge in a sweet treat now and then. A small piece of chocolate, perhaps. I don't drink a lot of… fizzy drinks, if that matters. I mostly have water. It’s all rather… unremarkable, I suppose. I don’t have any… unusual dietary restrictions, or anything.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very balanced diet, Ms. Glymph. No specific foods seem to trigger the pain more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s difficult to say. I haven’t really noticed a direct correlation. Sometimes, after a larger meal, it seems worse. But other times, it doesn’t seem to matter at all. I recall one instance after just a small salad, and it was particularly uncomfortable. It’s quite… frustrating, really. I wish I could pinpoint a cause.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Glymph. It’s often difficult to identify the exact cause of abdominal pain. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well… sometimes I feel a bit… bloated, you know? And… a little tired, though I’m always rather tired these days. It’s hard to say what’s related to the lupus and what isn’t, truthfully. I’ve also had a bit of… difficulty with my bowels, if you don't mind me saying so. Not consistently, but… changes in regularity.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t mind at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s important to tell me everything, and that’s perfectly normal to discuss. Changes in bowel habits are definitely good to know. Can you describe those changes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… sometimes constipated, and sometimes… the opposite. It varies. It's not… predictable, like everything else. And… occasionally, I’ve noticed a bit of… mucus. I apologize for being so… graphic. It’s just… I’m trying to recall everything you might need to know. I think there’s been no blood, though. I hope not.
DOCTOR: You’re not being graphic at all, Ms. Glymph, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. The constipation alternating with diarrhea, and the presence of mucus, are important details. No blood is good to hear. Now, thinking about your lupus, has it been well-controlled recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a difficult question. My previous doctor managed my medication, and I continued taking it as prescribed. But… I haven’t seen a doctor in a while, truthfully. So I’m not entirely sure if it’s still well-controlled. I do experience fatigue and some joint pain, but I always chalked that up to… aging. And the lupus, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. We’ll need to review your medication list and consider some bloodwork to assess your lupus activity. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Aside from lupus, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And… I've had the usual things, I suppose. A bit of high blood pressure, which is managed with medication. Nothing… major, really. I’ve never had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal, and I don't have any allergies to speak of.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. So, gallbladder removal and high blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s helpful. And no known allergies. Now, what medications are you currently taking, and what are the dosages?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I have quite a few. Let me see if I can recall. I take… lisinopril for the blood pressure, I believe it’s 20 milligrams daily. And then there’s… hydroxychloroquine for the lupus. I think it's 200 milligrams, twice a day. I also take a daily vitamin D supplement, and… sometimes, ibuprofen for the joint pain. But not regularly, just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph, that’s very helpful. Lisinopril 20mg, hydroxychloroquine 200mg twice daily, vitamin D, and ibuprofen as needed. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent changes to your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no changes recently. I’ve been on the same medications for quite some time now, as far as I recall. Doctor [Previous Doctor's Name] adjusted the dosages a while back, but nothing’s changed since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. Thank you for that information. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s another tricky one. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father had… heart problems, towards the end of his life. I don't recall any other… significant medical conditions in my family, truthfully. No history of… bowel problems, or anything like that. It's a rather… unremarkable family history, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. So, arthritis in your mother and heart problems in your father. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never have, never will. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And… definitely no recreational drugs. I believe in living a clean and healthy life.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. Thank you for sharing that. Now, finally, can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I seem to be repeating myself, aren't I? I did mention my diet earlier. I try to eat fairly healthily, lots of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins… fish, mostly. A little chocolate now and then. I drink mostly water. It's rather… unremarkable. Is that alright? Perhaps it would be helpful if I spoke to someone else about my diet?
DOCTOR: You're not repeating yourself, Ms. Glymph, and it's perfectly alright. I apologize if I seemed to be jumping around. It's just that gathering a thorough history is important. You've described a very healthy diet, and that's great. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for tenderness or any abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I apologize for being… a bit scattered today. My memory… isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Glymph. I’m listening to your abdomen now. I'm not hearing any abnormal sounds. And when I press on your abdomen……I do notice some tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Not severe, but it’s definitely there. It doesn't feel like there are any masses or anything concerning, but there is some discomfort when I press there. I also want to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Tenderness, you say? That explains the pain, I suppose. It's… comforting to know there's not something more serious, though. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it definitely the lupus, then? Or could it be something else?
DOCTOR: It’s good that it doesn't feel like anything acutely serious, Ms. Glymph. However, tenderness in your lower abdomen, with your history of lupus and the changes in your bowel habits, could indicate several possibilities. It could be related to lupus itself – lupus can cause inflammation in the digestive tract. It could also be something separate, like diverticulitis – an inflammation of small pouches in the colon – or even irritable bowel syndrome. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some bloodwork. This will help us assess your lupus activity, rule out infection, and check for inflammation. I’d also like to order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or bleeding. Depending on the results of those tests, we may need to consider further imaging, like a CT scan of your abdomen. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… comprehensive, Doctor. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Bloodwork and a stool test… and perhaps a CT scan if needed. I trust your judgment entirely. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you see. It's… unsettling, having this pain without knowing what’s causing it. When can I expect the results, Doctor? And will someone contact me, or should I contact them?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Glymph. It's always unsettling when you don't know what's causing pain. The bloodwork and stool test should take about 3-5 business days to come back. Our office will contact you directly with the results, either by phone or through our patient portal – whichever you prefer. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week after that, to discuss the results and decide on the next steps. If you haven't heard anything after 5 business days, please don’t hesitate to call the office to check on the status. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you develop a fever, nausea, vomiting, or any blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. 3-5 business days… and a follow-up appointment. I’ll be sure to contact the office if I haven’t heard anything. And I’ll go to the emergency room if my pain worsens, or if I experience any of those symptoms. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And your patience with my… forgetfulness. It’s a great comfort to have someone taking care of me. I believe that’s all I had, Doctor. Unless you have any further questions for me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm happy to help, and don’t worry about your memory – it's perfectly alright. We'll take things one step at a time. I think we've covered everything for now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the blood for the tests, and we'll get everything ordered. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, if your pain worsens, or you develop a fever, nausea, or blood in your stool, go to the emergency room. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Glymph.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for your kindness and care. Goodbye.
