DOCTOR: Hi Chirag, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I am… tired. Very tired. Not like normal tired after work, you understand? This is… inside tired. Like something is wrong in me. It’s been… a while now. Maybe two, three months? It makes everything hard. Even watching TV. My wife, she says I just need to rest more. But I am resting!
DOCTOR: Okay, "inside tired" – I understand. That's a really helpful way to describe it. And it’s good you’re recognizing this isn’t just normal fatigue. Two or three months is definitely long enough to warrant looking into it. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by "makes everything hard?
PATIENT: Hard… like… getting up. Like… thinking. Like… wanting to do things. I used to like my garden, you know? Beautiful flowers. Now… I look at it, and it feels… too much. And the work… the fabric, it needs attention. I used to enjoy it, making things nice. Now I just… sit. My wife, she does more and more. It's not fair to her.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating, Chirag, and it’s very thoughtful of you to be concerned about the impact on your wife. It's definitely not fair to her if you're struggling, and it's good you're acknowledging that. So, it sounds like this fatigue is impacting your daily life, your hobbies, even just your motivation. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… my stomach feels funny. Not sick, exactly. Just… heavy. And… maybe a little yellow? My wife says my eyes look… different. She’s always noticing things. I don't feel… hot, or cold, just… blah. No pain, really. Just… everything is slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, "funny" stomach, potentially some yellowness, and feeling “blah” – that’s helpful. Your wife noticing changes in your eyes is good information too. When you say "funny" stomach, could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: It’s… full. Even when I don't eat much. And… sometimes it feels… tight. Not like a cramp, just… pressure. Like a balloon. And it… makes me not want to eat. Not sick, but… not hungry. I used to enjoy my food, you know? Spicy things. Now, everything tastes… the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of fullness and pressure even with little food, loss of appetite, and changes in taste. That paints a clearer picture. Now, thinking about your overall health… have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. My wife does the weighing. I think… maybe less? She says I’m… thinner. I haven’t looked, honestly. I don’t pay attention to things like that. I just… feel tired. That's the biggest thing. Everything else… I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss, along with the fatigue. That's concerning, Chirag, and definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, old age, I suppose. No, seriously… the doctor, a long time ago, he said my liver… not good. Something about… too much. I don’t remember what. I stopped drinking the strong stuff after that. Maybe ten years ago? More? It was a long time ago. He said… watch it. That’s all I remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of liver issues, and you stopped drinking alcohol around ten years ago. That’s very important information, thank you. Do you recall the name of that doctor, or where you were seen?
PATIENT: No, I do not remember the name. It was… a clinic downtown, I think. A big building. A long wait every time. I do not like doctors. My wife, she usually remembers these things. She has a good memory. But I really only remember the doctor saying… liver. And stop the strong drink. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can work with that. It's good you stopped drinking after that advice. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never had any surgeries. I don’t like… being cut. Too much trouble. My wife, she had her appendix out a long time ago. But me? No. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she was always sick. Stomach problems, mostly. She died young. My father… strong man. Lived a long life. No problems. My sister… she has trouble with her heart, I think. But that’s all I know. We don’t talk much about health, you understand? It’s bad luck to talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of stomach problems in your mother and heart issues in your sister. I understand your cultural beliefs about discussing health; we can certainly respect that. Now, let's move on to your current medications. Are you taking any medications right now, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… the pills for my blood pressure. The white ones. My wife gives them to me every morning. And… sometimes, when my joints hurt, I take something for that. Ibuprofen, I think? The blue ones. That’s all. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. Never had any trouble with allergies. I can eat anything, take anything. No problems. My wife always asks, but… never any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright Chirag, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. We'll also check your eyes, as your wife mentioned noticing some changes.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… make it quick, if you can. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little quiet. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm just going to feel your stomach. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Hmm. A little tender… here. Not much, but… yes. A little uncomfortable. Like… a dull ache. Not sharp. Just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That tenderness in the upper right quadrant is noted. Your reflexes are normal. And I'm looking at your eyes now… I do notice some slight yellowing of the whites of your eyes, as your wife mentioned. It’s subtle, but it's there. Okay Chirag, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’m concerned about possible liver problems. The tenderness in your abdomen, the yellowing of your eyes, the fatigue, and your history of stopping alcohol suggest we need to investigate this further. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function. I also recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests? More poking and prodding? Fine. Whatever you think is best. My wife… she will be happy you are doing something. I just… want to feel better. But… what if it is bad? What if it is… serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Chirag. It's natural to be worried when we don't know what's going on. It’s good you’re acknowledging these fears. Right now, we don't know for sure what's going on, and the tests will help us get a clearer picture. Many things can cause these symptoms, and it doesn’t automatically mean it’s serious. We'll start with the blood tests, which are relatively simple, and then the ultrasound. If the ultrasound shows anything concerning, we may need to consider further testing or a referral to a specialist. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll write the orders for the blood tests and ultrasound now, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. Will these tests… hurt? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have things to do, you know? My garden… it needs attention.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, but it shouldn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. It’s very brief. As for the results, the blood tests usually take a few days to come back – typically 2 to 3 business days. The ultrasound results can take a little longer, maybe up to a week, as the radiologist needs to review the images. I'll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them and make a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or yellowing of your skin – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Two, three days… I can manage that. And… I will tell my wife. She worries too much. Thank you, doctor. I think… that is all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chirag. I’m glad you came in today. Remember, we're a team, and we’ll figure this out together. Here are the lab orders and a contact number for the lab if you have any questions about scheduling your appointments. Don't hesitate to call my office if anything comes up. Take care, and I'll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: .
