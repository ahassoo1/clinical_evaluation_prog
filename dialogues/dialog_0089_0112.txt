DOCTOR: Hi Keoni, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Roseburroough. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the restroom quite a lot lately. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's… disruptive. I don’t quite know why it’s happening, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is good you came in to get it checked out – it's always best to figure these things out. “Quite a lot” is a little vague, though. Can you give me a rough estimate of how often you're going?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. Let me think. Normally, I’d say… perhaps four or five times a day? But now… it feels like every couple of hours, even if I haven’t had much to drink. Maybe six, seven times? It’s hard to be precise. It's not a constant urge, but it’s… frequent enough to be concerning. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, thank you. Six to seven times a day is definitely more frequent than usual. And it started gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult one. I believe it was gradual, yes. It wasn’t as though I woke up one morning and it was suddenly much worse. It started perhaps a month or so ago, with just a little extra… awareness, I suppose. Then it slowly increased over the weeks. I didn’t think much of it at first, just assumed I was drinking more water or something. But it hasn’t gone back down.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain, no burning, nothing like that. Just… the frequency. And occasionally a feeling of… not emptying completely, but it’s fleeting. It doesn’t happen every time, and it’s not particularly strong. Mostly just the need to go so often. It's mostly inconvenient, but I do find myself worrying about it, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine…? I don’t believe so. It looks… normal, I suppose. The usual color. I haven't noticed any blood or anything alarming like that. I suppose I haven't been actively looking, if that makes sense. I tend not to scrutinize things like that. I apologize for my lack of observation. Is there something specific I should be looking for?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all – most people don’t scrutinize their urine! It's good you haven't noticed anything obvious. Just checking. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I feel perfectly healthy otherwise. No fever, no chills, definitely no nausea or vomiting. I've been feeling… well, a little tired, perhaps, but I attribute that to work. I'm a concierge, you see, and it can be quite demanding. But overall, I’ve been well. This urinary frequency is the only thing bothering me. It's rather perplexing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: I… I am divorced, as a matter of fact. I haven't been in a… a relationship for some time now. So, no, I am not currently sexually active. It has been several years, to be precise. I hope that answers your question. It’s a little personal, of course, but I understand it’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information. It is important. Now, let’s quickly go through some other things. Do you have any past medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not to my knowledge. I've been generally healthy throughout my life. I had a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. No diabetes, no kidney problems… I've never been diagnosed with anything significant. My late husband always took care of the medical appointments, so I wasn’t always privy to the details. I apologize if my memory is lacking. I sometimes struggle to recall things. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. I understand. No worries at all. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: I believe I had my tonsils removed as a child. A very standard procedure, I'm told. And… oh, yes. When I was quite young, I broke my arm falling from a tree. I was hospitalized for a few days while they set it. Beyond that… nothing major, to my recollection. No other surgeries or extended hospital stays. I do tend to avoid doctors when possible, if I'm honest. Is that terribly foolish?
DOCTOR: Not at all. Many people feel that way. Now, quickly, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything, and I've never had a reaction to any medication. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years for minor infections, but nothing serious. I suppose I’m quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies to worry about, thankfully. I do try to eat healthy, when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a bit… difficult. My late husband handled most of those details as well, I’m afraid. My parents both passed away some years ago. My mother, I believe, had high blood pressure, but beyond that… I don’t recall any significant family history of illness. I believe my father was generally quite healthy. I apologize for being so vague. It’s rather frustrating, not being able to recall more information. Perhaps if I could speak with some family members… but they live quite far away.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information already. Okay. Last quick question. What medications are you currently taking – including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: None, to be perfectly honest. I don’t take any regular medications at all. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, but that's about it. No vitamins, no supplements… I try to get everything I need from my diet. I haven't felt the need for anything beyond that. I suppose I'm quite simple in my needs. Is that unusual?
DOCTOR: Not at all. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. That's standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I understand the need for a thorough examination. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment completely. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I hope it won’t be too… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax and take some deep breaths. I don’t feel any masses, and it’s not particularly tender to the touch. Your bowel sounds are normal. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 128/76, which is normal. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’d like to check a urine sample. I'll give you a cup, and I'll explain the process. It’s best to collect a midstream sample, if possible.
PATIENT: Very well. A urine sample, of course. Yes, that makes sense. I believe I can manage that. A midstream sample… I remember something about that. I’ll do my best to follow your instructions. Where shall I… dispose of the cup afterwards? And how much should I collect? I don’t want to be wasteful, or… insufficient. I apologize for all the questions. I just want to be sure I do it correctly.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all – it’s good you’re asking questions! You'll find the restroom just down the hall to your left. Please collect about 2-4 ounces of urine – it doesn’t need to be a lot. After you start urinating, let a little go, and then collect the sample midstream. There’s a small receptacle near the toilet for the cup. Take your time, and don’t feel rushed. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
PATIENT: Very well. Two to four ounces… midstream. I believe I understand. Thank you for the clear instructions. I shall be right back.
