DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's like… a pain, you know? In my chest.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… hard to say. It’s not like a sharp pain, more like… a heavy ache. Sometimes it feels like a lump, but I don't see a lump. It's mostly on this side… <points to left chest> But sometimes it feels… all over. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Bulaong. A heavy ache, sometimes localized to the left side, sometimes more diffuse… and no visible lump. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Um… maybe a few weeks now? I don't really keep track of dates so well. But a few weeks, I think. It comes and goes. Not every day. Sometimes it's worse before… before my wife and I go to bed. I think. Maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks of intermittent chest pain, potentially worsening before bedtime. And you mentioned you don’t keep close track of dates, that’s perfectly alright. We'll work with what you can recall. Does anything specifically trigger the pain, besides potentially bedtime?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I do a lot of climbing on roofs for work, you know? Maybe that makes it worse sometimes? But I always feel a little sore after work. It's hard to tell if it's that pain, or… this other pain. I don't think anything else. Nothing I can think of, anyway.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you do physically demanding work – climbing on roofs – and experience soreness afterwards. You’re wondering if the chest pain is related to that, or something separate. And it’s not consistently linked to any other activity, as far as you can tell. Now, let’s talk about what makes it better. Does anything relieve the pain when it occurs?
PATIENT: Well… resting, I think. When I stop working and just sit down, it gets a little better. And… sometimes my wife rubs my back, and that helps too. Not the chest directly, but it makes me feel better all over, you know? Not sure if that helps the chest, but… it helps.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Bulaong. Resting and your wife’s back rubs seem to provide some relief, even if it’s not directly on the chest. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no dizziness or sweating. Sometimes I feel a little… tired, but I work very hard, so that's not surprising. And no… no trouble breathing. No nausea either. Just the pain. Mostly. <pauses, thinking> Sometimes my wife says I look worried, but I always feel a little worried when I'm in pain! Does that count?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bulaong. No shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness. Just the chest pain and perhaps some worry, understandably. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been to a doctor before, really. I just try to work and… not bother anyone. So, no, no diagnoses. I don't know what those things are, even. <shrugs> I just feel the pain sometimes. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses. And you’ve never had any surgeries or been hospitalized, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never been in the hospital. I’ve been lucky, I guess. Mostly just bumps and scrapes from the roofs. Nothing serious. My wife takes care of me when I get those. She puts bandages on. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Um… my wife's family, they have… I don't know. She says her father had some trouble with his heart when he was old, but… I don't know what kind of trouble. She doesn’t talk about it much. My family… I don't see them anymore. So, I don’t know anything about their health. Sorry. <looks down at hands>
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bulaong. It's understandable that you don’t have that information. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take anything. Just… water. And sometimes my wife gives me tea when I’m sick. But that's all. I don't like taking pills. They make me feel funny. <shivers slightly>
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, pollen, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Sometimes I get itchy when I’m walking in the tall grass, but my wife says that’s just the plants. I don’t get sick from it, just itchy. No allergies, I think. Never had a bad reaction to anything. <pauses> Unless you count being tired after a long day! Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: No, being tired after a long day is not an allergy, Mr. Bulaong. Alright, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I would like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest to check for any tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. If you think it will help, you can look. Just… be gentle, please. My wife worries if I get poked too much. <nervously adjusts his shirt>
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Your heart rate is regular and within normal limits. Your lungs sound clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. I’m palpating your chest now… Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. That hurts a little. Not a bad pain, but… yeah, that’s where it hurts when I’m working. A little tender. <points to the left side of his chest, just below his collarbone> Right about there. <looks anxious> Is that bad, Doctor? Is something broken?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you point that out, Mr. Bulaong. There is some tenderness to palpation on the left side of your chest, as you indicated. It doesn’t feel like a sharp, acute pain that would suggest a broken bone, but it does warrant further investigation. Given your description of the pain, your physical exam findings, and your lack of prior medical history, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be musculoskeletal pain – meaning pain related to the muscles, bones, or joints in your chest wall – potentially aggravated by your physically demanding work. However, because chest pain can also be indicative of more serious issues, such as cardiac problems, it's important to rule those out. I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. I also recommend a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: EKG… X-ray… <frowns, looking confused> Those sound… complicated. And a little scary. Will they hurt? My wife… she gets worried when I have tests. But… if you think it’s important, I guess. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? If it’s nothing serious, that would be good. <nervously rubs his hands together> Will they take long? I have to get back to work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bulaong. They are perfectly reasonable. The EKG is a very simple and painless test. We’ll place some small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart’s electrical activity. It takes just a few minutes. The chest X-ray involves a brief exposure to a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose and the benefits of ruling out any underlying lung or heart problems outweigh the risks. It will take approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete both tests. We can schedule them for this afternoon. While we’re waiting for the results, and depending on what the tests show, I may recommend a consultation with a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… 30 minutes… I think I can manage that. And a heart specialist if you need… alright. It’s better to be safe, I guess. <sighs> My wife will be happy I’m getting checked out. She always worries about me. Yes, let’s do the tests. This afternoon is good. Just… try to be quick, okay? I don’t want to be away from work too long. <looks hopeful> Maybe it's just my muscles, like you said. That would be good. Really good.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bulaong. I’ll make sure to expedite the tests as quickly as possible. We’ll get you in and out as efficiently as we can. Alright, let me just get a nurse to come in and start the paperwork for the EKG and chest X-ray. And I'll have her explain the procedure to you in more detail. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Worsening pain… shortness of breath… dizziness… emergency room. I understand. Thank you. You’ve been very helpful. <pauses, looking relieved> I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on. And that you're looking into it. <smiles weakly> Maybe it is just my muscles.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That's what I'm here for. We'll get to the bottom of this together. I'll have the nurse come in shortly. .
