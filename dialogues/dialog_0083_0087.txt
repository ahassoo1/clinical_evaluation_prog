DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Croonquist, yes. Look, I just… need some lab work done. That's all. The lady on the phone said I needed to come in, and I filled out the forms. I don’t really remember why exactly, just that I need the tests. Old age, you know? Everything gets a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Croonquist. It’s very common for things to slip one’s mind. No worries at all. Let’s see… I can pull up your information on the computer here. Ah, yes. It appears you’re due for your annual wellness check, including some routine blood work. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Annual… wellness check? Blood work… sounds right. Yes, that must be it. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to get it over with. Is it going to take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We'll try to make this as efficient as possible. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. Then, depending on what your insurance covers, we may need to check your height and weight, blood pressure, and perhaps listen to your heart and lungs. It shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes total. Before we proceed, could you just confirm for me if you’ve experienced any new symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. New symptoms? Let me think… Everything feels a bit achy, but that's just getting old, right? And I get tired easily, but… I've always been tired easily. No, I don’t think so. Nothing new. Just the usual wear and tear. Can we just get to the blood work?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly proceed with the blood work. Just to be thorough, let me quickly review your medical history. I see here you have Medicare, and the clinic notes indicate you’re Afghan. Do you mind telling me a little bit about any significant medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Afghan, yes. That’s right. Medical conditions… Honestly, Doctor, it's been a long time. I think I had some trouble with my… with my stomach, years ago. But it was a long time ago. And I used to be very thin, but that was because… well, never mind. Nothing serious now, I don't think. Look, I really don’t remember much. Is it okay if we just skip this part? I'm not good with recalling details.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We can absolutely proceed without a detailed medical history if you’re not comfortable. It’s perfectly alright. Just one quick question: do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty sure. Can we please get on with the tests now? I appreciate your patience, Doctor. Really. But my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. Let’s go ahead and get started then. We’ll start with a quick check of your height and weight, then we’ll move on to the blood draw. If you wouldn’t mind stepping onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. It’s always something with getting older. Just weigh me, Doctor. Let's get it over with. I hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist, you are 69 kilograms and 195 centimeters tall. That's within a normal range for your height. Now, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, we will proceed with the blood draw. Do you have a preferred arm?
PATIENT: Preferred arm? Doesn’t matter to me, Doctor. Whatever is easiest for you. Just… get it over with quickly, please. I don't like needles. Never have.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll use this arm then. I’m going to clean the area with an alcohol swab, then insert the needle to collect a few tubes of blood. You might feel a brief pinch. Just try to relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. There we go. All done. Just keep pressure on this for a few minutes to prevent any bruising.
PATIENT: Ow! That wasn’t pleasant. Okay, okay. Just a pinch, you said. It felt like more than a pinch. Is it done now? Please tell me it’s done. I really don't like this. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Croonquist, you're all done. It is finished. I apologize if it was more uncomfortable than expected. You did very well. Now, we’ll send these samples to the lab for analysis. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. We’ll be in touch to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, just keep that bandage on for at least an hour, and try to avoid any strenuous activity with that arm. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… glad it’s over. A few days, you said? Okay. Just call me. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I need to go have a sit down.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Absolutely. Take it easy, and we'll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
