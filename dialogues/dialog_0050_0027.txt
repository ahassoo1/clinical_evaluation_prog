DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 67 years old. Please, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day, so let’s get this over with. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Regurgitation, the nurse called it. Happens mostly after I eat. It’s… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “Regurgitation,” yes. I understand you're experiencing episodes of bringing food back up after eating. And you’d like to be efficient with your time, which I appreciate. Could you describe what this "stuff" looks like?
PATIENT: Well, it looks like what I ate, doesn't it? Honestly, do I look like a scientist? It’s… partially digested. Sometimes it’s more liquid, sometimes more… chunky. Depends on what I had. Steak is worse than soup, naturally. And it happens… a few times a week. More if my wife makes her cabbage rolls.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, the composition of the regurgitated material can be telling. A few times a week, you say, and exacerbated by cabbage rolls. I see. Let's review some other aspects of this. Before we delve further into the specifics of this regurgitation, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I get heartburn sometimes, a bit of a burning in my chest. Not awful, I just… ignore it. And sometimes my throat feels a little scratchy. Probably just from yelling at the neighbor’s dog. Look, I'm a perfectly healthy man. This regurgitation is a new thing. It’s annoying, but I’m not about to fall apart.
DOCTOR: Heartburn and a scratchy throat. Alright. And you attribute the throat irritation to external factors. I see you’ve had no prior significant medical history noted here, which is… commendable. Have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Altine?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I could stand to lose a few pounds, but that’s from my wife’s cooking, not this… problem. She makes good food, bless her heart, but it's heavy. I haven't been weighing myself religiously or anything. Why would I? I’m not ill!
DOCTOR: It is simply a matter of thoroughness, Mr. Altine. Weight loss can be an indicator of certain underlying conditions. Very well. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any instances of gastrointestinal issues – perhaps reflux, ulcers, or cancers – in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had indigestion, always complaining. But she complained about everything. And my uncle, on my wife’s side, had something… stomach cancer, I think. Years ago. But he smoked like a chimney. Honestly, it’s probably just bad luck.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. Now, if you don't mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to palpate your abdomen. Just to get a baseline. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much, I have things to do. And I don’t like being cold.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m just assessing for any tenderness or abnormalities, Mr. Altine. Hmm. No acute tenderness to palpation, but there is some… mild distension. I also detect some mild epigastric discomfort upon deep palpation. Do you experience any pain radiating to your back or chest when this regurgitation occurs?
PATIENT: Radiating pain? No. It’s just… uncomfortable. A bit of a burning, like I said. Mostly just annoying. I’m a big man, I can handle a little discomfort. Look, is this going to take much longer? I had a tee time scheduled.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Altine. Based on what you've described, and the findings of this brief examination, it appears you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with gastroesophageal reflux disease – GERD – potentially complicated by esophagitis. However, to confirm this, and rule out other possibilities, I recommend a few further investigations. I’d like to order an upper endoscopy, and a pH monitoring study of your esophagus. This will allow us to visualize the lining of your esophagus, and assess the extent of acid reflux. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Endo-what-now? And monitoring? Look, I don't like the sound of either of those. Are you saying I need… surgery? Because I’m not doing surgery. I just want something for the heartburn, maybe something to stop this… stuff coming up.
DOCTOR: Mr. Altine, let’s not jump to conclusions. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus to visualize the lining. It's a relatively straightforward procedure. The pH monitoring study simply measures the amount of acid in your esophagus over a 24-hour period. Neither necessarily indicates the need for surgery. However, without these investigations, it’s difficult to formulate an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment plan. In the meantime, I can prescribe a proton pump inhibitor – a medication that reduces stomach acid production – to help manage your symptoms. But I strongly recommend you follow through with the endoscopy and pH monitoring. Would you be willing to schedule those appointments?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Proton pump… whatever. Just get me a prescription for it. And schedule the appointments, I guess. But if they’re going to take all day, I’m cancelling them. And make them quick. I have a life, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is a prescription for Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, to be taken once daily before breakfast. I’ve scheduled you for an upper endoscopy on August 12th, and a 24-hour pH monitoring study on August 19th. The endoscopy will require you to fast for eight hours beforehand, and you will need someone to drive you home. The pH monitoring study will involve wearing a small probe in your esophagus for 24 hours. I will also provide you with detailed instructions for both procedures. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as difficulty swallowing, chest pain, or vomiting blood – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. I’ve wasted enough of my day already. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow the instructions provided, and do not hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a… productive day, Mr. Altine. .
