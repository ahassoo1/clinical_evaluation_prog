DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, yeah, that's me. Look, I just… can't catch my breath sometimes. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. It's been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: "Old age," you say. Well, we don’t accept that as a diagnosis around here, Mr. Guilds. Let’s get a little more specific, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Hmph. What do you want specific? It just… happens. I'm walking, and then… whoosh. Gotta stop. And I gotta drink water constantly. It's annoying, to be honest. Never used to be like this. Back in my day, we didn’t need fancy doctors for a little… puffiness.
DOCTOR: Right. “Puffiness.” Okay. And is this “puffiness” – shortness of breath, as you’re describing it – constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I walk. If I try to do too much. Sometimes even talking gets me winded, but that’s… probably just me getting old. Like I said. It's not always happening, but it’s enough to bother me. And the dryness… that’s pretty constant, I think. Especially my mouth. Feels like cotton.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Swelling? Hmm… let me think. My shoes feel a little tight sometimes, but I figured that was just my feet getting wider. You know, with age. Never really paid much attention. I mostly wear work boots anyway, and those are always a little snug. Doesn't really bother me enough to complain about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any chest pain or palpitations – a racing heart – with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Racing heart? No, not really. Sometimes I feel… a little fluttery, maybe. But I get that when I drink too much coffee. Which, I admit, is too much. Coffee's good. No pain, though. Just… tired. And dry. Everything's dry. This is getting me nowhere, doc.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I got things to do, you know. Don’t got all day to sit here talkin' about dryness.
DOCTOR: If you could just sit here for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure, okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Go ahead. Just be quick about it. This paper's kinda scratchy, too, you know. Everything's scratchy these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. And your lungs… there’s a bit of diminished breath sound on both sides, especially towards the bases. Not wheezing, not crackles… just a little quieter than I’d like. Blood pressure is 140 over 90. A little elevated. And your pulse is 88. Let's take a look at your ankles now. Hmm. There's some slight pitting edema present bilaterally. Not severe, but it's there. Alright. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP. And I want a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: X-rays? Blood work? Now what for? I told you, it's just old age! What's the point of all this poking and prodding? Is that gonna fix my dry mouth? I swear, doctors these days… Always gotta do somethin'. What are you lookin' for, exactly? And how long is this gonna take? I got a bingo game tonight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, we need to rule out some potential causes for your symptoms. Shortness of breath, even with exertion, and the dryness you're experiencing, could be a sign of several things. The blood work will give us information about your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and if you have any signs of infection. The BNP will help us assess for heart failure, which can cause both shortness of breath and edema. And the chest X-ray will let us look at your lungs to see if there's any fluid buildup or other abnormalities. I understand you think it’s “just old age”, but it's my job to investigate and ensure that there isn’t something more serious going on. It could be something relatively minor, but we need to be thorough. As for how long it will take… the blood work and X-ray should be done within the hour, and the results will take a few hours to process. I'll have the nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I want you to reduce your caffeine intake, and try to drink plenty of fluids. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Plenty of fluids… like I haven’t tried that already. Caffeine… fine, fine. I’ll try. But I’m tellin’ ya, it’s gonna be a long night. And if this turns out to be nothin', I'm expectin' an apology. And maybe a free coffee. Do I have to sit here waitin' for all this? Can't I just go home and come back later?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I need to rule out some potentially serious conditions. I understand you’d prefer to be at home, but I need you to remain here while we conduct these tests. It’s for your own safety. It will only be a few hours, and the nurse will keep you comfortable. We can get you a glass of water, and I can have someone bring you a magazine. It’s important that we have the results before you leave, so we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Fine. Magazines, huh? What kind of magazines? Better not be those fancy home decor ones. I like… sports. Or maybe those true crime ones. And no, no allergies. Never had any. Just a general allergy to doctors, maybe. Just get it over with. And make sure that nurse brings me a big glass of water. This mouth is like the Sahara desert, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse bring you some sports magazines and a large glass of water. She'll be in shortly to draw your blood and take you for the chest X-ray. In the meantime, try to relax. I’ll be back to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Please let the nurse know if you feel any discomfort or have any questions.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t take too long. And tell that nurse to be gentle. Old veins, you know. Doctors… always poking and prodding…
