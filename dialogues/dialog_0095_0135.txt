DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I have... liquid coming from my ear. It is not good. It started, maybe, three days ago? I think so. It makes hearing difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, liquid coming from your ear for about three days, and it’s affecting your hearing. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about the liquid?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little yellow. Not much smell. And it is… not painful, but… uncomfortable. Like pressure. I try to clean it, but… it keeps coming. It drips, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Clear or slightly yellow liquid, no smell, no pain, just pressure and it’s dripping. Okay. Have you had any fever, any dizziness, or any ringing in your ears along with this?
PATIENT: Fever? No, Doctor. I do not feel warm. Dizziness… sometimes, a little, when I stand up very fast. But I think that is just… old age. And ringing… yes, a little ringing. Not always. It comes and goes. Like a… high sound. Very quiet, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, some dizziness when standing, and intermittent ringing in the ear. That's helpful. Have you ever had any trouble with your ears before – infections, pain, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had… ear pain. Very bad. The doctor… he put something in my ear. A white thing. It helped. Many years ago. I do not remember much else. And… when my son was small, he had many ear infections. I took him to the doctor a lot. But that was… a long time ago. My ears have been… okay… until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear pain in your youth treated with something put in your ear, and you've taken care of your son with ear infections. Good to know. Do you have any other medical problems – like diabetes, heart trouble, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, Doctor. I do not have… problems with sugar. My heart is… okay, I think. The doctor checks it every year. Blood pressure is a little high, he says. I take a pill for that. Small, white pill. And… I had a problem with my knee, a long time ago. But I do not think that is… connected to my ear. Is that… enough information? I am sorry if I forget something.
DOCTOR: No, that's very helpful, Mr. Radillo. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a past knee problem. Don't worry about forgetting things; we'll get everything we need. Now, let’s take a look at your ear. I’m going to use an otoscope, it's just a little light to see inside. It won't hurt. Can you sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can sit. I am… a little worried, but I trust you. Please be careful. My ear is… sensitive. I will sit very still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, I’m just going to take a quick look. I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum looks a bit… dull. There’s some redness as well. The right ear looks better, but there’s also a small amount of fluid present. It appears you have fluid behind both eardrums, and that is likely the cause of your hearing difficulties and discomfort. It looks like you may have an ear infection, or fluid buildup from a recent cold. I want to check your temperature and listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. An infection? Is that bad? I do not want to be sick. Temperature and listening… yes, you can do that. I hope it is not too serious. My grandson starts school next month, and I want to be well to help him.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is slightly elevated, but nothing concerning. Your heart and lungs sound clear. It doesn’t sound like it’s a serious infection, but we do need to address it. Given your symptoms and the examination, I believe you likely have an ear infection, or fluid buildup in your middle ear. I'm going to prescribe you an antibiotic ear drop and a decongestant to help clear the fluid. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never been allergic to anything. I take the blood pressure pill every day, and that is… fine. I eat many things, and nothing makes me sick. No allergies. I am sure. But… please be careful with the medicine. I do not want any bad side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies. I’ll prescribe a 7-day course of antibiotic ear drops and a decongestant. It’s important to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. I'm also going to recommend you avoid getting water in your ears for the next week, and you can use over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you experience any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me about the medication or anything else?
PATIENT: Seven days… yes, I can remember that. No water in ears. I understand. And pain relievers… like for headache? I do have one question, Doctor. Will this… affect my hearing? Will I not be able to hear my grandson when he tells me stories? That is very important to me.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Radillo. The fluid buildup is likely what's affecting your hearing right now. The antibiotic ear drops should help clear the fluid, and as the fluid drains, your hearing should improve. It’s unlikely to cause any permanent damage, but it might take a few days to get back to normal. I’ll give you a follow-up appointment in two weeks to check your progress. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, please call the office immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… good to hear. Fluid is the problem, medicine will help, hearing will return. Two weeks for follow-up. And call if worse. I think… I understand everything. Thank you very much, Doctor Vanochten. You have been very helpful. You are a good doctor. Now, how do I get the medicine?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Here is your prescription. You can take this to any pharmacy. I recommend calling ahead to make sure they have the medication in stock. I’m also going to send a copy electronically to your preferred pharmacy, if you have one on file. Do you have any other questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. Electronic copy is… good. I will call the pharmacy. Thank you again for your help. I feel much better now, knowing what is wrong. Have a good day, Doctor Vanochten. And thank you for being so kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I'm glad I could ease your mind. Get some rest, and please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day to you as well, and enjoy spending time with your grandson!
