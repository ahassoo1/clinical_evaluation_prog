DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s about these cholesterol numbers, I reckon. The nurse lady called and said they weren’t quite right. I don't rightly understand all the fuss, but she said I should come in and talk about it. Been feeling alright, though, if you want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the nurse flagged an elevated cholesterol level. And you’re feeling well otherwise?
PATIENT: Yes, feeling as good as a man my age can, I suppose. No aches, no pains, sleep alright... eat pretty regular. Though, I do enjoy a good steak now and then. Always have. My wife, bless her soul, made the best steaks you ever did see. We used to have one every Friday.
DOCTOR: I see. And how long ago did your wife pass away?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It’ll be… seven years this November. Seven years come the 15th. Seems like yesterday, some days, and a lifetime ago others. She was a good woman, always looked after me. We did a lot of living in those years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And since your wife's passing, has your diet changed significantly?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I mean, I don't cook like she did, naturally. Mostly just simple things now. Canned soup, sandwiches, a bit of fish if I’m feeling fancy. But I still treat myself to steak every now and then, like I said. Just can't seem to give that up. It reminds me of her, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, have you had any other medical issues recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a couple of years back, but the doctor – Dr. Olsen, he retired last year – he put me on a little pill for it. I take that every morning. Other than that, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains that come with being an old man, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And what is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… give me a moment. It’s a little white pill… let me think. It starts with an ‘A’… Amlodipine! That’s it. Amlodipine. Five milligrams, if that matters. I get it refilled at the drugstore every month.
DOCTOR: Alright, Amlodipine 5mg. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She was probably right, come to think of it. Ate all sorts of things without a second thought. No allergies, Doctor. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, as a young man, I broke my leg playing football. Silly thing, really. Tried to make a tackle I shouldn't have. Had a cast on for a good six weeks. But that was… oh, goodness, must be seventy years ago now. Other than that, no hospital stays. Just a bit of flu here and there, nothing serious. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a childhood broken leg doesn’t concern us at the moment. Now, is there any history of heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My father… he had a bit of chest pain now and then, towards the end. The doctor said it was his heart, but it was a long time ago, and they didn't have the fancy tests they have now. He didn’t take any pills for it, just slowed down a bit. My mother… she was healthy as a horse, right up until the day she passed. Never a sick day in her life. As for high cholesterol, I don’t rightly know. No one talked much about that back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she tried it once, back when she was a teenager, but didn’t care for it. Said it smelled awful. So no, Doctor, never smoked a day in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure and pulse, a quick look in your ears and throat. Standard procedure. Then we can discuss your cholesterol numbers and what, if anything, we need to do about them.
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Do what you need to do. I’ve had plenty of doctors poke and prod at me over the years. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It's not a loud murmur, and it doesn’t seem to be causing any problems at the moment, but it's something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears and throat… Ears are clear. Throat looks good. Pulse is 72 and regular. Okay, that’s all. Everything seems relatively normal, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and that mild heart murmur. Now, let's talk about those cholesterol numbers. Do you have the results with you, or did the nurse give you a copy?
PATIENT: No, I didn't get a copy, Doctor. The nurse just told me they weren’t right and I should come in. I reckon she had a list of the numbers with her. I’m not one for remembering all those figures, to be honest. You're the doctor, you tell me what they are!
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s see… Your total cholesterol is 245 milligrams per deciliter. Your LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is 160. Your HDL cholesterol – the “good” cholesterol – is 40. And your triglycerides are 180. These numbers are, as the nurse said, not ideal. Your LDL is quite high, and your HDL is a bit low. Essentially, you have elevated cholesterol, which increases your risk of heart disease and stroke. Now, given your age, your blood pressure, and the murmur I detected, we need to take this seriously.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound too good, does it? Heart disease and stroke… my wife… she had a stroke, you know. That’s what took her. So what do I do? Do I need pills? I don’t like taking pills, but I don’t want to end up like my wife. What are my options, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. It's understandable to be concerned, especially given your wife's history. Yes, a stroke is a serious event. Now, the good news is that we caught this early, and there are several things we can do. The first line of treatment, and what I always recommend first, is lifestyle modification. That means diet and exercise. Reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. We can get you a referral to a registered dietician who can help you with a meal plan. As for exercise, even a daily walk would be beneficial. However, given your current cholesterol levels and your overall risk factors, I do believe medication is also necessary. A statin would be the most appropriate medication to lower your LDL cholesterol. We can start you on a low dose and monitor your response. Statins do have potential side effects, such as muscle aches, but those are usually mild and manageable. We would start with a low dose and monitor your liver function regularly. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: Hmm… a dietician I could handle, I reckon. I used to enjoy a good walk back in the day, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. But pills… I really don’t like the sound of those side effects. Muscle aches… I already ache most of the time! Are there any other options besides pills? Could we not just try the diet and exercise first and see if that lowers it enough? I don’t want to be adding another pill to my daily routine if I don’t have to. What do you think, Doctor? Perhaps we could give it three months of strict diet and exercise and then retest? Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. I understand your reluctance to start medication. While diet and exercise are essential, your cholesterol levels are significantly elevated, and given your overall risk factors, I am concerned about waiting three months without any intervention. However, I am willing to compromise. We can try a trial of intensive lifestyle modifications – a referral to a registered dietician, and I’ll provide you with a list of resources for low-impact exercise – for three months. But, and this is important, we will recheck your cholesterol levels at the end of the three months. And, if your levels haven’t improved significantly, we will need to discuss starting a statin. We can also discuss monitoring for side effects very closely if we do proceed with medication later. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Three months of strict diet and exercise, and then we see where we’re at. And if it’s not enough, we talk about the pills. Alright, Doctor, that’s a deal. You can send me to that dietician, and I'll try to get out for a walk every day, even if it's just a short one. I'm not promising miracles, but I’ll do my best. Thank you for being willing to work with me on this. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Bohnett. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll put in a referral to a registered dietician – Ms. Emily Carter, she’s excellent. She'll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also give you a handout with some resources for low-impact exercise and some information about healthy eating. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for three months from today – November 2nd – to recheck your cholesterol levels and discuss your progress. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it all so clearly and for being patient with me. I appreciate your help. I guess I'll start walking and try to eat my vegetables! .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. You take care now. And remember, diet and exercise are important regardless. Good day.
