DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I’m Dr. VanOchten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. Though, frankly, I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for…well, let’s just say my daughter insisted. She’s quite convinced this “medical marijuana” is the answer to everything. I’m here, I suppose, to get whatever certification is required. I’m Ellan Rannells, by the way, in case that wasn’t clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your name here. And I understand your daughter is interested in medical marijuana. We can certainly discuss that process, but first, I need to understand why you’re considering it. It’s important to determine if it’s a suitable option for you, and what condition we’d be treating. Could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. “What’s been going on.” That’s a rather broad question, isn’t it? At my age, everything is going on. But if you must know, it’s mostly just…the aches and pains. The usual wear and tear. I've been a bailiff for a very long time, you see. A lot of running around, a lot on my feet. It’s not what it used to be, naturally. And the sleep…well, the sleep isn't terribly restful either. It’s not debilitating, mind you, but it’s…uncomfortable. My daughter thinks this will fix it all. Honestly, I'm skeptical.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches and pains, especially with your history as a bailiff – that makes sense. And trouble sleeping. So, it sounds like we’re talking about musculoskeletal pain and some insomnia. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…everywhere, really. My back, mostly. Lower back. But also my knees, my shoulders… even my hands, sometimes. Especially when it’s damp. It’s a dull ache, most of the time. Not sharp, thankfully. But it’s constant. It just…is. And it makes doing even simple things…difficult. Gardening, for instance. I used to love gardening. Now, it's a chore. And as for the sleep… I wake up several times a night. Tossing and turning. It’s not like I’m in agony, but I certainly don't feel rested in the morning. I suppose that's all. Is this what you need to know? It feels rather undignified, discussing all this.
DOCTOR: No, not at all undignified, Ms. Ranells. It's important information. And it’s very common for people your age to experience these kinds of aches and pains. Just trying to get a clear picture. When did you first start noticing these issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…difficult to say. It was gradual, you see. It didn’t just start one day. I suppose it started becoming truly bothersome maybe…five years ago? Perhaps a little longer. When I started noticing I needed a little longer to get going in the mornings, and that the stairs were becoming…less appealing. At first, I just attributed it to getting older. You know, the usual. But it’s been…progressing, shall we say. And it’s been a particularly bad stretch this past winter. The dampness, as I mentioned. It really aggravates it. And then my daughter started reading about this…marijuana. Honestly, I’m still not entirely convinced it’s a proper remedy. It just seems…frivolous.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five years of gradual worsening, worse in the winter. And you’re concerned about the appropriateness of medical marijuana as a treatment. That’s perfectly reasonable. Now, have you tried anything else for the pain and sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Plenty. My general practitioner – Dr. Hernandez, lovely woman – she’s given me all sorts of things. Various creams for the back, of course. Ibuprofen. Naproxen. Nothing really works, not for very long, anyway. And they all have such unpleasant side effects. Upset stomach, mostly. And the ibuprofen…well, it’s just not a long-term solution, is it? As for the sleep…she suggested a mild sedative, but I didn’t care for it. Made me feel…groggy. And sluggish. I’d rather just not sleep well, frankly, than feel like a zombie. My daughter keeps saying this marijuana won’t have those side effects. I suspect she’s being…overly optimistic.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve tried NSAIDs and a sedative, but didn’t find them effective or tolerable. That's helpful to know. Before we discuss medical marijuana further, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Well, I suppose so. I haven’t had one in… goodness, I can’t even remember. But…will it be… unpleasant? I'm not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding, you see. And I’m wearing my good dress. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just please be gentle. And try not to spend too long on my back, if you don't mind. It's rather sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ranells. I'll be as gentle as possible. We'll just check your range of motion, feel a few areas, listen to your heart and lungs – nothing too strenuous. And I’ll be mindful of your back. It won’t take long. Let’s start with your blood pressure, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose it's best to get it over with. My blood pressure is usually quite good, thankfully. I watch my salt intake. And I don’t drink very much alcohol. Just a small glass of sherry with dinner, on occasion. Though, I must admit, I haven't been myself lately. All this worry… it can't be good for one's constitution. But do get on with it. The sooner it’s over, the better. And please, do tell me if anything is…alarmingly wrong. I don’t want to be surprised.
DOCTOR: 130 over 80. Not bad at all, you're right. Now, if you could just sit up straight, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing is clear, heart sounds regular. Alright, now can you gently reach for your toes?
PATIENT: Oh. Reaching for my toes. That's going to be…difficult. I haven’t done that in years. It will likely be rather undignified, I warn you. But very well. Here goes… There. That's about as far as I can go. It pulls something in my lower back, you see. And it's rather uncomfortable. It feels as though it will take me the rest of the day to straighten up again. Is that enough? Can I sit up now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. And I understand it was uncomfortable. Good. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m just going to feel your lower back. Tell me if anything is particularly tender. Okay, and now your knees. Any pain when I bend them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The knees… that's where I truly feel my age. Yes, there's a bit of discomfort when I bend them. Not sharp, thankfully, just a…creaking, I suppose. And a slight ache. It’s worse when it’s cold, you see. And if I’ve been on my feet for too long. It feels rather…gritty, inside the joint. I suspect it’s arthritis, though Dr. Hernandez hasn’t confirmed it. She just gives me some cream, and tells me to take it easy. Not very helpful, is it? It's just… the wear and tear. Years of walking, years of gardening. It all adds up, I suppose. And it's rather unsettling to feel one's body…declining, you see. It's not a pleasant sensation.
DOCTOR: I understand. Yes, there is some crepitus with knee movement and mild tenderness to palpation. It is consistent with osteoarthritis. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Everything seems consistent with typical age-related wear and tear, and some osteoarthritis in your knees. Now, let’s talk about the medical marijuana certification. Do you have any specific questions about it, or what you're hoping to achieve with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I must say, I still harbor reservations. My daughter, bless her heart, has been reading all sorts of things online about it. She says it will help with the pain, and the sleep. And that it’s…safer than those pills Dr. Hernandez gave me. But it just seems…improper, somehow. I’ve always been a rather…conventional woman. And the thought of…smoking something… well. But if it truly could alleviate the pain, and allow me to sleep properly… that would be a blessing. But what are the side effects? Is it addictive? And will it make me feel… foggy-headed? I need to understand exactly what I’m getting myself into, you see. I don’t want to trade one set of problems for another. And frankly, I’m rather skeptical it will work at all.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Ranells. Let’s address them one by one. First, regarding side effects. The most common side effects are dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness. Some people experience anxiety or changes in appetite. Serious side effects are rare, but can include changes in blood pressure and cognitive function. Second, regarding addiction: While marijuana is not physically addictive in the same way as opioids, psychological dependence is possible. However, with responsible use and proper guidance, the risk is minimized. And finally, regarding feeling foggy-headed: Some people do experience cognitive impairment, especially with higher doses. However, with careful titration and the right strain, we can often avoid those effects. Now, it’s important to understand that medical marijuana isn’t a cure-all. It can help manage symptoms, but it doesn’t address the underlying cause of your pain. Also, it may interact with other medications you are taking. Before proceeding, can you tell me if you’re currently taking any other medications, besides what you mentioned from Dr. Hernandez?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a lot to take in. I suppose dry mouth and dizziness are…tolerable, compared to feeling groggy and zombie-like. But the thought of changes in blood pressure… that's rather alarming. And the cognitive impairment… I certainly don't want to feel any less sharp than I already do. As for other medications… let me see. I take a low dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, as you know. And occasionally, a small dose of loratadine for seasonal allergies. And I use a topical cream, diclofenac, for my knees, as Dr. Hernandez prescribed. But that's all, I think. Just those few things. And I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I eat a balanced diet, I get plenty of exercise… well, as much as my knees will allow. I just…want to feel better. But I'm still rather apprehensive about this whole thing. It just feels so…uncharacteristic.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril, loratadine, diclofenac. Those shouldn't interact significantly with medical marijuana, but it’s good to be aware. Given your concerns, and your overall health, I think medical marijuana could be a reasonable option to explore, but with some caveats. We’ll start with a very low dose, and carefully monitor your response. We’ll focus on strains with lower THC content, to minimize cognitive effects. And we’ll discuss potential side effects at each visit. It’s also important to remember that this is not a long-term solution, but a tool to help manage your symptoms. If you decide to proceed, I can issue the certification, and provide you with a list of dispensaries in the area. However, it's important to be aware that dispensaries are not always regulated, so it’s crucial to choose one that is reputable and knowledgeable. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A reputable dispensary… that sounds…complicated. And choosing the right strain… I don’t even know where to begin. It’s all so…overwhelming. It sounds as though there’s a great deal of responsibility involved, and I’m not sure I’m up to it. Perhaps my daughter should be the one doing all this. She’s so much more…technologically savvy, and she’s been reading about it for months. But if you truly think it could help, and you’re willing to guide me through the process… well, I suppose I could try it. But only if you promise to be patient with me. And if I feel any unpleasant side effects, I want to be able to stop immediately. And frankly, I’m still rather skeptical it will work at all. But I suppose it’s worth a try, if it means I can finally get a good night’s sleep. But I’m still not entirely convinced. So yes, I think… I think I will proceed. But with a great deal of apprehension.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And you’re right to be apprehensive – it’s a big step, and it’s important to approach it with caution. And yes, I absolutely promise to be patient with you every step of the way. We'll start with a very low dose of a CBD-dominant strain with minimal THC. I will provide you with detailed instructions, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response. I’ll also give you a list of reputable dispensaries in the area, and some resources to help you learn more about different strains and their effects. Now, I will also give you a printed sheet listing potential side effects and when to seek immediate medical attention. Are you able to get to a dispensary within the next week?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CBD-dominant strain… that sounds slightly less intimidating. And a list of reputable dispensaries… that’s certainly helpful. As for getting to one within the next week… yes, I suppose so. My son usually drives me to my appointments, and he could take me to a dispensary as well. He lives nearby, thankfully. But I’m still rather apprehensive about walking into one of those places. It sounds as though it will be… a rather unusual experience. But if it means I can finally get some relief, I suppose I’m willing to try it. And yes, a printed sheet listing potential side effects… that’s absolutely essential. I need to be prepared for anything, you see. I’m not getting any younger, and I don’t want to take any unnecessary risks. But yes, I think I’m ready to proceed… with a great deal of apprehension, of course. And please, do remind me again what I should be looking for in a strain? I feel as though I’m walking into the unknown.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here are the information sheets - one details the potential side effects and when to seek help, and the other has a list of dispensaries in the area and some things to look for. As for the strains, start by looking for those that are high in CBD and low in THC – less than 0.3% THC. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won’t get you “high”, but it has anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. Look for strains with names like "Charlotte's Web" or "Acdc" – those are generally good starting points. The budtender at the dispensary should be able to help you as well. Don't hesitate to ask questions, and if you’re unsure about anything, ask them to recommend something mild. Also, start with a very small dose – just a few milligrams – and see how you feel before increasing it. And remember, we can adjust the dose or strain at any time. This is a process of trial and error, and it may take some time to find what works best for you. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. “Charlotte’s Web” and “Acdc”… those sound… rather quaint. And a few milligrams… that seems… remarkably little. But yes, I suppose I understand. Start small, ask questions, and adjust as needed. It sounds as though it will be a rather tedious process, but if it means I can finally get some relief, I suppose I’m willing to try it. And yes, I feel… reasonably comfortable with that. Though I still harbor a great deal of skepticism. But you’ve been very patient with me, Doctor, and I appreciate that. And yes, I’m willing to give it a try. Though I’m still not entirely convinced it will work. But yes, I suppose that’s all for today, then? I suppose I should leave you to your other patients. And thank you again for your patience. It's been… enlightening. Though I still feel rather overwhelmed. But yes, thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Ranells. It was my pleasure. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns, before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we’ll take it one step at a time. Now, let’s get you scheduled for that follow-up in two weeks. And have a good day, Ms. Ranells. I hope to hear good news at our next visit. And please, try to rest and take care of yourself.
