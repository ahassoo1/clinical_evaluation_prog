DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brodie. It’s… well, it’s this cough. Been nagging at me for a while now. Just a dry tickle, mostly. Doesn't bring anything up, you know? Just… irritating. I don't even remember when it started, to be honest. Feels like forever.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brodie. It’s good to meet you as well. A dry cough, you say, that's been present for quite some time. And you don’t recall precisely when it began?
PATIENT: No, not really. Things… blur these days. My wife, bless her soul, she always kept track of these things. Now… well, I just try to get through each day. It's not a bad cough, not painful, just… constant. Like something's stuck in my throat, but isn’t. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly helpful, Brodie. It's quite common for things to feel less distinct with time, and you're describing it very clearly. A constant, dry irritation… I understand. Besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. I get a little… short of breath sometimes, when I walk up the stairs. But I’ve always been a bit winded, even when I was younger. And maybe… a little tired, but who isn’t at my age? It’s hard to say what’s the cough and what’s just… old age. I haven't been eating much either, but that's probably just 'cause things don't taste as good anymore. Everything seems bland.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion, some fatigue, and a decreased appetite with changes in taste. Thank you for sharing that, Brodie. When you say shortness of breath, can you describe it a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t walk up the stairs, you understand. I just have to… stop and catch my breath maybe once or twice on the way. It's not a wheezing or anything, just… feels like I’m working harder than I used to. And it happens with anything, really. Even just walking to the mailbox sometimes. It’s not every time, though. Some days I feel alright, other days… not so much. It just depends.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent shortness of breath with exertion. And you mentioned a decreased appetite and a change in taste. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. My wife always took my temperature when I was sick, and I haven’t felt feverish. Chills… not really. Maybe a little cold sometimes, but that’s just the air conditioning, I think. Night sweats… no, I sleep pretty soundly, thankfully. I haven’t woken up drenched in sweat, no. I do get thirsty a lot, though. Maybe more than usual. Could that be related?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Brodie. No fever, chills, or night sweats, but increased thirst. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as asthma, COPD, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. That’s a tough one. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, you know. I had… something with my lungs when I was younger, working in the factory. They said it was from the dust, but it cleared up. I don’t remember the name of it. And my heart… they said it was strong, but I had some palpitations once, a long time ago. Mostly, I just tried to stay healthy, eat right, and work hard. I don’t recall any serious illnesses, honestly. My wife handled all the doctor appointments and paperwork. I just went along for the ride.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It’s common for details to become less clear over time, especially regarding past medical history. And it sounds like your wife was very diligent in managing your healthcare. Did you ever have any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that I remember. And… oh! I had a hernia operation, years ago. Something popped out, and they fixed it. That was… painful, but I recovered alright. I don’t think there were any others. Nothing major, anyway. I tried to avoid hospitals as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, an appendectomy and a hernia repair. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, lung problems, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… family. That’s… complicated. My parents, they both lived to a good age, but I don’t really know what they died of. My mother… she had trouble breathing near the end, I think. But I don’t know if it was anything serious. And my father… he just… wore out, I guess. He worked hard all his life. As for my siblings… my brother had something with his heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. We weren’t very close, you see. It’s hard to say what runs in the family. Nobody really talked about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brodie. It’s not uncommon for families to not discuss medical history openly. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, right. Just this little blue pill. The doctor gave it to me for my blood pressure. I take one every morning. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are really bothering me. It's a white pill, but I don't remember the name. That’s about it, I think. I try not to take too many pills. They make me feel… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for blood pressure and something as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I can eat most foods, no problems there. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just from the dry air, I think. No, I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. My wife always asked me if I was allergic to anything before giving me new food or medicine, though. She was very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, Brodie, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My wife always said I was a good patient. I just hope I don't faint. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brodie. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, and I hear some diminished breath sounds and crackles in your lungs. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated as well, and your throat is a little red. These findings are consistent with a possible respiratory issue. I'm also going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. Given your age and these findings, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… Is it serious, Doctor? Is something really wrong? I haven't felt that bad. Just this cough, you know. And a little tired. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, go ahead. But I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. I’m an old man, Doctor. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Brodie. It's not necessarily serious, but given your age and the findings from the exam—the diminished breath sounds, crackles, and slightly low oxygen saturation—an X-ray will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we're providing the best possible care. It's a routine procedure, and it will give us valuable information. It's better to be safe and have a clear picture of what's going on. We can also order a basic blood test to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that as well?
PATIENT: Blood test… and an X-ray… Oh, alright. If you think it's best, Doctor, then do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain everything to me clearly, okay? I don't understand all the medical jargon. And… could you tell me what I need to do to prepare for these tests? I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brodie. I will explain everything in plain language. For the chest X-ray, you don't need to do any special preparation. You’ll simply need to remove any jewelry around your neck and upper chest. The technician will position you in front of the X-ray machine and take a few images. It's quick and painless. For the blood test, you’ll need to fast for about eight hours beforehand—meaning no food or drinks, except for water. We'll draw a small amount of blood from your arm, and it will be sent to the lab for analysis. Do you have any questions about either of these tests?
PATIENT: Eight hours… no food… Oh dear. That might be difficult. I get hungry easily. But… alright. I can manage. Eight hours. I’ll try my best. And… what will the blood test tell you? What are you looking for? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: The blood test will give us a broader picture of your overall health. We'll be checking things like your white blood cell count, which can indicate an infection, your kidney and liver function, and your electrolyte levels. It will also help us assess your blood sugar levels and rule out any other potential issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s not necessarily looking for anything serious, Brodie. It’s more of a precautionary measure to get a complete understanding of what’s going on and ensure we’re on the right track. I’ll order the tests now and schedule you for the chest X-ray as soon as possible. We'll have the results back within a few days, and I’ll call you to discuss them. In the meantime, please try to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers everything. You’ve explained it very clearly, Doctor. I just want to feel better, you know? It’s hard getting old. But… thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything. I appreciate it. When should I stop eating? Eight hours before the test… so if the test is tomorrow morning… I should stop eating after dinner tonight, then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. I understand. Getting old does come with its challenges, and I'm glad I can help. And yes, you are exactly right. If the test is tomorrow morning, you should stop eating after dinner tonight. You can still drink water, but no food or other beverages. I'll have my nurse schedule the X-ray for you now and provide you with detailed instructions. If you have any questions or concerns between now and then, please don't hesitate to call the office. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Brodie?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience and kindness. Thank you again. I’ll see you when the test results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brodie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. My nurse will be right in with the scheduling information. .
