DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, it’s about my… well, my business. You know, what comes out the other end. It’s black. Dark as night, it is. And I take those pills, the ones for the aches, every day. Been taking them for years. Don't know what else to tell ya. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Right. Black stools. And you mentioned pills for aches – are those prescription medications, or something over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Prescription, of course. Do I look like the sort to mess around with drugstore remedies? Honestly, the questions some doctors ask these days… They're supposed to know these things. It’s naproxen. Five-hundred milligrams, twice a day. Always have been. And it helps, mind you, but now… this. It started a couple of weeks ago, I reckon. Maybe three. I’m not a calendar keeper.
DOCTOR: I understand. Naproxen, twice daily for how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years. Years, I tell you. Must be… fifteen years, at least. Maybe more. I can’t rightly recall the exact date, and frankly, it’s not important. What is important is this black stuff. It's worrying. My husband, bless his soul, keeps telling me to come in, but I hate doctors. Always poking and prodding. And these questions! It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the color change, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, it’s not diarrhea, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s… solid. Just black. And a bit… sticky, maybe? Not like normal, you know. And sometimes, after I go, I feel a little… weak. Just a bit shaky. Nothing major, mind you, but noticeable. Honestly, I'm not one to complain. I just want to know what’s causing this and if it's serious. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sticky consistency and post-excretion weakness. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever?
PATIENT: No fever. Definitely no vomiting. And pain… well, a bit of a rumble sometimes, but nothing to write home about. Old age, you know. Everything creaks and groans. I don’t do “pain” unless it’s absolutely necessary. Nausea? No. Just… uncomfortable. And a bit worried, if I’m honest. This black stuff… it doesn’t seem right. Are you going to do some tests or what? I haven't got all day to sit here answering questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, I understand your concern and your desire for a quick resolution. Black, tarry stools are always something we need to investigate. It can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. While it may be nothing serious, it's important to rule out potential causes. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and checking your vital signs. After that, I'll order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood, and likely a complete blood count to assess for anemia. Depending on those results, we may need to consider further testing, such as an endoscopy. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Endo… what now? Look, I don’t need a lot of fancy tests. Just tell me what’s wrong. Is it serious? Am I going to need surgery? Because I'm telling you right now, I do not do surgery. I just want a simple answer. And I need something for this… whatever it is. Something to stop the blackness. Is it the pills? Is that what it is? They always have side effects, those things. Just tell me straight. No lectures, no fancy words. I’m a practical woman.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached that we use to visualize the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of the bleeding, if that is indeed what’s happening. It's too early to say definitively if it's the pills, Ms. Hatchard, but naproxen can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, especially with long-term use. However, other things can cause this as well. We need to rule those out. I understand your reluctance towards surgery, and we will certainly explore all other options first. Before we discuss any further procedures, let's start with the stool test and blood work. That will give us a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. Now, if you’ll please lie down on the exam table, I’d like to listen to your abdomen. It’s a routine part of the evaluation.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a roast in the oven. And don't expect me to be happy if it's ruined because I’m stuck here all afternoon. Abdomen, you say? Just hurry up, please. I really don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you lie on your back, I'll just listen for any unusual sounds. This won’t take long. Please relax as much as possible. Normal bowel sounds, slightly diminished, but no bruits or other concerning findings at this time. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No. Not particularly. A bit of a rumble, maybe, like I said before. Old age, you know. Everything shakes and rattles. Don't poke too hard, though. I bruise easily. Honestly, I'm not a fan of being touched. Just get it over with. Are we done yet? I can smell the roast burning already.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant tenderness. I'm going to order the stool test and blood work now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It will take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend temporarily stopping the naproxen, if possible, unless you have a specific reason you need to continue it. Is that feasible?
PATIENT: Stop the naproxen? Hmm. My hips ache, you know. Badly. I need something for the pain. It's why I take it in the first place. Honestly, I don't think I can stop it. What am I supposed to do, lie in bed all day? Look, just tell me how long this is going to take. And if it's going to cost me a fortune. I'm on Medicare, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed with the testing as planned. I understand your concerns about the pain, and we will discuss alternative pain management options once we have the test results. The stool test and blood work will be covered by Medicare, with your standard co-pay. As for the potential cost of further testing, if needed, we will review that with you before proceeding with anything. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once that's done, you are free to go. We will call you with the results in a few days. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. Just… hurry up. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I hate needles. Honestly, it’s a nuisance, the whole thing. A complete waste of my time. .
