DOCTOR: Hello Betty, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Lovely to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Land sakes, now you've got me thinkin’. It’s somethin’ about… not hearin’ so good, I reckon. It's been gettin’ worse, you see. Not sure when it started, exactly. Everything just seems… muffled, like talkin’ underwater.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing… that's good to know. It's common as we get older, but we definitely want to figure out what's going on. You said it’s been getting worse… can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… now that’s a tough one. Seems like… a long while now. Maybe a year? Or two? I used to be able to hear the birds singin’ real clear out in the garden, but now… not so much. And the TV… I have to turn it up awful loud, and even then it's hard to make out the words. My nephew, Billy, he says I yell a lot. He’s a good boy, Billy.
DOCTOR: Billy sounds like he cares about you. It's good you have family looking out for you. So, a year or two… that gives us a starting point. And it's affecting both the birds outside and the TV… Okay. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… slow, I think. Not like one day I just couldn’t hear anymore. More like… things just faded a little bit at a time. It’s hard to say exactly, you see. My memory ain't what it used to be. I remember workin’ in the shoe factory, clear as a bell… but ask me what I had for breakfast, and I'm lost.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Betty. It’s very common for memory to change as we age. We’ll take our time. So, it's been a gradual fading of sounds… And are you having any trouble hearing in specific situations, like when there's a lot of background noise?
PATIENT: Oh yes, now you mention it! Background noise… that's the worst. If folks are talkin’ and the radio's on, it’s just a jumble of sounds. Can't pick nothin’ out. And restaurants… forget about it! Just a whole lot of chatter, and I can’t understand a word anyone’s sayin’. Makes it hard to enjoy a nice meal with friends, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so background noise makes it significantly harder… That gives us a good clue. Now, have you ever had any ringing in your ears, or any pain or pressure in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm… sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. It comes and goes, mostly when things are quiet. Not constant, thankfully. And no pain, no. Never any pain. Just… can’t hear so good. And that little whine when it’s quiet. It doesn’t bother me too much, to be honest. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing in your ears… good to know. And no pain. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work, or during any hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, the shoe factory! Land sakes, yes, it was loud. All them machines… thumpin’ and whirrin’ all day long. We didn't have much in the way of ear protection back then, not like they do now. Just… got used to it, I suppose. And hobbies… not really. Used to garden a lot, but that weren’t noisy. Mostly just the birds singin’, which I can’t hear so good anymore, anyways.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exposure to loud noises at the shoe factory… that's a significant piece of the puzzle. It sounds like you may have some noise-induced hearing loss. Before we jump to any conclusions, though, I’d like to do a quick hearing test, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A hearin’ test? Oh, alright dear, if you think it’s best. I’ll do whatever you say. I trust your judgement. Seems sensible enough. I reckon I'm not gettin’ any younger, and I wouldn't mind knowin’ for sure what’s goin’ on with these ears of mine.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It’s a very simple test, Betty, and it shouldn’t take long at all. We'll do it right here in the room. I'm going to put these headphones on you, and you'll hear some beeps and tones at different pitches and volumes. Just tell me when you can hear them, and when you can’t. Sound good?
PATIENT: Beeps and tones… alright. Sounds easy enough. I’ll do my best. My ears have been playin’ tricks on me lately, so I hope I don’t mess it up. Just let me know if I'm doin' somethin' wrong, dear.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll guide you through the whole process, and we can take breaks whenever you need. Don't worry about messing anything up, just be honest with me about what you hear, or don't hear. Okay, let's start. I’m going to put these headphones on you now. Can you hear me okay through these?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, I can hear you just fine. They're a little snug, but alright. Ready when you are. Let's get this over with, eh?
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. I'm going to start with your right ear. I'll play a series of beeps at different pitches. Please raise your hand only when you hear a beep, no matter how faint. Don't guess, just let me know when you are certain you hear something. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright dear, I’ll do my best. Raise my hand when I hear a beep. No guessin’. Sounds simple enough. Go ahead when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, we’re all done. Thank you for your patience. Now, I need a few moments to review the results. …Okay. It appears you have moderate to severe hearing loss in both ears, particularly in the higher frequencies. This is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss, likely from your time working in the shoe factory. The ringing in your ears, or tinnitus, is also common with this condition.
PATIENT: Oh. Moderate to severe, you say? That sounds… serious. Noise-induced, from the factory… well, I figured as much. Always thought those machines were awful loud. And the ringing… so that’s what that is. What does this… mean, dear?
DOCTOR: It means that it will be more difficult for you to hear certain sounds, especially softer sounds and higher-pitched sounds like birdsong or some people’s voices. It also explains why you're having trouble hearing in noisy environments. It doesn’t mean you’re going completely deaf, and there are things we can do to help. The good news is, we can explore options like hearing aids. They can amplify sounds and make it much easier for you to communicate. We can also discuss strategies for coping with tinnitus, such as white noise machines or relaxation techniques. There are also support groups for people with hearing loss, which can be very helpful. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I’ve always thought of them as somethin’ for… old folks, I suppose. I didn’t think I was quite old enough for hearin’ aids yet! But… I suppose if they can help… What are they like, dear? And… do they cost a lot of money? Medicare… will that cover any of it?
DOCTOR: That's a very common thought, Betty. Hearing aids have come a long way in recent years. They're much smaller, more discreet, and more comfortable than they used to be. Many are nearly invisible! They also have advanced features like noise cancellation and Bluetooth connectivity. As for cost, they can be expensive, unfortunately. However, Medicare does cover a portion of the cost of hearing evaluations and some of the costs associated with hearing aids, but coverage can vary depending on your specific plan and the type of hearing aid. We have an audiologist who specializes in working with Medicare patients and can help you navigate the coverage process. They can also discuss different models and price points to find something that fits your budget and needs. Would you like me to schedule an appointment with the audiologist?
PATIENT: An appointment with an audiologist… yes, that sounds good, dear. I reckon I need someone who really knows about these things to explain it all to me. And help me with the Medicare… that always seems so complicated. Yes, please, schedule me an appointment. As soon as possible, if you can. I’m tired of missin’ out on conversations and… well, just not hearin’ things properly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Betty. I can schedule you an appointment with Dr. Evans, our audiologist, for next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00… yes, that should be fine. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better just knowin’ there’s somethin’ we can do about it.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I’ll have the receptionist send you a reminder text and email. In the meantime, are there any other questions or concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, dear, I think that’s all for today. You’ve answered everything I was wonderin’ about. Just lookin’ forward to seein’ Dr. Evans on Tuesday. Thank you again for your patience and kindness.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Betty. It was my pleasure. Remember, we’re here to help in any way we can. I’ll see you next Tuesday. Have a good rest of your day and try not to strain to hear things—we'll get this sorted out!
PATIENT: Thank you, dear. You too. I will. Goodbye now.
