DOCTOR: Alright, Jeannemarie, 41 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I’ve been coughing up… blood. Just a little bit, but it scared me. It happened a few times now, over the past week.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not a lot, like… just spots, really. More like streaks in the… phlegm. I didn’t know what to do, so I thought I should come see a doctor. It’s a little frightening, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. Spots, you say. Well, it is good you came in, though I'm sure it’s nothing serious. People get worried over the smallest things. Now, when you cough it up… is it with every cough, or just some?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not every cough. Just… sometimes. Maybe two or three times a day, when it happens. It's not… predictable, if that makes sense. I can't say "after I exercise" or "when I wake up." It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, then. Hmm. And have you been feeling unwell otherwise?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I’ve been a little tired, but I work long hours. I’m a physical therapist, so… it's normal to be tired. No fever, no chills. Just… the coughing, and the blood. And a little… worried, of course.
DOCTOR: A physical therapist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I have my own small practice. It keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. I help people get better, which is nice. But it’s hard when I’m not feeling well, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Well, physical work can sometimes cause minor irritation. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… um. Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a child, a long time ago. And… my husband passed away a few years back. But… no serious illnesses. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. I usually see a doctor for check-ups, but… nothing major.
DOCTOR: I see. And your family?
PATIENT: My family… my parents are both gone now. And I don’t have any siblings. My husband’s family is… far away, in Japan. We didn’t keep in close contact. I’ve been mostly on my own since… well, since he passed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I haven't ever had a bad reaction to anything. I can take most common medicines, I believe. I don't take anything regularly, except for… sometimes a pain reliever for my back, after work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick listen to your lungs then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. Breathing sounds are… mostly clear. A little bit of… wheezing on the exhale, but nothing too concerning. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation. 97%. Good. It’s likely just a minor irritation. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My husband didn’t either. I try to be healthy, as much as I can. It’s just… the blood worries me, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Well, these things can happen. A minor bronchitis, perhaps. Now, can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Um… it’s… bright red. Not dark. And it’s not a lot, like I said. Just streaks, mixed in with the… the mucus. It doesn’t… smell, if that makes sense. I know that sounds strange, but I was trying to think of how to describe it.
DOCTOR: Bright red, not dark… alright. You know, sometimes vigorous coughing can just irritate the airways, cause a little bit of bleeding. It's not always something serious. But just to be safe, I'm going to order a chest X-ray. Just to rule out anything more significant.
PATIENT: Oh. An X-ray? Okay. If you think it’s best, Doctor. I… I just want to know what’s going on. It’s good to be sure, I suppose. Is it… painful?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s not painful at all. It's a quick scan. The radiology department is just down the hall. The nurse will get you set up. We’ll get the results back within a few hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a cough suppressant, just to ease the irritation. And try to get some rest. Don’t push yourself too hard. We'll see what the X-ray shows, and then we’ll go from there. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to see me and explain everything. A cough suppressant sounds good. And I will try to rest, as you suggest. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse will be in shortly. Get the X-ray done, and we’ll see. Try not to worry. It's probably just a minor irritation. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you again for your time. I’ll go wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Alright. You do that.
