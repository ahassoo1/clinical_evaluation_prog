DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s rather inconvenient to be here. I have a very busy schedule, you see. But…well, my vision and hearing seem to be…fading. It came on quite suddenly, and it's unsettling. I suppose that’s what prompted this visit. I’d like to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about a recent and sudden change in your vision and hearing, and you’d like to get to the bottom of it efficiently. That’s perfectly reasonable. Let's start with the vision. Can you describe exactly how it's fading?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How…well, it’s not as if there’s a clear explanation. It's just…dimmer. Everything seems a bit…grey. And blurry around the edges, perhaps. I don’t recall any specific moment it began, truthfully. Things just…aren’t as sharp as they used to be. It’s quite bothersome when I’m trying to read, naturally. I have important documents to review, you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, a gradual dimming and blurring, more noticeable with reading. And you haven’t experienced any sudden vision loss, like a curtain coming down, or spots or flashes of light?
PATIENT: No, no curtains. Heavens, no. Just…a general lessening. A sort of…opacity, I suppose. I really don't concern myself with the details. I simply want it fixed. Are we getting anywhere? I do have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I haven't even begun to select an outfit.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sudden changes, just a gradual dimming and blurring. I understand your concern and desire to be efficient. Let’s move on to the hearing. You mentioned that’s been fading as well. Can you describe that?
PATIENT: It’s…difficult to explain. People seem to be mumbling more, I think. Or perhaps they’ve always mumbled and I'm only now noticing. My staff, for instance, constantly repeat themselves. It’s quite unprofessional, really. And I find myself asking "What?" far too often. It’s…irritating, to say the least. Do you need a precise account of every conversation? Because I assure you, I haven’t the time.
DOCTOR: No, a general sense of people sounding muffled and needing repetition is helpful. And it's understandable that it’s frustrating. Do you notice it more in quiet or noisy environments?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t bothered to analyze it to that extent. Both, I suppose. Everywhere is rather noisy these days. And when it is quiet, it’s just…a general lack of clarity. I'm a surgeon, you know. I require clear communication. This is…disruptive. Are you writing all of this down? Because I’m not sure it’s particularly relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm documenting everything, Ms. Julie. It is relevant. Okay, so difficulty in both quiet and noisy environments. Now, let's briefly go through some other areas. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or hissing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Buzzing? Goodness, no. I haven't the slightest idea. I don't sit around listening for noises in my ears, Doctor. I have patients to attend to. Honestly, this is…tedious. Are you going to ask me about every conceivable ailment now? I'm a healthy woman. This vision and hearing…it must be a temporary affliction. A virus, perhaps?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. I'm just trying to gather information to understand what might be going on. No, I won't go through every ailment. Okay, let’s move on. Have you experienced any dizziness or balance problems recently?
PATIENT: Balance problems? Doctor, I perform delicate surgeries for a living! My hands are steady as a rock. I have never had a balance problem. I find this line of questioning rather insulting, truthfully. I suppose anyone can experience a bit of lightheadedness from time to time, but nothing of consequence. Are we nearing the end of this…inquisition?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel insulting, Ms. Julie. I assure you, that is not my intention. I'm just trying to rule out different possibilities. Alright. Let’s skip the detailed review for now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to assess your vision and hearing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, finally. An actual examination. Yes, Doctor, please do get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. And please be quick about it. I have a reputation to maintain, you understand. I haven’t the time to be sitting here all day while you…poke and prod.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. If you could sit facing that chart over there, please. I'm going to start with a simple vision test. Could you please read the smallest line you can see on this chart?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather small print. I haven't the eyesight I once had, you know. …E…F…P…Oh, goodness. This is impossible. It’s all…blurry. I can barely make out the larger letters, let alone these tiny ones. Are you certain this chart is correctly illuminated? It seems rather dim.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's try this again. Don't strain your eyes. Just read whatever you can see. We're just trying to get a baseline. Okay, I'm noting approximately 20/70 vision in each eye. That means you can see at 70 feet what a person with normal vision can see at 20 feet. Now, let’s check your hearing. I'm going to put some headphones on you and play some tones at different pitches. Please indicate when you hear a tone, even if it’s very faint.
PATIENT: Headphones, you say? Honestly, this is rather inconvenient. I detest having things placed on my head. But…very well. Get it over with. Quickly, if you please. I have a luncheon. Proceed. But if it’s too loud, I will stop you immediately. I have sensitive ears, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Just let me know when you hear a tone – any tone at all. This will just take a few moments. Okay…and…?
PATIENT: Nothing. Nothing at all. Oh…wait. Yes…faintly. Very faintly. There. Did you hear that? It was barely audible. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure if this machine is functioning correctly. It seems rather…subtle. Proceed, I suppose. But do hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. Thank you for your patience. The results show moderate hearing loss in both ears, primarily affecting higher frequencies. Based on the vision and hearing tests, and your description of the symptoms, it appears you're experiencing a combination of presbyopia – age-related farsightedness – and presbycusis – age-related hearing loss. These are common conditions, Ms. Julie, and often occur simultaneously. However, the sudden onset you mentioned does warrant further investigation to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Age-related? Honestly, Doctor, I have always taken excellent care of myself. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly, and I maintain a rigorous skincare routine. I find that diagnosis…unsatisfactory. And "sudden onset" is quite accurate, if you'll recall. Are you suggesting I'm simply…old? Because I assure you, I am far from it. What further investigation are you proposing? And how long will that take? Because, frankly, I do not have time for endless tests. This is becoming quite disruptive to my schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Julie. I’m not suggesting you are simply old, but age is a significant risk factor for these conditions. The sudden onset is precisely why I want to rule out other possibilities – such as a viral infection affecting the inner ear, or less common neurological causes. I recommend an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture. It’s a non-invasive scan that can help us identify any underlying issues. It will take about 30-45 minutes. While we wait for the results, I can prescribe glasses to correct your vision, and we can discuss the possibility of hearing aids. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds…unpleasant. And time-consuming. But…very well. If it’s absolutely necessary to rule out these…hypothetical infections, then I suppose I can spare the time. But I expect a prompt turnaround. I do not wish to be kept waiting. And glasses are acceptable, I suppose. As for hearing aids…I’ll consider it. But I’m not making any promises. Please expedite the scheduling of this MRI, Doctor. And do send a referral to a reputable optician. I require the best possible care, you understand. And if this inconvenience causes any disruption to my professional commitments, you will be held accountable. Is that clear? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a luncheon to attend. .
DOCTOR: Perfectly clear, Ms. Julie. I will immediately send the referral to a highly-rated optician and arrange for the MRI. We'll prioritize getting you scheduled as quickly as possible, and I'll contact you as soon as the results are available. Here’s a copy of the referral and some information about the MRI procedure. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you enjoy your luncheon, Ms. Julie. And please do call if anything changes.
