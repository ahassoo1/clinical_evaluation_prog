DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Honestly? It’s my… well, it’s my poop. It’s black. Like… really black. And I take those pills, you know, for my arthritis. The red ones. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what’s doing it? I just want to know if I’m dying or something, frankly. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Black stools, you say. And you’re concerned it’s related to your arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s exactly it. The red pills. I told you. They're... naproxen, I think? My husband gets them for me. I take two every morning, sometimes three if my knees are acting up. Honestly, I don’t see what’s so hard to understand. It’s the pills! Are they making me bleed inside or something? Because if they are, I want different ones. I have a garden to tend, you know. I can't be laid up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID. It can cause gastrointestinal upset, and in some cases, bleeding. But we need to determine the cause definitively. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Like what? Honestly, I don’t sit around examining my… you know. I just noticed the color. And it’s not a little bit black, it’s… tar-like. Like oil. Is that bad? Look, I'm 73 years old. I don't need a lecture about fiber. Just tell me if it’s serious or not. I have tomatoes to can.
DOCTOR: Tar-like stools are concerning, Ms. Hatchard. It suggests the bleeding is higher up in the digestive tract. Now, I need to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weakness?
PATIENT: Weakness? Well, I get tired, but that's just getting old, isn't it? And my stomach… it's a bit rumbley sometimes. Like when I eat too much cabbage. But no vomiting, no. And no real pain, just… discomfort. Honestly, I think you're making a big deal out of nothing. Is it just me, or are doctors these days always trying to find something wrong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, it's my job to investigate any change in your health, even if it seems minor to you. Discomfort and changes in bowel habits can indicate a serious issue. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, besides the black color?
PATIENT: No! Just black. Like I said, tar-like. Look, I’m not a fool. I know what blood looks like. This isn’t bright red, it’s… dark. And it’s been going on for… oh, maybe a week? A little less? I don’t keep a log of my… output, if that’s what you’re expecting. I just want a quick answer. Can you just give me something to fix it and be done with it? I have a prize-winning zucchini to get to the fair.
DOCTOR: A week of tar-like stools is significant. Ms. Hatchard, I understand you're busy, but we need to rule out a serious cause for this. I'm going to need to perform a physical exam, and I'm going to order some lab work, including a complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood. We may also need to consider further investigation, such as a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Absolutely not! You want to put a camera where?! Look, I’ve lived a long life. I don't need poking and prodding. And I certainly don't need a camera shoved up… well, you know. I’ll just stop taking the pills, alright? Is that good enough? I’ll suffer through the arthritis. Honestly, doctors these days… it’s all just money, isn’t it? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Hatchard, stopping the naproxen without a diagnosis isn’t advisable. It could be masking a serious underlying issue. While I respect your concerns, I strongly recommend further investigation. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting problems in the colon, and it's a relatively safe procedure. I understand your reluctance, but we need to prioritize your health. I will refer you to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ramirez, who can discuss the procedure in detail and address your concerns. Would you like me to schedule that appointment for you?
