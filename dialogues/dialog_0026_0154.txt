DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… it’s about my waterworks, I suppose. They’ve been… troublesome. Honestly, I don’t remember exactly when it started, just that it keeps happening again and again. It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I just want it to stop happening, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Claudene. “Troublesome waterworks” is a perfectly good way to describe it. And don't worry about the timing, it's common to not remember exact dates. Could you tell me a little more about what’s happening?
PATIENT: Well… it burns, when I… you know. And I have to go so often. It’s a nuisance, really. I have to stop on long drives, which is a problem with my job… I fix those… those camper things. Recreational Vehicles, that’s it. It interrupts everything. And I worry about… finding a restroom. It's just… disruptive. I don't recall if it hurts before or after, or… honestly, it's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequent trips to the restroom, and it's interfering with your work… I understand. It sounds quite distressing, especially with your job requiring travel. You mentioned not being sure if the pain is before or after – that's alright. We’ll try to sort things out. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any lower back pain along with this?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… I don’t think so. I… I really don’t remember. I try not to look, if you understand. It’s… unpleasant. Back pain… sometimes my back aches. But I'm an old woman, Doctor. Everything aches! It’s hard to say if it's related… or just… old age. Perhaps it is just the sitting. I sit a lot when I'm fixing things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Claudene. And it's perfectly reasonable not to want to look. It’s good you’re telling me about the back pain, even if it's hard to pinpoint. We’ll take everything into consideration. Now, thinking about your overall health… do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… conditions. Let me think… I was married, once. A long time ago. Divorced, now. Does that count as a condition? No… I don’t think so. I try to eat reasonably well, although sometimes it’s hard on the road. I don’t have… well, I haven’t been to a doctor in… quite a while. I don’t really have any conditions, that I’m aware of. No, I'm fairly… robust, for my age. I work hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. That’s helpful. And it sounds like you stay quite active with your work, which is good. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me see… Oh! Yes. A very long time ago. When I was… much younger. It was my… appendix. They took it out. That’s all I remember. And… honestly, Doctor, that was… decades ago. I don’t recall any others. It was a very simple procedure, as far as I know. Everything healed just fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, an appendectomy many years ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical problems that run in your family – perhaps heart trouble, diabetes, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she was a very strong woman. Spanish, you know. She lived to be… well, quite old. I don't recall her having any… problems. My father… he worked with horses. Strong man, also. He… broke a leg, once. But that wasn’t a condition, exactly. As for anything else… no, not that I recall. We didn't really… talk about such things. It wasn’t the custom.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. That’s alright; we’ll work with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t take anything. I believe in… natural remedies. And honestly, I don’t really like taking pills. I try to stay healthy. Sometimes I have a cup of chamomile tea if I can't sleep, but that’s it. No, no medications at all, Doctor. None.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. That’s good to know. Now, just to finish up with some basic questions, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmmm. Let me think… I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. I’m not allergic to anything I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy if I use a certain kind of soap, but that’s not a serious allergy. No, I don’t have any real allergies, Doctor. None.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Claudene, it sounds like you’ve been dealing with burning with urination and frequent trips to the bathroom. To help me understand what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your abdomen and do a quick urine test. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a test. And an exam? Well… I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a camper to fix, you know. And I promised Mr. Henderson I’d have it ready by the weekend. But… yes. If it’s necessary. Just… please be quick?
DOCTOR: Of course, Claudene. I’ll be as quick as possible. The urine test will just involve a small sample, and the abdominal exam will be gentle. It helps us rule out a few things. Would you mind stepping onto the scale so I can get your current weight?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A weight, you say? I haven’t weighed myself in… ages. Probably lost a few pounds, working so hard. But alright. There. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, 119 pounds. Thank you, Claudene. And just a quick measurement of your height, if you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… Height? It’s been a long time since anyone asked about my height. I used to be quite tall, you know. Is that alright? I hope I haven’t shrunk too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, 174 cm – excellent. Now, if you could just follow me over to this chair, and we’ll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Listening, you say? It all sounds very… thorough. Just please don't take too long, alright? Mr. Henderson is expecting that camper.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds normal on initial listen. No immediate concerns there. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please tell me if anything feels painful. I’ll start here, on the right side. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… That's… alright. A little firm, perhaps. I've been sitting a lot lately, you know, fixing those campers. It probably just feels a bit… tight. Not painful, exactly. Just… aware of it, if you understand. Please don't press too hard, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, just checking. And here, on the left side?
PATIENT: Oh… a little more… sensitive there, perhaps? Not a sharp pain, but… a little uncomfortable. It's hard to say if it's related to the camper, or… something else. Perhaps I slept in a funny position. It comes and goes, you know. It's not constant. Just be gentle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, and down here, in the lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Oh… Oh dear. Yes… that’s… a bit more tender. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. Like a… a dull ache. Perhaps that's where the trouble is. It's been bothering me for a little while now, to be honest. It comes and goes, you know, but it's… persistent. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for letting me know. That gives me some helpful information. Now, to help narrow down the possibilities, I'd like to collect a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It will just be a quick test to check for infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… A urine sample. Yes, alright. If you think it's necessary. It’s a bit… inconvenient, but… alright. Just… please tell me exactly what to do? It's been a long time since I’ve… done this. And where is the restroom?
DOCTOR: Of course. Here’s a cup, and these instructions explain everything. It’s very simple. The restroom is just over there, through that door. Please wash your hands before and after, and try to collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-flow. And please bring the cup back to me when you’re finished. Take your time. I'll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Oh… very well. Mid-stream, you say? It all sounds so… technical. But alright. I’ll try my best. Please excuse me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Claudene. I'll send this off to the lab for analysis. It should give us some answers. While we're waiting for the results, do you have any other symptoms that you haven't mentioned yet – things like fever, chills, back pain, or nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness that's over. No… no fever, not that I know of. No chills, either. My back aches sometimes, as I said, but that's just… old age. And no, I haven’t been feeling nauseous. Just… tired, sometimes. But that’s probably from working so hard. No, I don't think I have any other symptoms, Doctor. Just… the troublesome waterworks, and a bit of tenderness down there.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or nausea. Just the urinary symptoms and lower abdominal tenderness. Now, given your symptoms, and the fact that you haven't been to a doctor in a while, I’m going to start by considering a few possibilities. A urinary tract infection is one possibility, which is why we sent off the urine sample. Another possibility could be something related to your bladder, or even a gynecological issue. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I would recommend a pelvic exam. This would allow me to examine your bladder and other organs more closely. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… A pelvic exam? Well… I… I haven’t had one of those in… decades. Is it… necessary, Doctor? I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that. It sounds… invasive. And frankly, I promised Mr. Henderson I’d have that camper ready by the weekend.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Claudene. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. It’s been a long time, and it is a more personal exam. It would help me to get a more definitive diagnosis, which would allow me to recommend the best course of treatment. However, if you’re not comfortable with that right now, we can wait for the urine test results. If the results show an infection, we can start you on antibiotics. But if the antibiotics don't improve your symptoms, or if the urine test is negative, we would need to consider further investigation. Would you like to wait for the urine test results and see how things go?
PATIENT: Oh… Yes, Doctor. I think… I think I’d prefer to wait for the test results. I really don’t want to have an exam right now. I promised Mr. Henderson… and honestly, it’s all a bit overwhelming. If the antibiotics work, that would be wonderful. But if not… well, we can talk about it then. Yes, please. Let’s wait for the test results.
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. We will wait for the urine test results. It should take about 24-48 hours to come back. I'll call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe back pain, please don’t hesitate to call me or go to the nearest emergency room. To summarize, we’re suspecting a possible urinary tract infection. We’ve sent off a urine sample for analysis. If the results are positive, we’ll start you on antibiotics. If they’re negative, or if the antibiotics don’t improve your symptoms, we can discuss further investigation, including a pelvic exam. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… no, Doctor. I think… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. I just want to get better, and get back to fixing campers. I appreciate your patience. And thank you for not… pushing the exam. It made me feel… more comfortable. I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Claudene. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to work with you at your pace. And don’t worry, we’ll get you feeling better as soon as possible. Here’s my card. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I’ll be in touch as soon as the test results are back. Have a good day, and please get back to those campers!
