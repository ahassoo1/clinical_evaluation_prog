DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a bit of information from a doctor before I go. Just a check-up sort of thing, to make sure I’m fit enough to travel. Nothing serious, mind you.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Squiers. A pre-travel check-up is always a good idea. I see you’re 45 years old. And you said it's just a routine check-up for the cruise line, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Forty-five, and feeling it some days, I must admit! And yes, purely for the cruise. They have a rather detailed form, and it requests a doctor’s signature after confirming a few things. I’m a widow, by the way – lost my husband five years ago. No children, thankfully. Just wanted to give you a bit of background in case it's useful.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Squiers. It is helpful to have a complete picture. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult, and I appreciate you telling me. Let’s get started with gathering some information. To begin, can you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a good question. Let me think… I had a bout of bronchitis a few years back, a nasty one, but that cleared up completely with antibiotics. And…oh! I used to suffer from quite bad migraines, particularly when I was younger, but those have lessened significantly over time. I haven’t had a proper one in…well, it must be nearly ten years now. Apart from that…no, not as far as I recall. I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I do get a bit of arthritis in my hands, the kind that aches with the weather, but it’s not a diagnosed condition, if that makes sense. Just…old age creeping in, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, bronchitis a few years ago, migraines that have improved, and some arthritis-like aches in your hands. We’ll certainly document all of that. Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Let me see…yes, actually. Years ago, when I was quite young – about twenty years old – I had my appendix removed. It was quite sudden, a bit of a shock, but it all went well. And…oh! And I had a wisdom tooth out. That wasn't too bad, just a local anaesthetic. Apart from those two, no. No other surgeries at all, thankfully. Everything else has held together! I’m rather proud of that, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Appendix removal and wisdom tooth extraction. And you've had no other surgical procedures. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… That’s a bit tricky. My mother…she had high blood pressure, I believe, and she suffered a stroke in her later years. My father was quite a robust man, actually, but he did develop heart trouble towards the end. And… my grandmother on my mother’s side, she had diabetes. That’s all that springs to mind immediately. It wasn't a particularly chatty family, so we didn’t discuss medical things much. Not like these days, with everyone sharing everything!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Squiers. High blood pressure and stroke in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and diabetes in your maternal grandmother. That’s helpful information. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything, thankfully, and I've taken antibiotics and painkillers over the years without any trouble at all. I don’t have any sensitivities to pollen or animals or anything like that either. I’m quite fortunate in that regard, I think. My friend Moira is allergic to everything imaginable – it's quite a list! I consider myself very lucky.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Ms. Squiers. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. A bit of paracetamol now and then for a headache, perhaps, but that’s it. I believe in letting my body heal itself if possible. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just to be on the safe side, but it's not a regular thing. I prefer a healthy diet and a bit of fresh air. I think that’s the best medicine, really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Squiers. No regular medications or supplements. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never smoked in my life. My husband did, unfortunately, but I always detested it. As for alcohol, I enjoy a small glass of sherry with my dinner occasionally – a very small glass, mind you. It’s more of a habit than anything else. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I believe in a quiet life. I prefer a good book and a cup of tea, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. That's perfectly understandable. So, no smoking, occasional small glass of sherry, and no recreational drugs. Now, before we proceed with a quick physical exam, is there anything specific you’re concerned about or any symptoms you’ve been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel quite well, all things considered. My hands ache a bit when it’s cold, as I mentioned, but that’s nothing new. And…now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit tired lately, but I put that down to getting older! I’ve been sleeping reasonably well, though. I just thought it was a bit of a phase, really. I wouldn’t say it’s concerning me, but I thought I should mention it, just in case.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Squiers. A bit of fatigue and hand aches. We’ll certainly investigate those a bit further. Alright, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, take your blood pressure and pulse, and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I understand it’s all part of the process. I’m used to a bit of poking and prodding, to be honest. My mother always insisted on a thorough check-up with every doctor’s visit!
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not cause for immediate concern. Heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Pulse is 72 and regular. Reflexes are normal. Your thyroid feels normal as well. Now, just a quick look in your ears and throat... Ears and throat look fine. Do you have any pain in your hands?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. More of an ache, really. It's worse in the mornings, or when it’s cold and damp. Sometimes it makes it a bit difficult to open jars, but I manage. I've just gotten used to it over the years, I suppose. It doesn't keep me up at night or anything.
DOCTOR: I see some mild swelling and tenderness in your knuckles, Ms. Squiers. This is consistent with some mild arthritis, likely osteoarthritis. It doesn’t seem to be severe at this point, but it is something we should keep an eye on. I also notice a little dryness of the skin on your hands. To rule out other potential causes for your fatigue, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Just a routine complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin D level. It’ll give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Blood tests are fine. If it helps to get a better understanding of things, then I'm happy to have them. I don't mind a little prick, as long as it's for a good cause! And you mentioned Vitamin D – I don’t get out in the sun much, so I suppose that wouldn't be surprising.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll have the lab draw those for you now. The results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing with a healthy diet, staying hydrated, and trying to get some gentle exercise when you can. Given your upcoming cruise, it might be prudent to ensure you have a supply of hand cream to help with the dryness. And if your fatigue worsens, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Hand cream is a good idea – Moira always tells me I should use it! And I will be sure to contact you if anything changes. Thank you for being so thorough. I feel much more reassured now. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those blood test results to you as soon as they are available. If everything comes back normal, and you remain feeling well, you should be fit to enjoy your cruise! I’ll have the nurse come in and take your blood. Do you have any travel vaccinations planned?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good point. No, I haven’t thought about vaccinations yet, actually. I suppose I should look into that. The cruise line didn’t mention anything specifically, but it’s probably best to be on the safe side. Could you perhaps recommend somewhere I could get vaccinated, Doctor? I don’t know where to start. I wouldn’t want to go to the wrong place.
DOCTOR: Certainly. There's a travel clinic located at the community health center – about a 15-minute drive from here. They specialize in travel vaccinations and can advise you on what's recommended for the Mediterranean. Here’s the number and address. They are usually quite busy, so it would be best to call and schedule an appointment. And if you'd like, I can send your primary care records to them so they have a good overview of your health. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be absolutely wonderful, Doctor! Sending my records would be a great help. I always forget these things! The community health center sounds perfect – not too far away at all. You’ve been so thoughtful. I think that’s everything for now. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I’m looking forward to my cruise even more now, knowing I’m in good hands – literally and figuratively!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Squiers. I'm glad I could help alleviate your concerns. I’ll have the nurse send your records over to the travel clinic now. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your trip. Enjoy your cruise! And safe travels. .
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you too, Doctor! I certainly will. And thank you again for everything. Goodbye!
