DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… getting some information, really. A friend mentioned something about… a pill you can take to prevent things. Before anything happens, you know? I’m Helaina, by the way. And honestly, I’m a bit overwhelmed with all the information online. It’s… a lot.
DOCTOR: Right. Preventative care. That’s good, being proactive. Helaina, okay. Well, there are a number of options, depending on what you're trying to prevent, specifically. When your friend mentioned “a pill,” were they referring to something for heart health, maybe?
PATIENT: No, no, it wasn't for my heart. It was… about, well, avoiding HIV. That’s what she called it – PrEP. She said it’s really effective if you’re, you know, at risk. I’m not… I haven't been diagnosed with anything, thankfully. Just trying to be careful, especially now. It’s just… a lot of new people around, and you hear stories. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: PrEP, right. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. Yes, I'm familiar. It is effective, when taken consistently. And it’s… sensible, I suppose, to be cautious. "New people around"… hmm. Okay. So, to clarify, you're considering PrEP because you're concerned about potential exposure to HIV, despite not having been diagnosed with anything yourself?
PATIENT: Exactly. That's it perfectly. I… I don't want to need a diagnosis, you know? It's just… my niece is visiting from the States, and she’s… very open about things. And she suggested I talk to someone. She said it’s a lot less scary than people think. I’m just… worried about side effects, mostly. And whether it’s even right for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, age isn't necessarily a barrier, though we do consider overall health. Side effects are always a valid concern. Most people tolerate it well, but there can be some. We'll get to that. First, let's talk a little bit about your risk factors, beyond simply "new people around." Have you had any… recent changes in partners?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s been a while since… well, since anyone. I’m single, haven't been with anyone regularly for years. It’s more… I’ve been helping out at the community center, and there are a lot of folks coming and going. Different backgrounds, you know? And it just… made me think. It's probably silly, being worried at my age. I haven't even thought about… that sort of thing in a long time.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly to be cautious, Ms. Trefren. Community work does expose you to different situations. And it’s good you’re thinking about this now. Okay. So, you’re not currently sexually active, but you're concerned about potential exposure through your work at the community center. Have you had a recent general check-up?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one last year with Dr. Kamal. He’s retired now, though. It was… pretty standard. Blood pressure, cholesterol, the usual. I’m generally healthy, I think. I walk a lot, I try to eat well… you know, the things you’re supposed to do. I don’t smoke, I barely drink… I think I’m in pretty good shape for my age. Not that it necessarily helps with… all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dr. Kamal retired last month, good to know. And that's all helpful information – a generally healthy lifestyle is a good foundation. Now, before we discuss PrEP further, we need to do some baseline testing. We’ll need to check your kidney function, liver function, and run an HIV test, just to be sure. It’s standard procedure. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had one. But… the HIV test… that sounds a little scary, even if I don't think I need it. Is it a blood test? And… what if it is positive? I mean, I really don't think it is, but… what then? I haven’t been feeling sick or anything.
DOCTOR: It is a blood test, yes. And you're right to ask about a positive result. It's unlikely, given your history, but we need to be prepared. If it were positive, we would discuss treatment options immediately. HIV is a manageable condition these days, with very effective medications. We’d also discuss partner notification and support services. But, again, the likelihood is very low. We’re really just covering all our bases. I also want to mention that PrEP requires regular monitoring – kidney function checks, STI screenings – to ensure it’s safe and effective. Are you willing to commit to that?
PATIENT: Regular check-ups… I can do that. I mean, I want to be careful, and if that’s what it takes, then yes. That’s… manageable. And… manageable is good. I just… I don't want to be a bother. I’m sure you have lots of patients, and I'm just… an older woman worrying about things. And STI screenings… that sounds a little embarrassing. But… if it’s necessary… then I’ll do it. Is it a lot of blood work? Because I’m not great with needles.
DOCTOR: “Not great with needles,” okay. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Trefren. And frankly, regular health screenings are not a bother. It’s part of my job. The blood work for the initial PrEP assessment is fairly comprehensive – it includes a complete blood count, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an HIV test. After that, the follow-up tests are less extensive. And regarding the STI screening… it's discreet and confidential. We understand it can be sensitive, but it's essential for your health. Alright. Let’s get the paperwork started. I'll need some information about your insurance, and then we can schedule the blood work. Do you have your Medicare card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, here. Medicare. And… honestly, Doctor, are you sure this is even worth it? I mean, it seems like a lot of fuss for… someone like me. I’m probably just being silly. And wasting your time. But… if you think it’s best, then I’ll do whatever you say. I just… I don’t want to be a burden. It’s probably just my age getting to me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Trefren, while I understand your concerns, preventative care is always worthwhile. It's responsible of you to consider this, regardless of your age. And frankly, I have patients of all ages and backgrounds with similar concerns. We’ll get the lab order sent over, and the phlebotomist will call you to schedule an appointment. Try not to worry. It’s a standard procedure, and we'll take things one step at a time.
