DOCTOR: Talofa, Mikeisha! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is… good to meet you too. Um… my sinus. It is… bothering me. For… some time now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly how long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your sinus is bothering you. It's not always easy to pinpoint when things started, so that's alright. Can you tell me a little more about what's bothering you specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… full. Like… a lot of pressure. And sometimes… ache. Around my… face, yes. My nose… and cheeks. It’s not… a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. And I… I think it is hard to breathe sometimes, through my nose.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness, pressure, and aching around your face – nose and cheeks specifically – and some difficulty breathing through your nose. Does anything make it worse, Mikeisha?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Maybe… when it is cold? Yes. Cold air… makes it feel more full. And… dust. Dust makes it… harder to breathe. I work… with the drills, you see. A lot of dust. Not always, but… often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold air and dust seem to aggravate it. You mentioned working with drills – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. I… operate them. The rotary drills. For… oil and gas. It is… outside work. Sometimes in the dirt, sometimes… not. But there is always… something in the air. Little bits. It is… hard work, but I… I need to work. My husband… he needs help too.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're operating rotary drills for oil and gas, outdoor work, and exposure to dust is frequent. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the sinus pressure and breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Sometimes… I feel… tired. Very tired. More than usual. But… I work hard. So maybe that is why. And… I think I have a… a little cough. Not much. Just… sometimes in the mornings. It does not… bother me too much. Mostly just… a tickle.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and a slight cough, mostly in the mornings. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches with this?
PATIENT: No. No fever. No chills. And… no body aches. Just… the tiredness. And… the sinus. It is… mostly the sinus. I… I don't feel sick, sick. Just… uncomfortable. And tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, chills, or body aches. Just the sinus pressure, breathing difficulty, fatigue, and a mild cough. Have you noticed any discharge from your nose, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Discharge… yes. Sometimes. Mostly… clear. But… sometimes a little… yellow. Not a lot, though. Just… when I blow my nose. It is… not always there. More when the sinus… feels worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear to yellow nasal discharge, more prominent when the sinus pressure is worse. Have you tried anything to help relieve the symptoms – any over-the-counter medications, home remedies, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Um… my neighbor, she gave me… something. For the… cold. A little… bottle. I put it in the water. It tastes… funny. It did not… really help. And… I tried to use… the saline spray. From the store. But I… I don't like it. It… makes me cough more. So… I stopped. I mostly just… drink water. And try to rest when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, you tried a cold remedy from a neighbor and saline spray, but neither provided much relief. You mostly drink water and rest. And it sounds like the saline spray actually made your cough worse. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies or asthma?
PATIENT: Allergies… asthma… hmm. I don't… think so. I do not… remember being told. When I was little… my mother, she used… some herbs. For everything. But I don’t think… I’ve been to a doctor… much. Not for a long time. I don't remember being told about… allergies or asthma. No. I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or asthma. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No. No surgeries. And… no serious illnesses. I… I had a little… trouble with my stomach once. But it went away. It was… a long time ago. Nothing… serious. I’ve been… mostly healthy, I think. Until… this sinus problem.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous surgeries or serious illnesses, just a minor stomach issue a long time ago. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she… she had… trouble breathing sometimes. When she was old. But I don't know… what kind of trouble. She lived… far away. In El Salvador. My husband’s mother, she has… the arthritis. In her hands. That’s… all I really know. I don't… we don't talk about… health much. It is… not something we do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had some breathing trouble when she was older, and your husband’s mother has arthritis. What about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… just… the one for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I take it… every day. But that is… all. I do not… take many medications. I try to… not. Unless I really need them. And the doctor… he just gave me that one. For the blood pressure. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a medication for blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No. No allergies to medications. I have… never had a reaction. I am… very careful. I only take what the doctor tells me. I do not… experiment. No allergies. I am sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies. And just to confirm, you’re currently uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… correct. No insurance. It is… difficult. We are… trying to get it. But… it is hard. Very hard. It is… why I waited so long to come. I did not want to… be a bother. Or… expensive. But… it is getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Thank you for being open with me about that. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… alright. If you think it will… help. Please. Do what you need to do. I… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm just going to feel around your face to check for tenderness. And I’ll listen to your lungs to see if there’s any congestion. Let’s take a look at your throat. And I'll quickly check your ears. Okay, your sinuses are tender to the touch, especially on your forehead and around your cheeks. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your throat is a little red, but no significant swelling or exudate. Your ears look normal. I also noted a slightly elevated blood pressure reading of 140/90. It is elevated, but it is not alarming at the moment. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have sinusitis, an inflammation of your sinuses. The redness in your throat could be related to postnasal drip from the sinuses. And the elevated blood pressure may be a contributing factor. The fatigue and cough are likely symptoms related to the sinus infection.
PATIENT: Sinusitis… Is that… bad? What does that mean? And… postnasal drip? Is that… what is making my throat sore? I do not… understand. And my blood pressure? Is that… serious? I try to eat healthy. And I take my pill. Is something… wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's break it down. Sinusitis simply means your sinuses are inflamed – they’re swollen and irritated. It’s very common, and usually not serious, but it can be uncomfortable. Think of it like having a cold that lingers in your sinuses. Postnasal drip is exactly what it sounds like – mucus draining down the back of your throat. That’s likely what’s making your throat a little sore. As for your blood pressure, a reading of 140/90 is slightly elevated. It's not an emergency right now, but it's something we need to monitor. Your medication should be helping to keep it under control. We will want to get it checked out. For now, I recommend a few things. Plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the discomfort. A saline nasal rinse, even if you don’t love it, can help clear out the mucus. I also recommend a decongestant, but be careful if you have high blood pressure. I want you to try to avoid dust as much as possible while at work. Can you wear a mask, for example?
PATIENT: Fluids… rest… pain relievers… I can do that. The mask… yes, I think so. My supervisor… he is usually understanding. The saline… I will try. Even if I do not like it. But… if the blood pressure is high… should I not be working at all? What if… it gets worse? And… the medication… is it… the right one? I do not want to… make things worse. I just want to feel… better.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Mikeisha. You're right to ask. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the fact that your work involves dust exposure, I'm going to recommend you take a few days off, if possible, to see if the symptoms improve with rest and reduced exposure. It’s important to rule out any work-related factors aggravating your condition. As for the medication, it’s possible it needs adjusting. I'm going to write you a prescription for a different blood pressure medication. We'll see how that works. And to be safe, I'd like you to schedule an appointment with a primary care physician as soon as possible. They can monitor your blood pressure more closely and provide more comprehensive care. Since you are uninsured, I can refer you to a clinic that offers sliding scale fees. In the meantime, if you experience any severe symptoms – high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or difficulty breathing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: A few days off… different medication… a doctor… sliding scale… yes. That… that makes sense. Thank you. It is… a lot. But… thank you. You have… been very helpful. And the clinic… with the fees… that is… very good. I will… try to schedule an appointment. And… I will watch for the symptoms. The fever… the headache… I will be careful. Thank you, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mikeisha. It’s my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, taking care of yourself is the most important thing. Here's the prescription and a list of clinics offering sliding scale fees in the area. I'm also going to give you a work note explaining your need for a few days off for medical reasons. Get some rest, and please, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention if things don’t improve or worsen. Take care. .
PATIENT: .
