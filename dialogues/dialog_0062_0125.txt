DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I just… I wanted to get tested for HIV. I requested it, you know? It’s… just something I need to get done. Don't really want to talk about why why, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, no problem at all. You absolutely don’t need to share anything you’re not comfortable with. Getting tested is a responsible thing to do, and I respect your privacy. Okay, so you're requesting an HIV test today. Just to confirm, is there anything specific that prompted you to get tested now, or is this just a routine check for you?
PATIENT: Routine? No, definitely not routine. Look, I just… I have standards, alright? And I need to know. It’s… it's about being careful. Some people just aren't as… discerning as others, you know? And I need to protect myself. It’s common sense, really. Don’t see why I have to explain all this.
DOCTOR: I understand. You're being proactive about your health and want to be sure. That's excellent. No, you don’t need to explain anything at all. It sounds like you’re taking responsible steps to protect yourself, and I commend you for that. Before we proceed with the test, I just need to ask a few standard questions, if that’s alright. This will help me understand your risk factors a little better and ensure we choose the most appropriate testing method. It’s all confidential, of course. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't like all these questions. It feels… invasive. But fine, I guess. As long as it’s quick. Just… don’t ask me anything too personal, alright? I have a reputation to maintain. And I'm married. Just so you know. I expect discretion.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern about privacy, and I assure you, everything we discuss is confidential. I'll keep the questions as brief and relevant as possible, and I will absolutely respect your boundaries. Knowing you're married is helpful information, thank you for sharing that. Let's start with this: Have you ever had any previous HIV tests, and if so, do you know the results?
PATIENT: No. Never. This is my first time. Honestly, I wouldn't need to be here if people just… behaved. It's embarrassing, frankly. You'd think I'd raised better kids. But here we are. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult, and I want to assure you, I’m not here to judge at all. It takes courage to come in and get tested, and I respect you for taking this step. Okay, so this is your first HIV test. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever shared needles with anyone, even for non-medical reasons?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Are you serious? What kind of question is that? I have a perfectly respectable life. I wouldn’t dream of it. That’s… that’s appalling. Honestly, the things you doctors ask… It's insulting. I'm a homeowner. A taxpayer. Do you understand? I'm not some… reckless person. It's just… preposterous.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was insensitive or offensive. It's a standard part of the risk assessment, and I didn't intend to cause any discomfort. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, it wasn’t my intention to imply anything about your character. Let’s move on. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake! Are you trying to offend me? This is ridiculous. My wife… my wife would be furious if she knew you were asking me these things. It's just… outrageous. I’m a respectable man. I don’t engage in… that sort of behavior. It's insulting, frankly. You're insinuating things. I demand a different doctor. This is unprofessional. Do you have a supervisor I can speak to? Honestly, the lack of decorum. It's appalling. .
DOCTOR: Sir, I sincerely apologize. It seems I've upset you, and that was absolutely not my intention. I understand your frustration and I deeply regret causing any offense. You are right to be upset, and I apologize for the line of questioning. It's clear you're very concerned about privacy and discretion, and I haven't respected that. Let's stop this line of questioning immediately. Would you prefer I stop the consultation here, or would you be willing to let me explain why I ask these questions, and perhaps we can proceed with just the test itself, without further discussion of your personal history?
