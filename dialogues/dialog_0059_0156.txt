DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Chagaris. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, I guess. It’s been… not good, lately. I’ve been having a lot of diarrhea. Honestly, I can’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a while, though. It’s just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Persistent diarrhea can be quite disruptive. It's helpful you've come in to get it checked out. When you say "not good," could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it? Okay. It’s… watery, mostly. And… frequent. Like, a lot more often than usual. Sometimes it’s… I don’t know… kind of yellowish? And it smells… bad. Really bad. Sorry to be so graphic. I just… I don’t really know what else to say. It just… happens. A lot. And it makes me really tired.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jase. Providing details like that is very helpful. Frequent, watery, yellowish stools with a strong odor… that gives us a good starting point. And you mentioned fatigue. Is the fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. Like, after a really bad day with… everything happening, I’m completely wiped out. But some days are better. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there more often now than it used to be. It's hard to explain. I just feel… drained, a lot of the time. Even when I’ve had a decent night’s sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite draining, and it’s good you’re recognizing that. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed anything that seems to trigger the diarrhea, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Um… I honestly don’t know. I've been trying to think about it, but… nothing really jumps out. I mean, I eat pretty normally, I guess? My husband does most of the cooking. Sometimes, if I eat something really spicy, it might be a bit worse after, but not always. And I’ve been drinking a lot of water, trying to stay hydrated. I really can’t pinpoint anything specific. It just… happens, regardless. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. It’s often difficult to identify a specific trigger. Since you haven’t been able to pinpoint anything dietary, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you had any previous issues with your stomach or digestive system?
PATIENT: Um… well, a few years ago, I was diagnosed with… something. I’m so bad with remembering things. It was something with my intestines, I think? And celiac disease, maybe? They did a lot of tests. It was all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I’ve been seeing a specialist, but it was a while ago. I think they put me on some medication, but I’m not sure what it was. My memory is just… terrible. I know it’s something long-term, but the details… they’re just gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful information, even if the details are fuzzy. It sounds like you have a history of intestinal issues and a possible diagnosis of celiac disease. Do you recall the name of the specialist you were seeing?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is so embarrassing. No, I really don’t. I think… Dr. something Patel? It was a really common name. He was in the city, somewhere… I honestly couldn’t tell you exactly where. And I haven’t been back to him in ages. It was a long time ago, and… things were stressful then. I just stopped going, I guess. I know I should have followed up, but… I just didn't. I'm really sorry. I wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Jase, don’t apologize. These things happen. It’s more important to focus on getting things sorted out now. Given your history, it sounds like we need to consider the possibility of a flare-up of your previous condition. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I mean, I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. No known allergies, I guess. My husband always checks when we go out to eat, just in case. But I don’t have any specific allergies that I know of. I’m pretty lucky that way, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Actually, yes. I take something for… anxiety. It’s a small blue pill. I think it’s called… Sertraline? My doctor prescribed it a few months ago. It helps a little. And… that’s it, I think. Just the Sertraline. I don’t really take anything else regularly. Just when I have a headache, or something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sertraline for anxiety. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, and feel it gently to check for any tenderness. It won't be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… fine. I mean, I’m a little nervous, but… if you think it’s necessary. Go ahead. Just… please be gentle?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm listening now. Take a few deep breaths for me. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds, which is good. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Anything here?
PATIENT: No, that's okay… a little pressure, but no pain. Keep going, I guess. It just feels… normal pressure. Not anything specific. I’m a little ticklish, though.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. A little ticklish is fine. Okay, I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or masses. There's a slight resistance in the lower left quadrant, but it's not alarming. Everything seems relatively normal on physical exam, which is reassuring. Given your history of possible celiac disease and the current symptoms, I think we should run some tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be comfortable providing a stool sample?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Oh… that’s… awkward. But… yeah, I guess so. If it helps, then yes. It’s just… embarrassing, I guess. What will you be looking for?
DOCTOR: I understand your embarrassment, Jase. It’s a common feeling. We’ll be looking for things like infections, parasites, and markers of inflammation. It will also help rule out other potential causes of your diarrhea. We’ll also need to do a blood test to check for nutrient deficiencies, and to re-evaluate your celiac disease status. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood tests and a stool sample. It’s a lot, but… if it’ll help figure out what’s wrong, then yes. Do I need to do anything special for the stool sample? Like, is there a special container or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will provide you with a special collection container and instructions. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate results. She’ll explain everything to you in detail before you leave. I’m going to order those tests for you now. We should have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, continue to stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen significantly – such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, stay hydrated and watch out for those things… got it. Um… no, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything really well, actually. I guess… I’m just worried about what it might be. But I trust you to figure it out. Thank you, Dr. Chagaris.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. It’s perfectly normal to be worried, and I understand your concerns. We’ll work through this together. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and discuss the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the collection instructions and answer any remaining questions you may have. Thank you for coming in today. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment.
