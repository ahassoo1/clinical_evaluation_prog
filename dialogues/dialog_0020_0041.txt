DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s my legs, mostly. They are getting… weaker, you see? It’s been happening slowly, but it’s getting harder to walk even short distances. My wife, she says I shuffle a bit now too. It worries her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Weakness in your legs, getting progressively worse… and your wife has noticed a change in your gait, some shuffling. I appreciate you both bringing this to my attention. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about when you first started noticing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly when. It wasn't a sudden thing. Maybe… six months ago? It started with just feeling a little tired after walking around the yard. Now, getting up from a chair takes some effort. I don’t remember a specific day, if that helps. It just… crept up on me.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It sounds like it was a gradual onset. Six months is helpful information. And is this weakness in both legs, or is it more pronounced on one side?
PATIENT: It’s… both legs, I think. But maybe a little worse on my left side? It feels… heavier, sometimes. Like I have to lift it higher to take a step. It’s hard to explain. I don’t fall or anything, but it’s definitely there. My wife would know better, she watches me closely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's bilateral, affecting both legs, but potentially a bit more noticeable on the left side, with some heaviness. That's good to know. And it’s good you haven't had any falls. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. My hands get a little shaky sometimes, but I thought that was just from getting old! And I get tired easier than I used to, even when I haven’t done much. Also… and this is embarrassing… sometimes I have trouble seeing clearly, like my vision gets blurry, but it comes and goes. It doesn’t happen all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hand tremors, increased fatigue, and intermittent blurry vision. Thank you for sharing all of that, Dorman. It's important information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have my blood pressure, the doctor keeps it under control with a pill. And… oh, a few years back I had a problem with my prostate, but they fixed that. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy, eat good food, but it’s hard sometimes. And I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you manage hypertension with medication, and you had a prostate issue in the past that was addressed. That's good to know. And yes, Medicare is helpful information. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… my wife handles the pills, mostly. I think… it’s a little white pill. No, wait. I remember now, the doctor said it started with an “A”. Amlodipine? Is that right? I’m not good with names, you see.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that's correct. Good memory, Dorman! And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. My wife always asks when the doctor gives me something new, and she’d tell me if there was something I couldn’t take. She’s very careful like that. I haven't had a reaction to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies. Alright, Dorman. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll check your strength, reflexes, and balance. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I want to know what’s happening, you see. I trust your judgement. My wife will be glad you’re looking into it. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just follow my instructions, that would be wonderful. First, let's start with your strength. Could you please sit on the exam table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Just tell me what to do. It’s been a while since I had a proper exam, you see. My legs feel a little wobbly, but I’ll manage.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. We'll take it slow. Okay, I’m going to ask you to push your feet against my hands, but don't push too hard. Just resist as I try to push your feet down. Let’s start with your right leg. Push down with your foot, if you can.
PATIENT: There… I’m trying, Doctor. It feels… difficult. Not as strong as it used to be, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. And it does seem a little weaker than expected. Now, let's try your left leg. Same thing, just push down with your foot against my hand. Push down, when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Oh… this one is harder, Doctor. It feels… very weak. And it’s shaking a bit, you see? I’m trying my best, but it’s… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Thank you for that. It's alright, you're doing great. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm going to gently tap on your knees with this little hammer. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. I’ll start with your right leg. Just relax your leg, and let it hang loose.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. It feels… a little strange being examined like this, but I trust your judgement. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now let's check the left side. Same thing, just relax your leg.
PATIENT: Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that, Dorman. Now, I’d like to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly, if you’re comfortable?
PATIENT: Whoa… that’s… a little difficult, Doctor. My legs are very wobbly. I need to hold on tight, you see? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can see that. That’s alright, hold on to the table. Just try to stand there for a few seconds. I just want to see how steady you are.
PATIENT: Oh… this is… difficult, Doctor. I feel… very unsteady. I don't think I can stand here for long. I’m afraid I’m going to fall.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, that’s alright. It’s perfectly alright. Let's sit down. Thank you for trying, Dorman. That gives me a lot of information. Based on the exam, there is weakness in both legs, more pronounced on the left, diminished reflexes, and some instability with balance. You also mentioned tremors and blurry vision. I also see you manage hypertension with Amlodipine. These findings are concerning and suggest a potential neurological issue. It’s important to get to the bottom of this. I’m going to recommend some further testing, including an MRI of the brain and spine to rule out any structural problems. We will also need some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies and other possible causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what’s happening, you see. I trust your judgement. MRI and blood tests… yes, that sounds alright. I’ll do whatever it takes to find out what’s wrong. My wife will be glad you’re taking this seriously.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad to hear that. I’ll write the orders for the MRI and blood tests now. The MRI will require a referral to the imaging center, and I’ll have my staff schedule that for you. The blood tests can be done here at the clinic. We'll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and being cautious with your balance. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as new weakness, difficulty speaking, or loss of bladder control, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Emergency room… yes, I understand. That’s good to know. No… not right now, Doctor. I think I need to process everything first. Maybe my wife will have some questions later. Just… what does this mean? Is it… serious? I’m a little scared, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Dorman. It's natural to be scared when facing uncertainty. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what’s causing your symptoms. The MRI and blood tests will help us determine the underlying cause. There are many potential causes for these symptoms, some more serious than others. It could be something like a vitamin deficiency, which is easily treatable. However, it’s important to rule out more serious possibilities, such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, or a neurological disorder. That’s why we need to do these tests. I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and I’ll do everything I can to provide you with the best possible care. My staff will contact you to schedule the tests. In the meantime, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, you see. I’ll let my wife handle the scheduling. She’s very good with things like that. Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care. My staff will escort you out and ensure you have everything you need. Have a good day, Dorman. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this.
