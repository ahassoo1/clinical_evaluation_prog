DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste time. You're 83 years of age, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is right. Eighty-three years old, this old body is. But still moving, thank the Lord.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that's…fortunate. Now, please, articulate the reason for your visit today. Be concise. What brings you in?
PATIENT: It’s this…weakness, Doctor. It's getting harder to do things. Little by little, things feel…heavier. My wife, she says I’m slower too. It’s not a sudden thing, just…a growing tiredness in my arms and legs. They just don’t seem to want to go like they used to.
DOCTOR: “Growing tiredness,” you say. And how long has this “growing tiredness” been progressing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Not easy to say exactly. Maybe… six months? No, longer. Perhaps a year. It started with just feeling a bit more tired after working in the garden, you know? But now... now it's almost all the time. It's not a sharp pain, just…a lack of strength. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: A year. And you continued gardening despite this progressive weakness?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, a man has to keep busy, doesn't he? It's my hobby! I just…took more breaks. And my wife helped a little more with the heavier lifting. I didn’t want to stop completely, if I could avoid it. It's good for the soul, being out there. But…maybe I pushed myself too much.
DOCTOR: Hobbies are…secondary. Let's focus on the medical aspect. Now, aside from the garden, are you experiencing any difficulty with other activities?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It's getting harder to get out of my chair, for one. And walking... not long distances, but even around the house, I find myself needing to hold onto things. The stairs are…a challenge these days. I used to be able to bound up them! Now…now I have to take them very slow, one step at a time. It worries my wife, you see.
DOCTOR: Difficulty with ambulation and rising from a seated position. And have you noticed any…shaking?
PATIENT: Shaking? Not really, Doctor. No. My hands sometimes feel a little unsteady when I reach for things, but I wouldn’t call it a shake. More like…a clumsiness, maybe. Like they don’t listen to my brain quick enough. It's hard to explain. My wife hasn't said anything about shaking.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Any recent falls?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, Doctor. No falls. I’ve been very careful. My wife is always watching out for me, too. She’s a good woman. I stumble sometimes, catch myself on the furniture, but haven’t actually gone down. I’m very grateful for that. A fall would be…troublesome, at my age.
DOCTOR: Good. We want to avoid that. Now, are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really pain. Sometimes a little achy in my joints, like an old man's aches, but nothing sharp or constant. It’s not like a broken bone or anything like that. More like…wear and tear.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor got that under control with pills. And I had a touch of the flu a couple of years back. But nothing serious. Oh, and they told me… years ago, they said I had something with my nerves. Multiple… something. I don’t remember the whole name. It wasn’t supposed to be too bad, they said. Just meant I had to take it easy sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Multiple something"?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s right. Multiple…Sclerosis, I think? My wife reminded me just this morning. It was a long time ago, maybe twenty years? The doctor said it could cause some problems with my balance and things, but he said it was mild. I didn't have too many troubles with it, until… well, until this weakness started. I haven’t seen a doctor about it since then, just my regular checkups.
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago... multiple sclerosis... mild... Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure, Doctor. A little white one, I take it every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, if my joints are achy, I take a little over-the-counter pain reliever. But nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to any pills. And no food allergies or anything like that. I can eat just about anything. My wife is always trying to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's a different story!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Astore, I am going to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. We'll assess your strength, reflexes, and balance. Don’t be alarmed, it will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds good. Just tell me what you want me to do. This old body isn’t what it used to be, but I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Diminished reflexes, bilaterally. Now, please try to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Grip strength 4 out of 5 bilaterally. Now, can you lift your arms against my resistance?
PATIENT: I can…but it's harder than it used to be, Doctor. Feels…heavy. Like there's a weight on them. I can lift them, but not very high, and not for very long. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is…informative. Now, stand up slowly, if you can. I want to observe your balance. Hmm. And now, heel-to-toe…just a few steps. Right. That will be sufficient. You may lie back down now.
PATIENT: That…was a little wobbly, Doctor. I haven’t been able to do that for a while, I don’t think. My wife says my balance isn't what it used to be. She's probably right. What do you think, Doctor? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, based on this brief examination, and taking into account your age, your history of multiple sclerosis, and the progressive weakness you’ve described, it appears you are experiencing a decline in your overall strength and balance. It is likely this is related to the progression of your MS, although it’s difficult to say definitively without further testing. We’ll need to rule out other causes, of course. I’m going to order a blood test to check for vitamin deficiencies, and I’ll refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I'll also order a physical therapy evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: So… it is the nerves again, then? Getting worse? Blood tests and a…neurologist? Physical therapy? I understand you want to check things, Doctor, but it all sounds a bit… serious. I just hoped it was something simple. What will the neurologist do, exactly? And the physical therapy… will that help? I’m a bit worried about falling, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, the neurologist will perform a detailed neurological examination, potentially including an MRI, to assess the extent of the damage to your nervous system. It will help determine the best course of action, if any. Physical therapy will help improve your strength, balance, and coordination, and teach you strategies to prevent falls. It is unlikely to cure anything, but it may help you maintain your independence for longer. Now, I am writing the referrals now. Do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor…if it’s going to help me stay on my feet, I suppose I should go to the neurologist and try the physical therapy. I don’t want to be a burden to my wife. She’s been very good to me. But… will these tests be expensive? My Medicare… does it cover all of this? And… how long will it take to get an appointment with the neurologist? It just feels like a lot, all at once.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, your Medicare should cover the majority of these services, although you may have co-pays and deductibles. I will have my staff verify your coverage and provide you with cost estimates. As for the neurologist appointment… expect a wait. These specialists are in high demand. My staff will handle scheduling. Now, I have documented my findings and issued the referrals. Do you have any further questions that pertain to the medical aspects of your condition?
PATIENT: No… I suppose not, Doctor. Just the waiting…and the cost. But you’ve given me the referrals, and I’ll let your staff handle the details. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate you checking me out.
DOCTOR: Very well. If anything changes before your neurology appointment, contact my office immediately. Otherwise, I will see you for a follow-up in six months, or sooner if necessary. Have a good day, Mr. Astore. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
