DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s… pleasant to finally meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Though I can’t say I find much pleasure in being here, frankly. Waste of a perfectly good morning. It's about this… surgery. My daughter insisted I get a check-up before I go through with it. Says the hospital won’t let me do it otherwise. Seems like a lot of fuss over nothing, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I see. A pre-operative evaluation, then. Your daughter sounds… conscientious. And, while I appreciate your… directness, Mr. Orwin, these evaluations are quite important. Could you tell me a bit more about the surgery you’re scheduled for?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s a face lift. A simple face lift. My skin’s just… drooping, you know? Getting old isn't for the faint of heart, and gravity isn’t helping. It’s not like I’m asking for a whole new face, just a little tightening. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I had a handsome face… just needs a little work, she’d say. And now… well, now it needs a bit of help from a professional. Is this going to take long? I have appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: A cosmetic procedure, then. Very well. While it may seem… straightforward, any surgery carries risks. We need to ensure you are a suitable candidate. Now, regarding your medical history… have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Goodness, at my age? Let me think… I had the flu, maybe, a few times. Nothing serious. Broke my wrist when I was a young man, working with terrazzo. That’s about it, really. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. Worked hard my entire life. Don't need to fill out a book about every little sniffle, do I? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your… frustration, Mr. Orwin. However, even seemingly minor details can be important. Were any of those illnesses complicated?
PATIENT: Complicated? No, no. Nothing complicated. Just a bit of a cold, a broken bone. I healed up just fine. I always did. I didn't lie in a hospital bed for months, if that’s what you’re asking. I'm a practical man, Doctor. Get on with it. Are you going to poke and prod me or what? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. It will help me assess your overall health. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Afterward, we'll have a quick look at the area of the planned surgery.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But don’t expect me to sit here all day. And be gentle, alright? My bones aren't what they used to be. This is all rather undignified, you know. A man my age shouldn’t have to go through this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths, if you would. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range for your age. Heart sounds are… regular, although a slight murmur is present. Not particularly concerning, but we'll note it. Now, let’s have a look at the surgical site. Could you please turn your head slightly to the left?
PATIENT: Left it is. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? It's just a bit of loose skin. Anyone can see that. You’d think you’d have seen it all by now. Hurry up. My neck's getting stiff.
DOCTOR: The skin elasticity is diminished, as expected. There’s some… laxity in the tissues, and minimal wrinkling. No signs of infection or any unusual growths. I’m also noting a small mole on the right cheek. Has this mole changed in size or shape recently?
PATIENT: A mole? Goodness, I don’t know. I’ve got moles all over. Never paid much attention to them. Probably been there my whole life. It certainly hasn’t bothered me. You’re making a mountain out of a molehill, Doctor. Honestly. This is ridiculous. Can we just get this over with? I've got a lunch appointment. A very important lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, while I appreciate your… eagerness to proceed, it's my responsibility to conduct a thorough examination. Any new or changing moles should be evaluated to rule out potential skin cancer. While it may appear harmless, it's better to be safe than sorry. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I eat everything. Steak, potatoes, fish, you name it. Strong stomach, I always say. I built this body on hard work and good food. No need for fancy pills or anything like that. Are you suggesting I'm a delicate flower? Because that's simply not true. And frankly, this is all rather insulting. I’ve lived a full life, and I think I know my own body pretty well. Now, can we please get back to the surgery? I’m starting to lose my patience.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. No known allergies, then. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in all that modern medicine nonsense. A good night's sleep and a bit of fresh air, that’s all a man needs. And maybe a strong cup of coffee in the morning. But no pills. Never have, never will. I've gotten this far without them, and I plan to stay that way. This is getting beyond ridiculous, Doctor. I'm a perfectly healthy man. Are you going to operate or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, you are 81 years old. While you may feel healthy, your age and lack of a recent medical history present certain risks. I am hesitant to proceed with elective surgery without a more complete understanding of your overall health. I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a cardiology consultation to assess your heart function, given the murmur I detected. We also need to address this mole. A biopsy will be necessary to rule out malignancy. I understand you have a lunch appointment, but your health is paramount. I’m not comfortable proceeding until we have this information.
PATIENT: Are you serious? A biopsy? A cardiology consultation? This is preposterous! I came here for a simple face lift, not a full medical workup. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not going to spend my remaining years running around doctors’ offices. This is an utter waste of my time! Forget it. I’ll find another doctor. One who understands what a patient wants. This has been… a complete and utter waste of my morning. Don’t bother calling. I won't be back.
