DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn't absolutely necessary. It’s a… a problem. A personal problem, really. And quite unpleasant, if you must know.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and you’re doing the right thing. Everything you tell me is confidential, of course. No need to feel embarrassed – I’m here to help in any way I can. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: It's… discharge, Doctor. From… well, you understand. It started a few weeks ago, just a little bit. I thought it was perhaps something I ate, but it’s… persisted. And it’s not a pleasant colour, I assure you. Not at all. It’s… yellowish. And there’s a bit of… odour. It’s truly dreadful. I haven't… well, I haven't been with anyone, so it's not that sort of thing. It simply appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowish discharge with an odour. And you said it started a few weeks ago and hasn't gone away despite not having any recent changes in partners?
PATIENT: Precisely. No changes whatsoever. I maintain a… respectable lifestyle, Doctor. It's simply… baffling. I keep everything very clean, you see. Very clean indeed. It's not as if I’m… careless. I’ve always taken pride in my… hygiene. Really, it’s most disconcerting. Perhaps it’s something I’m eating? Though I can’t imagine what.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, and I appreciate you telling me that. It does sound concerning, and while diet can sometimes play a role, the colour and odour you’re describing suggest we need to investigate a little further. To get a better picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, no. Not exactly. I mean, there's a bit of… discomfort, naturally. When I… clean up. But nothing more than one would expect. No pain, no burning, certainly no… swelling. Just the discharge, which is quite enough, thank you very much. It's thoroughly unpleasant and ruining my undergarments. Do you think it could be a… a fungal infection? My neighbour had something similar, though she isn't quite as… meticulous as I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the yellowish discharge and some discomfort when cleaning, no pain, burning, or swelling. A fungal infection is certainly a possibility, but we need to rule out other things too. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain at all?
PATIENT: Fever? Good heavens, no. I am a perfectly healthy woman, Doctor. Chills? In this weather? Don’t be absurd. And lower abdominal pain… really. I would know if I had abdominal pain. I take very good care of myself. No, those symptoms are quite… unrelated, I assure you. This is simply a… localized issue. A most unpleasant one, but localized nonetheless. I do hope it isn't anything serious. I haven't time for illnesses.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. And you haven't noticed any changes in your urination – no burning, frequency, or urgency?
PATIENT: Urination? Now, that’s a rather personal question, isn't it? I… well, no. I haven’t noticed anything different. One urinates, Doctor. That is the natural order of things. No burning, no… urgency, certainly nothing out of the ordinary. It’s all perfectly normal. I truly believe it must be something minor. Perhaps a… a reaction to a new soap? I did try a lavender-scented one recently. Though I must say, it didn't smell very nice. Really, all this questioning is rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your discomfort. Just trying to get a complete picture. So, no changes in urination. Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions like diabetes or any other chronic illnesses?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Heavens, no! I watch my diet carefully. A little biscuit with my tea, perhaps, but nothing excessive. As for other chronic illnesses... well, I've had the usual aches and pains of getting older, Doctor. A bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing serious. And a touch of indigestion sometimes, but that’s easily remedied with a peppermint. Other than that, I’m perfectly healthy. Medicare keeps a close eye on things, you know. They'd tell me if there was something wrong. Really, I'm a very… robust woman, all things considered. This discharge is quite out of character.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no diabetes, some arthritis, and occasional indigestion. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… Surgery? Yes, actually. A hysterectomy, many years ago. Perhaps thirty years ago now. And… I was hospitalized for a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a very long time ago. Nothing since. Really, my health has been quite stable. I don’t bother the doctors much, usually. Which is why this… situation is so concerning. It’s most unlike me. And terribly inconvenient. Really, I was hoping for a quick resolution.
DOCTOR: Okay, hysterectomy about thirty years ago and pneumonia when you were younger. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Well, I can’t stand penicillin. Makes me terribly itchy. And I'm a bit sensitive to dust, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Nothing major. I can take most things, thankfully. I don't like taking pills, you know. They always upset my stomach. Really, I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Ginger tea, peppermint, that sort of thing. But this… discharge… I don’t think ginger tea is going to solve this problem. It’s rather… persistent. And quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy and some sensitivity to dust. And you're currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don't believe in all those pills. I might take a pain reliever if my arthritis flares up, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I pride myself on my natural constitution, Doctor. I don't need all those chemicals coursing through my veins. Really, I'm a very simple woman with very simple needs. This whole ordeal is terribly disruptive. I had a lovely garden party planned. Now I simply can’t face it. Really, it’s most distressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Oh dear. Where to begin? My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… well, he wasn’t a very healthy man. He drank too much. And my sister… she had some sort of… nervous condition. Nothing you need to worry about, really. It’s all rather complicated. And frankly, I don’t like dwelling on unpleasantness. It’s all very… unfortunate. And not relevant, I assure you. This is my problem, Doctor, not my family’s. Really, I’d prefer to focus on finding a solution, rather than recounting family woes. It’s terribly depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! What a question! I would never! I might have a small glass of sherry with my dinner occasionally, a very small glass, to aid digestion, of course. But smoke? Drink excessively? Recreational drugs? The very idea! I am a respectable woman, Doctor. Really, I find your questions rather… intrusive. And frankly, a bit insulting. I have led a very proper life, and I expect to be treated with a certain amount of decorum. Now, are you going to do something about this discharge, or are you going to continue interrogating me? It's quite embarrassing, you know. Really, I'm starting to feel quite faint.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt intrusive, Jinnie. I assure you, I’m only trying to gather all the information I need to provide the best possible care for you. It's standard practice to ask about these things. Okay, so a small glass of sherry with dinner occasionally. Right. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh dear. I really wasn’t expecting that. Must you? I mean, is it absolutely necessary? I’ve told you everything. It’s just… discharge. Surely you can prescribe something without… poking and prodding. I find the whole thing rather… undignified. And frankly, I’m not feeling very well. The whole experience has been quite upsetting. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary… but please be gentle. And quick. Really, I’d prefer to get this over with as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Jinnie. I will be as gentle and quick as possible. It’s important to rule out anything serious and make sure we get the right treatment for you. I'll explain everything as I go along. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll just need to take a look at the area. Do you have any underwear you’re comfortable changing into afterwards?
PATIENT: Underwear? Oh dear. I hadn't thought of that. I suppose… I have a spare pair in my handbag. Though they aren’t very… fashionable. And rather crumpled. But they will have to do. Really, this is most inconvenient. I haven’t been anywhere remotely respectable in weeks. And now this. Well… hurry up, please. The sooner this is over, the better. Really, I’m starting to feel quite faint again. And my garden party… it’s ruined. Absolutely ruined.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just follow me over to the examination table, we can get started. Okay, Jinnie. I’ve had a look. There is some redness and mild swelling. The discharge has a slightly foul odor, as you described. Your abdomen feels normal to the touch. I'm going to order a lab test to check for an infection. It will involve a swab to analyze the discharge and a urine sample. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: A swab? And a urine sample? Oh dear. This is even more unpleasant than I imagined. Must you really? I mean, surely you can just guess what’s wrong? I’ve told you everything. And a swab… it sounds awfully invasive. Really, I’m starting to feel quite ill. And what if it’s something dreadful? I haven’t been feeling quite myself lately, you know. Perhaps it’s just old age. But a swab… and a urine sample… it’s simply barbaric. Really, I wish I hadn’t come. It’s all so… undignified. What sort of infection could it be? Is it… contagious? Oh dear, oh dear. I think I’m going to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Jinnie. It's not pleasant, I agree. But these tests are very important to help us determine the exact cause of the infection so we can get you the right treatment. It's not 'guessing', it's responsible medical care. The swab is a quick procedure – it won't take long at all. And the urine sample is straightforward. As for what it could be… it’s too early to say definitively. It could be a bacterial infection, a yeast infection, or something else. That’s why the tests are so important. And no, it’s not contagious. We'll get this sorted out. I’ll have the nurse come in to help you with the samples. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, try to relax. We’ll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… yes. How long will it take to get the results? And what if it’s something serious? Will I have to be hospitalized? I haven’t packed a bag! And what about my garden party? It's tomorrow, you know. All my friends are coming. This is simply dreadful. Really, I’m starting to feel quite faint again. And the swab… please be gentle. Very, very gentle. I have delicate skin. And what sort of… treatment will I need? Pills? Injections? I don’t like either, you know. Really, this is all so… overwhelming. I wish I hadn’t come. It’s ruined my day. Absolutely ruined.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take these one at a time. The lab results usually take about 24-48 hours, so we should have them by the end of tomorrow. As for whether it’s serious… it's too early to say. Most infections like this are easily treatable with medication. Hospitalization is very unlikely, unless it’s a very complicated case, which I don’t anticipate. Regarding medication, it will depend on the results of the tests. It could be a cream, an oral antibiotic, or an antifungal medication. We’ll discuss all the options and choose the one that’s best for you. I will, of course, take your preferences into account. As for your garden party, let's focus on getting you better first. Once we have the results, we can discuss whether you’ll be able to attend. I will ensure the nurse is very gentle when taking the swab. And again, I’m here to answer any questions you have. I’ll let the nurse come in now. Just take a deep breath, and we’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Together? Oh dear. It all sounds so… complicated. And what if I can't attend my garden party? It’s the highlight of the year! I’ve spent weeks preparing! And I promised my friends… Really, this is absolutely dreadful. Very well… but please, be quick. And gentle. Very, very gentle. I simply can’t bear any more unpleasantness. This is ruining my life. Absolutely ruining it. Send the nurse, then. But please, tell her to be careful. Very careful. I have delicate skin. And I simply can’t bear the thought of any more… probing. It's barbaric, I tell you. Barbaric.
