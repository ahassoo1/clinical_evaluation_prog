DOCTOR: Hi Nicoletta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I feel like I need a little… boost. A reset, perhaps? I’m getting on in years, you see, and things just aren’t working quite as smoothly as they used to. I want to feel more… lively, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “A little boost” – wanting to feel more energetic as we get older is very common. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Well, it's not any one thing, really. I just feel… tired. Not all the time, but often. And I don’t bounce back as quickly as I used to after doing things. Even something simple like gardening leaves me feeling wiped out for the rest of the day. My memory isn’t what it used to be either, though I don’t know if that’s just age. It’s frustrating, you know? I used to be so active. I taught kindergarten for years, and then elementary school after that! Now… well, now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and feeling like it takes longer to recover, plus some memory concerns. That gives me a starting point. When did you start noticing these changes, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It’s been… gradual. Perhaps… the last year or so? Maybe a little longer. It’s hard to say precisely. It started with just feeling a bit more tired at the end of the day, and then it slowly got worse. I thought it was just getting older, to be honest. But I thought I should probably get it checked out, just in case. My daughter insisted, actually. She’s a sensible girl.
DOCTOR: That’s smart of you and your daughter to get it checked out. Okay, so fatigue worsening over the last year. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, sometimes my joints ache a little, especially my knees. But I’ve always had trouble with my knees, so I don't know if that's new. And I seem to be a bit… colder than I used to be. I always keep a sweater handy, even in the summer. Oh, and I've been a little bit more… forgetful, I suppose. Not major things, just… where I put my glasses, or a name on the tip of my tongue. Little things like that. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all helpful. Joint aches, feeling colder, and increasing forgetfulness. Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well controlled with medication for years now. My doctor, Dr. Reyes, she managed it beautifully. He retired a few years ago, sadly. And I had a bit of a problem with arthritis in my hands when I was younger, but it hasn’t bothered me much lately. Apart from that… not much, really. I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered. I always ate a good Chamorro diet, lots of fish and fruits. Though I do enjoy a little chocolate now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure and a history of arthritis. That's good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take Ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, nothing fancy. And… oh! I take a Vitamin D supplement. Dr. Reyes suggested that years ago, said it was good for the bones. I think it’s a small dose, 1000 IU, maybe? I can’t quite remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and Vitamin D 1000 IU. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very lucky in that regard. My mother always said it was because I ate so much fruit when I was little. She was a firm believer in natural remedies. Though I suppose that’s just an old wives’ tale. Still, I haven't had any allergic reactions, so I can’t complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh! Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was a long time ago, though, maybe thirty years ago? It wasn’t a very pleasant experience, but I recovered well. Apart from that… no, I haven’t had any other surgeries. I always tried to stay healthy and avoid them if possible. I’ve always believed prevention is better than cure.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tricky one. My mother lived to be 92, but she had diabetes. My father died relatively young, in his seventies, from a heart condition. And my brother… well, my brother had high blood pressure, like me. But other than that, I don’t really know much about my family’s medical history. My grandparents passed away when I was very young, and we didn’t really talk about these things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother with diabetes, father with a heart condition, and brother with high blood pressure. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I was married to my husband, Manuel, for over fifty wonderful years. He passed away five years ago. It’s still difficult, to be honest. We raised four children, all grown up now, with families of their own. I have eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren! I used to be very involved in the church and the community, but I’ve slowed down a bit since Manuel passed. I mostly keep busy with my family and a little gardening when the weather permits. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Nicoletta. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your joints.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Finally, let’s check your joints. You have some mild tenderness in your knees, and some slight swelling in your hands. This is consistent with arthritis. Overall, everything seems relatively stable, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds warrant further investigation. Do you have any questions about what I've found so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound terribly good, does it? Diminished breath sounds… that sounds worrisome. And my blood pressure being up… is that from worry, do you think? I do get anxious sometimes, especially since Manuel passed. Is it something serious, Doctor? And what do you suggest we do about it? I suppose a few tests are in order, aren't they?
DOCTOR: It's good you’re asking questions, Nicoletta. It is important to investigate these things, but I don’t want to cause undue alarm. The diminished breath sounds could be a number of things - it could be related to some mild fluid buildup, or simply age-related changes. We'll need a chest x-ray to get a clearer picture. And the slightly elevated blood pressure, while it could be related to anxiety, is something we need to monitor more closely. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to rule out thyroid problems, and a vitamin D level, since you're already taking a supplement. We'll also do a urinalysis to check for any signs of infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Tests are always a good idea, I suppose. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A comprehensive panel… that sounds very thorough. Will these tests require me to fast beforehand? And where will I have them done? I usually go to Saint Jude’s Hospital, is that convenient?
DOCTOR: Yes, the comprehensive metabolic panel does require you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. Just water is okay. And Saint Jude’s Hospital is perfectly fine - we can send the orders there electronically, so they’ll be expecting you. They'll schedule you for the blood work and urinalysis. I’ll also write an order for the chest x-ray, which you can get done at the imaging center next door to Saint Jude’s. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a plan. In the meantime, try to manage your anxiety - perhaps some gentle exercise or spending time with your family. I'm also going to suggest you continue taking your Lisinopril as prescribed, and we’ll reassess your blood pressure at your follow-up. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes very good sense, Doctor. Fasting for 8-12 hours, continue my medication, and get the tests done at Saint Jude’s. And try to relax… that’s easier said than done, but I’ll try my best. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease somewhat, just knowing we’re getting to the bottom of things. When should I expect to hear about scheduling the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nicoletta. I'm glad I could help. My nurse, Maria, will call you within the next 24-48 hours to schedule the tests. She'll answer any questions you have about the fasting requirements and the location of the imaging center. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or a fever, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that's all for today, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and kind. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. It was a pleasure meeting you, Nicoletta. We'll get those tests scheduled and get to the bottom of this. Take care, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
