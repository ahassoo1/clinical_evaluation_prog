DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, no offense, but "pleasure" feels a bit strong. I'm Brad. And I'm here 'cause, well, I’ve been… bleeding. From down there. Not a good time. It started a few days ago, just thought it was something I ate, but it ain’t stoppin’.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. Thank you for being direct with me. It’s important to address these concerns promptly. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the bleeding in more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What kind of detail? It’s… blood, alright? Comes out when I, uh, go to the bathroom. Dark, kinda clotted. Not, like, a fountain, if that’s what you’re askin’. More like… drips. And it's makin' me weak. I haven’t been eatin’ much, honestly, didn’t wanna make it worse. It just feels… wrong. And I ain’t got insurance, so I’m hopin’ this ain’t gonna be expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about both the bleeding and the cost of care, Brad. We’ll work through this systematically, and I assure you we'll discuss options to manage expenses. You mentioned dark, clotted blood with drips. Has the amount of bleeding been consistent over the past few days, or has it increased, decreased, or fluctuated?
PATIENT: Fluctuated. Definitely fluctuated. Started light, thought it was just somethin' I ate, like I said. Then it got worse for a bit, a little more than just drips. Enough to… notice. Yesterday it seemed to calm down a touch, but this morning… well, it was back. Not worse than yesterday, but not gettin’ better, either. Look, I'm a simple man, doc. I don't do a lot of fancy descriptions. It bleeds, it stops, it bleeds again. It's a cycle, and frankly, it's a frustrating one.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Brad. That’s very helpful. It sounds like the bleeding pattern is somewhat unpredictable, which is understandably concerning. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about some other things, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any pain associated with the bleeding – abdominal pain, back pain, or anything else?
PATIENT: Pain… yeah, a little. Not like a sharp, stabbin’ pain, more like a dull ache. Low down, where the bleedin’s comin’ from, obviously. And kinda in my back too, lower back. Comes and goes. Honestly, I thought it was just gettin’ old. I’m 51, things ache, ya know? But it feels a little… connected to when the bleedin’ gets worse, if that makes any sense. It’s not somethin’ I’d rush to the hospital over, but it's definitely there. And it's annoyin’. Mostly annoyin’.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Brad. A dull ache in the lower abdomen and lower back that seems to correlate with the bleeding is useful information. Now, I’m going to ask some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or problems with your kidneys or liver?
PATIENT: Look, doc, I ain't been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Not since my wife passed, honestly. She took care of all that. I don't think I have anything, nothin' serious. I’m a pretty healthy guy, always have been. Used to work construction, hard labor. But… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, if that counts. And maybe some high cholesterol, somethin' like that, years ago. But I didn’t take any pills or nothin'. Just tried to eat better. Honestly, I don't remember much beyond that. She handled all the medical stuff. I really don't know. It's not like I've got a file full of diagnoses layin' around.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brad. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a detailed medical history readily available. Having your appendix removed as a child is good to know. And the mention of past cholesterol concerns is also helpful. Now, thinking about your family, have any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, children – experienced any similar bleeding issues, or had any history of colon cancer, stomach problems, or blood disorders?
PATIENT: Family… that's a tough one. My dad… he died young, heart attack. Mom lived a long life, but she had… arthritis, mostly. Lots of aches and pains. I had an older brother, but we weren't close. Haven’t seen him in years. He drank too much, if you're askin'. Didn't pay much attention to his health, let's put it that way. As for bleedin' or stomach problems… not that I know of. Nobody ever talked about that kinda thing. We weren’t a family that shared a lot, if that makes sense. It's not like we sat around discussin’ our digestive systems. Sorry I can’t be more helpful, doc. I really don't have much to go on.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Brad. You've provided valuable information. It’s helpful to know about your father’s heart condition and your mother's arthritis. Now, let’s talk about your current habits. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to, back when my wife was still around. A glass of wine with dinner now and then. But I haven't had a drink in over five years. Not since… well, not since. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a simple man, doc. I don’t need any of that nonsense. I get enough trouble just dealin' with this bleedin'. So, no. None of the above. I eat… well, I used to eat pretty regular. But honestly, with this bleedin’ makin’ me feel weak, I haven’t been eatin’ much of anything lately. Just tryin’ to take it easy and not make it worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brad. That’s good to know. To complete the picture, I need to ask about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements.
PATIENT: Medications? Like I said, doc, I don't take nothin'. Not a single pill. Haven't taken anything in years. Not even aspirin. My wife used to remind me to take a multivitamin, but I stopped even doin’ that after she passed. Just… couldn’t bother. So, no. Nothin'. Zero. Completely off any and all medications, vitamins, supplements… you name it. I’m a remarkably medication-free man, if that’s a good thing. Which, at this point, I'm startin' to wonder about. But seriously, doc, nothin'.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so thorough, Brad. Alright, given your history, or rather, lack of history, and your symptoms, I'd like to perform a physical exam. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and, with your permission, performing a rectal exam. This is important to help determine the source of the bleeding. I understand this can be uncomfortable, and we'll do everything we can to make you feel comfortable. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Look, doc, I appreciate you tryin’ to figure things out, I really do. But… that sounds… awful. I mean, I understand you’re a doctor and all, and you gotta do what you gotta do, but… is that really necessary? Couldn’t you just… order some tests or somethin’? I’m not comfortable with that, not at all. I haven't had anyone stickin’ their hands in there in… well, ever. Honestly, it's makin’ me nervous just thinkin’ about it. Can't we skip that part? Please? I'd really prefer it if we could. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your discomfort, Brad. You have every right to be concerned, and I would never proceed with an exam you are not comfortable with. However, given your symptoms and the lack of a clear diagnosis based on your history, a rectal exam is the most direct way to assess the source of the bleeding and rule out more serious conditions. It’s a crucial part of the evaluation process. I can explain the procedure in more detail, and we can take it very slowly and ensure your comfort throughout. I use plenty of lubricant and will be as gentle as possible. We can also stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. If you remain strongly opposed to the exam, we can proceed with initial blood tests – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – to assess your overall health and look for signs of anemia or kidney issues. However, this will only give us a limited picture, and we may need to consider referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, which would likely involve a colonoscopy. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Brad. I want to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you're talkin' about puttin' a camera... down there? Look, doc, I'm not sure I like any of these options. But… if a colonoscopy is gonna be necessary down the line anyway, maybe… maybe I should just bite the bullet and get the exam now. If it'll save me from havin' to go through another procedure later. But I'm tellin' ya, doc, I'm nervous. Really nervous. And I want you to be as gentle as possible. And if I say stop, you stop. Understand? No pushin', no arguin'. Just stop. And explain everything you're doin' before you do it. Okay? This is not gonna be easy for me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brad. You are absolutely right to be nervous, and I promise I will do everything I can to make this as comfortable and less stressful as possible. We will proceed at your pace, and I will explain every step before I do it. And if you say stop at any point, I will stop immediately – no questions asked. Before we begin, I’ll need you to change into a gown. I’ll provide you with privacy and leave the room while you do so. Then, we’ll proceed to the examination table. I’ll use plenty of lubricant and will be very gentle. It may be uncomfortable, but we’ll work through it together. It’s important to remember that this exam is crucial for determining the cause of your bleeding and ensuring you receive the appropriate treatment. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… get it over with. And… make sure there's someone I can call afterwards? Just in case? I don’t want to be alone after this, not if I'm feelin’… shaky or somethin’. That’s all. Just let me have a gown and… get on with it. The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brad. I will ensure you have someone you can call afterwards, and I'll make sure you're stable before you leave. I'll get a gown for you now. I'll leave the room while you change, and I'll be right outside when you’re ready. Take your time.
PATIENT: .
