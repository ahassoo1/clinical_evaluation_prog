DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need a paper signed. Something about... fixin' myself up a little? A friend told me I needed clearance before I do it. Don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest. It’s for... cosmetic stuff. You know.
DOCTOR: Cosmetic procedures requiring a physician's clearance… fascinating. And you expect me to simply sign a paper without knowing what this entails?
PATIENT: Well, that's what I figured, Doctor. I mean, you're the doctor. Isn't that what you do? Sign papers? Look, I told you, I ain't got time for a lot of questions. It’s… it’s a little somethin’ to tighten things up. I don't need to explain every little detail of my personal business. Frankly, it's not very polite to pry.
DOCTOR: “Not polite to pry”?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect, I'm a busy man. I install towers, fix radios... important work. I don't have time to sit here and explain my life story to get a simple signature. This whole thing is a waste of my time. Just tell me what you need from me to get this done. A pulse check? A blood pressure readin’? I can handle that. But don’t ask me to detail my… choices.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, while I appreciate your… directness, a responsible physician cannot simply rubber-stamp requests without a proper assessment. This isn’t a drive-through service. It's about ensuring your safety. Now, let's start with a basic history. Do you have any underlying medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Heavens no. I work outside, Doctor. Builds character. I mean, I get a little…flustered sometimes, but that’s just from dealin’ with people. And diabetes? Now why would I have diabetes? I don’t sit around eatin’ sweets all day. Look, I'm a healthy man, mostly. Towers don't climb themselves, you know. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Is that what you want to know? A long time. Now can we please just get this over with?
DOCTOR: “A long time.” Very informative. And you said “flustered sometimes.” Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Doctor, really? It means I get a little worked up when folks are bein' difficult. Like now, with all these questions! It's not a medical condition, it’s… temperament. I get things done, see? Sometimes people slow things down. Makes my blood… rise a little. That’s all. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with…tightenin’ things up. Are you even listenin’ to me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, your “temperament” could be relevant. Elevated blood pressure, even intermittent, is a contraindication for certain procedures. Now, let's move on. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No! Goodness, no. I don't believe in all that… stuff. Let the body heal itself, that’s what I always say. I got a little somethin’ for my joints sometimes, a liniment, but that ain’t a medication. It's… a rub. My friend gave it to me. And that's it. Really. I’m a simple man, Doctor. No pills, no potions, just hard work and a little rub when things ache. Can we please get to the signin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, according to this system, you were prescribed Lisinopril – a medication for high blood pressure – five years ago. Does that ring a bell?
PATIENT: Lisinopril? Five years ago…? Look, Doctor, that system ain't always right. Computers are… tricky things. Maybe it was for somebody else? I told you, I don’t take medications. I barely even own a computer! Maybe a friend… used my name or somethin’? People do strange things. It doesn’t mean I was takin’ it. Honestly, this is gettin' ridiculous. I need that paper signed, and I need it now. This is a complete waste of my time, and frankly, a little insulting.
DOCTOR: According to the records, you were quite consistent with refills for three years. And then… abruptly stopped. No explanation. This is concerning, Mr. Honcoop. Abruptly discontinuing antihypertensive medication can be… dangerous. Now, tell me, what prompted you to stop taking it?
PATIENT: Look here, Doctor! I’m tellin’ you, I don’t remember any of this! I do honest work, I provide for myself, and I do not appreciate you accusin’ me of… of somethin’ I don’t even know about! My memory ain’t what it used to be, alright? And frankly, I’m not gonna sit here and be interrogated about somethin’ that happened five years ago! I came here for a signature, and that’s what I expect. I ain’t got time for this medical drama! I think I’ll just… find another doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I cannot in good conscience sign that paper without a proper assessment. Your health is my primary concern, and frankly, your refusal to provide basic medical history is… irresponsible. Given your stated history of possible hypertension and your abrupt discontinuation of medication, I strongly advise against proceeding with any cosmetic procedure at this time. I recommend a full cardiovascular workup. I will not contribute to a potentially dangerous situation. .
