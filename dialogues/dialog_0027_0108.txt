DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, doc, no offense, but “nice to meet you” feels… unnecessary. I’m here ‘cause I’ve been, well, throwing up blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It started a couple days ago, just after… well, never mind when. It's blood, okay? And it’s not exactly a pleasant experience. I'd rather just get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. No need to apologize for being direct. Throwing up blood is concerning, and you're right to get it checked out. It's good you came in. Just to be clear – and please correct me if I misunderstand – this started a couple of days ago, and you've noticed blood in your vomit each time since then?
PATIENT: Each time isn’t exactly right. It’s… sporadic. Some times it’s just… regular stuff. Other times, it’s… you know. Streaks. Dark streaks. And it smells… metallic. Like pennies, maybe? I don’t know. Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I just know it’s not right. And it’s… frankly unsettling. I haven’t eaten anything weird, and I don’t drink. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, sporadic occurrences of dark streaks in your vomit with a metallic smell. And you haven't had any changes in your diet or alcohol consumption. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the amount of blood you’ve seen?
PATIENT: Amount… Look, it’s not like a bucketful, alright? More like… a tablespoon, maybe? Each time it happens? Sometimes less. It’s hard to say, really. I don’t measure it, doc. And it’s always mixed in. Not just straight blood. And… it makes me feel weak. Not like I'm gonna collapse, but just… tired. And a little dizzy. Especially after… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately a tablespoon or less, mixed in with your vomit, and you've noticed feelings of weakness and dizziness afterward. I understand. And you said this started a couple of days ago – has anything else been going on at the same time?
PATIENT: Well… my stomach’s been a bit off. Not painful, exactly. Just… unsettled. Like after a bad meal. And… I’ve been more tired than usual. But honestly, doc, I’m always tired. Widowed life, you know? It takes it out of you. And I haven’t been sleeping well. But I figure that’s just… normal. Old age creeping up.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It sounds like you've been dealing with a lot. The unsettled stomach and fatigue could be related, or they could be separate issues. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if that’s alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Shoot. Other symptoms… Let me think. My… stool’s been a bit dark, actually. Blackish. I didn’t think much of it, figured it was something I ate. But now that you mention it… and I’ve been… well, I haven't had much appetite. Everything just tastes… bland. And… honestly, I’ve been a bit more irritable than usual. My neighbors are loud, alright? Always have been. But it's getting on my nerves more lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark stools, loss of appetite, and increased irritability. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I’ve noticed. Chills… maybe a little cold sometimes, but that's just the air conditioning, alright? It's always freezing in here. And night sweats… no. I sleep in a heavy robe, always have. Keeps me warm. Look, doc, I'm not a delicate flower. I'm a practical man. I just want to know what's wrong and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I assure you I'm doing my best to get to the bottom of this. Now, just to cover all the bases, have you been taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not a one. I avoid those things like the plague, alright? Give me fresh air and a good night's sleep over pills any day. Supplements… no. I used to take a multivitamin, years ago. But that was before… before my wife passed. Haven't touched one since. I get all I need from my food… when I can stomach it, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements currently. Now, do you have any allergies to any foods or medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to love spicy food, before… well. Never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty tough, alright? I can handle most things. Don’t need to worry about that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Thank you for answering all my questions. Based on what you’ve told me – the sporadic vomiting of blood, dark stools, loss of appetite, fatigue, and metallic taste – and given your age, I think it’s important to investigate this further. It could be a number of things, and I don’t want to jump to conclusions. I’d like to start with a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Alright, fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day, you know? But don't go poking around too much. I'm not exactly thrilled about being prodded and poked. Just tell me what you're doing as you go. And keep it quick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I will explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I'll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don’t surprise me. I don't like surprises. And if it's gonna be uncomfortable, just warn me. I'm an old man, alright? Things don't bounce back as quickly as they used to.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I will certainly let you know if anything might be uncomfortable. Now, if you could please take a deep breath for me… Good. And another… Okay. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your ears… Ears look normal. And now, your throat… say “Ahhh” for me. Your throat looks slightly inflamed, but nothing significant. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. This might be slightly tender, so please let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Ouch. There. On the left side. That's… tender. Not agonizing, but definitely not comfortable. Feels… a bit bloated, maybe? And… there's a slight… ache. Like a dull pressure. Don't press so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, I apologize. I’ll be much gentler. Tenderness on the left side of your abdomen, with a dull ache and a feeling of bloating. Thank you for letting me know. I don’t feel any masses, but there is some resistance. Given your symptoms and the tenderness, I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be gastritis, an ulcer, or even something more serious like a splenic issue. To get a better diagnosis, I’m going to order some blood work and a stool sample analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work and… stool sample? Honestly, doc, you’re really piling it on now. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with. But I expect you to explain everything afterwards, alright? No medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong and what we need to do about it. And how long this is gonna take? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. I promise I will explain everything in plain language. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check for signs of inflammation or infection, and rule out any other potential issues. The stool sample will help us look for blood in your stool and identify any possible infections or parasites. The lab should have results within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce stomach acid and hopefully alleviate some of your symptoms. This is a common medication for stomach issues, and it should help with the nausea and discomfort.
PATIENT: Proton pump… what now? Look, doc, just write down the name of the pill, alright? And how often I need to take it. I don’t need a lecture on how it works. And what are the side effects? I don’t want any surprises. Honestly, I feel like you're just throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask questions, and I apologize if I’m overwhelming you. The medication is called Omeprazole, 20 milligrams, once daily, preferably in the morning before breakfast. Common side effects are headache, diarrhea, and nausea, but these are usually mild and temporary. It is rare, but some people may experience more serious side effects, such as weakness or irregular heartbeat. If you experience any concerning symptoms, please contact me immediately. Here is the prescription. I’ll also give you a written list of instructions. Now, I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of your blood work and stool sample. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Alright. Omeprazole. Once a day. Got it. A week… fine. As long as it doesn’t conflict with anything. Look, doc, I’m a practical man. I just want to get this sorted out. So, one week. Tell me what time slots you have. And try to give me something in the morning, alright? I’m not a night owl.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. Let me see… I have openings next Tuesday at 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM. Would either of those times work for you?
PATIENT: 9:00 AM. Fine. 9:00 AM it is. Don’t keep me waiting, alright? I have things to do. Well, I guess that's everything. Let’s hope this pill does the trick. And don’t forget to explain everything in plain language. No medical jargon. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I’ll make sure to explain everything clearly. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do my best to get you feeling better as soon as possible. If you experience any worsening symptoms before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. .
