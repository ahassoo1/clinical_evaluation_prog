DOCTOR: Hi Londell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I’m here for a men’s health check-up, you could say. Just want to make sure everything’s still tickin’ right, you know? Gettin’ up there in years, and all. I figured it was time to be proactive.
DOCTOR: Right, a good idea to be proactive. That's smart. So, just a general check-up… anything specific that's been worrying you, or any changes you've noticed recently?
PATIENT: Not really worryin' me, no. Just… things slow down a bit, you know? Takes a little longer to get goin’ in the mornin’, that sort of thing. And I seem to be gettin’ up a few more times at night. Not terrible, just… noticeable. Energy levels are pretty good though, still doin’ my etchings. That keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Etchings, that sounds lovely! Keeps you active, that’s good to hear. Okay, so some changes in your urinary habits, a bit of slowing down… and generally good energy. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, or any difficulty starting or stopping the flow?
PATIENT: No pain or burnin’ at all, thankfully. And no trouble startin’, exactly. It just… isn’t as strong a stream as it used to be, I guess. And like I said, I just get the urge to go more often, especially at night. It doesn’t wake me every night, but more than it used to. It’s not somethin’ that's keepin’ me up in a panic, just… an annoyance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weaker stream and increased frequency, particularly at night… no pain or burning. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits as well?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… things aren’t as regular as they used to be. Not constipated or anything, just… unpredictable, I suppose. Sometimes I go a couple times a day, other times it’s every other day. It’s not a big deal, usually, but it's another one of those little things that's changed lately. I never used to pay much attention to it, to be honest. Gettin’ old means payin’ attention to more things, I reckon.
DOCTOR: You're right about that. It's good you're noticing these things. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let's see… My wife, bless her heart, she kept track of all that. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about fifteen years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication ever since. My doctor, Dr. Hemlock, he used to check it regularly. Other than that… no, nothin’ major. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but recovered just fine. And a broken arm when I was a boy, climbin’ a tree… but that doesn’t count, does it?
DOCTOR: No, a broken arm doesn’t count! High blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, that’s good. And you said Dr. Hemlock used to follow that?
PATIENT: That’s right. Dr. Hemlock retired a couple of years back. That's when I started lookin’ for someone new. Good man, Dr. Hemlock. Real thorough. He always wanted to know everything – family history, what I ate, how much sleep I got. I don't recall him ever askin’ about family history though, if that matters. My folks are both gone now, and I wasn't super close to any cousins or aunts and uncles.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history known. That’s alright, we can still work with that. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just my tonsils when I was a kid. And an appendectomy when I was about twenty. That’s it. Real quick recovery from both, thankfully. Oh! And I had a skin tag removed from my back a few years ago, but that was just a little snip in the doctor’s office. Barely felt a thing. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, the skin tag doesn’t count. Tonsils and appendectomy, that's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. I take one every mornin’. And a multivitamin, but that’s it. I try to eat pretty healthy, but figured a little extra insurance couldn’t hurt. My wife always said I didn’t get enough fruits and vegetables. She was probably right.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything without a problem. My wife used to try all sorts of new foods, and I always volunteered as the taste tester. She was a good cook. Sorry, gettin’ off track. No allergies, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a brief abdominal exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds just fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain’t got nothin’ to hide. Except maybe a few grey hairs.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Now, blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Your abdomen is soft, not tender. I don’t feel any masses or enlarged organs. Everything seems normal so far. A digital rectal exam would be appropriate to assess the prostate, would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A… digital rectal exam? Well now, that’s… a bit more personal, isn’t it? What exactly would that tell you? I ain't never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I understand you're the doctor, and I trust your judgement, but...
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, it's a very common feeling. A digital rectal exam allows me to feel the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate gland. As men age, the prostate can enlarge, which can cause some of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing – the weaker stream, increased frequency, especially at night. It also helps rule out any abnormalities. It's a standard part of a men's health check-up, especially given your age and symptoms. It's quick, and while it's not the most comfortable exam, it’s important for detecting potential problems early. We can skip it if you're truly uncomfortable, but it would be best to get it done. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Well, when you put it like that… I reckon it makes sense. I don't want nothin’ hidin’ in there, that's for sure. And you’re right, I came here to get checked out, and that means doin’ everything that needs to be done. Alright, Doctor. Let's get it over with. Just… be gentle, okay? And tell me if you find anything. I’d rather know, even if it ain't good news.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything I'm doing as I go. I’ll also let you know right away what I find. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths. Okay. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it’s smooth and symmetrical. No obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. This is fairly common for a man your age. It’s likely contributing to your urinary symptoms. I don't feel anything concerning, but I would recommend a PSA blood test to get a more complete picture. Have you had a PSA test done before?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe I have. What’s a PSA test? And what does it tell you that feelin’ around didn't? I always thought a good doctor could tell everything just by lookin’ and listenin’.
DOCTOR: That's a good point, and a thorough physical exam is crucial. However, a PSA – Prostate-Specific Antigen – test is a blood test that measures the level of a protein produced by the prostate gland. It can help detect prostate cancer early, even before there are any symptoms. A slightly elevated PSA doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer, but it can indicate inflammation or other prostate issues. The feelin’ around, as you say, only tells me about the size and texture. The PSA gives us another piece of the puzzle. It's a routine test for men over 50, and I would recommend we get one done today, if you’re agreeable. It doesn't require fasting or any special preparation. What do you think?
PATIENT: Well, if it don't require any special preparations, and it can tell you somethin’ more… then sure, let’s do it. Might as well get all the information we can, right? I don't want nothin' sneakin' up on me. So a little blood draw, and then we wait for the results? How long does that usually take?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just a simple blood draw. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, based on your symptoms and the exam findings, I think we can start with some lifestyle modifications and possibly a medication to help manage your urinary symptoms. Have you tried anything already, like limiting fluids before bed or avoiding caffeine?
PATIENT: Well, my wife used to fuss at me about drinkin’ too much coffee. She said it made me jittery. I cut back a bit after she passed, but I still have a cup or two in the mornin’. And I do drink a glass of water before bed, sometimes. Habit, I guess. I haven’t really tried to change nothin’ specific, just kinda… let things be. I guess I figured it was just part of gettin’ older. Maybe I shoulda listened to my wife more.
DOCTOR: It's never too late to make changes. Cutting back on caffeine and limiting fluids before bed can definitely help. There's also a medication called Tamsulosin that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. It's a commonly prescribed medication for men with similar symptoms. We can start you on a low dose and see how you respond. Does that sound like something you'd be interested in trying?
PATIENT: Hmm. A pill, huh? I always try to avoid pills if I can. But if it'll help me sleep through the night, and make things easier… then I reckon I'm willin' to give it a try. What kind of side effects does it have? I don't want to be runnin' to the bathroom all day, or feelin’ dizzy or somethin’.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Common side effects of Tamsulosin can include dizziness, lightheadedness, and a stuffy nose. Some men experience retrograde ejaculation, which means the semen goes into the bladder instead of out of the penis during orgasm. It's not harmful, but it can be a little disconcerting. These side effects are usually mild and temporary, and they often improve as your body adjusts to the medication. We can start with a low dose to minimize the risk of side effects, and we’ll monitor your response closely. I’ll give you a detailed information sheet about the medication, and I want you to call me if you experience any bothersome side effects. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A low dose sounds good. And I’ll definitely call if somethin’ feels off. I ain't afraid to speak my mind. My wife always said I was too stubborn for my own good. Information sheet sounds good too. Gotta have all the facts. So, we’re doin’ the blood test, startin’ the pill, and cuttin’ back on the coffee? Is that about right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Blood test to get a baseline, Tamsulosin at a low dose to start, and cutting back on the caffeine. I’m also going to give you a handout on lifestyle modifications for prostate health, including things like regular exercise and a healthy diet. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a month to discuss the results of the blood test and see how you're responding to the medication. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers just about everything, Doctor. You've been real thorough, and I appreciate you takin' the time to explain everything so clearly. It's a relief to finally gettin' this checked out. I reckon I’m in good hands. And thank you for bein’ patient with an old man.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Londell. It was my pleasure. And don’t worry about being an “old man” – you’re doing the right thing by taking care of your health. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you the handouts and information sheet. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
