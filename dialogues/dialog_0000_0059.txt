DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn, good to meet you. Nineteen years old, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Good to meet you too, Doctor… Batara, was it? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Batara, yes. Pinky Batara. And don’t worry about it, dear. It's perfectly normal to forget names. Though, at your age… well. Anyway. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… my speech. It’s been a bit slurred lately. Not all the time, but often enough that my husband noticed, and he insisted I come see someone. I don’t really know when it started, to be honest. It just… gradually became more noticeable, I think.
DOCTOR: “Gradually”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the best way I can describe it. It wasn’t sudden, not like I woke up one morning and couldn’t speak clearly. It’s… harder to explain. Like, sometimes I feel perfectly fine, and other times… the words just don’t come out right. I hope that makes sense? It’s frustrating, even for me to talk about.
DOCTOR: Frustrating for me too, dear, when I have to piece things together. Alright. So, this slurring… does it happen more at certain times of the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. It seems fairly random. After work, maybe? But I’m often tired after work, so it could just feel worse then. I work in construction management, so it’s a fairly physical job. Lots of… running around, mostly. I honestly can’t pinpoint a specific time, Doctor. It just… happens. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Not particularly, no. Construction management… strenuous work, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. Lots of walking, climbing, lifting… coordinating with other people on site, making sure everything runs smoothly. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. And, like I said, tired by the end of the day. I don't mean to be vague, I just… I’m not sure what else to tell you. It's not like I hit my head or anything. Or been sick recently. I feel generally healthy, apart from the speech, of course.
DOCTOR: “Generally healthy”?
PATIENT: Yes. I mean, I eat alright, I sleep… most nights. I don’t smoke, and I hardly ever drink. My husband worries about me getting enough rest, but I feel… okay. Just tired sometimes, and now this with my speech. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, and everything was fine at my last appointment, which was… oh dear, I can’t remember when exactly. Earlier this year, I think? I really wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s not dwell on the memory. We’ll see what we can find. Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? No, not that I’ve noticed. I lift things at work all the time, and I haven't had any trouble with that. I walk a lot too, and my legs feel fine. I did pull a muscle in my back last month, but that’s completely separate, I think. It’s just a normal work injury, and it’s mostly healed now. I haven't noticed any weakness anywhere else, no. Should I be? I'm starting to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: "Should you be?
PATIENT: Well, yes, a little. I came here because my husband was concerned, and now you’re asking about weakness, and I just… I don’t want anything serious to be wrong. I feel healthy, but I’m clearly not explaining things very well, and you seem… concerned. Is it something I should be worried about, Doctor? Perhaps it's just stress? I've been working a lot of overtime lately.
DOCTOR: “Stress.” Everyone blames stress. Alright, let’s have you do a quick neurological exam. Just a few simple tests. Follow my finger with your eyes, don't take it off.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Yes, I can do that. Is this to check my eyes, or something else? I apologize if I seem silly, I just… don't know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize. It’s my job to explain. And yes, it checks a few things. Now, smile for me. A big one. And then stick your tongue out.
PATIENT: Is that alright? I hope my tongue isn't too… strange. I’ve always thought it was a bit too big, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, say "hello." And then, say "hockey." Let’s hear how those sounds come out.
PATIENT: Hello. And… hockey. Does that sound… worse? I can’t really tell. It feels normal to me, but I suppose that's the problem. My husband says it's definitely slurred, but I’m not sure I hear it myself. Is it noticeable?
DOCTOR: It’s… subtle. Now, squeeze my hands. Hard. As hard as you can. And then, push against my palms. Don't be gentle.
PATIENT: Is that enough? I don't want to hurt you, but I'm trying to push as hard as I can. It's a bit difficult, I haven't really been tested like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stand up, if you will. Let's see how you walk. Just a normal walk, across the room and back. And please, try to walk normally. Don’t exaggerate anything.
PATIENT: Is that okay? I’m a little unsteady on my feet, but I think that’s just because I’m nervous now. I'm trying to walk as normally as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a seat. This isn’t conclusive, of course, but… it’s enough for now. I’m going to order an MRI of your brain. Just to rule things out. It’s a precaution.
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… serious? What are we ruling out, Doctor? I'm getting quite worried now. It's just a precaution, you said, but… what if something is wrong? Is it something I should be really concerned about? Perhaps a second opinion would be wise? I don’t want to overreact, but I do like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Prepared for what, dear?
PATIENT: Well, for… anything! If you're ordering an MRI, there must be something you're concerned about, even if it’s just a precaution. I just… I want to know what we’re looking for. Is it something to do with my speech? Is it something serious, like a… a tumor, or something? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I'm very anxious. I don't like feeling helpless. Perhaps my husband should have come with me, he's much better at understanding these things. Is there anything I should be doing while we wait for the results? Or anything I should avoid doing?
DOCTOR: Look, dear, I order a lot of MRIs. It doesn’t automatically mean you have a brain tumor. It rules out a lot of things. A stroke, multiple sclerosis, some types of nerve damage. It’s… a comprehensive look. And frankly, you're being overly dramatic. Now, while we wait, just… try to relax. Avoid strenuous activity. And no, your husband doesn’t need to come. You’re perfectly capable of understanding this. I’ll have my nurse schedule the MRI for you. And we’ll discuss the results when they’re back. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before scheduling?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Just… a little claustrophobic, I think. I've never had one before, so I'm not entirely sure. Is it very enclosed? I suppose I can handle it if I have to. Just… please let me know if it's going to be a long scan. And if I can take something to help me relax beforehand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining things, even if I am being dramatic. It's just… a lot to take in. And I really do hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: The nurse will give you something for the anxiety. It’s standard procedure. Now, is there anything else you want to discuss before I see my next patient?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you for your time, Doctor Batara. And thank you for being patient with me, despite my… anxieties. I’ll wait to hear from the nurse about scheduling the MRI. I hope you have a good rest of your day. And thank you again. .
