DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, Doc, right? Yeah. It's… a cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Red stuff. Not good. I smoke, you know. Always have. Been a while now. Don't remember exactly how long... a long time. Just want it fixed, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough with some redness... I see. And you mentioned smoking for a long time. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. When did you first notice the cough, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Hmm... It started... a few months back, maybe? Or was it last winter? Everything kinda runs together these days. It wasn't bad at first, just a little tickle. But it's gotten worse. Definitely worse lately. More… stuff comin' up. Redder stuff. Is that bad? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: It's good you’ve noticed it’s getting worse, Mr. Reyno. Any redness with the cough is something we need to investigate. And yes, it's worth getting checked out. Now, besides the redness, is there anything else you’ve noticed about the cough?
PATIENT: Anything else…? I get… short of breath sometimes. Not all the time. When I walk up hills, mostly. Or if I try to do too much at once. And it feels… tight in my chest. Like somethin’s squeezin’ it. That happen sometimes too. I mostly just try to ignore it. It’s just… old age, I guess. And the smokin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and chest tightness… those are important things to tell me, Mr. Reyno. It’s good you’re sharing all of this. You mentioned the smoking – do you smoke cigarettes, cigars, or something else?
PATIENT: Cigarettes. Always cigarettes. Been a pack-a-day habit for… well, a long time. I quit a few times, tried those patches and gum, but… didn’t stick. Just too hard. Don't really see the point in talkin' about it now, honestly. It’s done. Just wanna know what's wrong with my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Reyno. It’s never too late to address these things, but we’ll focus on what’s going on now. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Other conditions… Doc, I honestly can't recall. Old age, like I said. I see the medicine man sometimes, for aches and pains. And I get Medicare, if that means anything. Other than that… nothin’ I can think of. I haven’t been to a real doctor in… a long time. Before this. Honestly, it’s probably just old lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We’ll take it slow. The Medicare information is helpful, thank you. And it's good you see the medicine man; we can certainly respect that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm... let me think. Nope. Never had surgery. Not that I remember. Hospitalized… maybe when I was a kid? Chickenpox or somethin'. But not as an adult. Definitely not. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just aches and pains and this cough. Can we just… find out what’s wrong with my chest? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Reyno. We will. Before we get to that, just a few more quick questions. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Doc, my family's mostly… gone. Passed on. And I didn't pay much attention to what they died of, if I'm bein' honest. Old age, probably. Heart trouble, maybe. But I couldn’t tell you for sure. We didn’t talk about that stuff much. Can we please just… get this over with? I don't mean to be rude.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Reyno. It’s perfectly alright. We can move on. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Nope. Never been allergic to nothin’. Not that I know of. I take whatever the medicine man gives me, and I've never had a reaction. I'm pretty sure. I don't think so. Is that all the questions? This is takin' a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. Thank you for your patience. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Then, depending on what I hear, we may need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… Lookin’ at my chest… I guess so. If you gotta, you gotta. Just… try to be quick, okay? And tell me what's wrong, Doc. Don't beat around the bush. I don't have time for fancy words. Just tell me straight. What’s wrong with my chest?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I will. I promise to be as straightforward as possible. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Okay. I’m hearing some wheezing and some crackling sounds in your lungs, which suggests some inflammation. Your oxygen level is a little low, but not critically so. Now, I do think a chest X-ray is a good idea to get a clearer picture of what's going on. It will help us determine the cause of these sounds and plan the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Wheezing… crackling… Sounds bad. You think it's the smokin'? I figured. Look, just do the X-ray. Get it over with. And then tell me what I gotta do. If I gotta quit smokin’, just tell me. I knew this would happen eventually. Just… hurry. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I'll get the order for the X-ray sent over to the radiology department right away. It shouldn’t take too long. After the X-ray, we'll review the images together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I'm going to have the nurse take your blood pressure and check your heart rate. Just so you know, the smoking is very likely contributing to these symptoms. We'll discuss options for quitting when we have the results of the X-ray. Is there anyone you'd like to have with you when we review the images?
PATIENT: No. Nobody. Just me. I always do things myself. Just get it done, Doc. I don't need nobody holdin' my hand. I just wanna know what’s wrong, and what I gotta do about it. Then I gotta go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I understand. I’ll let the nurse know to come in shortly. I’ll be right here when you’re ready to discuss the results. .
