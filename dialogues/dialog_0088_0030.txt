DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell… my body odor. It’s not… normal for me. It just started a few weeks ago, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you brought it up – changes like that are worth investigating. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body. A few weeks ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. Maybe four or five weeks. It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but that feels right. It’s… stronger than usual, and maybe a little different in the smell, if that makes sense. I usually don’t have much odor at all, even when I'm working hard. I lay flooring, you know? It’s physical work.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Flooring – so you are physically active. And you’re saying this is a noticeable change despite that activity?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Usually, I’ll sweat, of course, but it doesn’t… linger, you know? Or smell bad. This is different. It’s… more persistent. And it feels like it's coming from everywhere, not just my armpits. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Persistent and more widespread… Alright. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. Have you started using any new soaps, detergents, or deodorants recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing new at all. I’ve been using the same things for years. A simple Dove soap, and I don't usually bother with deodorant unless it's a really hot day. I haven’t changed anything in my routine, which is why I’m so surprised. And honestly, a little worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No changes in products. Have you noticed any other changes alongside this – like changes in your sweat patterns, skin condition, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My sweat feels the same, I guess. Not more, not less. Skin condition… no, not really. I haven't had any rashes or anything like that. I’ve been a little more tired than usual lately, but I figured that was just from the work. Laying that flooring is hard on the body, you know? But that’s probably not related.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a little more tired. We'll keep that in mind. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. And I’ve got some arthritis in my knees, but it’s pretty mild. Otherwise, I'm generally pretty healthy. I've got Medicare, so they do regular checkups. Everything’s always come back okay. I don’t take any regular medications, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No major medical conditions, gallbladder out ten years ago, mild arthritis, and no regular medications. And Medicare does regular checkups – excellent. Do you have any family history of unusual body odor or medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart trouble, but I don’t recall anyone specifically having issues with… body odor. We didn't really talk about things like that. My mother was more concerned with making sure we were well-dressed than well-smelling, if that makes sense. We were Ethiopian, you know? Appearance was important. But no, nothing specific about odor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known family history of unusual body odor. Alright. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I quit a long time ago, though I did try it when I was younger. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once a week, if that. Nothing heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. No smoking, minimal alcohol. And finally, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all – like weight loss, fever, night sweats, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no weight loss, no fever, no night sweats. My appetite is normal, maybe a little less since the heat, but nothing concerning. Just the tiredness, really. And this… smell. It’s just so strange, and it’s making me feel self-conscious, honestly. I work with a lot of people, and I don’t want them thinking I’m not… clean.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. It’s good you’re addressing it. Alright, Kerriann, based on what you’ve told me – a new onset of persistent, widespread body odor with no obvious cause and no other significant symptoms – we need to investigate a little further. It could be something simple, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your overall health. Then, I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to get a baseline and rule out any underlying medical conditions. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. A physical exam and blood work sound reasonable. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get back to feeling normal again. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood work? Like, do I need to fast?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the metabolic panel, we will need you to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – water is okay. We’ll get you a slip for the lab. Now, if you could just hop up on the exam table when you’re ready, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your skin. I'll also check your thyroid, sometimes that can cause changes in body odor.
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours fasting. Got it. Water is okay. Thyroid, huh? I hadn't even thought of that. Sounds good, Doctor. Go ahead. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Your thyroid feels normal to the touch – no swelling or tenderness. Skin looks good – no obvious rashes or discoloration. Alright, everything seems normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. But the blood work is important to rule out anything underlying. We'll get those results back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds good, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. A few days for the results… okay. I'll just try not to worry too much in the meantime. Will the lab results tell us specifically what might be causing the smell, or will we need to do more testing after that?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. The lab results will help us rule out common medical causes, like kidney or liver problems, diabetes, or thyroid issues. They won’t specifically pinpoint the cause of the odor, necessarily. If the blood work is normal, we may need to consider other possibilities – like a condition called trimethylaminuria, which is a metabolic disorder where the body can't break down certain compounds properly, leading to a fishy body odor. Or, it could be related to a skin condition we haven’t identified yet. We’ll cross those bridges if we come to them. For now, let's focus on getting these results back. I'm writing up the lab order now. And I’ll give you a slip for the lab, with instructions on where to go and how to prepare. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a lot better just knowing we're looking into it. I appreciate it. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get those results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if the odor becomes significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms – like a fever or weight loss – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here's the lab slip. We’ll see you back in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day. And don't worry too much – we’ll figure this out.
