DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Georgiou, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, must be a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real doozy. Feels like a tight band squeezin’ around my skull, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks with a headache that comes and goes, and it feels like a tight band around the back of your head. That does sound bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. It's hard to say for sure. Doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, really. I’ve noticed it sometimes when I’m workin’ with numbers – I’m a financial advisor, you see, lots of spreadsheets and such – but not every time. And sometimes it’s just… there, when I’m relaxin’ at home, watchin’ the news. I don’t think it's after eating anything special, or after bein’ in the sun or anything like that. It just… pops up. Honestly, I'm a bit baffled myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be consistently triggered by anything specific, even with your work. That helps us narrow things down. When the headache is happening, would you describe it as a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: Definitely not sharp. More like… a dull ache, yeah, that’s a good way to put it. And it's not throbbing, either. It’s… steady, like a pressure. Not the worst pain I’ve ever felt, but it’s enough to make it hard to concentrate, you know? Especially when I’m lookin’ at a computer screen all day. Sometimes it spreads a little to the sides of my head, but mostly it's right at the back. Like right here.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, steady ache, mostly at the back of your head, sometimes spreading to the sides. It doesn’t throb, and it interferes with your concentration. That's helpful. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No nausea, no dizziness. Vision’s been fine, I think. No fever, no stiff neck. Oh, wait! Sometimes, when the headache is really bad, my eyes feel a little… sensitive to the light. Not a terrible sensitivity, just… brighter lights bother me a little more than usual. And… now that I think about it, I’ve been feelin’ kinda tired lately. Just generally run down, you know? But I figured that’s just gettin’ old! I'm eighty-four, Doctor. Tiredness comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: That's good information, Percell. Light sensitivity with the headache and the general tiredness are worth noting. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. No diabetes, no heart trouble. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was maybe sixty, but that cleared up with antibiotics. And… oh, my doctor, back in Wisconsin, he used to say I had slightly high cholesterol, but he never put me on any medicine for it. He just told me to watch my diet. And… I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. Nothing major, really. I’ve always been a fairly healthy fella. That’s why this headache is so strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, slightly elevated cholesterol, and appendix removed years ago. Otherwise, generally healthy. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not a single one. I don’t much believe in pills, if I can help it. I take a multivitamin every now and then, just to be on the safe side, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I mostly try to eat a balanced diet and get a little exercise when I can – walkin’ around the block, you know. I really try to avoid putting anything in my body that wasn’t grown there naturally, if that makes sense. Old Hmong habits, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, just an occasional multivitamin. And you prioritize a natural lifestyle. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled around a bit, and never had any problems. My wife, God rest her soul, she used to tease me that I had an iron stomach. I guess I was just lucky. No allergies to speak of, Doctor. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like headaches, heart disease, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a tough one. My family… we didn’t really talk about medical stuff much, you know? We weren't big on doctors, not back then. My mother, she lived to be a good age, but she had some trouble with her joints when she got older, arthritis, I think. And my father, he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away when he was still a fairly young man. As for headaches… I don’t remember anyone else complainin’ much about headaches. My wife, she got migraines sometimes, real bad ones, but these don’t feel like migraines, not at all. More of a dull ache, like I said. It's hard to say for sure, Doctor. We didn’t keep good records, and a lot of my family is back in Laos.
DOCTOR: Okay, some joint trouble and heart issues in the family, your wife had migraines, but your headaches feel different. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, I try to stay active. I live in an apartment building, thankfully, so I don't have to worry about stairs too much. I walk around the block most days, sometimes to the little market down the street. I like to read the newspaper, keep up with current events. I used to volunteer at the community center, helpin’ folks with their taxes, but I had to give that up a while back. Just too much strain on my eyes, you see. I spend a lot of time thinkin’ these days. Reflectin’ on life, you know? And watchin’ the news… can’t help but worry about the state of things. I live alone now, my wife passed away five years ago. It gets lonely sometimes, but I have a few friends I see now and then. It’s a quiet life, Doctor. A peaceful life, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet and peaceful life, but with some loneliness and concern about current events. Now, just to clarify, are you currently working, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m still workin’, yes. Still doin’ financial advisin’. I have a little office I go to a few days a week. Not as much as I used to, mind you. I’ve been doin’ it for over fifty years, you see. It keeps my mind sharp, and I enjoy helpin’ people plan for their future. It’s a good feelin’, knowin’ you’ve made a difference in someone’s life. Some folks retire and just sit around, but I like to keep busy. And it pays the bills, of course. A man’s gotta eat, right?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re still working as a financial advisor a few days a week. That's good. Now, one last question about your lifestyle before we move on to a physical exam. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness no, not a drop. Never had much of a taste for alcohol. My wife, she liked a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I always stuck to water. And smokin’? Never touched it. Horrible habit, in my opinion. And recreational drugs… well, that’s just not my style. I’m an old Hmong man, Doctor. We believe in livin’ a clean life, takin’ care of your body. That’s just the way I was raised. Never felt the need for any of those things. So, no, none of the above. Clean livin’ all the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Clean living. Now, Percell, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I haven’t had a good exam in a while, truth be told. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Percell. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your neck muscles are tense. Otherwise, your heart and lungs sound okay, and your neurological exam is normal. I’m going to check your eyes now, just to rule out anything obvious. Your eyes look good. Given everything you've told me, and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you are likely experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to stress and muscle tension in your neck. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to run some blood tests just to rule out any other underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests can’t hurt, I suppose. Tension headache, you say? That’s what my wife used to get sometimes. She used to rub peppermint oil on her temples. Maybe that’s what this is. Stress… yes, well, there’s plenty of that to go around these days. And workin’ with numbers all day… it does take a toll on the eyes, you know? So, yes, blood tests sound good. Let’s rule things out, as you say. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a good baseline and help rule out any underlying medical conditions. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend trying over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the headache. Also, try to incorporate some stress-reducing techniques into your daily routine, like deep breathing exercises or meditation. And staying hydrated is always a good idea. While we're waiting for the results, I’d also like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that could help lower your blood pressure. Things like reducing sodium intake, increasing potassium intake, and getting regular exercise are all important. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Ibuprofen, I think my wife used to take that sometimes, yes. And stress-reducing techniques… well, I suppose I could try a little deep breathin’. I used to enjoy gardenin’, maybe I should get back to that. And less salt, more potassium… I can work on that. My friend, Mrs. Lee, she makes a good potassium-rich soup. I'll ask her for the recipe. No, I think I understand everything you’re sayin’. Lifestyle modifications, blood tests… sounds like a plan. One question, though. About these blood tests… will they hurt? I’m not a big fan of needles, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Percell. They will involve a small needle prick, but it’s usually very quick and not very painful. It’s just a little pinch, and it’s over before you know it. The phlebotomist, the person who draws the blood, is very skilled and will make sure you’re comfortable. We'll use a small needle, and they can also numb the area if you’re particularly anxious. We can take it slow, and you can tell them to stop at any time if you’re feeling uncomfortable. It’s much more important that you feel safe and relaxed. Would you like me to explain the blood test procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: That's… good to know, Doctor. That it won’t be too bad. And that I can tell them to stop if it’s uncomfortable. That puts my mind at ease. No, I think I understand. Just a little pinch, and I can stop them if needed. I suppose I can handle a little pinch. I’ve survived eighty-four years, after all. A little needle shouldn’t be too much trouble. No, I don’t think I need any further explanation. Let’s just get it over with, when you’re ready. I trust your team, Doctor. They sound very capable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. Alright. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure again and answer any questions you may have. Once we get the results back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to manage your headaches and blood pressure. In the meantime, if your headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, stiff neck, vision changes, or weakness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Headache gets worse… new symptoms… I’ll keep an eye out. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your patience with an old man like me. You've put my mind at ease. I’m ready when the nurse is. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Percell. It was my pleasure meeting you. We'll get this sorted out together. I’ll leave you to the nurse now. She’ll be right with you. Have a good day, Percell. And don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse. .
