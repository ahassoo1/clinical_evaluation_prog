DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to sit here recounting my life story. I woke up this morning and couldn’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. That’s it. Is that enough for a diagnosis? It’s rather frightening, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you we will work as efficiently as possible. Sudden hearing loss and facial weakness are concerning, and it's absolutely right to seek medical attention immediately. However, to provide the best and most accurate care, I do need to ask a few questions – not to recount your life story, but to understand exactly what’s happening and rule out potential causes. It's important to gather enough information to determine the best course of action. Would you mind if we start with when you first noticed the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. It was… this morning. Woke up, went to say good morning to the help, and… nothing. Just silence in my left ear. And when I looked in the mirror… well, one side of my face isn’t working right. It’s not paralysis, exactly, but it definitely sags. It’s quite alarming, I must say. I haven't hit my head or anything, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. That’s helpful. So, this started this morning, with both the hearing loss and facial weakness occurring simultaneously?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. At the same time. I didn't wake up gradually losing hearing, it was just… gone. And the face thing was immediately noticeable when I looked in the mirror. Honestly, I don’t understand why it would just happen. I'm a perfectly healthy woman, or at least I was yesterday. It's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Sudden onset of both hearing loss and facial weakness is definitely something we need to investigate promptly. It’s good you came in right away. To help me understand the facial weakness better, could you describe exactly what you’re noticing?
PATIENT: Oh, really? What exactly would you like me to do, draw you a diagram? It's… difficult to explain. The left side of my face just doesn't move like the right. When I smile, it pulls… less. I can’t really… close my eye properly on that side either. And when I drink water, it dribbles. It's embarrassing, frankly. Do you need me to demonstrate? I'd rather not, if I’m honest. It's undignified.
DOCTOR: You’re describing exactly what I need to know, Ms. Nissenbaum. No diagrams or demonstrations are necessary if you’re not comfortable. The difficulty with closing your eye, the asymmetry of your smile, and the difficulty drinking are all important clues. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief neurological exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. It's nothing to be worried about, just a way for me to assess the nerves in your face and head. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to poke and prod? Really? Fine. But be gentle. I’m not some child. And don’t take all day. I have things to do, you know. This is already a considerable inconvenience. Just get it over with, quickly and efficiently, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. This won’t take long. First, I'm going to check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we'll move on to the neurological exam. Okay, Ms. Nissenbaum, can you tell me if you’re experiencing any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… oddness. Everything feels a little… strange on that side of my face. Tingling, maybe? It’s hard to describe. And frankly, it's unsettling to have someone poking at my face. Is this going to lead anywhere? Because honestly, I'm not convinced anything productive is happening here. I’ve always had excellent doctors who could diagnose things with a simple look, not endless prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. It’s certainly not ideal to be undergoing a series of tests, and I apologize if this feels intrusive. However, these assessments are crucial in helping me determine the cause of your symptoms and rule out more serious conditions. I'm noting some weakness on the left side of your face, particularly affecting your ability to close your eye and smile fully. Your sensation appears intact, and your strength in your arms and legs is normal. Based on what you've described and my initial examination, the most likely possibility at this stage is Bell's palsy. It’s a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles, often due to inflammation of the facial nerve. However, to rule out other potential causes – such as a stroke or tumor – I would like to order a blood test and a CT scan of your head. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A scan? Honestly, all of this seems… excessive. A scan? I haven’t even had a cold in years! And you’re talking about a scan? Is this absolutely necessary? I distinctly remember my previous doctor diagnosing things with a simple otoscope, not an elaborate investigation! And what does this palsy even mean? Is it serious? Will I be… disfigured? Just tell me straight, Doctor, will I be okay? And frankly, what is the cost of this scan? I don’t even have insurance, you know. This is becoming a rather expensive inconvenience.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Nissenbaum. It’s reasonable to question the necessity of these tests, and I apologize for the anxiety this is causing you. Let me explain. Bell's palsy, while often frightening, is usually not life-threatening. It’s caused by inflammation of a nerve, and in many cases, it resolves on its own with treatment. However, it’s important to rule out other, more serious causes with a CT scan—that’s why I’m recommending it. It's a precaution to ensure we're providing the correct care. Regarding disfigurement, the weakness can cause facial asymmetry, but in most cases, function returns over time with treatment, often involving corticosteroids and sometimes antiviral medications. Physical therapy can also help. While complete recovery isn’t always guaranteed, many patients experience significant improvement. Now, regarding the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance, and I am very concerned about that. Let me speak with our billing department and see what options are available. We may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. I will also see if there are any charitable organizations that might be able to help cover the cost of the scan. Before we proceed with the scan, I want to ensure you feel comfortable and informed. Would you like me to explain Bell’s palsy in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Explain it. But keep it brief. I haven’t got all day, you know. And don’t patronize me. I’m a perfectly intelligent woman. Just tell me what it is, what causes it, and what they’ll do to me. And the cost, Doctor. Don't forget the cost. That’s the most important part, frankly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. As I mentioned, Bell’s palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of your face. It's thought to be caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, which controls those muscles. The exact cause isn't always known, but it’s often linked to viral infections, stress, or, in some cases, no identifiable cause at all. It’s not typically caused by a stroke, which is why the CT scan is important – to rule that out. As for what we’ll do, the treatment typically involves a course of corticosteroids—these are anti-inflammatory medications that help reduce swelling around the nerve. In some cases, we may also prescribe antiviral medications. We'll likely refer you to physical therapy to help you strengthen your facial muscles and regain function. Regarding the cost, I've just spoken with the billing department. The CT scan typically costs around $800 to $1,200. However, they’ve agreed to offer you a 20% discount, bringing the cost down to approximately $640 to $960. They also offer a payment plan if you're unable to pay the full amount upfront. I’m also looking into potential financial assistance programs. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the CT scan and the initial course of corticosteroids?
PATIENT: A payment plan? How much a month? And what happens if I can't pay? Will they send the debt collectors after me? This is all very unsettling. I distinctly remember a time when doctors actually cared about their patients, not just their wallets! Fine. Order the scan. But I’m not making any promises about the payment. And if I get a bill for more than $800, I'm contesting it. I'm a reasonable woman, but I won't be taken advantage of. And if this doesn't work, and I'm still stuck with half a face, I'm holding you personally responsible. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I assure you, we will work with you to ensure you receive the care you need without undue financial burden. The billing department has confirmed a payment plan option of $100 per month for eight to twelve months, depending on the final cost. They also assured me they would work with you if you experience difficulty making payments. They will not send debt collectors without first attempting to find a reasonable solution. I also want to assure you that my primary concern is your health and well-being. I will monitor your progress closely, and we will adjust the treatment plan as needed. I will now order the CT scan and write a prescription for a course of corticosteroids. The scan will be scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. You’ll need to arrive 15 minutes early to complete the paperwork. Do you have any questions about the scan or the medication?
PATIENT: Medication… side effects? What horrible things will this do to me now? I haven’t got time for nausea and weight gain. Honestly, it's one thing after another. And will this interfere with my… other medications? I take a little something for my nerves, you understand. And is this… contagious? I have staff. I can’t have them falling ill because of me. Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it likely to spread? And will it cause permanent damage? I need to know. I'm a practical woman, you see. I need to plan.
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Ms. Nissenbaum. Let’s address them one by one. Corticosteroids, like all medications, can have side effects. The most common ones include increased appetite, temporary weight gain, and, occasionally, mood changes. Nausea is less common, but possible. However, these side effects are usually mild and temporary, and they typically resolve once you stop taking the medication. Regarding interactions with your other medications, could you please tell me the name and dosage of the medication you take for your nerves?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, it’s… let me see… it’s called… Lorazepam. Half a milligram, twice a day. It helps me… calm my nerves. You understand. Life is stressful. And I’m already anxious about this whole… ordeal. And it’s not contagious, is it? Tell me straight. I can’t have my staff getting ill because of me. That would be… disastrous.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lorazepam and corticosteroids generally don't have significant interactions, but it's good to be aware. The combination could potentially increase the sedative effects of Lorazepam, so just be cautious if you feel drowsy or lightheaded. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how the medications affect you. And to answer your primary concern, no, Bell’s palsy is not contagious. It’s not caused by a virus or bacteria, so it cannot be spread to your staff or anyone else. You can continue to interact with them without any risk of transmission. Here are the orders for the CT scan and the prescription for the corticosteroids. The prescription is good for 30 days, with one refill. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long. And make sure this scan doesn’t cost me an arm and a leg. Honestly, the stress of this whole ordeal is enough to make my palsy worse. And if it doesn't improve… what then? What’s the worst-case scenario? Don’t sugarcoat it. I need to know what I'm dealing with. A practical woman, remember?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your need for a clear picture. While most people with Bell’s palsy recover fully, sometimes there can be lingering effects. The most common lingering effect is mild facial weakness or muscle twitching, which may take several months to resolve. In rare cases, there can be more permanent facial weakness, difficulty closing the eye fully, or changes in taste. However, we have options to manage these complications, including physical therapy, eye drops to keep your eye moist, and, in very rare instances, surgical procedures to improve facial function. But let’s focus on the positive. The majority of people recover fully with treatment, and we’ll do everything we can to ensure you have the best possible outcome. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week after your scan to discuss the results and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Nissenbaum. I wish you a speedy recovery.
PATIENT: Hmph. We’ll see.
