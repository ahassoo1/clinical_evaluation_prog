DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Sobkowicz, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just… chest pain. And my heart, it feels… flippy. Like a fish. And the nurse, she say my blood pressure too high. I no like. Very uncomfortable. Let’s get this over with, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain and feeling like your heart is “flipping” – that is uncomfortable, and we definitely want to figure out what’s going on. And yes, the nurse did mention your blood pressure was elevated. We'll get this sorted out as quickly as we can. First, can you tell me a little more about this chest pain?
PATIENT: More? What more to tell? It hurts! Like… squeezing. Sometimes in the middle, sometimes a little to the left. It come and go. Happens mostly when I… when I walk fast. Or if I get angry. My wife, she always tell me to calm down. She no understand. It just happens. Is not from being angry!
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing pain, mostly in the center or a little to the left, and it comes and goes, especially with walking or when you're upset… That’s helpful information. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time. Maybe… six months? Seven? I no keep good track. Old man problems. It was small at first. I thought nothing of it. Just a little… discomfort. But it get worse. Now, it scare my wife. She make me come here. Always worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for things to start small and gradually worsen. And it’s good your wife encourages you to get things checked out – it’s always best to be cautious. So, six to seven months of this squeezing chest pain that comes and goes with activity or stress. Besides the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get tired easier. And… sometimes, I feel a little dizzy. Not fall-down dizzy, just… woozy. And I sweat a lot. Even when it not hot. My wife say I look pale too. She always notice everything. Honestly, I just want a pill to make it stop. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, dizziness – not enough to fall, but a woozy feeling – sweating even when you’re not hot, and your wife says you look pale. All of those things are important to know. It sounds like we need to do a thorough check-up to figure out what's going on. It might be something simple, but with chest pain, we always want to rule out anything serious. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again. Then I'll want to ask a few more questions about your medical history, any medications you take, and your family history. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just be quick about it. My blood pressure is probably still high because of all this waiting. And please, no poking and prodding. I no like needles either. Just listen. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll do my best to be as quick and gentle as possible. We can definitely start with just listening to your heart and lungs. I promise to explain everything I’m doing as I go. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your breathing and heartbeat, okay?
PATIENT: Hurry up. My back not so good. And don't expect me to tell you everything. I forget things. Old age, you know. Just listen to the heart. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing deeply for me, please… in and out… I'm hearing a slightly rapid heartbeat, and your breathing sounds a little… diminished on the lower lobes of both lungs. I also detect a very faint murmur – a sort of whooshing sound – when I listen to your heart. It’s subtle, but it’s worth investigating further. Your blood pressure is still elevated, 160/95. We’ll need to address that. Now, just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about any other medical problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmph. Medical problems? What do you mean? I get the usual old man stuff. Achy joints. Bad back. Sometimes trouble sleeping. My wife always say I snore too loud. She sleep in the other room sometimes. I had the flu, maybe ten years ago? And I broke my arm when I was young, falling from a tree. Stupid tree. And… oh! I had high cholesterol, the doctor say. He gave me pills for that. I stop taking them. They make me feel… funny. Is that what you want to know? This is getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy joints, bad back, trouble sleeping, high cholesterol… and you stopped taking the cholesterol medication because it made you feel unwell. That's all helpful information. Do you remember what medication you were taking for the cholesterol?
PATIENT: No! I no remember the name. It was a little white pill. Small. I took it for… a few months, maybe. My wife, she probably remember. She keeps track of everything. But she not here. Just… stop asking about pills. They make me sick. And they didn’t even help! My numbers were still high when I stopped. What’s the point?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You don’t remember the name of the medication and you didn’t feel it was effective, so you stopped taking it. No problem, we can look into that later if needed. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My wife, of course. She very healthy. And my son, he lives in America. I no see him much. He busy. And my parents… they both gone now. Long time ago. My father, he had a weak heart. He die young. That’s all I remember. Nothing important. Is this going to take all day? I have appointments!
DOCTOR: Okay, your wife is healthy, your son lives in America, and your father passed away at a young age due to a weak heart. That’s helpful to know. Knowing about your father’s heart condition is particularly important. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can talk about a plan. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never! Stupid habit. Makes you smell bad. My wife would never allow it. She very strict. Always telling me to eat healthy. And exercise. I try, but my back… it’s not easy. Never smoked. Never will. Now, can we please be done? I’m getting tired. And my back is killing me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. You've never smoked. That’s excellent. Now, just to be thorough, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little. Sometimes. Just a glass of wine with dinner. My wife, she likes it too. Not every night. Just… for relaxation. It’s good for the heart, I think. A little bit. Not like those… those heavy drinkers. Just a small glass. Is that a problem? I don’t get drunk. Never. Just… calm. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, that gives me a better understanding of your overall health. Given your age, your history of chest pain, the elevated blood pressure, and your father’s heart condition, I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? More poking and prodding? I no like tests. Is it expensive? I have insurance, but still… I just want a pill! A simple pill to make it stop. Can’t you just give me a pill? This is ridiculous. But… fine. If you have to. But make it quick. And explain everything. I no want any surprises. What kind of tests are you talking about? Blood test? X-ray? Tell me!
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Sobkowicz. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to make this as comfortable and quick as possible. I’m thinking we should start with a few things. First, a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out any other underlying issues. Second, an EKG – that's a simple, painless test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. And finally, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. These tests will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and decide on the best course of treatment. If the tests show anything concerning, we might need to consider further evaluation with a cardiologist – a heart specialist. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Blood test, EKG, X-ray… all of it. Just get it over with. But no needles if you can help it. And explain everything! I want to know what you’re looking for. And if it show something bad… I don’t want to hear it. Just tell my wife. She can handle it. Just… hurry up. My back is killing me. And I have things to do. Important things. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz. I understand. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything as we go. I will do my best to minimize any discomfort, and we’ll avoid needles if possible. The blood test will help us assess your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. The EKG will measure the electrical activity of your heart and help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of a previous heart attack. And the chest X-ray will give us a picture of your lungs and heart, allowing us to look for any enlargement or abnormalities. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood first. Then we'll do the EKG right here in the exam room. After that, we'll go to the X-ray department. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. And tell the nurse… be gentle. My veins are old. And tell her to hurry. I have appointments. Important appointments. And don't bother explaining everything to me again. I already heard it. Just… do it. Now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. I’ll also make sure she understands you'd prefer a quick and efficient process. Nurse Lee, could you please come in and draw Mr. Sobkowicz’s blood?
