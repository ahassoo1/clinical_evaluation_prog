DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor… Billman, is it? Yes, Billman. It’s… this waterworks situation. Been going to the bathroom a lot lately. More than usual, you understand. It’s a bother, really. Interrupts things.
DOCTOR: Right. "Waterworks situation," okay. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Time… slips away, doesn’t it? I’d say… a few weeks, maybe? It’s hard to put a finger on it. My wife, bless her heart, she's the one who actually notices these things. She kept saying I was going back and forth like a… a shuttlecock. Is that the right word?
DOCTOR: A shuttlecock... right. Okay. And would you say it's more frequent during the day, or at night, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Hmm. Consistent, I suppose. Though… now that you mention it, maybe a bit more at night. Keeps me from sleeping soundly, you know? Have to get up… disrupts the whole rhythm of things. Used to be able to sleep right through, like a log. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. It’s not uncomfortable, just… frequent. And a bit… weak, maybe? Like it doesn't all come out at once, you understand? A dribble, sort of. Though I wouldn't call it a dribble, exactly. It's… diminished. That's a better word, I think. Diminished flow.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished flow… and frequent urination, mostly consistent, but perhaps a little worse at night. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color… well, it looks like… urine, doesn't it? Yellow. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker. Depends what I drink, I suppose. And smell… I don't go sniffing it, doctor! You expect me to go smelling my own… well, you know. Honestly. I'm a farmer, not a… a chemist.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. No need to… analyze it yourself. Have you been drinking more fluids than usual lately, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… maybe a little. It’s been hot, you see. August, it always is. Can’t go without a drink of water when it’s this warm. My wife makes me iced tea, sometimes lemonade. But no more than usual, I don't think. It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My knees ache, if that counts. Old age, you know. And I forget things, constantly. Though that’s nothing new. Can’t remember what I had for breakfast half the time. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, we’re here to discuss the issue with your urination. Are you experiencing any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute! No need to shout, doctor. I’m not deaf, you know. And no, no fever, no chills, no… what was it? Nausea? Vomiting? Absolutely not. Perfectly fine, otherwise. Just this waterworks situation.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What for? I told you, I'm fine! Just a bit… frequent. I haven't been feeling sick, just… older. Still, if you insist. But don't go poking and prodding too much, you hear?
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Segretto. Just need to listen to your abdomen, check your prostate… routine stuff. Please, have a seat on the table.
PATIENT: Prostate? Now hold on a minute. What’s this about checking my prostate? I don't like the sound of that at all. I’m a farmer, not some… some specimen. This is getting ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, prostate exams are a crucial part of evaluating urinary issues in men your age. It's a quick procedure and helps us rule out several potential causes. We need to assess whether your prostate is enlarged, which can be causing your frequent urination. It's for your own health. Are you refusing the exam?
PATIENT: Look, doctor, I appreciate your… concern. But I’m not comfortable with this whole thing. I didn’t come here for… poking around. I just wanted to know why I have to go to the bathroom so often, not get… examined. This is getting very uncomfortable. I think I'll just go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, you are not making this easy. I understand your discomfort, but refusing a basic exam significantly limits my ability to determine the cause of your symptoms. Frequent urination can be a sign of several serious conditions, including infection, prostate issues, or even bladder cancer. I strongly recommend you reconsider. However, if you absolutely refuse, I can provide you with a referral to a urologist who can discuss your concerns and perform the necessary tests. But frankly, I’m concerned that delaying proper evaluation could be detrimental to your health. Are you willing to proceed with a basic abdominal exam and a digital rectal exam, or would you prefer a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: Well… that sounds… serious. Cancer, you say? My wife always tells me to listen to the doctor. But… that exam. It doesn't sound pleasant at all. Alright, alright. But quick now, you hear? And gentle. Very gentle. And no funny business. Just get it over with. But if it's too uncomfortable, I'm stopping it right then and there.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on your back. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m going to need you to bend over and touch your toes. Your back feels normal as well. Now, we’ll need to proceed with the digital rectal exam. I'm going to apply some lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum to assess the size and texture of your prostate. This may be uncomfortable, but it's important. Please let me know if you experience any pain. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged and a little firm. It’s not acutely tender, but it's definitely not normal. This, combined with your frequent urination, warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? Firm? That doesn't sound good at all. So, what does this mean? Is it serious? Are you going to have to… cut it out? My wife’s going to kill me if I need surgery. Tell me straight, doctor. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It doesn't necessarily mean cancer, and it often doesn't require surgery. However, it can cause urinary problems like frequent urination, weak stream, and difficulty emptying your bladder. The firmness I felt is a little concerning, and while it's likely just BPH, we need to rule out other possibilities, including prostatitis – an inflammation of the prostate – and, yes, prostate cancer. To get a clearer picture, I’m going to order a Prostate-Specific Antigen blood test. This test measures the level of PSA in your blood, which can be elevated in cases of prostate cancer. I also want you to provide a urine sample for a urinalysis and a urine culture to check for infection. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of these tests. If the PSA is elevated or the urinalysis shows signs of infection, we may need to consider a referral to a urologist for further evaluation, which could include a biopsy. Right now, let's not jump to conclusions. These tests will give us the information we need to determine the best course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Biopsy… that sounds… awful. And a urologist? More poking and prodding, I suppose. Oh, this is just a mess. PSA… and a urine sample. Alright, alright. I can manage a urine sample. Where do I… do it? And how long until I get these results? My wife’s going to be beside herself with worry. She’s always been a worrier. And… what if it is cancer? What are my options then? Is there anything I can do to… prevent it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto, let’s take things one step at a time. First, the urine sample. The nurse will give you a collection cup and instructions. Please try to provide a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow. As for the results, the PSA test typically takes 2-3 business days to come back, and the urinalysis results are usually available within a day. We’ll contact you as soon as we have them. Now, regarding cancer… if it is cancer, there are several treatment options available, depending on the stage and grade of the cancer. These include active surveillance, surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy. We would discuss these options in detail with you and a urologist. As for prevention… there’s no guaranteed way to prevent prostate cancer. However, studies suggest that a healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight may reduce your risk. There’s also some evidence that certain nutrients, like lycopene, found in tomatoes, may be beneficial. But right now, it's premature to talk about treatment. Let’s get the test results first. I’m going to write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a urologist in town. If you have any concerning symptoms like blood in your urine or significant pain, please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Blood in my urine… oh, dear. No, no blood. Not yet. Just this… frequent going. Lycopene… tomatoes, you say? My wife makes a lovely tomato soup. I’ll have to ask her to make more. And Dr. Ramirez… is he a good doctor? Is he… gentle? I don’t want another poking and prodding session. I’m an old man, you know. Things aren’t what they used to be. I think… I think that’s all for now. Just… get those tests done quickly, doctor. And… tell Dr. Ramirez to be gentle, please. My wife will be so relieved.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez is a very reputable urologist and is known for being thorough and… patient. I’ll make a note on your referral regarding your concerns about gentleness. The nurse will escort you to the lab for your blood and urine tests. They'll provide you with detailed instructions. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. If you have any pressing concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. And Mr. Segretto… try not to worry too much. We're just taking the necessary steps to rule things out. .
