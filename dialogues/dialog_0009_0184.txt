DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get right to it. It’s this… this shape of me. I don’t like it. Too skinny. Always been skinny, but now… now it’s just… bad. Wife used to say I was all muscle, but she gone now, so what she say don’t matter. I want to fix it. You understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, I understand. You’re concerned about weight loss and feeling too thin. It sounds like this is something that's bothering you quite a bit, and I want to help figure out what’s going on. When you say “now it’s just bad,” can you tell me a little more about when you noticed this change?
PATIENT: Change? Well, after… after Martha passed. About six months ago now. I just… stopped eating, really. Not on purpose, you understand. Just… no appetite. And the weight just… melted off. Always been a strong man, pile driving and all, but now… feels like a breeze could knock me over. Used to be 160, easy. Now? Don't even ask. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the weight loss started around six months ago, shortly after your wife, Martha, passed away. That’s a significant life event, and it's not uncommon to experience changes in appetite and weight during times of grief. It sounds like this has been impacting you physically, and you feel weaker than before. To get a better understanding of what's happening, could you tell me about any other changes you've noticed?
PATIENT: Other changes? Hmmm… well, I tire easy. Real easy. Used to work all day, no problem. Now I gotta sit down after an hour. And I get cold. Even in the heat. Martha always said I had a good constitution, but this… this ain't good. Sleep ain't been good either. Just… restless. Wake up every hour, thinkin'. Mostly thinkin' about… well, never you mind what I'm thinkin' about. But yeah, tired, cold, and can’t sleep. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, that’s very helpful. Fatigue, feeling cold frequently, and difficulty sleeping are all important things to note. It sounds like you’re experiencing a cluster of symptoms. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. Had the flu a few times, broke my arm when I was a boy, fallin' out of a mango tree. Pile drivin’ is dangerous work, but I never had a serious illness. Doctor always said I was as strong as an ox. High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. Took some pills for it, stopped when Martha… well, stopped everything, really. Haven’t seen a doctor regular since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was previously managed with medication, but you stopped taking it after your wife passed. And no other serious illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Nope. Never needed 'em. Always been lucky, I guess. I mean, pile drivin’… you get bumps and bruises, the odd cut, but never nothin’ that needed a doctor to cut me open. Martha had her gallbladder out, but that was years ago. She didn’t like hospitals. Me neither, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries for you. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she died young. Something with her heart, I think. But I was just a boy. My father, he lived a long life, strong as me. Worked in the sugar cane fields. Cancer, maybe, with my aunt. But she smoked like a chimney. Everybody smoked back then. Not much I can tell you, really. Old family, but nobody talked much about sickness. Just got on with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart issues on your mother’s side and potential cancer with your aunt, who smoked. Now, let's talk about your daily habits. Do you drink alcohol or smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched the stuff. Martha smoked, but I told her it was killin' her. Alcohol… used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. A Red Stripe. But since Martha… haven't had the taste for it. What's the point, really? Everything tastes like dust these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you used to drink alcohol occasionally, but not since your wife passed. And you don’t smoke. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had a reaction to nothin'. Martha was allergic to bee stings, but I ain't never been stung. Doctors gave me some pills for my blood pressure years ago, but I don't remember nothin' wrong with them. Strong stomach, I guess. Pile drivin’ requires a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s all very helpful information, Mr. Trendler. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Look, I ain’t got all day. If you thinkin’ you can fix me, fine. If not, I’ll be goin’. But quick is the word. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. I will be as efficient as possible. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your overall condition. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is a little on the low side, but not critically so. Your heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. And your lungs sound a little quieter than they should be. Your abdomen is tender to the touch in a few spots. I'm also noting that your weight is 122 pounds. Is that about right?
PATIENT: 122? Yeah, that sounds about right. Maybe a little less, now that I think about it. Used to be 160, easy. Felt strong then. Now… feel like a skeleton. What does it mean, all this… faint and quiet? You findin' somethin' bad?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily “bad,” Mr. Trendler, but it does warrant further investigation. The low blood pressure, faint heart sounds, and diminished lung sounds, along with the weight loss and fatigue, are all things we need to explore. The tenderness in your abdomen is also a bit concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. We should also check your vitamin D and B12 levels. Additionally, I think a chest X-ray would be helpful to get a better look at your lungs. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests? X-rays? Look, I don’t like this. All this poking and prodding and… and waitin’. Is it somethin’ serious? You gonna tell me I got… what, cancer? Is that what you’re gettin’ at? I ain’t got time for all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Trendler, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to alarm you. The tests are simply to help us understand what’s causing your symptoms. It's important to rule out potential causes, and that includes things like cancer, but also many other less serious possibilities. Right now, we don’t have enough information to make a diagnosis. The tests will give us a clearer picture. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency or a thyroid problem. It could be something more serious, but we need the test results to know for sure. I want to assure you that we will discuss the results thoroughly, and I will explain everything in a way that you understand. We’ll work together to come up with a plan that’s right for you. Would you like me to explain the tests in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Look, just get it over with. The tests. Whatever you need. Just… hurry up. I got things to do. And don't talk down to me, I understand perfectly fine. Just tell me where to go and how long it'll take.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is on the same floor. You'll need to provide a urine sample and have some blood drawn. The blood work will take about 15-20 minutes, and the X-ray should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 2-3 business days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here are the forms. Do you have any questions about where to go or what to expect?
PATIENT: No. Just… get it done. And call me when you got somethin'. Don't waste my time. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
