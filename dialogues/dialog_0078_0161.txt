DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just… well, a friend suggested I come talk to someone about staying safe. About… preventing HIV. I don’t really know much about it, to be perfectly frank. I just want to make sure I’m doing everything I can.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Helaina. It’s always best to be proactive about your health, and it’s completely normal to have questions. We can definitely discuss HIV prevention. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? Not really concerns, exactly. More like… I’m single, you know? And I date. I try to be careful, of course, but you hear things. And I want to be extra sure. A friend of mine… she mentioned something about a pill you can take, to avoid getting it even if something… happens. Is that right? Is that what this is about? I just want to know if it’s something I should consider.
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. It’s a very effective medication for preventing HIV. Your friend is correct; it's a pill you take daily, and it can significantly reduce your risk. It’s a great option to consider, and we can discuss whether it’s right for you. Before we go further, to make sure PrEP is a good fit, I need to gather a little more information about your overall health and risk factors. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Ask away. I don’t mind at all. I just… I hope it’s not too complicated. I’m not really good with medical things, if you know what I mean. Mostly just try to avoid needing them, if possible. But this feels important.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. No need to worry about complicated medical jargon. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing serious. I get my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy sometimes when I pick up a prescription, and it's always been normal. I haven't been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, probably five years. Maybe more. I try to stay healthy, eat reasonably well, and I walk a lot with my dog. Nothing major ever flagged, though. I have Medicare, so they would have told me if something was wrong, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And having regular check-ins with the pharmacy is helpful. Medicare is thorough, so that’s reassuring. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been hospitalized. And no surgeries either. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree, but it just needed a cast. That’s about it, honestly. I’m a fairly… robust person, I guess you could say. I haven't had a lot of need for doctors, thankfully. Is this about to change? I’m hoping not, but I’m glad I’m getting this checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean it will! We’re just gathering information to ensure we make the best decisions for your health. Okay, moving on. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My mother had… high cholesterol, I think. And she had some trouble with her knees as she got older, arthritis, maybe? My father… he had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. But other than that… not really. My grandmother on my mother’s side lived to be ninety-eight, so good genes on that side, I guess. Does that matter? It feels a long way off, thinking about family history. I'm more worried about what I'm doing now, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. Family history can give us some clues, but you’re right to focus on your current health. We’ll definitely factor that in. Now, a little bit about your social history, if you don't mind me asking. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh. That kind of social history. Well… I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Maybe three or four times a week. Nothing excessive, I don't think. I used to smoke, years ago, when I was younger and… foolish. But I quit over twenty years ago, and I haven’t touched a cigarette since. And no, absolutely not with the drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a very… straightforward person, if you know what I mean. I like things simple and clean. Does the wine matter? I really just want to be honest with you. I don't want to be judged, or anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Helaina. I’m not here to judge, just to gather information to provide the best care. A few glasses of wine a week is good to know. And quitting smoking is fantastic – that significantly reduces your health risks. Now, before we move on to allergies and medications, could you tell me if you have any sexual partners?
PATIENT: Well… yes. I date. Occasionally. It’s… not regular. And honestly, it’s been less frequent lately. I’m not… actively looking, if that makes sense. I’m just… open to possibilities. I meet people online sometimes, or through friends. It's nothing serious, and I always use protection, of course. I’m very careful. Is this about… STDs? Because I get tested regularly, if that’s what you’re asking. I want to be responsible, and I take things seriously. I just… it feels a bit personal, talking about this. But I understand you need to know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Helaina. It's perfectly natural to feel a bit uncomfortable discussing this, and I understand. Knowing you use protection and get tested is excellent. It's good that you're taking responsibility for your health. Just to clarify, do you primarily have sexual contact with men, women, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly men, I suppose. Though I'm not… exclusive. It's been a while since I've been with a woman, to be honest. But I wouldn’t rule it out. It’s more about the person, really. But yes, primarily men. I hope that clarifies things. I just want to be… thorough, if that makes sense. I don't want to leave anything out. Is this important for the pill? I'm starting to worry I'm asking too many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Helaina. It’s good to be thorough, and this information is important for determining if PrEP is right for you and for monitoring your health while on it. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections – STIs – like chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, or herpes?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I've been tested regularly, as I said, and everything has always come back clear. I'm very particular about that, to be honest. It’s a non-negotiable. I wouldn't… I wouldn't risk it. I have a good relationship with my doctor, and I take it very seriously. I get tested before starting a new relationship, and I encourage my partners to do the same. I’m very upfront about it. I just… it’s important to me. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. I haven’t had any issues, thankfully. Is this all? I’m starting to feel a bit drained, talking about all of this. It’s not exactly a pleasant conversation.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to discuss these things, and I appreciate you being so open with me. And it's good to hear you've been proactive about STI testing. Finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no regular medications. Just an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. And no allergies, thankfully. Nothing to bee stings or anything like that, either. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I just… I'm a fairly healthy person, overall. I really try to take care of myself. This whole thing is… a bit unsettling, to be honest. I’m starting to feel like I need a glass of wine just thinking about it. Is this all the questions? I really appreciate you being so understanding. I’m just… a bit overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Helaina. No, that’s all the questions for now. You've provided a lot of helpful information. You are a healthy person, and being proactive about this is a smart move. Now, based on what you’ve told me, PrEP could be a good option for you. Before we proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam and some blood work to ensure there are no underlying health issues that would prevent you from starting PrEP. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to make sure I’m doing the right thing. I want to be safe, and I trust your judgment. A physical exam and blood work sounds… sensible. Is it going to be uncomfortable? I’m not a fan of needles, if you know what I mean. But I’ll do whatever it takes. Just… please be gentle?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take it slow and I'll explain everything as we go. The physical exam will be fairly routine – just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick check of your overall health. As for the blood work, it's mostly just a standard test to check your kidney function and screen for any infections. We'll start with the physical exam. Could you please sit up and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead. Just… try not to startle me. I jump easily. And please, no cold stethoscopes! That’s always the worst part. Honestly, I don't understand why they have to be so cold. It's a bit barbaric, if you ask me. But go ahead. I’m ready. I think.
DOCTOR: I completely agree about the cold stethoscope – it’s a common complaint! I always make sure to warm it up first. Okay, just breathe normally for me. Everything sounds clear. Your heart rate is good, and your lungs are nice and clear. Now, I’m just going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. I always get a bit anxious at the doctor, even though I know it's silly. I just… don't like being poked and prodded. It reminds me of being a child. I guess it's a control thing. I like to be in control. Is my blood pressure high? I had a glass of wine with dinner last night… does that matter? Oh, dear. I'm probably making a fool of myself. I just… I get nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious at the doctor, Helaina. And you're not making a fool of yourself at all. Your blood pressure is 128/78, which is perfectly normal. The glass of wine last night didn’t affect it. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no abdominal pain. Everything feels fine. Honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty good lately. I walk my dog every morning, which helps. He’s a rescue, a little terrier mix. Keeps me busy. He's a bit of a handful, but I love him to bits. He’s probably the best thing that’s happened to me in a long time. He certainly keeps me from getting bored. And forces me to go outside, which is good for my health, I suppose. Are you sure you don't think the wine affected my blood pressure? I always worry about things like that. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac, I suppose.
DOCTOR: No, your blood pressure is perfectly normal. A single glass of wine won't raise it significantly. It sounds like you’re taking good care of yourself with the walks and having a wonderful companion in your dog. Okay, everything sounds good during the physical exam. Now, we just need to get some blood work done. This will confirm your overall health and screen for any infections. I’ll write you a lab order, and you can go down to the lab on the first floor. Do you know how to get there?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I remember seeing it when I came in. Down the hall and to the left, I believe. Is it a long wait usually? I hate needles, as I’ve mentioned, and I tend to get a bit faint. Perhaps I should bring a magazine? Or a distraction? I really appreciate you being so patient with me. I know I’m probably being a bit of a bother. But I just… get anxious at these things. I’m a bit of a worrywart, as you’ve probably gathered. Is there anything I should do to prepare? Or eat? Or avoid? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Helaina. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about blood work, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. You can bring a magazine or distraction if you'd like. As for preparation, just make sure you’re well-hydrated. You don’t need to avoid anything specific. And if you feel faint, please let the lab technician know immediately. They are used to it and can help you feel comfortable. The wait time can vary, but it's usually not too long. Once the results are back – which usually takes a couple of days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide if PrEP is right for you. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly okay. A couple of days isn’t too bad. And I’ll definitely bring a magazine. And a bottle of water. And I’ll remember to tell them if I feel faint. You’ve been very thorough. And patient. I really appreciate it. I think I’m ready to go brave the lab now. Wish me luck! Hopefully, it won’t be too traumatic. Thank you again, Doctor Solero. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I’ll see you in a couple of days. Hopefully with good news.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. You've got this – it will be over before you know it. And I look forward to seeing you in a couple of days to discuss the results. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and please give your dog a pat from me! .
PATIENT: .
