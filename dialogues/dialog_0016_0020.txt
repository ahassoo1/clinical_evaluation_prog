DOCTOR: Hi Avril, welcome! It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth appointment, yes? My… the office, they told me to come. I feel… okay, mostly. Just… checking, you know? Like a regular check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly fine! So, a general check-up, just making sure everything's as it should be. That’s great. I see this is your first visit with me, and it looks like you haven’t been seen at our clinic before. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health generally?
PATIENT: Yes, first time. I… live here now, near the city. Before, I live in… small town. Not so good for doctors. Mostly, I am okay. A little tired sometimes, but who is not? My husband… he passed last year. That is hard. And… my knees. They bother me when the weather is bad. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Avril, that’s all very helpful, thank you. I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone is incredibly difficult. And yes, knowing about the tiredness and your knees is good information. Let’s start with the tiredness. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Is… a long time ago now, but still hard. The tired… it is not all the time. More in the afternoon, I think. Like… no energy. I sit and rest, and that helps a little. I sleep okay, usually. Eight hours, maybe. Not too much trouble sleeping. But I wake up… not feeling fresh, you know? Like… heavy. I drink coffee, then I am okay. For a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of an afternoon fatigue, not consistently all day, and sleep isn't really the issue. You're getting a good amount of sleep, but don't wake up feeling rested. And coffee helps temporarily. That’s good to know. Now, you mentioned your knees bother you when the weather is bad. Could you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. The knees… when it rains, or very cold… they ache. Is… hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, more like… a dull ache. And they feel… stiff. Hard to bend them. I have to move them slowly. Sometimes I take… what you call it… ibuprofen? The pills. They help a little. Not much, but a little. It is… annoying. I walk less when the weather is bad, because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache and stiffness in your knees, worse with rainy or cold weather. Ibuprofen provides some relief, but it’s not a complete fix, and you tend to reduce your activity when it's bad. Have you had any injuries to your knees in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries? Hmm… I do not think so. Not that I remember. I worked in a factory, long time ago. Lots of standing, lots of walking. Maybe I twisted them sometimes, but nothing… serious. No big falls, no breaks. Just… old knees, maybe? My mother, she had bad knees too. Is that what you mean? Like, did something happen to them?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – no specific injury that you recall, just a lot of wear and tear from work and a family history of knee problems. That definitely helps give me some context. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… back in the small town, he told me my blood pressure was a little high, a few years ago. He gave me pills for that too. I take them every day. I do not remember the name of them. And… I think he said my cholesterol was a little high, but not very high. He did not give me pills for that one. He said I should eat less… fat? Is that right? I try to eat healthy. Mostly. That is all I remember, I think. Nothing else. I had the usual… colds, flu. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication, and you were told your cholesterol was mildly elevated, which you're addressing with diet. That's helpful. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I take the blood pressure pills, and ibuprofen when my knees hurt. No problems with those. I have… sensitive skin, sometimes. But not really an allergy. Just… gets red easily. And the sun, I burn easy. But I use sunscreen. No… I do not think I have any allergies. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known drug or food allergies, just sensitive skin and a tendency to sunburn, which you manage with sunscreen. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills and the occasional ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No, just the blood pressure pills. And the ibuprofen when my knees… bother me. That is all. I take the blood pressure pills every morning, with my breakfast. And sometimes, when the weather is bad, I take the ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it. I do not like taking pills, you know? I only take them when I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication daily and ibuprofen as needed for knee pain. That's good to know. To finish up with your history, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What is that? I… I live alone now. My husband… he passed. I have a daughter, she lives in another state. We talk on the phone. I do not smoke. I do not drink. I used to work in a factory, but I am retired now. I like to garden. And read. Is that what you mean? Like… what I do?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I mean! That's very helpful. So you live alone, your husband passed last year, you have a daughter who lives out of state, you don't smoke or drink, and you enjoy gardening and reading. That paints a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's okay with you. Just to get a general sense of how things are going. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. I do not mind. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle with my knees, please? They are old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Avril. I’ll be very gentle. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Knees have some crepitus with movement, and a slight limitation in range of motion, particularly with bending. There’s a little tenderness on the inner side of both knees, but no significant swelling. Good pulses in all extremities. Okay, everything seems generally okay, but your knees are definitely showing some wear and tear, which isn't surprising given your history. And your blood pressure is a bit higher than we’d like. We’ll talk about that in a moment.
PATIENT: Okay. That is… good to know. The knees, I expect that. They always bother me. And the blood pressure… is that bad? Should I be worried? Maybe I need more pills?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you're aware of your body and these issues. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not at a level that requires immediate alarm. Increasing your medication is an option, but often we can try some lifestyle modifications first to see if we can get it under better control. Things like diet – reducing sodium intake and eating more fruits and vegetables – and regular, moderate exercise can make a big difference. Before we decide on a course of action, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out any other underlying causes for your slightly elevated blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Diet… I try. But it is hard, living alone. And exercise… my knees, you know? Maybe walking is okay. Not too much. So… blood work, and try to eat better, and walk a little. Is that right? And… when should I do the blood work? Is it at this office?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly right. Blood work, focus on improving your diet, and gentle walking when your knees allow. And yes, the blood work can be done right here in the office. We have a lab just down the hall. I'll give you a requisition form, and they’ll draw a few vials of blood. You’ll need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that is fine. Eight hours, no food… I can do that. Water is okay. Good. I will remember. And… after the blood work, how long until I know the results? And then we will talk about the blood pressure more? I hope it is not too bad.
DOCTOR: That’s great. We typically get the results back within 2-3 business days, so we can schedule a follow-up appointment for early next week to discuss them and make a plan for your blood pressure. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache, please don’t hesitate to call the office or go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, just focus on getting some rest, staying hydrated, and we'll figure everything out together. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you. You are very kind. Rest, drink water… and blood work tomorrow. I will remember. Thank you again. I… I think I will go now? Is that okay?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Avril. It was a pleasure meeting you. Yes, absolutely. You can head out whenever you’re ready. The lab is just down the hall on your left. Here’s your requisition form. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
