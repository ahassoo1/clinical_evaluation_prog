DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the insurance. Before it starts, I need to have this done. My friend told me I must do this before they will cover anything. It is very important to have this paper, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, a “check-up” for insurance purposes. I understand. We see a lot of that. Let's get this paperwork out of the way, then. Although, truthfully, simply fulfilling a requirement isn't particularly good medicine. But, we'll proceed as needed. Do you have any specific concerns besides the insurance form?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I am… mostly fine. I work, I eat, I sleep. What kind of concerns would I have? It is a waste of time to worry about things that are not happening. I am a practical man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Practical. Right. Very well. Even practical men experience health issues, Mr. Barban. It’s simply a matter of preventative care. To satisfy the insurance requirements—and, if you’ll permit me, to actually assess your health—I’ll need to ask some questions. Starting with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Illnesses? No, not really. A cold, maybe, sometimes. Nothing serious. When I was a small boy, I had… the fever. But that is normal, yes? Every child gets the fever. I do not remember much else. My mother always took care of everything. She had… special remedies. Old country things. Not important now.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Why would I need surgery? I am careful. I do not do foolish things that would require cutting me open. That sounds… unpleasant. Are you suggesting I look like someone who has been cut open, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Barban. It’s a standard question. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he passed some time ago. My mother is still alive, but very old. She lives… far away. She has… problems with her legs. And my brother, he is a fisherman. He is… strong, but drinks too much tea. Not much else to tell you. They are… family. They exist. Do you need a list of their shoe sizes, Doctor? Because I do not understand why you ask.
DOCTOR: No, shoe sizes aren’t necessary. I'm simply trying to get a picture of your family’s medical background. Were there any significant illnesses that ran in your family?
PATIENT: Illnesses… in my family? My uncle, I think, had problems with his stomach. Always complaining. But he also ate too many dates. It was probably just the dates. And my grandmother, she was… old. Old people get sick, yes? That is just what happens. There were no… terrible diseases or anything. Just old age and bad eating habits. Is this important, Doctor? Are you looking for a reason to deny my insurance?
DOCTOR: It's important to rule out potential predispositions, Mr. Barban. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. It is bad for you. My mother would kill me if I smoked. It smells terrible and makes you cough. A foolish habit. I do not understand why anyone would do such a thing. You are not suggesting I smoke, are you, Doctor? I seem a respectable man.
DOCTOR: No, of course not. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. Tea, mostly. And on special occasions, a small glass of something stronger. My brother makes it. It is… traditional. Not every day, Doctor. Just when we celebrate. A small amount. It helps with… digestion, yes? My mother says so. Is that a problem, Doctor? Are you judging my family traditions now?
DOCTOR: No, I am not "judging" anyone, Mr. Barban. It’s simply a matter of gathering information. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Nothing. I eat everything. Dates, fish, lamb… everything. My mother always said a strong stomach is important. I have never had a problem with any food. And I do not take… what do you call them? Pills? I do not take pills. Are you suggesting I am a weak man who needs pills to survive, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Very well. To complete the insurance requirements, and to actually get a sense of your current health status, I'd like to perform a basic physical examination. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Must you? It seems… unnecessary. I feel perfectly fine. But… if it is required for the insurance, I suppose. Just… be gentle. And do not take too long. I have things to do, you know. I do not have all day to be poked and prodded. Is this going to cost extra, Doctor? Because I do not want any surprises.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Barban. And no, it won't incur any additional charges. If you'll step over here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Please remove your coat. And try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? How can I relax when you are about to… attach something to my arm? This is… unsettling. Are you sure you are properly trained for this, Doctor? I have heard stories about… incompetent doctors. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Barban, I am fully qualified. Now, just keep your arm still. Blood pressure is… 140 over 90. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are… normal, though slightly distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Your respiration rate is 16. Now, if you would open your mouth, please. Let me take a quick look at your throat.
PATIENT: My throat is fine. I told you, I am perfectly healthy. Do not stick anything in there. It is probably just… dry. The air is very dry these days. I do not need a lecture on hydration, Doctor. My mother always made sure I drank enough water. Can we finish this now? I have… important things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I see no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Based on this limited examination, and the information you've provided – which, frankly, is rather sparse – you appear to be in… reasonably stable health. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated. We should repeat this measurement in a few months. And I strongly recommend a more comprehensive blood work-up. Cholesterol, blood sugar, a complete metabolic panel. It's preventative care, Mr. Barban. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Preventative care? Waste of time and money. I feel fine. And no, I do not have any questions. Just… give me the paper for the insurance. And tell me how long it will take for them to approve it. I need this sorted out quickly. I do not have time for lengthy procedures or unnecessary tests. Just the paper, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the form. It’s completed to the best of my ability, given the limited information I’ve received. It may take several weeks for the insurance company to process it. I cannot provide a more precise timeframe. I strongly advise you to reconsider the blood work-up, Mr. Barban. But, ultimately, it’s your decision. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That is all. Thank you. Waste of time. .
