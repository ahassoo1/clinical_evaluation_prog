DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconi. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. I believe I requested an appointment to discuss… plans for the future, should something… unexpected happen. I understand there are forms for this? I confess, my memory isn’t what it once was, and I want to be certain things are… in order.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. It sounds like you're interested in advance care planning – discussing what kind of medical care you'd want if you were unable to make decisions for yourself. That’s a very thoughtful thing to do. Yes, we do have forms, and we can go through them together. Before we get to the paperwork, though, perhaps you could tell me a little more about what prompted you to think about this now?
PATIENT: It's… difficult to say precisely. Things have been… hazy, lately. A friend mentioned it, actually. She said it was important, especially… well, we're not getting any younger, are we? And I realized… I hadn’t really considered what I would want. It feels… responsible, I suppose. Though, truthfully, I struggle to recall exactly why it came to mind. My apologies if that’s not a very helpful answer.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It's very common for people to start thinking about these things as they get older, or after a friend or family member has a health scare. It is responsible, and it’s good you’re addressing it now. “Hazy” is a useful word. To help me understand your wishes, let's start with a general overview of your health. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Conditions… that's a good question. I… I see a specialist for my joints, I believe. Something about inflammation. It comes and goes. And… I had a rather unpleasant bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I seem to have recovered fully. I'm afraid I don’t recall the specifics of either diagnosis. I have all my records with my… ex-husband’s office, if that’s helpful? He handles those things. I’m terribly sorry for my lack of precision. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It's more important to get the information as we go, and it sounds like we have a good starting point. We can certainly access records from your ex-husband’s office – we’ll need a release form for that, which we can handle shortly. For now, let’s focus on the specialist you see for your joints. Do you recall the name of the specialist or the clinic where you receive care?
PATIENT: The name… it's on the tip of my tongue. Dr… something Petrov… or perhaps Petrenko? It’s a clinic downtown, I think, near the art museum. A smaller practice, very… efficient. They send reminders via text message, which is helpful. I’m so sorry. It feels ridiculous to be so vague about something so simple. I’ve been going there for… several years, at least. Perhaps if I thought about the art museum… no, that doesn't help. I truly apologize. Is it alright if we move on to something else for now? I worry I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Ms. Buoniconi. It's perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling details, especially when it comes to medical history. We'll get there. Let’s try a different approach. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: I do, yes. Just… this one, mostly. For the joints. It's… a small, white pill. I believe it's an anti-inflammatory. And sometimes, when it's particularly bad, I take something for the pain. Just ibuprofen, usually. Nothing regular. Do you… need to know the dosage? I’m afraid I haven’t memorized it.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, 500mg, and ibuprofen as needed. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I used to keep a cat, when I was married, and I wasn’t allergic to it. Though, sometimes I get a slight rash if I use certain cleaning products. Nothing severe. Just… a little irritation. It’s been a while since I’ve had that happen. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? It feels rather insignificant.
DOCTOR: It's good to know about both, Ms. Buoniconi. Even seemingly insignificant things can be important. A slight rash with certain cleaning products is worth noting. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s another difficult one. My… my mother had heart problems, I believe. And my father… he had some sort of respiratory illness. But I wasn’t very close to either of them, and I don’t recall the specifics. They both passed away a long time ago. I’m afraid I don’t have much information to offer. It’s rather… hazy, as you can see. Perhaps it’s best if we focus on my wishes for the future, rather than delve further into the past? If that’s alright with you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconi. It's understandable that you don’t have much information given the circumstances. We can certainly focus on your wishes for the future. Before we proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It’s a routine exam, nothing to worry about. Your heart rate is regular, 78 beats per minute. I do hear a very faint murmur, which is not uncommon. We’ll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 130/80. Slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Ears are clear. Throat appears normal. No signs of infection. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, with a slight murmur and slightly elevated blood pressure. We can discuss lifestyle modifications to help manage your blood pressure later. Now, let’s talk about your advance care planning. Do you have any thoughts on what kind of medical care you’d want if you were unable to make decisions for yourself?
PATIENT: That’s… a rather large question. I confess, I haven’t given it much consideration. I suppose… I would want everything possible done to preserve my life, if it were at all feasible. But… not at any cost. I wouldn't want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. I’m not sure I’m being very clear. It’s difficult to think about. Perhaps… I would want my friend, Anya Volkov, to make those decisions for me, if that’s possible? She’s… very sensible, and she knows me well.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly clear, Ms. Buoniconi. You want aggressive treatment if there's a reasonable chance of recovery, but you don’t want to be kept alive artificially without hope. And you’d like Anya Volkov to be your healthcare proxy. That's an excellent starting point. To formalize this, we'll need to complete a Healthcare Proxy form. This document legally designates Anya as the person authorized to make medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so yourself. We'll also discuss a Living Will, which outlines your specific wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, like ventilation or feeding tubes. Would you like to start with the Healthcare Proxy form now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds… sensible. The Healthcare Proxy form, then. Perhaps you could explain it to me as we go, just to be certain I understand everything? I apologize for my… slowness. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Buoniconi. It is a lot to take in, and I'm happy to explain everything as we go. That's what I'm here for. This form has several sections. The first section is to designate your healthcare proxy – that’s Anya Volkov, as we discussed. We'll need her full name, address, and contact information. Then, we have a section outlining the powers granted to your proxy – essentially, giving her the authority to make medical decisions on your behalf. And finally, there's a section for your signature and a witness signature. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: A witness signature… does that mean someone needs to be present while I sign it? And… what kind of medical decisions would Anya be authorized to make? Everything? Or just… certain things? I confess, I’m a little unsure about the scope of it all. It feels… a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Buoniconi. Yes, you do need a witness signature. It must be someone who is not your healthcare proxy, not a family member, and not someone who would directly benefit from your estate. It’s to ensure the form is properly executed. As for the scope of Anya’s authority, it’s quite broad. She would be authorized to make decisions regarding any medical treatment you’re unable to make yourself, including life-sustaining treatments, surgery, medications, and even end-of-life care. However, she’s legally obligated to make decisions in accordance with your wishes, as best as she knows them. That's why we're having this conversation. She would also need to follow any instructions you’ve provided in a Living Will, if you choose to create one. Do you have any concerns about granting Anya that level of authority?
PATIENT: No, not concerns exactly. Anya is… very reliable. It's just… the thought of someone else making those decisions for me… it’s a little unsettling. But I suppose it's necessary. If I'm unable to make the decisions myself, I need someone I trust to do it. So, I just need to fill in her information, then sign and date it? And we’ll need a suitable witness. Do you… perhaps have someone who could serve as a witness, or should I arrange for one myself?
DOCTOR: That’s right, Ms. Buoniconi. You just need to fill in Anya's information, then sign and date the form. I can serve as a witness if you’d like. I’m not a family member, and I'm not involved in your care in a way that would create a conflict of interest. As long as I’m present while you sign, and I also sign as a witness, it’s perfectly valid. Would you like me to serve as your witness?
PATIENT: That would be… most convenient, yes. If you wouldn't mind, Doctor. I believe this is her full name… and her address is… yes, this should be correct. Do I need to provide my date of birth as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Your date of birth is needed for identification purposes. It’s a standard requirement for legal documents like this. And just to confirm, are you comfortable with Anya Volkov as your healthcare proxy, with the understanding that she will make decisions in accordance with your wishes, as best as she knows them?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I am completely comfortable with Anya Volkov as my healthcare proxy. She understands my wishes, and I trust her implicitly to make the right decisions for me, should I be unable to do so myself. I believe I’m ready to sign the form now.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go. This is the completed Healthcare Proxy form. Please keep this in a safe place, and make sure Anya knows where it is. Now, would you like to discuss creating a Living Will?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A Living Will, you said? I confess, I know very little about it. Perhaps you could explain what it entails, and whether it would be beneficial in my case? I'm willing to listen, if you think it's advisable. I suppose… if it helps to clarify my wishes, it's worth considering.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Buoniconi. A Living Will, also known as an advance directive, is a legal document that outlines your specific wishes regarding medical treatment, particularly end-of-life care. It allows you to specify what types of treatment you want or don’t want if you’re unable to communicate your wishes yourself. For example, you can specify whether you want life-sustaining treatments like ventilation, feeding tubes, or CPR if you’re in a terminal condition or a permanent vegetative state. You can also specify your wishes regarding pain management and comfort care. It’s a good idea to create a Living Will because it ensures that your wishes are respected, even if you’re unable to communicate them. It also relieves the burden on your family members, who won’t have to make difficult decisions without knowing your preferences. Would you like me to go over some of the specific options with you, or would you prefer a form to review on your own?
PATIENT: Perhaps… go over some of the options with me, please. A form on my own… I fear I might misinterpret something. If you wouldn’t mind explaining it, step by step, that would be most helpful. I appreciate your patience. It’s… a lot to take in, as you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Buoniconi. It is a lot to take in, and I’m happy to go over it with you step by step. The first thing to consider is whether you want life-sustaining treatments in certain situations. Life-sustaining treatments can include things like mechanical ventilation , artificial nutrition and hydration , CPR, and dialysis. You can choose to accept or refuse any or all of these treatments. For example, some people want life-sustaining treatments at all costs, while others prefer to refuse them if there’s no reasonable chance of recovery. There are also different levels of treatment. For example, you might want CPR but refuse ventilation, or vice versa. Do you have any initial thoughts on whether you would want life-sustaining treatments in a terminal condition or a permanent vegetative state?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. I believe… if there was absolutely no hope of recovery, no chance of regaining any quality of life… I would prefer not to be kept alive artificially. I don’t want to be a burden, and I wouldn’t want to prolong suffering unnecessarily. But… I would want to be comfortable. Pain management is important. Does that make sense? I’m trying to articulate my wishes, but it’s difficult to think about. It feels… morbid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconi. You want comfort care and pain management, but you don't want life-sustaining treatments if there's no reasonable chance of recovery. That’s a very reasonable and thoughtful position to take. Now, let's talk about CPR. CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is a procedure used to revive someone whose heart has stopped beating. It involves chest compressions and rescue breathing. Some people want CPR at all costs, even if their chances of survival are low. Others prefer to refuse CPR, especially if they have a terminal condition or a serious illness. What are your thoughts on CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… I believe… if my heart were to stop suddenly, and there was no hope of regaining any meaningful life… I would prefer not to have it. It feels… aggressive. And if there's no chance of recovery, I wouldn't want to be subjected to that. It feels… undignified. Would that be… something you can document? A DNR, I think it’s called? Do Not Resuscitate? It sounds rather… final.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's a Do Not Resuscitate order, or DNR. It’s a legal order that instructs medical personnel not to perform CPR if your heart stops beating. That's perfectly acceptable, Ms. Buoniconi, and it's a very common request. It's important to remember that a DNR order doesn't mean you won't receive any medical care. You'll still receive treatment for other conditions, and you'll still receive comfort care and pain management. It simply means that you don't want CPR if your heart stops beating and there's no reasonable chance of survival. Now, let's talk about artificial nutrition and hydration. This involves providing you with fluids and nutrients through a feeding tube if you're unable to eat or drink on your own. Some people want artificial nutrition and hydration at all costs, while others prefer to refuse it if they're in a terminal condition or a permanent vegetative state. What are your thoughts on artificial nutrition and hydration?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… If I were unable to eat or drink on my own, and there was no hope of recovery… I think I would prefer to refuse it. It feels… unnatural. And if my body is shutting down, I wouldn’t want to prolong the inevitable. I’d want to be comfortable, and I’d trust my body to do what it needs to do. It feels… right, somehow.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Buoniconi. You'd prefer to refuse artificial nutrition and hydration if you're unable to eat or drink on your own and there's no reasonable chance of recovery. So, to summarize, you've expressed the following wishes: you want comfort care and pain management, you decline life-sustaining treatment in the absence of a reasonable chance of recovery, you request a DNR order, and you decline artificial nutrition and hydration in the absence of a reasonable chance of recovery. Are there any other specific wishes you'd like to document?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Those are my main wishes. I… I think I’m ready to finalize the document now, if that’s possible. I feel… a sense of relief, actually. It’s… comforting to have it all written down. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. I’m glad I could help. Okay, I’m just finalizing the document now. It will include all of your wishes, as we discussed. It will also require your signature and the signature of a witness. I can serve as the witness, as we discussed. Here you are. Please review it carefully to ensure everything is accurate. Once you've signed it, I'll also sign as a witness, and you'll have a legally binding document outlining your wishes. Do you have any questions before you sign?
PATIENT: No, everything looks correct. This accurately reflects my wishes. There. I believe that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes are documented.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you go. This is your legally binding Living Will. Please keep it in a safe place and let your loved ones know where it is. You’ve done a wonderful thing today, Ms. Buoniconi, taking the time to plan for the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s everything. You’ve been most helpful. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I believe I’ll be on my way now. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconi. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a wonderful day. .
