DOCTOR: Well, good afternoon, Zoie. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They’re not working so good anymore. It’s hard to… push it out, you know? Not like it used to be. It takes a long time.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. So, difficulty with urination… takes a long time to empty, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A long time. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn't all come out. Like there’s still some left in there. Does that make sense? I forget things easily, so I hope I’m explaining it okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Zoie. Retention, potentially. It's common as we get older, though doesn’t make it pleasant. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Oh, goodness, that's a good question. Not all at once, no. It’s been… slow. Maybe a few months now? Hard to say, really. Time… it goes by so fast, doesn’t it? My husband, he usually notices these things first. He’s good at that.
DOCTOR: Right. A few months. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… Not really pain, no. More… a little uncomfortable, sometimes. Like it’s straining. And a little bit of a weak stream, you know? Not strong like it used to be. But not painful. Does that make a difference? I don’t know what’s normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Weak stream and straining… okay. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I remember. I feel warm sometimes, but that's just from the sun, I think. We had a hot day yesterday. And my belly… no pain there. Just… feels normal. Old and a bit saggy, maybe! But no pain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your medical history. I see here you have a history of… hypertension, controlled with medication. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s right. The high blood pressure. I take a little pill every morning. Been doing that for years now. It helps, mostly. Sometimes my numbers are a bit high still, but the doctor keeps changing the dose. My husband makes sure I don't forget, he’s very good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Any allergies to medications, Zoie?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. I’ve taken so many pills in my life, it’s hard to remember. Never had a bad reaction, not that I recall. My husband might know better, he keeps track of all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it sounds like we're dealing with some urinary hesitancy and possibly some incomplete emptying. To get a better picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a quick neurological check, just to be sure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A check-up, alright. That sounds… sensible. I always trust what the doctor says. Yes, you can check me up. Just be gentle, my bones aren’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the table, and we'll start with listening to your abdomen. Sounds normal, no distention. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is common for your age. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to feel for any tenderness or masses. No significant tenderness. Bladder feels… full, but not acutely distended. Okay.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is everything okay, Doctor? You seem… very busy. Everything felt okay, a little poking and prodding. Like you said, old and a bit saggy! I hope I’m not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: It's all part of the exam, Zoie. We’re not finished yet. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a post-void residual volume test, to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, more tests, alright. Seems like there's always more tests. Post-… what now? The what volume test? You'll have to explain that one to me, dear. I don't understand all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: A post-void residual volume test is simply measuring how much urine is left in your bladder after you try to empty it. We’ll have you urinate, and then use a small scanner to see how much remains. It’s not painful, just a little… inconvenient. It will tell us if you’re completely emptying your bladder. We’ll get the results back within a few days. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Oh, after I go to the bathroom? So you'll see if there's any left in there? That makes a little more sense. A little inconvenient… alright. I can do that. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. My legs aren't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, let’s get that done then. The nurse will show you to the bathroom, and assist you with the test. Once that's done, we’ll discuss the results. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, but not too much right before bed. And… try not to strain when you urinate. I’ll put in the order for the urinalysis and post-void residual volume now. We’ll see what those show, and go from there.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Drink water, not too much before bed, and don't strain… I'll try my best. Thank you for looking after me. I appreciate it. Is that all for today?
DOCTOR: For today, yes. The nurse will be in shortly to take you to the bathroom for the test. We'll review the results when they come back. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain in your abdomen, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Fever, chills, pain… emergency room. Alright. I think… I think I understand. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a very busy woman.
