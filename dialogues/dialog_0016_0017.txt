DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok! Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, uh… something about a tryout. For… sports. They said I needed to get checked out first. My ex-wife made the appointment, probably. She always liked things done…properly. I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-participation physical for a sports tryout. That makes sense. And it sounds like your ex-wife was being thorough! No worries at all about the details, we can figure everything out together. To get started, can you tell me what sport you’re trying out for, if you remember?
PATIENT: Sports… hmm. Baseball, I think. Or softball? It’s with a team… some older fellas. I used to… play a lot. A long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, my memory ain't what it used to be. It was… a league. That's about all I recall. A summer league. Maybe.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. We'll take it slow. A summer league is a good start. And don’t worry about remembering specifics – we’re just trying to get a general idea of your health and fitness level. Now, have you been feeling any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… well, a little. In my shoulder. Old injury, I think. From… work. Construction. Years back. It flares up sometimes. Nothing… serious. Just aches. Gets worse when I… reach for things. Or if it's cold. I mostly just ignore it.
DOCTOR: Okay, shoulder pain with a history of construction work. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… sharp. More of a dull ache. Like someone’s tightening a screw, but not all the way. And sometimes it just feels… stiff. Hard to lift things. Like I said, mostly when it’s cold or if I overdo it. I haven’t really done much with it lately. It's been a while since I played any… baseball. Or softball. Whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and stiffness, worse with cold or activity. That gives us a good starting point. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just check your range of motion in your shoulder, and listen to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological check. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Exam? Well… I suppose. As long as you aren’t going to poke around too much. My shoulder… it doesn’t like being bothered. And please, no needles. I hate needles. Are you going to give me a shot? I really don’t want a shot.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise, Mr. Bartok. We’re just checking things out to make sure you’re safe to participate in the tryout. We'll be gentle with your shoulder, and I'll let you know what I'm doing every step of the way. First, let’s just have you stand up and I’ll take a look at your posture and how you move. Then we'll work on the shoulder. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just… easy with the shoulder, please. And don’t expect much. I’m not as young as I used to be. Used to be able to throw a mean fastball, though. Back in my day… but never mind. Go ahead. Do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let’s start with just standing normally. I’m just looking at how you stand and walk. I notice a slight rounding of your shoulders and a bit of a favoring to the left side when you walk. Is that something you've noticed yourself?
PATIENT: Rounding? Favoring? I don't know, Doctor. I just stand. And walk. Been doing it for a long time. I guess I haven’t paid much attention. Probably from… lifting things at work. All those heavy beams and… concrete. It does get a little stiff sometimes, like I said. But I always figured it was just… getting old. You know?
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Heavy lifting can certainly contribute to that. Now, let’s take a look at your shoulder directly. Can you slowly raise your right arm out to the side, like you're trying to reach for something on a high shelf?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… not so good. Feels tight. Can’t get it all the way up. It just… stops. And it kinda hurts here… Feels like something is pinching. Maybe I shouldn't…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good, Mr. Bartok, we'll stop there. No need to push through any pain. That gives me some information. I’m noticing limited range of motion and you’ve indicated pain on the outside of your shoulder. Now, let's feel for any tenderness. I’m going to gently press around your shoulder. Please tell me if anything feels particularly painful. I’m starting right here…
PATIENT: Ow! Yeah, that’s… tender. Right there. Feels… bruised, almost. But I don’t think I actually bruised it. Just… always feels a little sore. Like someone’s been poking at it for years. And a little bit here… That bone feels… sharp. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some tenderness over the deltoid muscle and along the bony part of your shoulder – that’s the acromion. The sharpness you’re feeling is the bone itself. It’s not uncommon to feel bony prominences, but the tenderness suggests some inflammation or irritation there. I'm also checking your rotator cuff muscles. Okay, and a bit of pain with that movement. Given your history and what I’m finding on the exam, it’s possible you have some rotator cuff tendinitis or a mild impingement. We'd need to confirm with some imaging, possibly an X-ray, to rule out any other issues.
PATIENT: Rotator cuff? Impingement? What does that even mean, Doctor? Is that bad? Am I gonna need surgery? I really don't want surgery. I just want to play some baseball… or softball. Whatever it is. Is it gonna stop me from playing? I haven’t even started yet! And X-rays… I hate those. All that radiation.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s take a deep breath. Rotator cuff tendinitis just means the tendons around your shoulder are irritated and inflamed. Impingement means those tendons are getting pinched. It’s fairly common, especially with activities like lifting and throwing. Most cases don't require surgery. Usually, we can manage it with physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and rest. We’ll start with an X-ray to make sure there aren't any other underlying issues like arthritis. It's a low dose of radiation, and it will help us get a clear picture of what's going on. As for stopping you from playing, we need to see what the X-ray shows. If it’s mild, we might be able to get you back on the field with some modifications and rehab. If it's more severe, we may need to postpone playing until it heals. We will work together to make the best decision for you.
PATIENT: Alright… physical therapy. I hate physical therapy. All those exercises… and it always hurts. But better than surgery, I guess. And X-rays… fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I just want to know… can I still play? Even if I have to take it easy? My team… they’re counting on me. I’m the only one who knows how to play second base. It’s important. Even though I’m… not as young as I used to be. So, what happens next, Doctor? Do I get the X-ray today?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you have a team counting on you! And yes, we'll get an X-ray today. I’ll write an order for it, and then the technician will take you to the imaging room. It should only take a few minutes. After that, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. That plan might include physical therapy, as you mentioned, and some exercises you can do at home. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that aggravate your shoulder pain. And if you do experience any significant pain, ice it for 15-20 minutes at a time. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay… no playing. Ice it. Physical therapy. X-rays. It’s a lot. But alright. I’ll do what I have to do. Just… get this over with. Where do I go for the X-ray? And how long will it take? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things. I guess I'll just go where you tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-ray room is just down the hall to your left. The technician, Maria, is expecting you. It should only take about 15-20 minutes, including the wait time and the actual imaging. After you’re done, you can come back, and we’ll schedule that follow-up appointment. I'll also send the X-ray results to my computer. In the meantime, try to relax and take it easy. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… don’t make me do too much physical therapy, Doctor. My old bones can’t handle it. And… thank you. For not yelling at me for not knowing what’s going on. My ex-wife always… well, never mind. I’ll go get the X-ray. Rotator cuff… impingement… physical therapy…
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. And I promise we'll take it slow. We’ll work together to get you back on the field, at your own pace. Consider gentle rehab protocol. Patient is motivated, despite pain and uncertainty.
