DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Schlatterer is fine, please. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why my…daughter-in-law scheduled this appointment. Something about…work. It's all rather bothersome, if you must know. I simply wish to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand you're not particularly keen on being here. Let's try to make this as efficient as possible then. Your daughter-in-law mentioned something about work concerns. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Really. Well, I teach. I have for…a very long time. At the university. It's library science. Though these days, the students… they simply don't appreciate proper cataloging. And they ask the most ridiculous questions. Honestly, it’s a decline in standards, a complete and utter decline. Is that what you need to know? I don’t understand why this requires a doctor.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re experiencing some frustration with your current work situation. While I appreciate your…passion for proper cataloging, Mr. Schlatterer, the concern brought to my attention wasn't necessarily about the students themselves. Is there anything else related to your work that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Besides the general incompetence of the youth? Honestly, Doctor, it's the volume of work. Endless grading, pointless meetings… the administration keeps changing the syllabus, and it's all rather… taxing. Though I suppose at my age one expects a certain level of…inconvenience. But it’s… exhausting. Is that what you’re fishing for? I haven’t the time for riddles, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased workload and changes at the administration. Have you noticed any specific physical effects from this exhaustion, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Physical effects? Goodness, Doctor, I'm eighty-seven years old. What physical effects wouldn't I have? My knees ache, my back protests, and I occasionally forget where I put my spectacles. That's simply aging. Are you suggesting my work is…causing my age? That’s preposterous. Though… I suppose I haven’t been sleeping as well lately. Not that I’d attribute that to anything other than general…discomfort.
DOCTOR: So, you've noticed some difficulty sleeping. Anything else?
PATIENT: Difficulty sleeping…yes. And… a certain lack of appetite, I suppose. My daughter-in-law makes me eat, thankfully. But I don't feel like eating. Everything tastes rather…bland these days. And I’ve been…irritated. More so than usual. Though, frankly, I find most people irritating, so it's difficult to say if that's new. Really, Doctor, is this necessary?
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite, increased irritability, difficulty sleeping…and a significant increase in workload and stress. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It will be relatively simple. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Honestly, Doctor, I doubt it will reveal anything I don’t already know. But… fine. Get it over with. Just… don’t expect miracles. And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are a bit irregular, which is common at your age, Mr. Schlatterer. Lungs are clear, though a little diminished. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, and pulse is a bit irregular as well. Finally, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears and throat look normal. Overall, your physical exam is within expected parameters for your age, but these findings do warrant some further investigation, given your recent changes in appetite, sleep and mood.
PATIENT: Investigation? Good heavens. What sort of investigation? Am I being accused of something? I assure you, Doctor, I lead a perfectly…ordered life. Aside from the students, of course. I simply want to know if I can continue teaching. Is that so much to ask? And please, no further poking and prodding. I’ve had enough of this… scrutiny. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I'm not accusing you of anything. It’s standard practice to run some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes for these changes. Things like thyroid function, vitamin deficiencies, and a complete blood count. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and ensure you're not dealing with something more serious. I'm also going to recommend a simple screening test for depression, just to assess your mood more objectively. Would you be willing to consider those tests?
