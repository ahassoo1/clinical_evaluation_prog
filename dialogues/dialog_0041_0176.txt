DOCTOR: Hi Ivette, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won’t stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s quite annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Annoying is an understatement, I'm sure! Hiccups that last over 48 hours… that’s definitely something we should look into. Can you tell me a bit more about them?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely. Well, they come and go, you know? Not a regular pattern. Sometimes just one, sometimes a few in a row. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. Eating, drinking, sitting, walking… doesn’t make a difference. I tried holding my breath, like everyone says, but that didn't help at all. I even drank water upside down! Nothing seems to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pretty constant, no real triggers you've noticed, and you’ve already tried some of the common remedies… Good to know. Are you having any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No pain anywhere, no heartburn, no trouble breathing. I’m a little tired, I guess, but that’s probably just from being… well, hiccupping for two days! I haven't noticed anything else unusual. I haven't been sick or anything like that. Oh, actually, now that you mention it, my stomach has been a little gassy, but I usually am. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Gas can sometimes be a factor, yes. And it's helpful to rule things out. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… I don't have any major illnesses, not that I know of. I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. No surgeries, no serious accidents. I had a divorce a few years back, but that didn't involve any medical procedures! I don’t take any regular medication, just over-the-counter pain relievers if I get a headache. And I don't have any allergies, that I'm aware of. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about fifteen years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful, thank you. Quitting smoking fifteen years ago is excellent. And knowing about the occasional pain reliever use is good. Now, just a few more questions. Family history – any significant medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but that was later in life. My sister is healthy as a horse, as far as I know. Oh, and my grandfather on my mother’s side, he had some sort of stomach trouble, I think. But I don’t know exactly what it was. He lived in Egypt, and things weren’t quite as… documented back then, you know? We just knew he often complained about his stomach. I don’t think it was anything serious, but I’m not sure. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That's all useful information, thank you. It can sometimes give us clues. And I understand about the documentation – we work with what we have. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy, never get drunk. I don't drink beer or spirits, just wine. And I don’t smoke anymore, as I mentioned before. I’m not much of a party person, to be honest. Mostly just quiet evenings at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Could you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. Let me know if anything feels… odd. It’s these hiccups, you know. Sometimes they make everything feel a bit strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ivette. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Then I'll just take a quick look at your abdomen. Deep breaths in and out, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing normally. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Not tender to palpation. No masses. Abdomen is soft. I'm noticing some mild distension, but nothing alarming. Do you frequently feel bloated or gassy?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, actually. As I said before, my stomach is often a bit gassy. It’s just something I’ve always had, really. Not usually painful, just… uncomfortable. It’s worse after I eat, sometimes. And if I eat too quickly. Ooh, that’s a little sensitive, right there. But it’s not painful, just… a bit tender. I think that’s where I usually feel the gas build up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. It sounds like you might have some mild bloating and increased gas production. Given the duration of your hiccups – over 48 hours – and the fact that they're not responding to home remedies, I’d like to order a few tests just to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. If it will help figure out what’s going on, absolutely. What sort of tests are we talking about? I don't mind, as long as they’re not too… invasive. It’s just… these hiccups are really getting to me. It's exhausting!
DOCTOR: I understand. Nothing too invasive, I promise. I’d like to start with a blood test – just a routine complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. And I think a basic metabolic panel would be useful, to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. That’s all for now. We can discuss further tests if needed, after we get these results. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood tests are fine. I don’t mind needles, honestly. And if you think it’s necessary after that, then we can do more. Just… I’d really like to get these hiccups sorted out, if possible. Do I need to fast before the blood tests? And where do I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Good. No, you don't need to fast for these tests. You can eat and drink as normal. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The phlebotomist – that's the person who draws the blood – is expecting you. They'll give you the necessary paperwork to fill out. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Usually takes about 24-48 hours. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid any foods that you know trigger your gas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Room 203, no fasting, stay hydrated. I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for not making me feel silly about these hiccups! It’s just… annoying, to say the least. I'll go down to the lab now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. And you're not silly at all. Prolonged hiccups can be a sign of something underlying, so it's good we're investigating. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Let’s get those tests ordered, and hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. You go ahead and head to the lab, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day.
