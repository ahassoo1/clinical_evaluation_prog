DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's…well, the paperwork said something about lab work. I get a lot of things sent to me, you know? Old age. I just need whatever it is done so I can get on with my day. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. Paperwork can be a bit much sometimes! Let’s see… yes, I see here you’re scheduled for some routine blood work today, as well as a general check-up. We haven’t seen you in a little while, so I’d like to get a good update on how you've been doing. Before we get to the blood work, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately? Hmm… Honestly, not much different than usual. I work, I…eat, I sleep. You know. The basics. I'm a bit of a solitary man, if that makes sense. I don’t really do much. Is this important? I just want the blood work done, if that’s okay. I don’t remember the last time I was at a doctor, to be honest. My mind isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It's good you came in. And yes, it is important to check in, even if things feel routine. It helps us catch anything that might be changing, even subtly. Since you mentioned things feeling routine, are you experiencing any new symptoms at all?
PATIENT: New symptoms…let me think. Everything feels a bit…tired, lately. More tired than usual, maybe. But I've always been a bit tired. Hard to explain. It’s probably just old age catching up. Is that something to worry about? I really don’t want a long list of tests if it's just…being old.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about unnecessary tests, Mr. Croonquist, and we'll definitely try to avoid those. Feeling tired is very common, and it can be just part of getting older. But it's also a symptom that can have other causes, so it’s good you mentioned it. When you say “more tired than usual,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Ugh, describing… It’s like…getting out of bed is harder. And I don’t have the energy to do…anything, really. Even watching TV feels like too much sometimes. I just…sit. A lot. And I sleep, but it doesn’t always help, you know? It's not like I’m sick, sick. Just…drained. I used to be able to…do things. Now…not so much. I'm probably just rambling. Is this useful?
DOCTOR: That is useful, Mr. Croonquist. It’s helpful to hear you describe it that way. It sounds like this fatigue is impacting your daily life, which is worth looking into. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, my appetite’s been a bit off. I don’t really feel hungry, most of the time. I eat something because I know I should, but…it doesn’t taste like much. And…sometimes I feel a bit…off balance. Just a little wobbly, when I stand up too quickly. But that doesn’t happen all the time. Is that important? I really hope this isn’t going to be a whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and occasional dizziness when standing. That gives us a bit more to work with. We'll certainly try to figure out what's going on. Before we proceed with the physical exam and blood work, let's quickly go over a few things. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. Never really had any problems with anything, to be honest. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just…nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, until…well, recently. I guess. Do you need to know what I had as a kid? Is that important? Because I honestly can't remember. My memory is terrible.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, no known allergies or current medications. And no worries at all about not remembering childhood illnesses—it's not essential. Now, have there been any significant illnesses or hospitalizations in your family?
PATIENT: Family illnesses… That's a tough one. I haven’t spoken to my family in… a very long time. Decades, probably. I don't really keep in touch. I’m not sure I would know if anything happened to them. I apologize, I’m not very helpful, am I? Honestly, I just want to get this over with so I can go home and rest. Is the blood work soon?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It’s not a problem at all. Family history isn’t always readily available. And I appreciate you being honest with me. Before we move on to the physical exam, let's quickly talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never have. Always thought it was a terrible habit. Can't stand the smell of it, either. And…I don't drink much. Maybe a glass of tea now and then. I mostly just…work. And sleep. As I said, a very solitary life. Is that what you needed to know? Because, honestly, I'm getting a bit tired just talking about it. Can we get to the blood work now? I just want to know if there’s something seriously wrong, or if it’s just…old age.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. And I completely understand wanting to get this sorted out. We will get to the blood work shortly. First, I'd like to do a quick physical exam—just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a brief neurological check. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: I suppose so. As long as it’s quick. I really don't have the energy for a long exam. Just…get it over with, please. I'll try to be cooperative, but I can't promise I'll be very helpful. My limbs don't always do what I tell them to anymore. Let’s just…get it done. Where do you want me to go?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. We'll keep it as quick and comfortable as possible. Please just have a seat on the examination table here. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a bit…distant. I’m also hearing some mild crackling in your lower lungs. Nothing to panic about immediately, but something we’ll want to investigate further. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little low, 108/65. And finally, I’d like to do a quick neurological exam - just follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head.
PATIENT: Okay, okay… It's a bit…fuzzy. My eyes aren't what they used to be. Everything is blurry. This is making me feel a bit dizzy, actually. Can we just…stop now? I really don't think I'm up for this. I just want to know if I'm dying or not, and go home. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. We’ll stop right away. I apologize if that made you feel worse. It sounds like you’re feeling quite unwell. Your low blood pressure and the crackling in your lungs, combined with your fatigue and dizziness, are concerning. I’m going to order some blood work right away, as planned. But given how you’re feeling, I also think we should get an EKG done to check your heart rhythm and a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs. Would you be able to manage that?
PATIENT: More tests…? I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I don't have much choice, do I? But please…can someone just tell me what's wrong? This waiting…it's awful. And can I lie down during these tests? I really don't think I can stand up much longer. I just want to rest. Is there a nurse who can help me? I'm getting very scared now.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, we need to find out what's going on, and those tests will help us do that. And yes, absolutely, you can lie down during the tests. I’m going to call a nurse right now to come and assist you, and they’ll get you comfortable. Nurse Patel, could you please come to examination room three?
PATIENT: .
