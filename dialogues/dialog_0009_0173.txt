DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Petrimoulx, nice to meet you too! Um, well, I've been getting chills. It’s been happening on and off for a few days now, and it’s starting to worry me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills, happening on and off for a few days. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about those chills?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like a fever chill, you know? Not with sweating or anything. Just...cold. Like when you step out of a warm room into a cold one. But it happens even when the room is warm. And it's not always all over. Sometimes it’s just my arms and legs. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, it’s a cold sensation, not necessarily accompanied by fever or sweating, and it seems to come and go, sometimes localized to your arms and legs. Is it constant when it happens, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It definitely fluctuates. It’s not like, constantly cold. It'll come on, I’ll feel it for maybe ten or twenty minutes, and then it goes away. Then it'll come back a few hours later. It’s been pretty random, honestly. I haven’t noticed a pattern yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, random episodes of chills lasting ten to twenty minutes, then resolving for a few hours. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. I haven't really noticed anything specific causing them, no. I’ve been trying to think about it, but it seems to happen whether I’m resting, moving around, inside, outside… I did have a long flight a few days ago, maybe that has something to do with it? I flew back from visiting family.
DOCTOR: A long flight a few days ago… that’s good information. Sometimes travel can be a factor. Let's talk a bit more broadly. Besides the chills, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Not really, thankfully. No cough, no sore throat, no headache, no body aches… I feel perfectly normal except for these chills. I’ve been a little tired, but honestly, who isn’t these days? I just wanted to get it checked out because it’s just… unusual for me. It’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern; it's good you came in to get it checked out. Unusual symptoms always warrant a look. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, like everyone else. And I broke my arm once when I was little, but that’s about it. No allergies that I know of, and I’m not on any medications regularly. I had a divorce a couple of years ago, which was stressful, but I don’t think that’s causing the chills, is it?
DOCTOR: While significant stress can sometimes manifest physically, I don’t think that’s the primary cause here. It's good to rule things out, though. No allergies, no regular medications, and a past history of chickenpox and a broken arm – that's helpful. Do you have any family history of medical conditions—anything that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom has high blood pressure, and my grandfather had diabetes. Nothing else major that I can think of. My family's pretty healthy, actually. No one’s got anything weird going on, as far as I know. They’re all Moroccan, and generally pretty robust people!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No significant family history. And you mentioned you’re Moroccan—do you have any recent travel history besides the flight you mentioned, or any close contact with anyone who's been ill recently?
PATIENT: No, just that flight back from visiting family in Morocco. I haven't been anywhere else recently. And no, no one I’ve been in close contact with is sick, not that I know of. Everyone seemed healthy when I saw them. I was a bit worried about bringing something back from Morocco, but everyone’s fine so far.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No recent travel besides the flight, no known contact with anyone ill. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a general look. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let’s take your temperature. Normal temperature. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Lymph nodes are not swollen. I'm going to check your reflexes now. Reflexes are normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal at this point.
PATIENT: Okay, that's good to hear. So, what do you think it could be? Is it something serious? I’m probably just being paranoid, but it's better to be safe, right?
DOCTOR: You're not being paranoid at all; it's responsible to get things checked out. Given your symptoms and the unremarkable physical exam, several things could be going on. It could be a mild viral infection that's not fully manifesting, or even a reaction to the stress of travel. Occasionally, chills can be caused by something as simple as dehydration or a slight vitamin deficiency. However, because the chills are persistent, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order some basic blood work. We'll check your complete blood count to look for any signs of infection, your electrolytes to rule out dehydration, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to check your thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. I'd rather be sure, you know? Just tell me what I need to do. And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll write you a lab order. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. It's a standard blood draw, so it shouldn't take long. Typically, the results come back within 24-48 hours. Our office will contact you as soon as they’re available. We can either call you with the results, or you can access them online through our patient portal—do you have an account set up for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I set up an account when I made the appointment. I think my username is Jailenne.A… I’ll have to double-check the email, though. Okay, so I just go down the hall and they’ll do the blood work? And then I’ll just wait for a call or check the portal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's correct. Just go down the hall to the lab, let them know you're here for Dr. Petrimoulx's order, and they’ll take care of everything. And yes, you can check the portal or we’ll call you with the results. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated, getting plenty of rest, and avoiding any unnecessary stress. If your symptoms worsen significantly—especially if you develop a fever, severe headache, or body aches—please don’t hesitate to contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much, Dr. Petrimoulx. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. I feel much better now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. We'll be in touch soon with the results. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day.
