DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s... well, it’s about a letter. For a pet, you see. Some people are being funny about it, needing proof and all. Honestly, the fuss some folks make. It’s just a little dog. A perfectly lovely little thing, really. Though I can’t recall exactly what breed… something fluffy.
DOCTOR: A letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter. Saying I… own him. Or her. One of the two, anyway. It's for… well, it’s to do with where I live. They’re being difficult about pets, can you believe it? It’s not like it's a lion, honestly. Just a small, quiet… companion. I think they want to know if I can properly care for it. As if! I've had pets before. Many times. Though the details… they're a bit hazy now.
DOCTOR: So, to clarify, you're requesting a medical statement confirming pet ownership, as part of a housing application?
PATIENT: Housing... yes, that’s it! A statement. Confirming… ownership. Though ‘ownership’ feels a bit strong, doesn't it? He – or she – is more of a friend. And yes, it's for the new place. Honestly, the paperwork! It's ridiculous, expecting me to fill out all these forms. Just let people have their little dogs, that’s what I say. It’s good for the soul, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand you find the request burdensome. However, a medical professional’s role isn’t necessarily to validate companionship, Ms. Wrye, but to assess health and wellbeing. Are you seeking confirmation of your health status being compatible with pet ownership?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, when you put it that way… No, I hadn’t thought about it like that. I just thought you wrote letters sometimes. For people needing proof. I suppose my health… is fine. Mostly. I get a little tired, you know? And my knees aren't what they used to be. But that’s just age, isn’t it? I certainly don’t think that affects my ability to, um, walk a small dog. Or throw a ball. Sometimes.
DOCTOR: “A little tired” and “knees aren't what they used to be” are rather vague, Ms. Wrye. To properly address your concern and fulfill any potential documentation needs, I'll need a more detailed medical history. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let’s see… The doctor back home – it was a lovely man, Doctor Adebayo – he always said I was a bit… everything. A little bit of this, a little bit of that. I think I had something with my blood pressure, once. Or maybe it was my sister? She always worried about her blood pressure. And my knees, as I said. They ache. Especially in the cold. Arthritis… maybe? It runs in the family, you know. Honestly, it's all a bit of a blur now. I’m not very good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, "a little bit of this and a little bit of that" isn't helpful for medical documentation. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – for anything?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think. I do take something for my sleep. A small one, just before bed. Helps me drift off. The doctor gave it to me, years ago. I think it’s blue? Or maybe white. And I take a vitamin, yes. A multi-vitamin. For energy. Though I don’t remember the brand. It comes in a bottle. A plastic bottle. Everything comes in a plastic bottle these days, doesn’t it? Honestly, I’m not very organized. It’s all a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Alright. To proceed, Ms. Wrye, I will need to conduct a brief physical examination. Specifically, I’d like to assess your blood pressure, heart rate, and range of motion in your knees. And perhaps a quick listen to your lungs. This is to ensure you are physically capable of providing adequate care for a pet, and to accurately document your overall health status. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical examination? Well, I suppose. Though I'm not very good with doctors poking and prodding. It makes me feel a bit… vulnerable, you know? But if it's necessary for the letter... yes, alright. Just be gentle, please? My knees are particularly sensitive. And try not to take too long. I have things to do, you see. Important things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. We'll start with your blood pressure. Breathe normally, please. 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but a mild murmur is present. Not currently concerning, but warrants noting. Now, regarding your knees… Could you please bend them, one at a time, as far as comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A murmur? Is that bad? My mother always had a murmur, I think. Though she lived to a good age, so perhaps it wasn't too bad. My knees… Oh, that’s not very comfortable. They creak something awful, don’t they? Like an old door. I can bend them… a little. Not very far. It’s the cold, you know. Makes them stiff. See? Not much range of motion. I can walk, though. Perfectly well. Most days.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion with crepitus present in both knees. Gait appears stable, but further assessment may be warranted. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fainting spells recently?
PATIENT: Oh my. All those big words! Shortness of breath… well, sometimes. When I climb the stairs, perhaps. But that's just getting older, isn’t it? And dizziness… I get a little lightheaded sometimes, if I stand up too quickly. It happens. Nothing to worry about, I’m sure. I haven’t fainted, though. Not that I recall. It’s been a long time since I fainted. Though I did once have a dizzy spell at a party… years ago. But that was the punch, I think. A bit too strong.
DOCTOR: Intermittent dyspnea on exertion and occasional orthostatic lightheadedness. History of potential episode related to… “punch”. Ms. Wrye, based on this preliminary assessment, and given the limited information regarding your past medical history, I am hesitant to provide a statement confirming your suitability for pet ownership without further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive cardiac evaluation and a consultation with a rheumatologist to assess your knee condition. Additionally, a full blood workup is advised. I can provide you with referrals to specialists in the area.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That sounds… complicated. Specialists? Blood workups? I just wanted a letter for a little dog! Honestly, all this fuss. It's a perfectly healthy little thing, and I'm perfectly capable. I’ve had pets before, you know. I suppose I could get the referrals. But it will take time, won't it? And I need this letter… rather urgently. Is there anything you can write now? Just a basic statement that I’m generally… okay? Perhaps something about my spirit being young?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while I understand your frustration, providing a medical statement without a thorough assessment would be ethically irresponsible. It would not be in your best interest, nor would it be defensible medical practice. However, I can provide a brief note stating that you were evaluated on August 2nd, 2025, and are currently undergoing assessment for potential cardiac and musculoskeletal concerns. I will also document that you report being generally functional and capable. But I must reiterate: this is not a confirmation of your suitability for pet ownership, nor is it a guarantee of your long-term health. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A note, then. Saying I'm “undergoing assessment”. It sounds terribly ominous, doesn’t it? But I suppose it's better than nothing. And you'll write that I'm “generally functional”? That sounds… reasonably polite. Yes, alright. Do that. Just… please hurry, Doctor. I really do need this letter.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will prepare the note. Here you are, Ms. Wrye. It also includes the referrals I mentioned. Please schedule appointments as soon as possible. I will also send a copy of this note to your primary care physician for continuity of care. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. "Potential concerns"… it does sound rather alarming, doesn't it? But I suppose that’s better than nothing. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you. I’ll schedule those appointments. Eventually. Yes. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Wrye. Have a pleasant day. .
