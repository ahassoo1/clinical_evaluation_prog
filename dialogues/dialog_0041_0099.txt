DOCTOR: Hi Denis, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Polczynski. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe they called it, and the doctor who ordered it suggested I come speak with you about them. It was an… abnormal result, they said. I must confess, I am not entirely certain what that means.
DOCTOR: Okay, an abnormal result… that can definitely be unsettling. Don't worry, we'll figure it out together. Let me pull up those results… just a moment. Okay, I see here a CT scan was performed… and the report does indicate some findings. Before we dive into those findings, could you tell me a little bit about why the scan was ordered in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It began a few months ago, perhaps… April, I believe? I started experiencing some discomfort in my stomach. Not a sharp pain, precisely… more of a… persistent ache, and bloating. It came and went, so I initially dismissed it as something I ate. However, it grew more frequent, and… less pleasant. My primary care physician, Doctor Ramirez, ordered some blood work, which came back normal. Then, she suggested this scan to get a clearer picture. She was quite concerned about… well, she didn’t say specifically what, only that it was important to investigate further. It is all rather… unsettling, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always worrying when things are unclear, and a scan adds another layer of anxiety. Persistent abdominal discomfort and bloating… alright. And you said it started around April?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately April. It wasn’t constant, at first. Just after meals sometimes, or in the evenings. I tried adjusting my diet, avoiding things I thought might be causing it – spicy foods, rich foods… but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. It has been… gradually worsening, I suppose is the best way to describe it. Now, it’s almost daily, and it interferes with my sleep some nights. It’s not debilitating, Doctor, but it’s… wearing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual progression over several months, despite dietary changes. And it’s impacting your sleep now. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the discomfort and bloating?
PATIENT: Yes, now that you mention it… I have noticed a change in my bowel habits. Not… dramatic, but more frequent trips to the restroom. And sometimes… a feeling of not being completely empty, even after going. Also, I’ve been… less hungry than usual. I haven’t lost any weight, not noticeably, but I simply don’t have the same appetite I once did. It’s difficult to enjoy a meal when I know it will likely be followed by discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, so more frequent bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation, and decreased appetite… that gives us a bit more to work with. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No blood in my stool, and no nausea or vomiting. I have experienced some… fatigue, perhaps. A general feeling of being… run down, but I attributed that to my age, frankly. I am 67 years old, after all. But no, no blood, and no sickness.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. No blood, no vomiting, just fatigue. And you're right to mention your age – that's important context. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had my gallbladder removed approximately twenty years ago. Aside from that, I have been… remarkably healthy, all things considered. I have managed my blood pressure for many years, with medication, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but recovered fully. I do not have any allergies, and I am not currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure medication. My late husband, God rest his soul, had diabetes, but I do not have that condition myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, managed hypertension, and a history of pneumonia. No allergies, and just the blood pressure medication currently. Thank you. Now, just briefly, is there any family history of colon cancer, or any other digestive issues, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: That is a… difficult question, Doctor. My family… we are not ones for readily sharing medical information. It was not considered polite, in my youth, to discuss such things. However, thinking carefully… my aunt, my mother’s sister, passed away several years ago from what I believe was… stomach cancer. It was a very long illness, and she suffered greatly. I do not know the specifics, as I was quite young at the time, and the details were not widely shared. My father’s side of the family… I know very little about their medical history, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of stomach cancer in your aunt… that's certainly relevant. Thank you for sharing that, even though it's difficult to recall. Alright, Denis, let's move on to a physical exam. I'd like to gently examine your abdomen, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand it is necessary. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. I must admit, I am a little… apprehensive, but I understand it is all part of the process.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Denis. I'll be as gentle as possible. I’m going to start by having you lie back on the exam table. Okay, just relax your stomach muscles for me. I'm just feeling for any tenderness or masses. I’m noting some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, but no obvious masses. Your abdomen is slightly distended, and I can hear active bowel sounds, but they’re a little… sluggish. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Based on what you've told me and this initial exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The history of stomach cancer in your aunt, combined with your symptoms and the tenderness I’m feeling, is concerning enough that we need to investigate further. I’m thinking a colonoscopy is the next step.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… I have heard of those. It involves… a camera, does it not? And some… preparation, I believe? I confess, Doctor, the thought of it is… unsettling. But I understand you believe it is necessary. If you feel it is the best course of action, then I trust your judgment. What precisely does it involve, and what are we hoping to find? And… what if we do find something?
DOCTOR: Yes, a colonoscopy involves a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached that's inserted into the rectum to visualize the entire colon. You're right, there is preparation involved – it requires a thorough bowel cleanse to ensure a clear view. It’s not the most pleasant process, I won’t lie, but it’s crucial for accurate results. We're hoping to identify the cause of your abdominal discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. It allows us to look for polyps, inflammation, or any other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. If we do find something, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s cancer. Polyps are common, and often benign. However, we would need to take a biopsy – a small tissue sample – to determine if further treatment is necessary. This could range from removing the polyp during the procedure to recommending further imaging or a referral to a gastroenterologist. It's important to be proactive, and the earlier we identify any potential issues, the better. I can provide you with detailed information about the preparation process, risks, and benefits of a colonoscopy, and answer any questions you have. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. I believe it is best to be proactive, as you say. I would like to schedule the colonoscopy. And yes, please provide me with detailed information about the preparation. I would also appreciate it if you could explain the risks involved, as clearly as possible. I am… not a young woman anymore, and I wish to be fully informed before proceeding. Perhaps a pamphlet, or some written materials I can review at my own pace? And… what about the cost? I am not insured, and I would need to know what to expect financially.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Denis. Absolutely. I understand your concerns, especially regarding cost and potential risks. We’ll get you all the information you need. I'll have my assistant, Maria, prepare a packet for you that includes detailed instructions for the bowel preparation, a comprehensive list of the risks and benefits of the colonoscopy, and an estimate of the costs involved. Because you are uninsured, we can discuss payment options and potential financial assistance programs. I’ll also have her schedule the procedure for a date that works best for you. I think we can aim for sometime next week, giving you enough time to prepare. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, fever – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. We’ll get you scheduled with Maria before you leave today, and she will go over everything with you in detail. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly good. Thank you for being so thorough, and for addressing my concerns. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. A next week appointment would be fine. I am grateful for your assistance in this matter. I will speak with Maria, and I am sure she will provide me with all the necessary information. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Denis. It's my pleasure. I understand it can be a stressful process, but we'll be with you every step of the way. I’ll have Maria come in to speak with you now and schedule the appointment. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most helpful and informative. I will await Maria, and proceed as advised. Thank you once more for your time and attention.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Well, please don’t hesitate to reach out if any questions arise before you see Maria. I’ll let her know you're ready for her. Have a good day, Denis. We'll take good care of you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You as well.
