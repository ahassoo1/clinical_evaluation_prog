DOCTOR: Hello Mackenzi, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Kamahele. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, I’m here for a… a clearance, I believe? For a surgery I’m hoping to have. It’s… quite a bit on my mind, truthfully, and I want to be sure everything is alright before I proceed. I apologize, my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly alright. Many things can affect memory. A pre-operative clearance, yes. Okay. And what type of surgery are you planning, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh… it’s… cosmetic. A… a facial reconstruction, I suppose you could say. It’s… personal, but I understand you need to know for the clearance. It’s been… a long time coming, and I’m just wanting to make sure I’m a good candidate, and that there won't be any complications. I don’t recall the specifics of why I need a clearance, to be honest. My… husband, before he passed, handled all of that.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like a significant step for you, and it's very responsible of you to get cleared beforehand. Losing a partner is… difficult, and it's understandable that details might be hazy. Let's try to get a good picture of your overall health, then. Do you have any current medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. I… I think not? I believe I’m generally healthy. I try to eat well, and I do quite a bit of walking with my work, landscaping, you see. But… I haven’t been to a doctor regularly in… quite some time. Honestly, I don’t recall ever being diagnosed with anything major. Though, I do get winded easily sometimes… and my hands ache after a long day. Is that… relevant? I'm truly sorry if I'm being difficult.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi, you're not being difficult at all. It's much better to be honest, and it's very common for people to not have regular check-ups. Getting winded and hand aches… those could be a number of things, and it's good you mentioned them. Let's make a note of those. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. And occasionally, ibuprofen for the aches, when they’re really bad. But… that’s it, I believe. Nothing prescribed. I’ve always tried to avoid medication if possible. I think my husband had a small bottle of something for his blood pressure, but I wouldn’t know the name of it. It’s all rather… blurry, truthfully. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mackenzi. It sounds like you’re generally quite careful about what you put into your body, which is good. Let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, like pollen or pets?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s another tricky one. I don’t think so, not anything severe. I sometimes get a bit of a sniffle during pollen season, but I just assumed it was the pollen. And… I’ve never had a reaction to any food that I’m aware of. I’ve handled all sorts of plants with my work, and never had a rash or anything. But again… my memory isn't the best. It’s possible I’ve forgotten something. Could it be helpful to check my records somewhere? Perhaps with my insurance?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good idea, Mackenzi. Let me see if we can access your records through your insurance. It often has a more complete history. One moment… Ah, yes. Here we are. It appears you had a tetanus shot about five years ago, and… a bout of seasonal allergies documented a few years back, as you mentioned. Nothing major, thankfully. Okay, now, briefly, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I believe. And… oh, yes! After my husband… passed, I was briefly hospitalized for a few days. Just… exhaustion, the doctors said. Grief… it takes a toll. Aside from that… no, I don't believe so. No other surgeries or hospital stays that I can recall. It was quite some time ago, as you can imagine. Everything feels a bit… distant. I do hope I'm not making this too difficult for you.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi. You’re doing just fine. It’s perfectly alright that things are a little hazy. It sounds like you had a tonsillectomy as a child and a brief hospitalization after your loss – that’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there any history of significant medical conditions in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a tough one. My mother… she had some issues with her heart, I think. She passed away when I was quite young. And my father… he worked very hard, and I believe he had some breathing problems later in life, but I don’t recall the specifics. They both lived in Colombia, and medical records weren’t as readily available then, I suppose. And my husband's family… I wasn’t very close to them, so I don't know much about their medical history at all. I truly wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… so long ago, and so many details have faded. Is there a specific condition you’re particularly concerned about? Perhaps you could ask me more pointed questions?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mackenzi. It’s not always easy to recall family history, especially if you weren't close or records are limited. Knowing about your mother’s heart issues is helpful, and we can keep that in mind. Given your history of windedness, it's good to be aware of that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. I occasionally have a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once a month, but very rarely. And… definitely no recreational drugs. I’ve always believed in living a healthy lifestyle, and avoiding those sorts of things. My husband felt the same. I’ve always found peace in nature, and hard work, and that’s always been enough for me. I do hope that’s… reassuring.
DOCTOR: That is very reassuring, Mackenzi. It sounds like you take very good care of yourself. Okay, one last general question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Are there any other concerns you have, anything at all, that we haven't discussed?
PATIENT: Hmm… well… I suppose my biggest concern is just… whether I’m strong enough for this surgery. It’s been a long time coming, and I really want it to go well. I just worry about complications, and recovery, and… being alone through it all. It's a little silly, perhaps, but… my husband always took care of those sorts of things. He always made me feel safe. I just want to be sure I'm doing the right thing, and that I'm not putting myself at risk. Is that… a valid concern? I'm not sure if that's something a doctor can even help with, but… it's on my mind.
DOCTOR: That is absolutely a valid concern, Mackenzi. It’s not silly at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a surgery, especially after a loss. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s brave of you to consider this now. We’ll do everything we can to minimize risk and ensure a smooth recovery. And we can discuss resources for support if you’d like. Now, if you’re comfortable, let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. I appreciate you being so understanding. And… yes, resources for support would be wonderful, if you have any suggestions. I… I'm not sure where to even begin. But yes, let’s do the exam. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. It could be due to anxiety, or just the normal stress of the visit, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur – it’s very faint, and not necessarily concerning, but we should note it. Your lungs sound clear, but you do have a slightly reduced breath sound on the lower lobes. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or abnormalities felt. Okay, and I’ll just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Overall, you seem in relatively good health, but there are a few things we’ll want to investigate further, given your history of windedness and the slight murmur and reduced breath sounds. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Oh… the murmur and reduced breath sounds… that doesn’t sound very good. Is that… serious? Could that be why I get winded so easily? And what does investigating further… entail? Will I need more tests? I… I’m starting to feel a little anxious again. I apologize. This is all a bit overwhelming. Perhaps if you could explain things slowly… that would be very helpful. I truly don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You are not a bother at all, Mackenzi. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious when hearing new information. Let’s take it one step at a time. The murmur is very faint, and many people have innocent murmurs that don’t cause any problems. However, given your family history and the reduced breath sounds, I’d like to order a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of your lungs. It’s a simple, non-invasive test. And I’d also like to order a basic blood work panel to check your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions. As for the windedness, it could be related to the reduced breath sounds, but it could also be due to a number of other factors, such as your activity level or even anxiety. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray and blood work… yes, that makes sense. That doesn’t sound too bad. I… I’m relieved it’s not something more immediate. And… so, the surgery… is that still a possibility? Or do I need to address these issues first? I’m just trying to… understand the timeline, and what I need to do next. I want to be prepared. Perhaps a written list of what I need to do would be helpful? I apologize again for being so… scattered. My mind is racing.
DOCTOR: You’re not scattered at all, Mackenzi. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed in this situation. We'll take things one step at a time, and I'm happy to provide a written list. Okay, here's what we’re going to do: 1. Chest X-ray: I’ll give you a referral for a local imaging center. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience. 2. Blood Work: I’ll give you a lab requisition form. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours before the test. 3. Follow-up Appointment: We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week, once we have the results of the tests. Regarding the surgery, I would recommend postponing it until we have a clearer understanding of your overall health. It's best to address these issues first, to minimize any potential risks during and after the procedure. We need to make sure you're in the best possible condition before moving forward. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Postponing the surgery… yes, that sounds very reasonable. I… I wouldn’t want to risk anything. It’s just… I’ve waited so long, and I was hoping to finally get it over with. But… your safety is more important, of course. And… about the support resources you mentioned? Perhaps a list of local therapists or support groups? I… I don’t really know where to start. It would be wonderful to have someone to talk to, someone who understands. I apologize again for all the questions. I truly don't want to be a bother. But I feel so lost, and alone.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not a bother, Mackenzi. I understand how overwhelming this must feel, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. Here, this brochure has a list of local therapists and support groups. It also has information on grief counseling, which might be helpful given your loss. And I’m going to write down a few websites on here as well, for online support groups. There are also a lot of resources available through your insurance provider. We can have the receptionist give you a call with that information before you leave. And please, remember that you're not alone in this. It's okay to ask for help, and it takes courage to do so. If you're feeling overwhelmed or anxious, please don't hesitate to reach out to a friend, family member, or mental health professional. Do you have any questions about these resources, or anything else before we finish up?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Kamahele. You’ve been so kind and understanding. This is… a tremendous help. I… I feel a little bit better, knowing I have somewhere to start. And yes, if you could have the receptionist call me with the insurance information, that would be wonderful. I think… I think that’s all for now. I truly appreciate your patience, and your kindness. It means more than you know. I’ll schedule the tests, and the follow-up appointment. And… I’ll look into these resources. Thank you again, Dr. Kamahele.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. It was my pleasure to meet you. Remember to take things one step at a time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get through this together. And please, take care of yourself.
