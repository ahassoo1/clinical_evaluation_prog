DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, welcome. I’m Dr. Rosanova. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my… well, my business. Down there. I noticed some red in the… you know. Not a lot, but enough to bother a man my age. It’s not right, is it? A man shouldn’t be seeing that at my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You've noticed some redness in the genital area, and it's concerning you. That’s perfectly reasonable to bring to my attention, Arbie. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it wasn’t a lot. More like… streaks. Blood-streaked, the young lady at the front desk called it. Fancy words for something a man shouldn’t be dealing with. And it happened after… well, after I used the facilities. Just a few times, mind you. Not every time.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood-streaked, appearing after urination, and not with every use. That’s helpful. Just to be clear, Arbie, is it pain during urination, or just noticing it afterward?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not a bit. That's what's so odd about it. A man'd expect pain if somethin' was wrong, wouldn't he? It's just… there. After I go. And like I said, not every time. Makes a fella wonder what’s goin' on, it does.
DOCTOR: Right, no pain. That is good information, and you’re right to wonder what’s going on. Have you noticed any other changes, Arbie?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes? You gotta be more specific, young lady. I’m not a doctor. I fly airplanes, or used to, anyway. Now I mostly just… sit.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Arbie. That was a bit broad. Let me ask this: Have you noticed any discharge—anything coming out that isn’t urine?
PATIENT: Discharge? Now hold on. Are you asking if I’m… leaking? At my age? Good Lord. No, no discharge. Absolutely not. I keep myself clean, thank you very much. This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no discharge. I apologize if my questions are upsetting. I just need to gather as much information as possible. Have you noticed any changes in how often you need to urinate—more frequently, or a sudden urge to go?
PATIENT: No, not really. Same as always, I suppose. Been goin' to the same places for the same length of time for… well, a long time. Never had any trouble holdin' it, either. Always been able to wait 'til I got to a proper facility. Not one of those fellas needin' to rush off to the woods.
DOCTOR: Good. No change in frequency or urgency. Arbie, just to be thorough, have you noticed any itching, sores, or bumps in the genital area?
PATIENT: Itching? No. And bumps? Heavens no. Look, I told you, I keep myself clean. I haven't got any of those… those things. This is gettin' embarrassing, asking an old man all these questions. What do you think it is, then?
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching, no sores, no bumps. I understand your frustration, Arbie, and I apologize if I'm making you uncomfortable. It’s good you’re taking this seriously, even if it’s a little embarrassing to talk about. Given what you’ve told me – the blood-streaked urine appearing intermittently with no pain, itching, sores, or changes in frequency – it could be a few things. One possibility is a small irritation or minor trauma, like from friction. Another could be a very early sign of a urinary tract infection, even without pain. And, while less likely, we need to rule out other possibilities as well. To help me narrow things down, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It’ll just be a visual inspection and I’ll likely palpate your abdomen. And then I’d like to take a urine sample to check for infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A urine sample, I can handle. A visual inspection… well, I suppose. But no pokin’ or proddin’, understand? I’ve had enough of that in my life. And I don’t want any fancy medical terms thrown around. Just tell me, plain and simple, what you find. And don't go thinkin' it's somethin' awful. Old men get things, you know. It's part of life.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Arbie. No poking or prodding, and I promise to explain everything in plain language. We'll take it slow, and I'll respect your boundaries. Okay, let’s start with the urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions, and you can go to the bathroom to collect it. I’ll wait here. After that, we'll do a quick visual exam. Just let me know when you're ready. And don't hesitate to tell me if you're feeling uncomfortable at any point.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. This is a ridiculous waste of time, but… alright.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Arbie. Let me just take this to the lab. It will only take a few minutes. Okay, the preliminary look is… normal color, normal clarity. That’s a good sign. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to take a look at the area. I’ll need you to lower your pants and underwear just enough for me to get a visual inspection. We'll keep it brief, and I’ll explain everything I’m doing as I go. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. Just get it over with, then. But quickly! And no gaspin’ or makin’ faces, you hear? I don’t need any young lady lookin’ at… well, you know. Just tell me what you see, plain and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. I’ll be as quick and discreet as possible. And I assure you, I'm a professional. Okay. I’m just going to take a look now… Alright. I see a very slight redness around the opening of your urethra, but no obvious sores, lesions, or swelling. No significant discharge visible. The skin appears normal otherwise. Palpation is…normal, no tenderness. That's good news, Arbie. The slight redness is minimal and could easily be due to minor irritation. Given the absence of pain, significant discharge, or other concerning signs, and the normal initial urine test results, I suspect this is likely a mild irritation. It could be from friction, sensitivity to soap, or even just a slight change in hygiene practices.
PATIENT: Hygiene practices? Now hold on. I've been keepin' myself clean for eighty-eight years, young lady. Don't go suggestin' I've suddenly taken to rollin' in the dirt. So, what do I do? Just… ignore it? And hope it goes away? Is that what you’re tellin' me?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Arbie. I didn't mean to imply anything about your hygiene. It was just mentioning a possible cause for irritation, and I should have phrased that better. You’re right, after eighty-eight years, I’m sure you know how to keep yourself clean. No, you don’t just ignore it. I recommend a few things. First, try switching to a mild, unscented soap for washing the area. Avoid harsh chemicals or anything with a strong fragrance. Second, make sure you’re staying well-hydrated – drinking plenty of water can help keep everything flushed out. And third, wear loose-fitting underwear made of breathable cotton. I’m also going to send the urine sample for a full culture to rule out any underlying infection, even though the initial results looked normal. It’s just a precaution. We should have those results back in a few days. If you experience any worsening symptoms – pain, significant discharge, fever, chills – please contact the office immediately. I suspect this will resolve on its own with these simple measures, but it’s always best to be thorough and rule out anything serious. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, I suppose. Cotton underwear… I used to wear those. Can't hurt, I reckon. And drinkin' water… a man should always drink water. So, no fancy medicines? No pokin' or proddin'? Just… washin' and drinkin'? That’s… acceptable. But if this doesn’t go away, I’m comin’ back, and I expect answers. And no talkin’ down to an old man, you hear?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arbie. No fancy medicines, no poking or prodding, just washing and drinking. And I completely understand. I promise to always treat you with respect and listen to your concerns. I’ll write down these recommendations for you, and I’ll have the lab results sent to the office as soon as they’re available. If you don’t hear back from us within a week, please give us a call. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just gettin’ it off my chest, so to speak. This whole thing was a ridiculous waste of time, but… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you, young lady. Even if you did try to suggest I don’t know how to wash myself.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbie. And again, I apologize for any offense. It's always better to be safe, and I’m glad you came in. If anything changes, or you have any concerns at all, please don't hesitate to contact the office. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
