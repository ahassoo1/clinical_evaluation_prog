DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's get straight to it. It’s… something in my mouth. A white coating. It’s rather unpleasant, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Something in your mouth… a white coating. And you'd like to get to the bottom of it quickly. I completely get that. Just to clarify, when did you first notice this coating?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t recall the exact date. A week, maybe? It’s not as if I spend my days examining my oral cavity. It just… appeared. And it’s irritating. It makes eating… less enjoyable. Though, frankly, most things are less enjoyable these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, approximately a week. And it's affecting your ability to eat comfortably. Alright. Now, is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not painful. Annoying, yes. Like a film you can't quite scrape off. Though, I suppose if I poked at it hard enough it might be… Look, it’s just a nuisance, Doctor. I’m a busy man. Are you going to tell me what it is or not? I have trees to fell, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand your time is valuable. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Is there any redness or soreness around the white coating?
PATIENT: No. Just… white. Look, I’m perfectly healthy. I work outdoors, I’m strong. It's probably just… something I ate. Though, I can't imagine what. I eat simple food. Meat, potatoes, the usual. It’s not like I’m indulging in sweets or anything frivolous. Now, is this going to require a battery of tests? Because I really don't have the time.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s take a closer look. Hmm. Yes, I see what you mean. There is a white coating on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. It looks… somewhat patchy. Now, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Like what? I told you, it’s white. Patchy, as you say. Is that bad? Look, Doctor, I don’t get sick. I’m a practical man. I don't have time for… whatever this is. Just tell me if I need something for it, and let me be on my way. This is… inconvenient. And I don’t like being inconvenienced.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I understand your frustration. It could be a number of things. One possibility is oral thrush – a fungal infection. It's not usually serious, especially in otherwise healthy individuals, but it can be uncomfortable. Now, do you have any underlying medical conditions?
PATIENT: Underlying conditions? No! Absolutely not. I told you, I’m a strong, healthy man. I work with machinery all day. Felling trees is not a job for the weak or infirm, Doctor. I don’t sit around complaining about aches and pains. I get on with it. I assure you, I don't have any "underlying conditions." And frankly, the suggestion is… insulting. Do you need to ask my wife? She’ll tell you the same. Now, are we finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known underlying conditions. And you’re quite active. Now, have you been taking any medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in filling my body with… potions. I get by with hard work and good food. And the occasional strong coffee, of course. But no medications. Never have, never will. Now, is this going to involve some sort of… swab? Because I have trees to fell. Time is money, Doctor. Precious, precious money.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Just coffee. Now, I'm going to ask one more question, and then we can discuss options. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Are you serious with these questions, Doctor? I’m a working man! Do I look like someone who spends their time with frivolous habits? No, I do not smoke. And I might have a beer with my dinner on occasion, but that’s it. A single beer. For relaxation. After a hard day’s work. This is absurd. Are you going to treat me, or interrogate me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I apologize if my questions seem… intrusive. I just need to gather all the information to determine the best course of action. Based on what you’ve told me, and a quick examination, it's possible this is a mild case of oral thrush, perhaps aggravated by something simple like dry mouth. We can try an anti-fungal mouthwash, over the counter. I'm going to write you a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension, just in case the mouthwash doesn't improve things. It's a simple medication, and should clear it up quickly. It's important to swish it around in your mouth for as long as possible, and then spit it out. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic? No. I’ve never been allergic to anything in my life. I’m a robust individual! Listen, just give me whatever you think will fix it and let me go. I have work to do. And frankly, this whole process has been a waste of my valuable time. And… are you sure this isn’t just something I can ignore? Because I really don’t see the point of… potions. And suspensions. It sounds ridiculous. Just write whatever you’re going to write so I can leave.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. Here’s the prescription for Nystatin. Please follow the instructions carefully. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please come back, or see a dentist. It's important to rule out other possibilities. I’m also going to recommend staying well-hydrated, as dry mouth can exacerbate the condition. Now, I'm going to give you a written summary of our conversation and the recommendations, just for your records. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
