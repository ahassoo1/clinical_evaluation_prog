DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta. I am here today, as I understand it, to see if I qualify for some help at home. I was told this office handles that. It is… for after a hospital stay, yes? For assistance.
DOCTOR: Assistance after a hospital stay. Yes, we do facilitate some post-hospital care arrangements. However, that's not strictly medical care, Mr. Bahta. It’s more of a care coordination service. To determine if you qualify for assistance, I’ll need to understand why you were hospitalized, and what your current functional status is. So let’s start with that hospital stay. When was that, and what were you admitted for?
PATIENT: Ah, I see. Care coordination… very good. The hospital stay was… let me think. It ended on July 12th, 2025. I was in for… a broken hip. Fell at home, quite a silly thing, really. It required surgery to fix. Everything went well with the surgery, the doctors said so, but… recovering is proving difficult. It is very painful still, even with the medication.
DOCTOR: July 12th… broken hip, surgery… Alright. And how old are you, Mr. Bahta, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. I am 54 years of age. Fifty-four. I was born in… 1971. Does that information assist you?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. Now, you mentioned recovery is proving difficult, and you’re still experiencing pain despite medication. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… a sharp ache, mostly in the front of my hip. It is worst when I try to move my leg – to stand, to walk, even to lift it to get into a chair. When I am lying still, it is more… a dull throbbing. It does not go away completely, even with the pills. It is… frustrating, to be honest. I used to be very active.
DOCTOR: And what medication are you currently taking for the pain, Mr. Bahta?
PATIENT: Let me see… the hospital prescribed… Oxycodone, I believe. 5 milligrams. I take two pills, three times a day, as instructed. But it does not seem to be enough, Doctor. Some days, it helps a little, but other days… it barely touches the pain. I have not asked for a stronger dose, I did not want to appear… demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Oxycodone 5mg, three times daily. You're right to be cautious about requesting more, but we do need to manage your pain effectively. Now, let's talk about your functionality. Before your fall, what was a typical day like for you?
PATIENT: A typical day… well, I am a surgeon, Doctor. Pediatric surgery, actually. So, very busy. Long hours on my feet, many operations. I would usually work from 7 in the morning until 7 at night, with only a short break for lunch. I walked quite a bit. I also enjoyed gardening in my free time. I kept very active. I would say I was… quite independent. Now… it is very different. I need help with almost everything.
DOCTOR: A surgeon, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Pediatric surgery. I have been practicing for… twenty-two years now. At Saint Jude’s Hospital, until the fall, of course. It is… humbling to be on this side of things. To need assistance with such basic tasks. I used to provide the assistance, not require it. It is… a difficult adjustment. Perhaps you can see from my chart? It lists my profession. I apologize if I seem… verbose. I am not used to talking about myself in this way.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see your profession. It's… notable, certainly. Let's focus on the practicalities. Can you tell me, specifically, what activities you are currently unable to do independently?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well… I cannot dress myself without assistance. Putting on socks and shoes is… impossible. I cannot bathe myself safely; I worry about falling. I cannot cook a proper meal. I can make a sandwich, perhaps, but anything more complicated is… risky. And walking is very difficult, even with a walker. I require assistance to get up and down the stairs. I… I feel very helpless, to be honest. It is a far cry from performing surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you're experiencing significant limitations with activities of daily living. And you're still having considerable pain despite the Oxycodone. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to assess your range of motion and strength. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can stand, but… it will be slow. And I will need to hold onto something, if that is permissible. My walker is just beside me. There. It is… uncomfortable. But I am standing.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, if you wouldn't mind, slowly lift your right leg forward. Just as far as you comfortably can. And now, try to rotate your right hip outward. Alright. And can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: That is… difficult. It is very painful when I lift it that high. It feels… stuck. I cannot rotate it very far without significant discomfort. I am trying to squeeze as hard as I can, Doctor, but it is… weak. I apologize. It feels like my muscles are… atrophying. It has only been a few weeks, but it feels like a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your range of motion is limited, particularly with external rotation, and your strength is diminished. We’ll need to get some imaging done to rule out any complications. I suspect some muscle atrophy, as you noted, but we need to confirm that. I'm going to order an X-ray of your hip, and I’d like you to schedule an appointment with a physical therapist for a full evaluation. As for the assistance at home, you likely do qualify for some services, but it will depend on the insurance coverage and the results of these evaluations. I will have my assistant contact you to schedule these appointments. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is… reassuring to hear. Yes, I do have a question. About the physical therapy… will that involve… a lot of pain? I am… concerned about exacerbating the condition. And regarding the insurance… I have private insurance, but I am unsure of the extent of the coverage for home health services. Is there anything I should be prepared for? Any paperwork or pre-authorization that I should be aware of? I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. It is… a great deal to take in.
DOCTOR: The physical therapy will likely involve some discomfort, Mr. Bahta. However, a good therapist will work within your pain tolerance and gradually increase the intensity as you improve. It's a process. As for the insurance, yes, you will almost certainly need pre-authorization for home health services. My assistant will handle the initial paperwork, but you may need to provide additional documentation, such as a letter from me outlining your medical needs. It’s… a bureaucratic process, unfortunately. You have private insurance, which is helpful, but coverage varies significantly. We will do our best to navigate the system for you, but it's not always straightforward. I also recommend contacting your insurance provider directly to inquire about your specific benefits. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: That is… understandable. I appreciate your honesty, Doctor. And thank you for offering to assist with the paperwork. I will contact my insurance provider directly, as you suggest. No, I believe that is all for now. I am… somewhat overwhelmed, to be honest. But I am grateful for your thorough assessment and guidance. Thank you again for your time. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant will be in touch shortly to schedule your appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening pain or any other concerns. Have a good day. .
