DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just…tired. Really tired. And I eat…dirt. Not like, on purpose, but…I crave it. It's stupid, I know. Don't ask me why, I don’t remember how it started. Is that what you need to know? Because honestly, I just want something to fix it and get me on with my day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Cantoran. It's helpful to have a clear picture of what's going on. It’s not stupid at all to want to address feeling tired and having unusual cravings. We'll figure this out together. To start, could you tell me more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? Honestly, it’s just…there. Always. It doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, ten, it doesn't matter. I wake up tired. And it's getting worse. I used to be able to push through it, get my work done, you know? CNC programming needs focus. But now…now I just feel…blah. Like a battery that’s always half-dead. What do you want to know? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. It sounds incredibly draining to feel constantly tired despite getting adequate sleep. And it’s completely valid to want to get to the bottom of this efficiently. Let’s try to narrow things down. When did you first notice this persistent tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t know. A while ago. Months, maybe? Years? Everything blurs together these days. My husband…he passed a few years back, and things just haven’t been the same. Maybe it started then? I really don’t remember specifics. Why does it matter when? It just is. I feel tired. And I eat dirt. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It's perfectly okay if the timing isn’t clear, and I truly appreciate you sharing about your husband’s passing. Grief can certainly have a profound effect on one's health and well-being, and it’s important to acknowledge that. Knowing when symptoms started can help us understand what might be going on, but we can definitely focus on how you're feeling now. The dirt-eating – that's what we call geophagia – that is also something we need to explore. It can sometimes be linked to nutritional deficiencies. Before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you're comfortable. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I guess…I’ve been kinda shaky lately. Not like, full-blown trembling, just…a little off-balance sometimes. And I get headaches. Dull ones. All the time. And I’ve been more…short-tempered, I guess. My neighbor asked me to help with her garden, and I just…snapped at her. Which isn’t like me. But really, I just want to lie down. Is that helpful? Seriously, I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cantoran, that’s very helpful. The shakiness, headaches, and increased irritability are all important pieces of the puzzle. It sounds like these symptoms are significantly impacting your quality of life, and we need to investigate the cause. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Not really. I mean, the usual things. Flu shots, a broken arm when I was a kid…nothing serious. My doctor retired a few years back, and I haven't really bothered finding a new one. Honestly, I mostly just tough things out. Is it important? I don’t really go to doctors. My husband always took care of all that. He said I worry too much. And now…well. I don’t have much of an appetite, if that matters. But I still eat the dirt sometimes. Stop asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cantoran. It's completely okay that you haven't seen a doctor regularly, and it sounds like your husband was very supportive. We’ll take things at your pace. Knowing you haven't been to a doctor recently helps us to build a more complete picture. You mentioned not having much of an appetite. Has your weight changed recently – either gained or lost?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes. I’ve lost weight. A little. I don’t know exactly how much. My clothes are looser, I guess. I just…don't feel hungry. Everything tastes kinda…blah. Not appetizing. And honestly, I’ve been too tired to cook. Mostly just…toast. And sometimes…I eat dirt instead of lunch. Is that…normal? Stop looking at me like that. I told you, I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cantoran. It’s important information. Weight loss and decreased appetite, along with the other symptoms you've described, are all things we need to investigate. It's not normal to eat dirt, and we want to understand why you're experiencing this craving. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t take anything. Never have. I figured if I needed something, it meant I was getting old. And I wasn’t about to let that happen. My husband used to say I was stubborn as a mule. Vitamins, maybe? I had some once, years ago, but I threw them out. They didn’t do anything. Just wasted money. Now, can we please get to the part where you tell me what’s wrong with me? I have things to do. Really. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cantoran. I assure you, we’re working as efficiently as possible. And it’s good to know you don’t take any regular medications. Given your symptoms – persistent tiredness, unexplained weight loss, decreased appetite, headaches, irritability, shakiness, and the geophagia – I would like to do a physical exam and order some blood tests. This will help us to rule out various potential causes, such as iron deficiency, thyroid issues, and vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I don’t see what poking and prodding is going to do, but…fine. Blood tests, whatever. As long as it doesn't take too long. And don’t ask me about my personal life, okay? I really don't have the energy for that. Just…do the tests. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. I will keep things as efficient as possible. We will start with a brief physical exam – checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and looking at your throat. Then, we’ll take a small sample of blood. If you’ll please have a seat on the table, we can begin. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little on the lower side, 100/60. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, could you open your mouth and say "ah"?
PATIENT: Ugh. Just get it over with. I told you, I don't feel well. I don't need you to tell me that. It's obvious. And it's probably just…old age. Or stress. Or something. I don’t know. I just want to go home. Is it done yet? This is ridiculous. I haven't felt this useless in years.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, Ms. Cantoran. I'm noting some paleness in your conjunctiva, which could suggest some degree of anemia. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Okay, Ms. Cantoran. Based on the physical exam, along with your reported symptoms, I’d like to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and an iron panel. These tests will help us evaluate your overall health and identify any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you want. Just…tell me when it’s over. I don't care what the tests are called, I just want to know what's wrong and fix it. I have better things to do than sit around waiting for results. And can we please hurry? I’m starting to feel dizzy. And don’t expect me to understand any fancy medical terms, okay? Just tell me the bottom line. In plain English. This is exhausting. I need a nap.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Cantoran. I understand. I will explain everything in plain English, and we will take things one step at a time. The phlebotomist will be right in to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe dizziness, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. And please don't bother me with unnecessary questions. I'm tired. Really tired. I just want to go home and sleep. That’s all. And don't expect a thank you. This whole thing is…a waste of my time. And frankly, I feel awful. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. I understand. We will get the blood draw done as quickly as possible, and I will contact you as soon as the results are available. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if your symptoms worsen. .
