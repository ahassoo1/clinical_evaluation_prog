DOCTOR: Right, good morning. I'm Dr. Gorga. Please, have a seat. So, Mrs. Sucich… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Gorga. It’s these hiccups, see. Just won’t go away. Started a couple of days ago, and they’re… well, they’re persistent, that’s what they are. Not painful, just… annoying! I thought they’d stop on their own, but no luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups… a couple of days. Alright. And are they constant, or do they come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, they come and go, definitely. Not all the time, thankfully. They’ll start up, maybe five or six in a row, then stop for a bit… an hour, maybe? Then they’ll be back. It's just… unpredictable. It’s making it hard to enjoy my tea, you know?
DOCTOR: Unpredictable…right. Any idea what might have started them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Now you askin’… I honestly don’t. I was makin’ a lovely seafood chowder the day before they started, but I doubt that’s it. I’ve made that a hundred times! Maybe I just… laughed too much at the telly? I was watchin’ one of those funny animal shows. But really, I can’t think of anything specific. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Seafood chowder… animal shows… Alright. Any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, no, nothing else at all. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no tummy troubles, not feelin’ unwell… just these blasted hiccups! I'm sleepin' alright, eatin' alright... everything's normal except this. It’s a bit of a mystery, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick check of your heart and lungs, just to be sure everything is alright. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Then we’ll talk about a few simple things you can try. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My heart’s always been strong, as far as the doctors have ever told me, but it doesn't hurt to check, does it? Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath for me… and another… good. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear, I'm not hearing anything unusual. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72. Everything sounds good so far. Any shortness of breath, even with just walking around?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. I walk down to the shops most days, and I can manage that just fine. No puffing or anything. I’m a pretty active woman for my age, I like to keep busy. Still do a bit of gardening, though the weeds are gettin’ the better of me these days! It's just these hiccups... they're the strange part.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to hear about the walking. And no pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Nothing at all like that. Just… this. It feels a bit silly complainin’ about hiccups, really, but they're relentless! They’re interruptin' everything. I was tryin' to knit a scarf for my granddaughter, but I can’t concentrate with them keepin’ comin’. It’s a small thing, but a bother, that’s what it is.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not the severity of it, it's the persistence. Let’s see… Given your age and the fact there are no other symptoms, it’s likely just an irritation of the phrenic nerve. Sometimes it happens. Have you tried anything to stop them yet?
PATIENT: Oh, the phrenic nerve, is it? Fancy name! No, haven’t tried anything special, really. Just tryin’ to ignore them mostly. And drinkin’ water, you know, like you always see in the pictures. Holdin’ my breath for a bit, but that just makes me feel a bit dizzy. I thought they’d go away on their own, but they’re bein’ quite stubborn.
DOCTOR: Alright. Since they've been going on for a couple of days, and holding your breath isn’t helpin’, let's try a few things. First, avoid carbonated drinks and very large meals for a bit. Sometimes that can irritate things. And there’s a medication, baclofen, that can help calm the nerve down. It’s usually prescribed for muscle spasms, but it can sometimes work for persistent hiccups. I can write you a prescription if you’d like. We'll start with a low dose.
PATIENT: Oh, baclofen, you say? Never heard of it. That sounds sensible, Doctor. Avoiding fizzy drinks isn’t a problem, I don't drink much of those anyway. And a prescription sounds good, if you think it'll help. I’m happy to try anything to get rid of these things! I'm not keen on takin' pills, but a low dose… well, that doesn't sound too bad. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, baclofen 10 milligrams, take one tablet three times a day with meals. We’ll see how you do for a week. If it’s not helpin' after a week, we can adjust the dose or consider other options. If the hiccups get worse at any point, or you develop any other symptoms – chest pain, trouble breathing, or anything else – give us a call right away, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly clear, Doctor. 10 milligrams, three times a day with meals, and call if anything changes. I've got a good memory, so I'll remember that. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a bit better just knowin’ there’s somethin’ I can try. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Good. And just so you know, these things usually resolve on their own eventually. It’s good to rule things out, and now we’re on the right track. I'll have the nurse print out some information about the medication for you. Any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. That’s very reassuring to know they usually go away on their own. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen and explain things. Thank you kindly. I’ll give the medication a try and see how it goes. Have a good day!
