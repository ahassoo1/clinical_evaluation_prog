DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. So, to start us off, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. It's nice to meet you as well. Well… my chest. It’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little. Feels like… a squeezing, sometimes. Mostly when I walk, I think. It’s been a few days now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, that’s good information to start with. A squeezing chest pain that comes and goes, especially with walking… that’s something we definitely want to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. More right here, in the middle of my chest. And it doesn't feel like a muscle pain, you know? It’s… hard to explain. It’s not sharp. Just… tight. And heavy. Like someone’s sitting on me, maybe? Does that make any sense? I'm sorry, I'm not good with describing things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Sherion. “Tight and heavy” is a very helpful way to describe it. And it’s perfectly alright to not be good at describing things – that’s what I’m here for. You mentioned it happens mostly when you walk. About how far do you typically walk before you start to notice the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, not very far, Doctor. Not like I used to! Maybe… two blocks. Two or three. And it comes on slowly, you know? Not all at once. I start feeling a little winded, then the tightness comes. I have to stop and rest a minute. It's been getting worse, that's why I came. Before, it was just when I was going up hills. Now it’s almost flat ground too.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, that’s important information – the gradual onset and the fact that it’s happening with less exertion. And that it’s increasing – that’s why you’re doing the right thing coming to get it checked out. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Sometimes I feel a little… short of breath, even when I'm not walking. Just sitting and watching TV, I might feel like I need to take a deeper breath. Not bad, just… noticeable. And I've been a little tired, but I thought that was just because of the heat. It’s been so hot, you know? Oh! And my hands… sometimes they feel a little cold. Not always, but sometimes. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts, Sherion. Shortness of breath at rest, increased fatigue, and cold hands – those are all things we want to consider. To help me get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any past medical problems you’ve had?
PATIENT: Well… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on pills for it and it’s been pretty good. They check it when I see my regular doctor. I had a little bit of trouble with my cholesterol, too, but those pills help with that too. Oh, and I had surgery on my knee, a long time ago. But that's healed now. Nothing else, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and cholesterol, both managed with medication, and a past knee surgery. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications for these conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I am. Let me see… I take one for the blood pressure, it's Lisinopril, I think? And one for the cholesterol, it's Atorvastatin. And sometimes, if my arthritis is bad, I take something for that too, but not every day. That one’s Naproxen. Does that help? I hope I'm not forgetting anything. I try to remember, but… you know.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Sherion, thank you. Lisinopril for blood pressure, Atorvastatin for cholesterol, and Naproxen as needed for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything! My husband, he's got allergies, but I'm pretty lucky that way. Nothing that I know of, anyway. No allergies. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, that’s good to know. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Hmm. My mother, she had heart trouble when she got older. She had to have a pacemaker. And my father, he had diabetes. He wasn’t very good about taking care of himself. My brother… he’s okay, I think. He has high blood pressure, like me. Nothing else I can think of, really. It's been a long time since we talked about it. Not much, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother, diabetes in your father, and high blood pressure in your brother. Thank you. And lastly, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well… I’m retired now, so I don’t work anymore. I mostly stay home, I like to cook, and I like to watch TV with my husband. We go to church on Sundays. I used to walk more, but it’s been so hot, you know? And with my chest hurting… I don't want to push myself too hard. I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink very much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but I like my arepas! Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Sherion, thank you. So, retired, mostly at home, light activity, no smoking, occasional alcohol, and a preference for arepas! Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just so I have a better idea of what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Go ahead, please. Just tell me if anything hurts.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated. I’m listening to your heart now. I hear a slight murmur, but it’s not new according to your records. Your lungs sound clear. Your pulse is a little fast, at 88 beats per minute, and regular. There’s no tenderness to palpation. Okay, Sherion. Everything seems stable, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly fast pulse, combined with your symptoms, are concerning enough to warrant some further investigation. I’d like to order an EKG, and a blood test to check your cardiac enzymes and cholesterol levels. Also, I'm going to order a chest x-ray to rule out any lung issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh my… that sounds like a lot. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. An EKG, blood test, and… x-ray. Okay. Will they be doing them here? And… will it hurt? I'm a little nervous.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be nervous, Sherion. We'll take things one step at a time. The EKG is completely painless. It just involves placing some sticky patches on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. The blood test will involve a small sample of blood, and the chest x-ray is also painless – you'll just stand in front of a machine while it takes a picture of your lungs. We can do the EKG and blood test here in the clinic right away. The chest x-ray will require you to go to the imaging center across the street, it should only take about 15-20 minutes. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and get you set up for those tests. While we’re waiting for the results, are you experiencing any chest pain right now?
PATIENT: No, not right now. It comes and goes, you know? It was a little bit earlier when I was walking from the car, but it’s better now. Okay. No pain right now. And… Maria, you said? A nice nurse? I hope so. I get a little… shaky sometimes, with needles and things. But I’ll be okay. Just… one step at a time, like you said.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sherion. Maria is wonderful – very gentle and patient. She’ll take very good care of you. I'll let her know you might be a little nervous, and she’ll make sure everything goes smoothly. Let's get those tests done, and then we'll talk about the results. In the meantime, if you do experience any chest pain, or shortness of breath, or feel dizzy, please let me or Maria know immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I… I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I want to be able to go back to normal, to walk around and not worry. Just… what’s going on. That’s all. Okay. Let’s get the tests done. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. That’s exactly what we’re going to figure out. We’ll take it one step at a time. Maria will be in shortly. I'll be here and we can discuss everything once we have the results. Just try to relax, and let me know if you need anything at all. We'll get to the bottom of this.
