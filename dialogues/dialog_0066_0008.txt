DOCTOR: Hi Leander, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, um… my ear. It feels… full. Like it’s plugged up, you know? It’s been… a while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, a plugged feeling in your ear. That can be pretty bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: When I first noticed… hmm. That’s a tricky one. Honestly, things are a bit… blurry. I think it was after… some work outside. Maybe a few weeks back? Or was it last month? I do a lot of… inspecting. Fields, mostly. It’s hard to say when it started exactly. Everything feels a bit mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it’s common to not remember exact dates. So, it sounds like it started around the time you were doing some work outside, inspecting fields?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Fields… lots of them. Dust, probably. Is that… is that what it is? I don't really know what causes these things. It just… feels full. And a little… muffled. Everything sounds a bit quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust is definitely a possibility when you’re working outdoors. And the muffled sound helps me understand what's going on. Has anything made it worse, or better, since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Not that I can recall, really. It’s pretty consistent. Maybe… a little more noticeable when it’s windy? But mostly just… there. I haven't tried anything to make it better, to be honest. Just… hoping it would go away on its own. Which, you know… hasn’t happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any pain with it at all?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. It’s not painful. Just… uncomfortable. Annoying, mostly. Like when you're on a plane, you know? That pressure feeling. It's not sharp pain or anything, just… a fullness. I'm glad it's not painful, though. Pain's never good.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it’s not painful. And you haven’t had any discharge from the ear, dizziness, or any changes in your hearing besides the muffled sound, right?
PATIENT: Discharge… no, I don’t think so. Nothing coming out, no. And dizziness… now that you mention it, maybe a little bit off-balance sometimes, but I figured that was just… getting older. And the hearing… well, it's always been a bit questionable, if I’m being honest. The muffled sound is… new-ish, I suppose. But the overall hearing… not great. But I didn't connect that to this ear thing, necessarily.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, really. I mean, I’m an old man, Doctor. A few aches and pains here and there, but nothing serious. I had… something a while back, a little cough, but that cleared up. My wife… she took care of all that paperwork. She passed away a few years ago, so I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. I have… private insurance, I believe. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the insurance is good to know, thank you. And I understand about the paperwork—it’s okay if you don’t remember the specifics. Just trying to get a general picture of your health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And… maybe an appendix? I think so. It was a long time ago, and honestly, I don't recall much detail. Hospitalized… probably for the appendix. Nothing else comes to mind, really. I try not to go to the doctor unless absolutely necessary. It’s just… a hassle. And she always took care of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils and possibly an appendix. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tough one. My parents… they both lived to be quite old, actually. I don’t really recall any… specific illnesses. My mother had… something with her joints, I think. Arthritis, maybe? But it was a long time ago. And my wife’s family… I didn’t know them very well. She didn't talk about it much. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? Things just… blur together.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine. It's understandable to not remember everything. Okay, lastly, do you take any medications regularly, or have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications… no, not regularly. I might take something for a headache now and then, but nothing every day. And allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. Dust maybe? But that’s not an allergy, is it? I'm really not sure. Honestly, I try to avoid taking anything if I can. She always knew what I could and couldn’t take. It's… complicated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Leander. Thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear. It will just be a quick examination. Can you sit forward a little bit for me?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Sit forward… Just… quickly, you said? I have some… inspecting to do later this afternoon. Fields don't inspect themselves, you know. But go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a bit of wax buildup and some slight redness behind the eardrum. The eardrum itself looks intact, thankfully. It does appear a bit…full, which is consistent with what you’re describing. The redness could be from the buildup, or a mild irritation. I don’t see any signs of an infection at this point. Do you feel any discomfort when I gently press on the area behind your ear?
PATIENT: Discomfort…? A little… yes, maybe. Not much, but… a slight pressure. Just there. It's probably nothing, though. I’m a bit tender there sometimes. Old age, you know. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily bad. Just good to know. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you likely have a wax buildup causing the feeling of fullness and muffled sound, potentially with some mild irritation. The tenderness behind the ear could be related to that. Now, we can try a simple wax removal. I can gently flush your ear with warm water. It’s usually pretty quick and painless, although some people experience a slight popping sensation. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Wax removal… yes, that sounds… sensible. I’m happy to try anything to get rid of this fullness. Popping sensation… well, I’ve had worse. As long as it doesn’t hurt. Is it… messy? I have to go back to the fields this afternoon, you see. And I’d rather not be covered in… whatever comes out.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn’t be messy at all. I use a gentle technique and have a basin to catch any fluid. We’ll have you lie on your side so it drains properly. Okay, let's get you comfortable. I'm going to have you lie down on your side with this towel under your head. We’ll start gently and see how you tolerate it. Let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Lie down… Gently, you said? Good. And tell me if anything feels… off? I'm not very good at describing things, but I'll let you know if something doesn’t feel right. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm starting with a very gentle stream of water. Let me know if you feel any pressure or discomfort at all. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh… a little… bubbly. And warm, of course. Not painful, just… strange. A little pressure, yes. Like something is… moving. Is that normal? It's a bit disconcerting, to be honest. But not unbearable. Just… strange. Keep going, I suppose? If it will help… the fullness.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. The bubbling and pressure are normal when the wax is starting to break up. I’m going to continue with gentle irrigation for a few more seconds. Alright, let’s pause there for a moment. Do you notice any change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes. A little, I think. Not a dramatic change, but… it's less muffled. Like someone turned up the volume a tiny bit. Still not perfect, but… better. Definitely better. Is there… more you can do? If it's not too much trouble? I really appreciate it, Doctor. This is a relief, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear! We can continue irrigating for a few more minutes. We’ll want to make sure we get most of the wax out. Okay, that looks much better. I see a significant reduction in wax buildup and your eardrum is clear. How does your ear feel now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… remarkable! Much, much better. It doesn't feel plugged up at all anymore. And the muffled sound is gone! I can actually hear you properly! That's a relief. Thank you, Doctor. Truly. I didn’t realize how annoying that fullness was until it was gone. You've saved me a lot of frustration, I think. What do I owe you?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Leander! I'm glad I could help. The cost for the ear irrigation is $125. Your insurance should cover a portion of that. We can process the claim for you here, or you can submit it yourself if you prefer. Now, to prevent this from happening again, I recommend avoiding getting water in your ears when you shower or swim. You could also use earplugs. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: $125… yes, that’s alright. Insurance… yes, process the claim, please. I don’t really understand those forms. Earplugs… yes, I’ll try to remember that. Showering… that’s not a problem. Swimming… I haven’t done that in years. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience, especially considering… well, my forgetfulness. Thank you again. I best get back to the fields. They won’t inspect themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Leander. Glad I could help. It was my pleasure. And don't worry about the forgetfulness—it happens to the best of us. If you experience any pain, discharge, or changes in your hearing, please don’t hesitate to call us. Here’s a card with our contact information. Have a good afternoon and be careful out there!
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. I will remember that… I think. You too, Doctor. Goodbye.
