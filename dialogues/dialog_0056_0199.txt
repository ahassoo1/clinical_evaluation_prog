DOCTOR: Hi Marquie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… my breathing. It’s been kinda hard lately. Like, I get really short of breath, even when I’m not doing much. It’s… annoying, to be honest. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a few weeks, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of shortness of breath. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it doesn’t really seem to have a pattern. Sometimes it's worse when I’m walking, but other times it just… happens. Even when I’m sitting. It’s hard to explain. Like, I’ll be relaxing, and then suddenly I have to really focus on taking a breath. And it’s not like a cough or anything, just… air hunger, I guess. My wife keeps telling me I look worried when it happens, but I don’t really feel worried, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining things, sorry.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Marquie. Don’t apologize – it's common to have trouble putting these things into words. So, it’s not consistently with activity, and it seems to come on even at rest. Any chest pain with that shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, not really. Maybe a little…tightness sometimes, but not like a sharp pain. It’s more like… pressure, I guess? But it doesn’t happen every time I’m short of breath. Honestly, it's been hard to keep track of what's happening when, everything feels a bit mixed up. I work a lot, you know? Long hours at the plant… keeps me pretty tired. I don’t have time to really… notice things, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent pressure, not sharp pain. And you work long hours at the plant… that’s good to know. Any cough, fever, chills, or recent illness?
PATIENT: No, no cough or fever. Nothing like that. I think I had a little cold a couple months back, but it was really mild. Just a stuffy nose for a day or two. Nothing serious. I’m usually pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat okay, I try to get some sleep when I can… it’s just this breathing thing that’s bothering me. And it’s kinda worrying my wife. She’s the one who made me come in, really. I don’t usually bother with doctors unless I absolutely have to. It takes time away from work, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, no recent illness beyond a mild cold. Let’s get a quick listen to your lungs and heart, and I’ll check your oxygen levels, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try to make it quick, if you can? I have a shift starting in a few hours, and I really don’t want to be late. I'm not insured, so I'm kinda watching the clock, too. Not trying to be difficult, just… things are tight.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick as possible. I'll document that you are uninsured as well. Okay, if you could just take a few deep breaths in and out for me... and then I'll listen to your back and chest. Okay, breathe in… and out… again… good. Now let's check your oxygen saturation. Your oxygen is 96%, which is good. I am hearing some mild wheezing on both sides. It’s subtle, but it’s there. Do you have any history of asthma or allergies?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Uh… no, I don’t think so. No asthma or allergies that I know of. My wife has some seasonal allergies, but I never really caught anything from her. I grew up in Venezuela, and we didn’t really have much time for doctors or… anything like that, to be honest. We were just trying to get by. So, I’m not really sure what wheezing is, but if you say I have it, I guess I do. Does that mean something bad? I’m really not good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't necessarily mean something bad, Marquie. Wheezing just means there's some narrowing in your airways. It can be caused by a lot of things – a recent cold, irritation, even just sensitive airways. Given your history and the fact that it’s mild, it’s not immediately alarming. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to any dust or fumes at work?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And at the plant… yeah, there’s definitely dust. And sometimes chemicals, I guess. We treat water and wastewater, so… there’s a lot of stuff floating around. We have masks, but they’re not always the most comfortable, so… sometimes people don’t wear them all the time. I try to, but it gets hot and stuffy, you know? It's a tough job. Do you think that could be it? The dust? It wouldn’t be the first time I’ve breathed in something I shouldn’t have.
DOCTOR: That’s definitely a possibility, Marquie. Exposure to dust and chemicals at work can certainly irritate the airways and cause wheezing. Given your symptoms and your work environment, that’s high on my list of potential causes. I'm going to recommend a trial of an inhaler to see if that helps open up your airways. It’s a bronchodilator – it relaxes the muscles around your airways. If it works, that would strongly suggest this is related to airway irritation. We can also discuss some strategies to minimize your exposure at work. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, an inhaler sounds good. If it helps, that would be great. Honestly, anything to make it easier to breathe. And yeah, talking about what I can do at work would be good, too. I don’t want to lose my job over this. Is it expensive? The inhaler, I mean. I really don’t have a lot of money, like I said. And… is there anything else I should be worried about? I always feel like doctors are holding something back. Not trying to be rude, just… that’s how it always felt back home.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Marquie. You're right to ask. The inhaler is relatively inexpensive, and I can write you a prescription for a generic version to keep the cost down. I'll also see if there are any patient assistance programs we can look into. As for other concerns… at this point, I don’t think anything serious is going on, but it’s important to monitor your symptoms. If the inhaler doesn’t help, or if you start experiencing chest pain, fever, or increased shortness of breath, we’ll need to investigate further. We might consider a chest x-ray or refer you to a pulmonologist, but let’s start with the inhaler and see how you do. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Reasonable. Starting with the inhaler seems smart. I don’t want to jump to anything too drastic. And… thank you. For explaining everything, and not making me feel like I’m wasting your time. And for not judging me for not knowing medical words. It's… nice. I guess I’ll take the prescription, and try to remember to use it. My wife will probably remind me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marquie. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm glad I could help. Here's the prescription. And I'll write a note for your employer explaining that you've been evaluated for respiratory symptoms and we're working on a management plan. Hopefully, that will ease any concerns they may have. I’ll see you back here in two weeks to check on your progress.
