DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It's about my legs. They just…gave out. It was right after that awful cold I had last week. Honestly, I’ve had better care at a roadside motel. But, you know, a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do. They feel like jelly, really. Not a good look, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. You experienced leg weakness after a recent cold. And you're finding it concerning. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe what you mean by “gave out”?
PATIENT: “Gave out” as in, I was walking – perfectly normally, I might add – and suddenly, thump, I nearly ended up on the floor. It wasn't a graceful fall, let me tell you. Had to be helped up. It’s…unsettling. I don’t do unsteady. And it’s both legs, which is even more alarming. I mean, one would be bad enough, but both? It feels…disrespectful, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this was a sudden onset of weakness in both legs, causing you to nearly fall. And it happened while you were walking normally. Was this weakness complete – meaning were you unable to move your legs at all – or were you still able to put some weight on them?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn't like I just collapsed. I could still…sort of…move them. It was more like they wouldn’t respond properly. Like trying to push through mud, you know? Very frustrating. I had to practically will them to work. And yes, I could put some weight on them, but it felt…precarious. Like a house of cards in a hurricane. I definitely didn’t want to try anything ambitious, like a quick sprint. Believe me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness that felt delayed or difficult to initiate, affecting both legs and making you feel unsteady. And this occurred after a recent cold. To get a better picture, could you tell me about the cold itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it was just a cold. You know, sniffles, sore throat, the usual. Nothing dramatic. I hardly even noticed it, honestly. I've had worse. Took some over-the-counter stuff, rested a bit – although, one doesn’t exactly rest when one has things to do – and thought I was over it. It was gone in a few days, and then…boom, legs. It was a rather inconvenient timing, really. I had a luncheon scheduled. A very important one.
DOCTOR: Right. A mild cold, resolving in a few days, followed by the onset of leg weakness. And this weakness came on suddenly after the cold symptoms subsided. Did you notice any other symptoms along with the cold, like fever, cough, or body aches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A bit of a fever, I suppose. Nothing to write home about. And a cough, a rather irritating one, actually. And yes, body aches. You know, the general misery that comes with being… unwell. I felt rather put upon, frankly. I’m not accustomed to feeling anything less than fabulous. But honestly, those were all fairly mild. I’ve had flu seasons that were considerably more… memorable. It's the legs that are the problem, Doctor. Not a sniffle.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mild fever, cough, and body aches with the cold, resolving before the leg weakness started. Now, besides the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms since this began?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No pain, thankfully. And no numbness or tingling, which I read somewhere is… unpleasant. My hands are perfectly fine, and I haven't noticed any… issues down there, if you catch my drift. It's just the legs. They feel… unreliable. And it’s terribly embarrassing, frankly. I had to have Ricardo – my driver – practically carry me into the salon yesterday. It wasn't a good look for anyone involved.
DOCTOR: Alright. No pain, numbness, or tingling in your legs, and no other associated symptoms. Just the feeling of unreliability and weakness. Have you had any similar episodes in the past?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Never. I’ve always been perfectly… robust, thank you very much. I’ve never had legs that didn't cooperate. I've walked miles in heels, I’ve danced all night… This is completely new. And quite unwelcome, I might add. It’s… disconcerting, to say the least. I don’t do unreliable body parts. It’s simply not in my nature.
DOCTOR: Okay. This is a new symptom for you, and you haven't experienced anything like this before. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I hardly take anything. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. A little chamomile tea, perhaps. And I used to take something for my…complexion, but I stopped that months ago. And the over-the-counter cold stuff, of course, when I was feeling under the weather. But nothing regular. I’m a very healthy person, Doctor. I watch what I eat, I get my eight hours… well, most of the time… It’s just… this. This leg situation. Honestly, it's terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't take any regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter remedies for things like a cold. And you generally consider yourself to be in good health. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. A rather long and complicated story. My mother… well, she was always a bit of a hypochondriac, to be honest. Always complaining about something. And she had… something with her nerves, I think. Always forgetting things, shaking a bit. But nothing specific, really. And my father… he was a strong, silent type. Very healthy, as far as I know. He didn’t believe in doctors. So, no, I don’t think there’s anything particularly relevant. It’s mostly just…drama, if you catch my drift. A lot of complaining and worrying. It wasn’t a particularly…calm household.
DOCTOR: Alright. A mother with some nerve-related issues and a healthy father who wasn’t fond of doctors. Now, finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I'm a tour guide, you see. Very demanding work, always on my feet, showing people the sights. Lots of walking, lots of talking, lots of…smiling. And of course, I have a very active social life. Luncheons, dinners, the occasional gala. I try to stay fit, but it’s difficult with my schedule. I used to swim regularly, but haven't had the time lately. I enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner, and… well, I’m not a saint, if you catch my drift. I live a full life, Doctor. A very full life. Which is why this leg situation is so… disruptive. It simply won't do to be unreliable, you see. It’s not a good look.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're a tour guide with a demanding schedule, active social life, and generally consider yourself healthy despite a busy lifestyle. Now, Ms. Firestone, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Honestly. I’m not sure that’s necessary. I told you everything. But… fine. If you insist. Just please be gentle. I have a luncheon to attend this afternoon, and I can’t afford to be…disheveled. And do try to be quick about it. Ricardo is waiting.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Honestly. It’s terribly uncomfortable. And this paper… it’s hardly dignified. But fine. Do what you must. Just…try not to poke me too much. And please tell me what you’re doing. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm checking your knee reflexes. Now, lift each leg off the table, one at a time, and hold it straight out. Okay, good. Now, can you push your feet against my hands like you’re pressing on a gas pedal?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s not as easy as it looks. This table is terribly low. And yes, I can…sort of…lift them. It's just… requires a bit of effort. There. Am I doing it right? It feels… rather weak, doesn't it? I used to be able to do this effortlessly. It's most unsettling. It's simply not like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I noticed some mild weakness with leg extension and slightly diminished reflexes in both legs. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Everything sounds clear there. And finally, I’m going to quickly check your sensation in your feet and legs. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch you here?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this poking and prodding is rather undignified. But fine. Do what you must. Yes…yes, I feel it. A little…tingly, perhaps. But yes, I feel it. It’s just…not very comfortable, you see. Is this going to take much longer? Ricardo is probably wondering where I am. And I have a very important luncheon. A very important one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Firestone. Everything seems normal except for the mild weakness I observed in your legs and the slightly diminished reflexes. Based on your history and the examination, and given the recent cold, one possibility is a condition called Guillain-Barré syndrome. It’s a rare autoimmune condition that can cause weakness and tingling after an infection. However, it’s important to rule out other causes as well. To be sure, I’d like to order some blood tests and a nerve conduction study. The blood tests will help us look for signs of infection or inflammation, and the nerve conduction study will assess the function of your nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré… what? Honestly, that sounds… dreadful. And blood tests? A nerve conduction… study? Are you sure this is necessary? I mean, couldn’t it just be a pulled muscle? Or…exhaustion? I’ve been terribly busy, you see. And I simply don’t have time for all these…tests. But…fine. If you insist. But please, make it quick. And I expect a full explanation of everything. I don’t like being left in the dark. And I need to know when I can expect the results. I have a schedule to maintain, you see. A very important schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. It’s good you’re voicing them. While a pulled muscle is possible, the weakness and diminished reflexes warrant further investigation to rule out anything more serious. The blood tests are relatively quick and straightforward. The nerve conduction study will take a bit longer, perhaps an hour or so, but it’s a painless procedure. We’ll send the orders to the lab immediately. The results should be available within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and monitoring your symptoms closely. If you experience any new symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, changes in your bladder or bowel function, or increased weakness, please come to the emergency room immediately. I’ll also write you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They are specialists in nerve disorders and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Honestly, this is all becoming rather…overwhelming. Fine. A neurologist, if you insist. But I expect a very good one. Someone who understands my…situation. I can't be wasting time with someone inexperienced. And I expect a full report. Everything explained in simple terms. No medical jargon, please. I'm not a doctor, you see. And I need to know when I can expect to see this neurologist. I have a luncheon scheduled next week, and I can't be missing that. It's very important. But…fine. Do what you must. Just…make it quick. And please, don't keep me waiting. My time is valuable, you see. Very valuable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Firestone. I’ll arrange for a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. I’ll make sure her office is aware of your concerns and schedule an appointment as quickly as possible. They will contact you directly to arrange a suitable time. Here’s the referral form and some information about Guillain-Barré syndrome. Please read it over at your convenience. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – any new weakness, difficulty breathing, or changes in your bladder or bowel function – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Honestly, I doubt I'll understand most of that medical jargon. But fine. I'll try to read it. Just one question. Will this…condition…interfere with my luncheon schedule? That's my primary concern, you see. I simply cannot miss that luncheon. It's extremely important. A very important client will be there. And I need to look my best. Is there anything I can do to ensure that this…condition…doesn't disrupt my schedule? And can you guarantee that I'll be feeling well enough to attend? That's all that really matters, you see. Everything else is secondary.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Firestone. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to say definitively whether this condition will interfere with your luncheon schedule. The severity of Guillain-Barré syndrome varies greatly. Some people experience mild weakness that resolves quickly, while others require more extensive treatment and have a longer recovery period. However, by getting a prompt diagnosis and starting treatment as soon as possible, we can maximize your chances of a full recovery and minimize the impact on your daily life. I’ll do everything I can to ensure that you receive the best possible care. We can also discuss some potential strategies to manage your symptoms and help you continue with your activities as much as possible. For example, if you experience weakness, we can explore the use of assistive devices or modify your activities to reduce strain. But until we have the results of the tests and a more definitive diagnosis, it’s difficult to say for certain. I understand your concerns, and I’ll keep you informed every step of the way. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all very unsettling. It simply won't do to be weak or incapacitated. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. And I simply cannot afford to be unreliable. Fine. I suppose I'll have to trust you. But if this…condition…interferes with my luncheon schedule, I will hold you personally responsible. Do you understand? Personally responsible. I suppose that's all for now. But please, keep me informed. And make sure that neurologist is…competent. I simply can’t waste time with someone inexperienced. And please, don't keep me waiting. My time is valuable, you see. Very valuable. And if this…condition…interferes with my luncheon… you’ll be hearing from my lawyer. Just so you know.
