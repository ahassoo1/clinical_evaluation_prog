DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And I been… eating dirt. Not like on purpose, you know? Just… feels good in my mouth. Don't ask me why. It's weird, I know. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… right. Well, we'll certainly address that. “Real tired” is rather vague, Ms. Cantoran. Can you tell me more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Vague? What do you mean vague? I told you, I’m tired! Like… all the time. Even after I sleep. It’s been going on… a while. Months, I guess. Longer? I don’t keep track of that stuff. Honestly, I just want to have the energy to get through the day. Is that so hard to understand? It makes it hard to… work. And everything else, really. Now, are you gonna help me or just ask questions?
DOCTOR: I am trying to help you, Ms. Cantoran. But to provide proper care, I need details. “All the time” still doesn’t tell me much. Is it worse at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm… I guess… afternoons. After lunch. That's when it really hits. And it’s not like a normal tired, you know? It’s… heavy. Like weights on my eyelids. And everything aches. My bones, mostly. But… I don't know. Look, I program computers all day, okay? Not describe feelings. Can we skip this part?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue and aching?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, my stomach's been… off. Sort of. Not sick, exactly, just… unsettled. And I been… colder than usual. Even when it's warm out. But I just put on another sweater, you know? Now, about this dirt eating… is that dangerous? Because I really don't want to stop if it makes me feel better. It's… a comfort.
DOCTOR: “Comfort” is… an unusual descriptor. Ms. Cantoran, consuming dirt can introduce parasites and toxins into your system. It's certainly not a recommended practice. But we will address that after we’ve determined the cause of your fatigue and other symptoms. Have you experienced any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I remember to. It’s not like I’m not hungry, just… don’t think about it much. Mostly just… toast. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Everything tastes kinda… bland lately, though. Even the coffee. And I haven’t been sleeping well, either. Tossing and turning. Now, are you going to give me something for this tiredness or what? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s review your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I remember. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. My husband… he always took care of that stuff. He said I worried too much. Now it’s just me. And I don’t recall any… fancy diagnoses. Maybe a cold now and then? Nothing serious. Now, can we please move on? I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never had one. Don’t like hospitals. My husband didn’t like them either. Said they were full of germs. Just...no. Never needed anything cut open. Now, are you gonna ask me about my family or something? Because honestly, I don’t remember much about them either. It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: I see. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just… the coffee, I told you. And sometimes a pain reliever for my back. But it doesn't really do much. It's just… getting old, I guess. Now, can we talk about the dirt eating? I want to know if it's going to kill me before I go. Because if it is, I'm gonna keep doing it. It's the only thing that helps.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand you find comfort in this practice, but it's frankly alarming. We need to rule out any underlying deficiencies that may be causing this craving. Now, let’s conduct a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t poke and prod too much. I bruise easily. And don’t tell me I need to eat vegetables or something. I know what I'm doing. And I still want to know if this dirt is gonna kill me. Just say it straight. Now, hurry up. My back's starting to ache just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is slightly elevated, and there are some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Abdomen is soft, but there is some tenderness in the lower quadrants. Blood pressure is 130/85. Skin is pale and slightly dry. Reflexes are normal. Now, I’d like to order some blood work to check for anemia, vitamin deficiencies, and kidney function. We also need to rule out any parasitic infections. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, great. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever you need to do. But I swear, if you find something wrong, I’m blaming you. I haven't been sick in years! Just...get it over with. And tell me if this dirt is dangerous. Please. I need to know. Now, how long is this going to take? I got deadlines.
DOCTOR: The blood work will take a few days to process. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. As for the dirt, it is potentially dangerous, as I mentioned earlier. The risk of parasitic infection and heavy metal poisoning is significant. However, without the blood work, I cannot definitively determine the extent of any harm. We need to identify if there are underlying deficiencies driving this craving. I will also order a stool sample to check for parasites. In the meantime, I strongly advise you to discontinue this practice. Until we have results, continuing to ingest dirt could be detrimental to your health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Detrimental? Oh, now you're scaring me. Fine. Fine! I’ll try to stop. But don’t blame me if I cave. It’s… hard, okay? And it makes me feel better! Now, can I go? I got things to do. And I still want to know what exactly is wrong with me, if anything. What kind of deficiencies are we even talking about? Just tell me straight. No fancy medical terms, please.
DOCTOR: Very well. Common deficiencies associated with this behavior include iron, zinc, and clay—specifically, pica, which is the craving for non-nutritive substances. We will determine if any of these deficiencies are present with the blood work. Until then, I recommend increasing your intake of iron-rich foods, such as lean meats, beans, and leafy green vegetables. I'm also prescribing a multivitamin to help cover any potential gaps. Here. Take this to your pharmacy. And please schedule a follow-up appointment with my receptionist as soon as the blood work results are available. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Or… whatever. I’ll see what I can do about the vitamins. And… clay? You think I’m missing clay? Honestly. Don't bother calling me if it's nothing serious. I got work to do. .
