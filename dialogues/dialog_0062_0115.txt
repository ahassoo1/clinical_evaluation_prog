DOCTOR: Hi Annelle, welcome to the clinic. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s my liver, I believe. Or something with my liver. It’s… yellowing, you see. Quite yellow. And I… I just wanted to get it checked. It's been… a while, honestly. A long while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Yellowing, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. The skin… and the whites of my eyes. It’s not… comfortable to look at. I don’t recall exactly when it started, though. Perhaps a few weeks? Months, even. Time… it slips away, doesn’t it? It’s… related to something the other doctor mentioned, about… hepatitis, I think? Or something similar. I truly don’t remember the specifics.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to months of yellowing of the skin and eyes, and a past mention of something like hepatitis. That's helpful. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Symptoms… Let me see. I’ve been… rather tired lately. More so than usual, I suppose. And… my appetite isn’t what it used to be. Everything tastes… bland. And… well, there's been some discomfort. A sort of… ache, under my ribs, on the right side. It comes and goes. But honestly, Doctor, I can’t be certain if that’s… new. It’s hard to say. I’ve had… aches and pains for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, decreased appetite, and a right-sided abdominal ache. Let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That… that’s a difficult question. I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I had something… with my gallbladder, I believe, quite a long time ago. They… removed it, I think? And… there was something else, years and years back. Something with my… blood pressure, perhaps? It’s all rather… hazy, Doctor. I’m terribly sorry. I don’t keep good records, and my memory… isn't what it once was. I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Annelle. It's perfectly okay. We can work with what you remember. So, gallbladder removal in the past and possibly some issues with blood pressure. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. Just the gallbladder. I was quite young, then. And… they didn’t make as much fuss about things back then. Everything was… simpler, I suppose. No, just the one surgery. Unless… unless there was something else… Oh, dear. This is terribly frustrating. I apologize. I really do. I wish I could recall more details. Are you certain you don’t have any records? Perhaps from a previous doctor?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Annelle. It's understandable. We'll do our best with what we have. Let's switch gears for a moment. Do you have any family history of liver problems, like hepatitis, cirrhosis, or liver cancer?
PATIENT: Family… yes. My brother… he was very ill, a long time ago. Something with his liver. They said… hepatitis, I think. He wasn’t… he wasn’t well. He passed away… many years ago. And my mother… she had stomach problems. Constant stomach problems. I don’t know if it was related to the liver… but she wasn’t a healthy woman. That's all I recall, truthfully. It was… a long time ago. A very long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a brother with hepatitis and a mother with stomach problems. Thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social… oh. Well, I've lived alone for many years. Never married. I... I used to enjoy gardening, and reading. But lately, I haven't had much energy for either. I don't… socialize much these days. Mostly just stay home. And… I haven’t traveled in a very long time. I suppose that's all there is to it. A rather quiet life. I don't… drink alcohol, if that's what you were asking. Never have.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the alcohol. And a quiet life, that's perfectly alright. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've taken various medications over the years, and I haven’t had any… severe reactions. I've had some mild itching with certain antibiotics, perhaps, but nothing serious. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital. No food allergies, as far as I know. I… I truly believe I’m rather unremarkable, Doctor. No allergies to speak of. Though, it’s possible I'm forgetting something. It wouldn’t be the first time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. No known allergies. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes. If you think it’s necessary. I suppose it's alright. Though, I… I don’t particularly enjoy being poked and prodded, Doctor. But if it will help determine what's wrong with my liver, then… yes. Go ahead. But please be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, pulse is 78 and regular, and temperature is normal at 98.6°F. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear. Now I'll examine your abdomen. Hmm. It's a little tender here, on the right side, under your ribs. Your liver feels slightly enlarged, and there’s some tenderness when I press on it. Your bowel sounds are normal. Finally, I’ll check for any swelling in your legs and feet. No swelling present. Based on the exam, your liver does appear enlarged and tender. The yellowing of your skin and eyes, along with the fatigue and decreased appetite, are also concerning. Given your history of a possible hepatitis exposure and your family history, I suspect we’re dealing with a liver issue. However, we need to run some tests to confirm this and determine the exact cause. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a liver function panel, a complete blood count, and a hepatitis panel. We'll also need to do a test to rule out any other possible causes of liver problems. Would you be able to provide a urine sample as well?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, I suppose that's to be expected. All those needles… oh dear. But if it will help, then I will do it. A urine sample… yes, I can manage that. I just… I worry, Doctor. What if it’s something serious? What if… I don’t want to be a bother. But I understand. Tests are necessary. Please… just tell me what I need to do, and I will try my best. I… I truly appreciate your help. And… thank you for being gentle. It means a lot. So, blood tests and a urine sample… and then what? Will I need to come back? How long will it take to get the results? I apologize for asking so many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly normal to have questions, and I’m happy to answer them. Yes, you’ll need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are back, usually within a week or so. We’ll discuss the results and determine the best course of action. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of how well your liver is functioning, and the hepatitis panel will help us determine if there's any evidence of a past or present infection. For the urine sample, the nurse will provide you with a cup and instructions on how to collect it. It's important to try and collect a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. As for waiting for the results, I know it can be stressful, but try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this together. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. Avoid alcohol and any unnecessary medications. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else I’ve mentioned?
PATIENT: Avoiding medications… yes, I can do that. Hydrated… rest… all right. I can manage that as well. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. I think… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… I wish I knew what to expect. But I suppose that’s the nature of things, isn’t it? You do what you can, and then you wait. Yes. Just… let me know as soon as you have the results, please. I would… appreciate that very much. And… thank you again. For everything. I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. I will certainly let you know as soon as the results are back. The nurse will be in shortly to collect your urine sample and go over some post-exam instructions with you. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself. .
