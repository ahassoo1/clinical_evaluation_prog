DOCTOR: Hi Amy, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Chriselda. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen, and it’s been… concerning me a bit. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand wanting to get that checked out. “Concerning” is a good way to put it – it's always best to investigate something new. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe exactly. It feels like a firm ball, not exactly painful, more of a dull ache sometimes. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago, and it doesn't seem to be getting much smaller, if that makes sense. It’s just… there. I haven’t really noticed any other changes, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, a firm ball, dull ache occasionally, present for about a month, no significant change in size. That's helpful. Just to get a clearer picture, can you pinpoint exactly where in your lower abdomen you’re feeling this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… lower down, towards my right side, a bit below my belly button. Not right on my hip bone, but… in that general area. It's difficult to be precise, honestly. It's not huge, but I can definitely feel it when I press on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower right abdomen, below the belly button. I want to get a full picture here. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits – things like constipation, diarrhea, or noticing any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, nothing like that. My bowel movements have been… regular, as they usually are. No blood, no change in… consistency, nothing like that at all. I was a little worried about that, so I'm glad to say that hasn't been an issue.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s reassuring. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite, any unintentional weight loss, or any fever or chills?
PATIENT: No fever or chills, and my appetite is normal. I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. I actually feel like I've been eating more recently, if anything, just because I've been a little anxious about this lump. But no weight loss, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no changes in bowel habits, appetite, or weight, no fever or chills. Just the lump itself. Have you had any recent injuries or surgeries in that area?
PATIENT: No, no injuries or surgeries. I haven’t had anything done in that region, ever, as far as I recall. I lead a pretty quiet life, to be honest. Mostly just work, and… spending time with my wife. No accidents or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, just to cover all bases, can you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing major, thankfully. I have… mild high blood pressure, which my family doctor monitors. I take medication for that, and it’s usually well-controlled. Other than that… I haven't really had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything. Just the usual colds and flu, like anyone else. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild high blood pressure, managed with medication. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I do take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one. And… occasionally, if I’m feeling particularly stressed, I’ll take some chamomile tea to help me relax. But that’s it, really. No other prescription medications or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin, chamomile tea as needed. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything, and I haven’t had any issues with medications in the past. My wife always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just to be safe, but… no known allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer, particularly colon or abdominal cancers, in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother’s side of the family… my grandmother had some sort of stomach issue, but I’m not entirely sure what it was. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t have much information about it. No one specifically mentioned cancer, but there was a general illness. My father’s side… nothing that I’m aware of. No strong history of cancer, no. It’s a bit hazy, to be honest. We don't really talk about health issues much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit hazy on the family history, some vague illness on your mother's side, but no specific cancer history known. Let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. I used to drink a little bit of wine with dinner occasionally, but I stopped a few years ago. And definitely no recreational drugs. I lead a pretty quiet life, as I mentioned. Mostly just work and spending time with my wife. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good. Alright, Amy, thanks for providing all that information. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and feel for the lump we discussed. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment, and I want to get to the bottom of this, so whatever you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Great. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. It may be a little cool. Then, I'll gently feel around to locate the lump and assess its size, shape, and consistency. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable or painful. Okay, taking a listen now... bowel sounds are present in all four quadrants, which is good. Now, feeling around... I can feel a firm, slightly tender mass in your lower right abdomen, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. It feels somewhat fixed, meaning it doesn't move around a lot when I press on it. There’s no rebound tenderness, which is good, and no guarding. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… exactly where it is. And yes, I do feel a bit of discomfort when you press there. Not sharp pain, but… a dull ache, like I’ve been describing. It’s not unbearable, but I definitely notice it. It’s… reassuring, in a way, that you can feel it too. I was worried I was imagining things.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know it’s localized and you can feel it as well. That helps narrow things down. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities. It could be a muscle strain, a lipoma , or, less commonly, something else. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast. The CBC will help rule out any signs of infection or inflammation, and the CT scan will give us a detailed image of the area to see what's going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best. A CT scan and blood work… yes, please. I want to know what’s going on, so I’m happy to do whatever’s necessary. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the CT scan? And… about the contrast, is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. For the CT scan, you'll need to fast for at least four hours beforehand, and we'll ask you about any kidney problems before giving you the contrast. The contrast helps us get a clearer image, and it's generally very safe. However, it's important to let the technician know if you have any allergies, especially to iodine or shellfish. We'll review your medical history before proceeding to ensure it's safe for you. I’ll also give you a written set of instructions detailing the preparation process. I'm ordering those tests for you now. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood work, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the CT scan. It should be within the next few days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I appreciate it. I suppose I’ll just wait for the lab and radiology to contact me then.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy. You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. I'll be in touch as soon as I have the results of your tests. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
