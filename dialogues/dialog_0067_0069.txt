DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. PaguiO. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think? It’s about getting updated on my shots, you know, to stay healthy. Medicare said I needed to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly reasonable. Medicare does a good job reminding folks to stay current with their vaccinations. Let me pull up your record here… Ah, yes. I see a note regarding recommended vaccinations. To make sure I have everything accurate, can you tell me which vaccinations you’re specifically concerned about, or were you just advised to get generally updated?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t really know specifically. The letter just said “recommended vaccinations” and to schedule an appointment. I’m not good with remembering which ones I’ve had before, or which ones I need now. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe something that shows what I’ve already gotten?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s very common. We have your vaccination history right here in your electronic record. Let me see… Okay, it looks like your last tetanus booster was in 2017, so you’re due for one of those. You’ve also had your initial series of COVID vaccines, but haven’t received an updated booster since the bivalent boosters became available. And it looks like you're also due for the annual flu vaccine. Does that sound right, or is there anything else you were specifically told about?
PATIENT: Tetanus… 2017? Wow, that was a while ago. And I think I did get the first COVID shots when they first came out, but I haven’t gotten any since then, you’re right. Flu vaccine… yeah, I usually try to get that one every year. So, those three sound about right. Are those the ones you recommend for me today?
DOCTOR: Yes, based on your age and health history – and with it being August, we’re getting ready for flu season – those are the three I’d recommend today. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to vaccines or any of the components in them?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to a shot before, thankfully. I’m not allergic to anything that I know of, really. Is there anything specific I should be worried about? I'm just making sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Most reactions are mild – soreness at the injection site, maybe a low-grade fever for a day or two. But it’s always good to ask. Alright, and just to confirm, you’re currently taking any medications, or have any underlying health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no medications at all. And thankfully, I'm pretty healthy. A little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a while back, but it's usually okay if I watch my salt intake. That's about it, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Managing your salt intake is good. So, we’ll do the tetanus booster, the updated COVID booster, and the flu vaccine. I’ll give them all in your other arm to minimize discomfort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Other arm is fine. I’d rather not have them all in the same spot, you’re right. Let’s get it over with, I suppose! The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay. This might sting for a moment. There you go. One down. And now the COVID booster. Last one – the flu vaccine. All done. There we are. All three vaccinations administered. I’ll have you stay here for about 15 minutes just to make sure you don’t have any immediate reaction. Do you feel okay?
PATIENT: Hmm, a little pinch, but not too bad. Yeah, I feel alright. Just a little sore, I guess. Fifteen minutes is fine. Is there anything I should be looking out for, like if I start feeling really sick or something? Just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Some soreness is very normal, and it should improve within a day or two. As for things to watch out for, the most common side effects are mild – fever, fatigue, headache, muscle aches. Those usually start within a few hours and resolve within 24-48 hours. However, if you experience anything more severe – difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat, a high fever, or any allergic reaction – please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll also give you a printed record of your vaccinations today to keep with your other medical records. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate you being patient with me. I’m glad to have those shots done. I'll be sure to keep this safe with my other important papers.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. PaguiO. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to take it easy for the rest of the day, and stay hydrated. And if anything comes up, don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you too, Doctor. I will definitely keep that in mind. Thank you again, and have a good day!
