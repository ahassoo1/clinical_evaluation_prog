DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just…won’t quit. Been hacking up stuff for months now, and I’m just tired all the time. Seems like I get a sinus infection right after I finally start feeling better, too. It’s a whole thing.
DOCTOR: Months, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, I’d say…at least six months now. Maybe longer, honestly. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. And it feels worse in the mornings, usually. Like something’s draining down the back of my throat. Not fun, let me tell ya.
DOCTOR: And has anything, to your knowledge, specifically triggered these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Not really that I can tell. I work in a food processing plant, so there's dust and stuff, I guess. But I've been doing that job for years, and it hasn’t always been this bad. I don't know. I haven't been sick with anyone, if that makes sense. It just…started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this cough productive?
PATIENT: Productive? You mean…do I cough stuff up? Yeah, plenty. It’s…thick, usually. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes it’s…yellowish. Sorry, I don’t know the right words for it. Just…phlegm. Lots of it. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And have you noticed any blood in the phlegm?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve seen. No, definitely no blood. That would scare me pretty bad. Just…the usual gross stuff, you know? Not a whole lot of anything else.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the cough and the congestion, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. I’m just…always tired. Like, really tired. Even after a full night’s sleep. And sometimes I get a little…short of breath. Not like, can’t breathe short of breath, but I get winded pretty easy. Climbing stairs is getting harder, that’s for sure. And…my head hurts sometimes. Dull aches, mostly around my sinuses. It’s a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Are you currently experiencing a fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or sweats. I haven’t felt hot or anything like that. Just…tired and achy. Like I’ve got a bad cold that won’t go away. Not the worst I’ve had, but definitely the longest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Uh…not much, really. I had the flu a couple times when I was a kid, but nothing serious. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I've got a little bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but I take a pill for that every day. Got a bracelet for it, actually. Other than that…pretty healthy, always been that way. Mostly. Until this cough.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take something over the counter for the congestion, like a decongestant. But it doesn't really help much. Just dries me out, mostly. I try not to take too much, though. Don’t like loading up on pills.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. No bee stings, no rashes, nothing like that. I eat pretty much anything, honestly. And I’ve lived around here my whole life, so I’m used to the dust and pollen and everything else. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pithan. I'm going to perform a physical exam now. Please remove your shirt and I'll listen to your lungs and heart. We'll also take a look at your sinuses and throat.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds good. I just…hope you can figure out what’s going on. It’s really getting me down.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound somewhat congested, with some wheezing in the lower lobes, bilaterally. Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated at 88 beats per minute. Tenderness noted upon palpation of the frontal and maxillary sinuses. Your throat appears mildly inflamed, but no visible exudate. Your blood pressure is 142/90, which is a little high today. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. I’m concerned about the persistent cough, the congestion, and the sinus tenderness. Given your symptoms and exam findings, it's possible you have a chronic bronchitis exacerbation, possibly with a secondary sinus infection. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a chest x-ray and a complete blood count. We'll also do a sputum culture to identify any potential bacterial infection. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work, huh? Sounds…serious. Will that tell you what’s causing it? I mean, I just want to know what’s wrong, and how to make it stop. And…how long will I have to wait for the results? I really just wanna get back to work.
DOCTOR: The x-ray will help us visualize your lungs and identify any signs of pneumonia, tumors, or other abnormalities. The complete blood count will assess for infection and inflammation. The sputum culture will identify the specific bacteria causing your infection, if any. As for how long it will take, the blood work should be back within 24-48 hours, and the sputum culture usually takes a few days. I’ll have the lab draw the blood now, and then we can get the sputum sample collected. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend that you rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. I’m also going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help open your airways, and a mucolytic to help thin the mucus. If your symptoms worsen, such as developing a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, inhaler and a pill to thin the mucus…and rest. I can do that, I guess. High fever, shortness of breath…got it. I understand. So…where do I go to get the blood drawn? And…what about the “sputum sample”? What do I have to do for that? This is a lot.
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The technician will handle the blood draw. As for the sputum sample, you will be given a sterile container. First thing in the morning, when you wake up and have a productive cough, cough deeply into the container to collect the mucus. Try to avoid any saliva – we need a pure sample of the lung secretions. The lab will provide specific instructions. The staff at the lab will guide you through the process. It's a simple procedure. Now, are there any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just…get the blood done, cough in a jar… I just want to feel better, Doctor. That’s all. Thanks for your help.
DOCTOR: Very well. The results will be sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Try to get some rest, Mr. Pithan. .
