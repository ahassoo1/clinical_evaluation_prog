DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good day to you too, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter… a notice, really, about needing certain… shots, I suppose you’d call them. It has to do with a family member coming to the United States. They need to have these things done before they can… well, before they can come here, legally. I’m hoping you can tell me what’s required. It’s a little confusing, all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, Karry, that makes sense. It sounds like you’re needing to fulfill some immigration-related vaccination requirements for a family member. That can be a bit complex. To make sure I give you the most accurate information, can you tell me a little bit more about your family member?
PATIENT: Certainly. My niece, Sarah, she's coming from… well, she’s been living in Mexico for the past few years. She was born here, in the States, actually, but she’s been away for quite a long time. She's 23 years old now, and she wants to come back and… well, start a life here. I’m helping her with all the paperwork and making sure she meets all the requirements. I just want to be sure we don’t miss anything. It's a big step for her.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, Sarah was born in the US, is 23, and has been living in Mexico. Since she was born here, the requirements will be a little different than if she wasn't a US citizen. Generally, for adults returning from Mexico, we focus on making sure they're up-to-date on routine vaccinations. Do you happen to know if Sarah has had a tetanus booster within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I honestly don't know, Doctor. It’s been a long time since she was a little girl, and we haven’t really talked about shots in… well, years. I think she had all her vaccinations as a child, but I don’t have any records, and I couldn't say for certain about a booster. Is that something we can check? Perhaps with her old medical records? Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we can definitely check. If you have access to any of her childhood medical records, that would be fantastic. Even if you don’t, we can proceed. We can give a tetanus booster regardless, it’s generally safe, and it's good to be current. Aside from tetanus, are you aware of any other vaccinations she might have missed?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so, Doctor. As I said, she was a healthy child and I’m fairly certain her mother… that’s my sister… kept up with everything. But again, that was a long time ago. I suppose it’s possible she needed something along the way that I just don’t recall. I'm just trying to do everything right for her. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Is there a list, perhaps, of the most common ones she’ll likely need? Just to give me an idea?
DOCTOR: I understand, it is a lot to keep track of. For adults returning from Mexico, generally we want to ensure they're up-to-date on routine vaccinations like measles, mumps, rubella , diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza. Depending on her travel history and activities, we might also consider varicella and hepatitis A and B. We'll also want to discuss COVID-19 boosters. To start, let’s do a quick review of her medical history. Have you or Sarah ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, neither of us have. I've been generally healthy my whole life, and my niece is the same. She’s a very active young woman. She’s always been strong and… well, she’s got good genes, I suppose! She’s never been seriously ill, and she doesn't take any medications regularly. No allergies either, as far as I know. I think her mother would have mentioned something if she did. I’m trying to recall everything… it’s just a little fuzzy after all these years.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very good to know. No chronic conditions, no medications, no allergies. Has she had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. She had her tonsils out when she was little, I believe… maybe around seven or eight years old? That was the only surgery she’s ever had, as far as I know. And she wasn’t in the hospital for anything else, not even for a broken bone. She was a bit of a tomboy, always climbing trees and running around, but she was lucky enough to avoid any serious injuries. Is that something we need to worry about? The tonsil removal, I mean?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Tonsil removal isn’t typically a concern for vaccination purposes. Alright, to be thorough, let's quickly go over her family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure when she got older, and my father had some trouble with his heart in his seventies, but that’s about it, as far as I know. My sister, Sarah’s mother, is perfectly healthy. And as far as I know, there's no history of cancer or autoimmune disorders on either side of the family. We're a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered. Though, my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had arthritis, I think. But that’s all I can really recall. Is there anything else I should be thinking about? It’s difficult to remember everything from so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. High blood pressure and heart issues in your father, arthritis in your grandmother, and your sister is healthy. That gives us a good baseline. Now, before we proceed with any vaccinations, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a sense of her overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you being so thorough. I want to make sure she’s healthy and ready for all of this. A physical exam is a good idea. Just let me know what you need me to do. I'm a bit out of shape these days, but I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, great. If you could just have a seat here, that would be perfect. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then, I’ll check your reflexes and do a basic neurological exam. It shouldn’t take too long. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. I always get a little nervous when they take my blood pressure. It tends to run a little high when I'm anxious. Hopefully, it's not too bad today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s common for blood pressure to be a little elevated in a clinical setting. Your blood pressure is 142/90. That’s slightly elevated, but not drastically so, given the circumstances. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths in and out for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. In… and out… in… and out… Is that alright? I used to smoke, years ago, but I quit a long time ago. It was a bad habit, I know. Hopefully, my lungs haven’t suffered too much damage.
DOCTOR: That’s good that you quit smoking. Your lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s a soft one, and doesn’t seem to be causing any problems at this time. Now, let's take a quick look at your ears, nose and throat. Please open your mouth and say "Ahhh".
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Ahhhh… I hope my teeth aren’t too bad. I haven’t been to the dentist in a while. I know, I know, I should really get that checked out. Everything feels alright, though. No sore throats or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good in your throat, no redness or swelling. Your ears also look clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms and legs. I’m going to tap on your tendons with this little hammer.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s alright. I’m a bit nervous about this, I’ve never had my reflexes checked before. Are you going to hit me hard?
DOCTOR: Don't worry, it won't hurt. It's just a gentle tap to see how your nervous system is responding. Okay, good response there. Now, let’s check the other side. Everything looks good. Now, let's do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Yes, I can see it. Up and down… left and right… It’s a bit tricky, but I think I’m following it okay. I used to have trouble with my vision when I was younger, but it’s gotten better over the years. I still need glasses for reading, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Your eye movements seem normal. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and orientation. Can you tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me think… It’s… 2025, isn’t it? August 2nd, 2025. I think so. I try to keep up with the date, but sometimes I get a little confused. I’m not as sharp as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. And do you know where we are right now?
PATIENT: Well, we're in the doctor’s office, aren't we? I believe this is Dr. Hernandez's office. And… I think we’re in… a city. It's a pretty big city. Not my hometown, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. And finally, can you tell me your full name and date of birth?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My name is Karry Skarbek, and my date of birth is… …April 12th, 1967. I think so. It's been a long time, and I don't always remember dates very well. My memory isn't what it used to be, but I’m fairly certain that’s correct.
DOCTOR: Okay, Karry. Based on the physical exam and your medical history, everything seems relatively stable. You have a slightly elevated blood pressure, and a soft heart murmur, but nothing that requires immediate attention. Your neurological function is also intact. Now, based on the immigration requirements for your niece, and her age, she’ll need to be up-to-date on routine vaccinations, including tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza. We should also consider a COVID-19 booster. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… manageable. Thank goodness. It's just a lot to keep track of. COVID-19 booster… yes, I’ve heard about those. I had the initial shots, back when they first came out, but I haven’t gotten any boosters yet. Is that something she absolutely needs? And… what about side effects? I've heard stories about people getting sick after the shots. I worry about her getting sick right before she comes here, you know? I just want her to have a smooth transition.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. A COVID-19 booster is highly recommended, especially given the current variants. It’s not absolutely mandatory, but it significantly reduces the risk of infection and severe illness. As for side effects, they are generally mild and short-lived. Most people experience some soreness at the injection site, fatigue, headache, or muscle aches. These symptoms usually resolve within a day or two. Serious side effects are very rare. We can discuss the risks and benefits in more detail, and ultimately the decision is yours and your niece’s. But I strongly recommend the booster. Now, before we proceed with the vaccinations, do you have any allergies to vaccines or any other medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't have any allergies to vaccines that I know of. I’ve always been able to tolerate vaccinations without any problems. And I don't take any medications regularly, as I mentioned before. My niece is the same, as far as I know. She's never had an allergic reaction to anything. So, you think she should get the booster… even with the possible side effects? I just worry about her being too sick to travel.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry. It's a valid concern. The risk of her getting significantly sick from the vaccine is low, and it's much lower than the risk of contracting COVID-19, especially with travel involved. We can schedule the vaccinations for a time that allows her a few days to recover before her travel date. That way, if she does experience any mild side effects, she’ll have time to feel better. We can also provide her with over-the-counter pain relievers to manage any discomfort. I think it’s the safest course of action, especially given the potential for exposure during travel. So, if you're comfortable with it, we can proceed with the vaccinations today. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well… alright, Doctor. If you think it's best… then yes, let’s proceed. I trust your judgment. I just want her to be safe and healthy. I suppose a few days of discomfort is better than risking getting sick. So, what do we need to do now? Do I need to fill out any forms? And how long will it take?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad we could come to a decision. Yes, there’s a short consent form for each vaccination that I need you to sign. It outlines the potential risks and benefits. It will only take a few minutes to fill out. The vaccinations themselves will be quick—just a few seconds each. Then, I’ll ask her to stay for about 15-20 minutes afterward so I can monitor her for any immediate reactions. Let me grab the forms, and then we can get started.
