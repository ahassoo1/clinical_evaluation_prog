DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Reyno. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good mornin'. It's… this cough. Been coughin' up stuff. Not just regular stuff, ya know? There’s… red in it. Blood, I think. Hurts to breathe sometimes too. I smoke, if that matters. Been smokin' a long time. I don't remember exactly how long, though. It’s just… been a while.
DOCTOR: Red in your sputum… and pain with breathing. Smoking history, significant, but imprecise. Alright. Let's get some details. When did this cough start?
PATIENT: Uh… start? Gosh. That's a hard one. Feels like… a few months, maybe? Or longer? I get these coughs sometimes. Winter is bad. But this one… this one's different. More… stuff comin’ up. And the red. I really don't remember when it started exactly. Sorry. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: A few months, with increasing severity. Okay. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I really cough hard. Or if I try to take a deep breath. It’s… a sharp pain, kinda. Not like a dull ache. More like… a poke. Does that make sense? It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. Just when I push myself, I guess.
DOCTOR: Sharp pain with coughing and deep inspiration. Alright. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Uh… other symptoms? Let me think… I get tired easier, maybe. But I always have been a little tired. I dunno if that's new. No fever, I don't think. And no… weight loss? I haven't really been checkin'. I eat when I'm hungry. Mostly. Hard to remember everything, ya know?
DOCTOR: Fatigue... and no fever or weight loss noted. You said you smoke, do you have any shortness of breath, other than with exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really. Not all the time. But… sometimes, walkin' up the hill to my place… gets a little tough. But I figured that was just the hill. And bein’… well, not as young as I used to be. I don't sit and think about breathin' unless it's botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Dyspnea on exertion… Alright. Now, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Other problems… gosh. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. That was a long time ago. And… maybe pneumonia once? But it was so long ago, I barely remember. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older. I got Medicare, so they keep track of stuff, I guess. I don't really pay attention to all that.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your records here… Appendixectomy in 1972… pneumonia in 1988. Any family history of lung problems – emphysema, bronchitis, lung cancer?
PATIENT: Lung problems… in my family? Hmm. My… my uncle, on my mom’s side, he smoked a lot. I think he got sick, some kind of lung trouble. But he lived far away, so I don't really know the details. And… that was a long time ago. No one else, not that I remember. We didn't really talk about that kinda stuff.
DOCTOR: Smoking history, family history of possible lung disease. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to nothin'. They gave me somethin' at the hospital when I had my appendix out, but I didn't feel nothin' bad. I don’t really take much in the way of medicine, though. Just… when I really need to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Reyno. I’m going to need to listen to your lungs and do a brief physical exam. Then we’ll talk about what further tests we may need. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just wanna get this cough figured out. It’s… worryin’ me some.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just take a deep breath in and out for me, please. Okay… and again… I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes, and a slight dullness to percussion on the left side. No wheezing or crackles that I can detect at this point. Is there any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that feels a little tender, right there. Not bad, but… yeah. I feel somethin' when you push. A little bit achy, kinda. Like a bruise, maybe? It’s been achin' off and on for a few days, I think. I didn’t really pay much attention to it.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation on the left lower lobe. Mr. Reyno, given your smoking history, the blood in your sputum, and these findings, I’m concerned about the possibility of something more serious going on. I need to order a chest X-ray, and I’d also like to get a sputum sample for analysis. We need to rule out infection, and assess for any masses or other abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Uh… X-ray? Sputum sample? Sounds… serious. I guess. If that’s what you think we need to do. I don't wanna ignore it, if it's somethin' bad. I just… don't like tests. But do what you gotta do, Doc.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will come in shortly to draw some blood and collect the sputum sample. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the next steps. I’m going to write an order for both, and also a referral to a pulmonologist, just to be on the safe side. It's always best to get a specialist’s opinion when dealing with potential lung issues. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Pulmonologist? Specialist? Sounds… expensive. I’m on Medicare, will that cover all this? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just wanna know what’s goin’ on, and get this cough fixed.
DOCTOR: Mr. Reyno, Medicare should cover these tests and the specialist referral, however, I cannot guarantee coverage. You will want to check with Medicare directly to confirm your benefits. As for the results, the X-ray typically takes a few hours, and the sputum analysis can take anywhere from 24 to 72 hours. We’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics, as a precaution. It’s important to start treatment if there is an infection present. I understand you’re concerned about costs and time, but it’s crucial we rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Uh… yeah, I understand. Antibiotics, okay. And check with Medicare. Sounds like a lot. But… okay. I guess I gotta do what ya say. Just… call me as soon as you know somethin', Doc. Don't want to be waitin' around too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The nurse will be in shortly to get the orders started, and she can answer any questions you have regarding the logistics. Here's a prescription for a seven-day course of azithromycin. Take as directed. And, as I said, we will call you as soon as the results are available. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… get this cough fixed. Thanks, Doc.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Have a good day, Mr. Reyno.
