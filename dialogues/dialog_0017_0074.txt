DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… the pressure. Been runnin’ high, the nurse said. Don't rightly know much about it, but it ain’t comfortable. I wanna get it sorted if I can, don't wanna slow down now.
DOCTOR: "Pressure," you say. And by that, you mean your blood pressure, as the nurse informed you?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s what she said. Blood pressure. Sounds scary, don’t it? Always been healthy as a horse, mostly. Just… older now, I guess. It’s been feelin’ a bit tight in the head, mostly. And kinda tired, but who ain’t tired at my age?
DOCTOR: Well, “healthy as a horse” doesn’t preclude the inevitable, Ms. Steines. Let's get a proper history. Now, how long have you been noticing this “tightness” in your head?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not long, really. Maybe a month or so? Hard to say exactly. I been busy with the bakery, lots of orders for pies lately. Makes it hard to remember what day it is, let alone when my head started feelin’ funny.
DOCTOR: A month. Right. And is this tightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I think. Worse when I'm on my feet all day, bakin' and such. And if I get to stressin’ about an order. Old Man Hemlock wanted a blueberry pie for his birthday, complicated design, near drove me to distraction. But mostly it just… comes and goes. Not every day, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And you mentioned fatigue. Is that a new symptom as well, or have you generally been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Well, I'm ninety years old, Doctor. Tired's kinda my default setting these days. But it’s maybe more tired lately, if that makes sense. Like… after a long day I'm just wiped out. Used to bounce back quicker, I reckon. Not like I’m runnin’ marathons or anything, but I like to keep busy. The bakery keeps me goin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, when I'm liftin’ heavy bags of flour. But that could be the stairs, too. Got a lot of stairs up to the bakery. And… no dizziness, no blurry vision, no headaches, nothin’ like that. Just the tight head and the tiredness. And the high pressure, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had much call for medicine, thankfully. Used to rely on good ol' Cherokee remedies, mostly. Herbs and teas and things. But when the nurse checked my pressure, she didn't mention nothin’ about allergies, either. I’m pretty sure I’m okay on that front.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just vitamins, sometimes. But mostly just try to eat right. And sleep enough… when I can. Don't take nothin’ regular. I've always been a bit leery of pills, if you don't mind me sayin’ so.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothin’ major, no. Had the flu a few times, broke my arm when I was a little girl, fallin' out of a tree. The doctor patched me up fine. My husband, bless his soul, he had a touch of diabetes later in life, but I didn’t catch it. Other than that… mostly just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old. I've been lucky, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never had need for cuttin'. My mama always said, "If you stay outta trouble, you won't need a doctor’s knife." And I mostly did. I ain’t one for takin’ risks. Just the bakery, mostly. And maybe a little gardenin’. Nothing dangerous.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Now that’s a long story. My mama lived to be ninety-five, strong Cherokee woman. Papa… not so much. He went early, workin’ in the coal mines. Lots of heart trouble on his side, I remember. My siblings, most of ‘em lived long lives, but there was some… high blood pressure in the family, yes. An aunt, I think. And a cousin. It runs in the family, I guess. That's why I’m here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. And finally, your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! I’m a baker, Doctor, not a… a wild woman! Never touched a drop of alcohol in my life. And smokin’? My mama would haunt me! Just strong tea, and the occasional sweet treat. That's my vice, I suppose. And keepin' busy. That's all.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s get to the examination. Please step onto the scale, Ms. Steines. I need to get a baseline weight. And then we'll take your blood pressure again to confirm the nurse's reading.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I got pies to bake, you know. People are countin’ on me.
DOCTOR: 85 kilograms. And your height is… 1.9 meters, according to the chart. A little underweight, frankly. Now, please have a seat. Let me listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Underweight? Now that's a new one. Been bakin' all my life, you'd think I'd be a bit heavier! Go ahead, Doctor. I’ll just lay still. Get it over with, please. I got a rhubarb pie needin’ attention.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… regular, but slightly weak. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though there's a mild decrease in breath sounds at the bases. No wheezing or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 160 over 95. Confirmed. Elevated. Well, Ms. Steines, it appears you do have hypertension. And a slight decrease in cardiac output. It’s not a crisis, but it needs to be addressed.
PATIENT: Hypertension, huh? Fancy words. So… what does that mean, Doctor? And what do we do about it? I can’t be havin’ a weak heart, not with everything I got goin' on. Pies don’t bake themselves, you know. Is it somethin’ serious? Will I have to give up bakin’?
DOCTOR: It means your blood pressure is consistently too high, putting strain on your heart and blood vessels. It's not immediately life-threatening, but left untreated, it can lead to stroke, heart failure, kidney problems… a whole host of issues. As for bakin', that's… complicated. We need to get this under control. Frankly, your weight is a concern, and your activity level is… less than ideal. We'll start with lifestyle modifications. Diet, exercise, stress reduction. And potentially medication. I'm going to prescribe a low-dose thiazide diuretic. It'll help your body get rid of excess fluid. And I want you to reduce your sodium intake dramatically. No processed foods, no canned soups, no… well, just eat healthier. And I want to see you back in one month for a follow-up blood pressure check. If it’s not improving, we’ll consider a stronger medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Sodium… diuretic… Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. You’re talkin’ a whole different language again. I bake pies, I don’t read medical journals! No processed foods? What can I eat? And what about the stress? Old Man Hemlock is always complainin’ about his crusts! This sounds like a whole lot of work, Doctor. And I’m an old woman. I just wanted somethin’ to lower the pressure, not change my whole life. Is there nothin’ else? Some kind of tea, maybe? Or a herbal remedy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Steines, with all due respect, I am a medical doctor, not a herbalist. You are welcome to explore alternative therapies, but I cannot endorse them. I am prescribing evidence-based treatment. And frankly, your age is precisely why we need to take this seriously. The risk of complications is higher. I understand your concerns, but your lifestyle is contributing to this problem. You need to make changes. The diuretic will help, but it’s not a magic bullet. And as for Old Man Hemlock… well, perhaps you should politely inform him that his crust preferences are contributing to your stress. Here's a list of low-sodium foods. Follow it. And schedule a follow-up appointment. I haven't got all day to discuss your pie-baking woes. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I understand. I just… thank you, Doctor. I'll… I'll try my best.
