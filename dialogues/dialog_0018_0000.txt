DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's...fine, I suppose. Though I have to say, this place is a bit out of the way, isn't it? But anyway, I came because my legs…they just feel weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a really nasty cold. It’s not like a gradual thing, it just…happened. Both of them, at the same time. It's quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be concerning when weakness appears so suddenly. And yes, the location is rural, but we strive to provide accessible care to our community. Could you describe the weakness in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, it's very concerning. I lead tours, you know. People depend on me. And I'm not one to just sit around. It’s…hard to explain. It’s not like I can't move them, exactly. It’s more like…they feel heavy? And it takes effort to lift them, to walk. Like I'm wading through water. Both legs are the same, thankfully. It wouldn't do to be lopsided. Honestly, it's just…limiting. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I completely understand. “Heavy” and requiring extra effort – that's a helpful description. And it’s good to know it’s affecting both legs equally. That does help narrow down potential causes. You mentioned this started a few days after a cold. Were there any other symptoms with the cold – fever, cough, sore throat, body aches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the usual. A terrible cough, that kept me up at night. And a sore throat, of course. A bit of a fever, but nothing major. Mostly just felt completely wiped out. Achy, you know? Like I'd been run over by a truck. It lasted about a week, I think. Then, just as I was starting to feel better, my legs decided to give out on me. It's all very…disruptive. Honestly, I don’t understand why everything has to be so complicated.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a fairly typical viral illness, but we certainly need to investigate why the weakness followed. And I understand your frustration – it's never convenient when illness disrupts our lives. Now, aside from the weakness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well…let me think. No, not really. My hands are fine. I haven't had any trouble with…well, anything else. I haven’t fallen, if that’s what you're asking. And my back doesn't hurt. I haven't been sick to my stomach. It’s just the legs, really. Though, now that you mention it, I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, even before the legs started acting up. But that's probably just…life, you know? I'm not a young woman anymore.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you haven’t had any falls, and that the symptoms are primarily focused in your legs. And it's wise to mention the fatigue, even if you feel it’s related to age. We’ll take everything into consideration. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it's usually well-controlled with medication. And I had my gallbladder removed years ago, but that’s not a problem anymore. Otherwise, I'm fairly healthy, considering. I used to be very active, but with the tours, it's not quite the same sort of exercise. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, if that’s what you mean. Nothing that required a hospital stay, anyway. I'm on Medicare, of course. Does that tell you everything you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. It’s good to know your blood pressure is generally well-controlled. And the gallbladder removal is noted. I see your Medicare information as well. Now, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. That's for the blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin, because everyone says you should. Honestly, I can’t remember the exact dosage. It's just a standard one, you know? Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if I’m feeling particularly achy, I’ll take an ibuprofen. But that’s only when I really need it. I don’t take anything regularly besides the Lisinopril and the multivitamin. Is that enough information? I really don’t like taking pills, so I keep it to a minimum.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know, thank you. Keeping a minimal medication list is always good. And thank you for clarifying the ibuprofen – it’s helpful to know you only use it as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to be a bit worried about shellfish, but I've eaten it plenty of times with no problems. I’m not particularly fond of shellfish, but that's just a matter of taste, not an allergy. I've never had a rash, or trouble breathing, or anything like that. I’m fairly robust, you know? I’ve always been able to eat whatever I wanted without any issues. Unless you count spicy food, but that’s just…uncomfortable, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies is helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Do any of your close family members have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. My mother had diabetes, Type 2, I believe. She was diagnosed when she was fairly old, though. And my father had heart trouble, but he also smoked a pack a day for fifty years, so…it's hard to say what was cause and effect. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He doesn’t talk to me much, so I don’t always hear about his ailments. But overall, we’re a fairly healthy family, you know? Nothing too serious. My grandmother lived to be ninety, so good genes are definitely a factor. Is that what you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know. Diabetes and heart trouble are important to note, and good to hear about your grandmother's longevity. Now, to get a better understanding of your current situation, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do. Though I do hope it won’t take too long. I have a tour scheduled for this afternoon, you see. But go ahead, I suppose. Just be gentle, please. I'm not as young as I used to be. What exactly are you going to do? I’m always a bit nervous about doctors poking around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concern, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. It won’t take long, I promise. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs. Finally, I'll check your feet for any signs of swelling or numbness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That…sounds a bit extensive, actually. But I suppose it's necessary. Just try to be quick, please. And explain what you're doing as you go along, it always makes me feel better when I know what's happening. My blood pressure is usually fine, but you can check it if you like. Just…please don’t poke me too much. I have to say, doctors these days seem to enjoy poking people.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, and I promise I won’t poke excessively. I'll explain everything as I go, and we can take it at your pace. First, I’ll take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning given your recent cold. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s move on to the neurological exam of your legs. Do you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It’s a bit cold, actually. But I feel it. Is this going to take much longer? I have to get back to prepare for the tour, you know. It's a historical walking tour of the old town, and I have to make sure everything is in order. I can't just show up unprepared. And I really don't like being touched like this. It feels…invasive. But go ahead, I suppose. Just try to be quick about it. What are you looking for, exactly?
DOCTOR: I apologize if this feels invasive, and I will certainly try to be as quick and efficient as possible. I’m checking your reflexes and muscle strength to see if there's any weakness or nerve damage. Did you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I felt that! It made my leg jump. Honestly, it feels like you're deliberately trying to startle me. Is this normal? I've never had a doctor poke my knee like that before. What does that even mean? Is something wrong? Just tell me straight, please. I don’t like this guessing game. Is my leg broken? Is it something serious? You're making me very nervous. And I still have to prepare for my tour!
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize. I didn’t intend to make you uncomfortable or nervous, and I understand your frustration. Let me explain what I'm doing and what I've found so far. The knee jerk reflex is a standard neurological test – it assesses the function of the nerves in your leg. It’s normal for it to make your leg jump. Your reflex is present and normal on both sides. Now, I’ve also assessed your muscle strength, and you have full strength in both legs. There’s no significant weakness detected. However, I noticed some mild decreased sensation to light touch on the tops of your feet bilaterally. It’s subtle, but it’s present. Given your recent cold, the sudden onset of weakness, and the mild decreased sensation, I suspect this may be related to a post-viral neuropathy. This means the virus may have temporarily affected the nerves in your legs. This is not uncommon, and it often resolves on its own. However, to rule out other potential causes, I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and vitamin B12 level. I'd also recommend a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A post-viral…what now? And blood work? Honestly, it sounds terribly complicated. Is it serious? Will I have to take pills? And will this affect my tour? I really can't afford to be laid up in bed. This is all very disruptive. And vitamin B12? I eat a perfectly balanced diet, thank you very much. I don't need any vitamins. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you trying to figure out what’s wrong, but I’m a busy woman. I have a tour to run. Can’t you just give me something for it? Something to make the weakness go away? I don’t need all this…testing. This is all very unnecessary. Just tell me what I need to do to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and I want to reassure you that I'm not suggesting anything unnecessarily. I appreciate that you're a busy woman and have a tour to run. I agree that extensive testing isn't ideal, but these blood tests will help rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and ensure we're addressing the correct problem. Unfortunately, I can’t prescribe anything without knowing the underlying cause. Simply masking the symptoms wouldn’t address the root issue. The blood work will take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs as much as possible, staying well-hydrated, and avoiding any strenuous activity. If the weakness worsens or you develop any new symptoms, such as numbness, tingling, or pain, please contact me immediately. Would you like me to write you a note for your tour, explaining that you've been seen by a doctor and are currently under evaluation?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, I suppose. But just the basics, please. I don’t want a lot of complicated tests. And a note for the tour would be helpful, yes. Just something to explain why I might be moving a bit slower than usual. I don’t want to worry the tourists. But honestly, I still think this is all a bit much. I’ve never had to go through all this trouble just for a bit of weakness. So, can we get this over with, please? I have a schedule to keep. And I really need to prepare for the tour. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Just tell me where to go to get the blood work done, and let’s be finished with this.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your frustration, and I’ll make sure we get this process moving as quickly as possible. Here’s the lab requisition form. The lab is located just across the parking lot in the medical building. They accept Medicare, and you shouldn’t have any issues. This note explains your situation to the tour group. Once the results are back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased weakness, numbness, tingling, or pain – please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just…don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. And make sure your nurse actually calls me. I have a very busy schedule, you know. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I hope you’re right about this being nothing serious. I’ll be going now. And please, try to be quick.
