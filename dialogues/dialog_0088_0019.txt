DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Um… my wife and I… we are thinking about… maybe having a baby? We are… older now. I think. She wants to know if… if it is okay. I do not remember all the things the other doctor said long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a good question, and very responsible of both of you to consider. It is wonderful that you're thinking about this. And it's perfectly normal to not remember everything from past appointments. So, just to clarify, you and your wife are considering trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Trying… to have baby. My wife… she is very hopeful. I want to make her happy. But… is it safe? For her? And… for the baby, if we are lucky. I worry a little. I am… not so young anymore, and she is… a little older than me, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Carlotta. It’s wise to think about the potential risks, and we'll definitely discuss those. Age is a factor, both for you and your wife, and can impact things. First, let's talk about your wife. How old is she, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. She says… sixty-two? Maybe sixty-three? I am not so good with dates now. We do not talk about age so much. It is… not polite, maybe? But she feels good. Very strong, still. She works in garden. Very hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, sixty-two or sixty-three. Thank you. And you mentioned she feels strong, which is good. I do want to be upfront though – conceiving at that age carries higher risks. There's a higher chance of complications during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and chromosomal abnormalities in the baby. We'll need to be very thorough in our evaluation. And how about you, Mr. Carlotta?
PATIENT: Seventy… I think seventy years old. Maybe sixty-nine? I forget. It is… a long time ago. I still work. I make little models. Metal and plastic. Keeps my hands busy. I… I feel okay. Not strong like my wife, but okay. I hope I am healthy enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, seventy or sixty-nine. Thank you for being open with me. It's good that you're still working and keeping active. Given both of your ages, a comprehensive medical evaluation for both of you is essential before even considering trying to conceive. This will help us understand your overall health and identify any potential risks or concerns. Let’s start with you, Mr. Carlotta. Do you have any known medical conditions—things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or any other health issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor… a long time ago… he said my blood pressure was a little high. I took pills for it. For many years. I think I stopped taking them… a few years ago? Maybe five years? I do not remember exactly. I feel okay, though. No problems. And… no, no heart problems, I think. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, but you’ve been off of it for about five years. We’ll definitely need to check your current blood pressure today. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I broke my arm, when I was young. Playing football. A long time ago. And… uh… I had a small operation on my eye, maybe ten years ago? Something small. Nothing serious. Just… to help me see better. I still need glasses, but not so bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm in the past and a relatively minor eye surgery about ten years ago. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not like pills. I try to eat good food. My wife grows vegetables. We do not need many medicines. Just… sometimes a little pain reliever for my hands, when they ache from the work. But not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional pain reliever for your hands. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your family history. Has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—had any serious medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or genetic disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a hard question. My family… they lived far away. I did not see them much. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my father… he worked very hard. He had… aches and pains. But I do not know what kind of sickness he had. They did not have good doctors where he lived.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart issues on your mother's side and general aches and pains in your father. That gives us some information to work with. Now, before we move on, are there any allergies I should be aware of—to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had any problems with allergies. I can eat anything. And… I have never had a bad reaction to a medicine. I think. I try to stay away from medicine, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, I think we have a good start to your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam to check your blood pressure, heart rate, lungs, and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I want to make sure I am… healthy enough. For my wife. And… if we are lucky… for a baby.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit here comfortably, and I’ll take a reading. …Okay, that's 150 over 90. A little elevated, which isn't surprising given your history. We'll want to monitor that closely. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. We'll need to investigate that further. Now, let me just check your abdomen… Everything feels okay there. And finally, I’ll take a quick look at your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little slow, which is common at your age, but nothing concerning at the moment. Overall, Mr. Carlotta, you're in relatively good health for your age, but we have a few things to address—your elevated blood pressure and the slight crackling in your lungs. We’ll need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. Tests… to see what is wrong. I hope everything is okay. I want to be sure. For my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get those orders entered right away. The lab is just down the hall, and the X-ray technician is available this afternoon. They’ll let you know when they're ready for you. In the meantime, I’m going to need to ask about your wife’s medical history as well. Do you have any of her records available?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. We do not have records. We lived… far away. And… she did not go to doctors very often. She is strong woman. She takes care of herself. I know she has… some aches in her knees, sometimes. From the garden. But she is okay. Very strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formal medical records available, but some aches in her knees from gardening. That’s helpful to know. We'll need to get a thorough history directly from her as well. Since she hasn't seen a doctor recently, it would be best for her to have a full physical exam and blood work as well, just to get a baseline assessment. I'd like to schedule an appointment for her as soon as possible. How does next week look for her?
PATIENT: Next week… let me think. Monday is good, maybe? She does not like Tuesdays. She has… garden club meetings. Wednesday is good too. She is free then. She is always busy. Taking care of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Monday or Wednesday next week. Let’s go with Wednesday afternoon, then. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for her. While we wait for the lab results and her appointment, it's also important to discuss lifestyle factors. Do you and your wife smoke, drink alcohol, or have any particular dietary habits?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. We do not smoke. Never. My wife says it is bad for the garden. And… we do not drink much alcohol. Maybe a little wine… with dinner, sometimes. On Sundays. But not every Sunday. We eat… good food. From the garden. Vegetables mostly. And… fish. My wife likes fish.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and a healthy diet rich in vegetables and fish. That's excellent. Those are all very positive lifestyle factors. Alright, Mr. Carlotta, we’ve covered a lot today. To summarize, we’re going to run some tests on you, schedule a full physical exam for your wife, and review the results together. This will help us determine if conceiving a child is a safe option for both of you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is everything. You are very kind. And… you explain things very well. I trust you. I just… I hope everything is okay. For my wife. And… if we are lucky… for a baby. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I understand your concerns, and I’ll do everything I can to help you both make the best decision. We will take things one step at a time. The lab technician will come and get you when they are ready. Feel free to sit here and relax until then. If you have any questions or concerns that come up before our next appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
