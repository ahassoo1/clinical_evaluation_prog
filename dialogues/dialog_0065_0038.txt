DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It’s… rather difficult to explain, truthfully. I believe I need some paperwork regarding… what one does if they become unable to make decisions for themselves? I was told this office could help with that. It's about planning ahead, if you will. Though, my memory isn’t what it once was, so I don't recall exactly who recommended this, or all the details.
DOCTOR: Planning ahead is… prudent, I suppose. You’re referring to advance directives – a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. Though, frankly, at your age, I’d expect a sharper recall. Before we proceed with the paperwork, it’s my professional responsibility to understand why you feel the need for these documents at this time. Are you experiencing any specific health concerns that are prompting this, or is this purely preventative?
PATIENT: I… I don’t know if I have specific health concerns, Doctor. It's less a feeling and more… a sense of unease, I suppose. Things have been… blurry, recently. Not physically, mostly… internally. And, to be frank, my divorce was rather… final. There’s no family nearby to… assist, should anything happen. I simply want to be prepared. I apologize for being vague. It’s frustrating for me as well. Is that… acceptable? Would preventative paperwork still be possible?
DOCTOR: “Blurry” is… unhelpful, Ms. Buoniconti. We need specifics to properly assess anything. While it’s admirable you’re being proactive, I can’t simply fill out legal documents based on a “sense of unease.” It invalidates the purpose of these directives. Let's start with a basic review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your cognitive function?
PATIENT: I understand, Doctor. You are quite right to press for details. It’s just… difficult to pinpoint. Cognitive function… I… misplace things more often than I used to. Important things. I struggle with names, sometimes. Not constantly, but… frequently enough to be noticeable. And I find myself repeating questions, or forgetting what I was saying mid-sentence. It’s not debilitating, but… concerning. Especially given my profession. Precision is… vital. Do you require a more… technical explanation? I can attempt one, though I suspect it will be equally unhelpful.
DOCTOR: “Frequently enough to be noticeable” is still vague, Ms. Buoniconti. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: A timeframe… It’s been… worsening over the last six months, I believe. Perhaps a little longer. It began subtly, with just the occasional misplaced item or forgotten name. But recently, it's… increased in frequency. Within the last month, I’d say there have been several instances each week where I’ve felt… lost, for lack of a better term. And the repeating questions… that happens almost daily now. I apologize for the lack of precision. I truly am trying to recall accurately. It's… infuriating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And to clarify, this isn’t related to any recent stressful life events beyond the divorce?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. The divorce was stressful, naturally. But that was… finalized eight months ago. I’ve had time to adjust. There hasn’t been anything significant since then. No major illnesses, no changes in medication, no… physical trauma. I did travel to Mongolia briefly three months ago to visit some… distant relatives, but that was a relatively peaceful trip. Mostly just observing. I don’t believe that contributed to this. It’s… internal, I assure you. A nagging… unease, compounded by the memory lapses. Perhaps it’s simply anxiety manifesting itself? I am prone to overthinking, I admit.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to a brief physical exam, then. I want to assess your basic neurological function. It's standard procedure, Ms. Buoniconti, and will help me determine the next steps. We’ll start with some simple reflexes and coordination tests. Please follow my instructions as closely as possible. If you would, please sit here.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That seems… prudent. Please, do proceed. I shall endeavor to follow your instructions as precisely as I am able. Though I must warn you, my balance isn’t what it once was. A minor issue, typically, but… worth mentioning, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Please sit here, facing forward. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Relax your arms. Both reflexes are present and equal, but slightly diminished. Not alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Now, can you close your eyes and extend your arms?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I believe there’s a slight tremor, as you’ve observed. It’s more pronounced when I’m fatigued, or… anxious. I apologize if it interferes with your assessment. I am attempting to remain as still as possible. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? A particular… angle, or resistance? I am rather compliant, should you require me to perform a more… challenging maneuver.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I want you to follow my finger with your eyes, but don't move your head. There is slight nystagmus – involuntary eye movement – particularly when looking to the left. It's subtle, but present. Alright. Based on these preliminary findings, I recommend a few tests to rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms. A complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level, to start. I also think an MRI of the brain would be prudent, to assess for any structural abnormalities. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: MRI… of the brain? Is that… is that concerning, Doctor? I had not anticipated such… extensive testing. I understand you’re simply being thorough, of course. But the thought of… abnormalities is rather unsettling. Are we certain this is necessary? Could it not be… stress, or a vitamin deficiency, as you mentioned? I would prefer to exhaust all other possibilities before proceeding with such an… invasive procedure. And frankly, I'm not certain my insurance will cover that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Buoniconti, I understand your apprehension. However, dismissing these symptoms as “stress” without proper investigation would be irresponsible. Your symptoms – the memory lapses, the repeating questions, the diminished reflexes, the nystagmus – are concerning enough to warrant further evaluation. An MRI is the best way to rule out any structural issues – a tumor, stroke, or other abnormalities. It's not necessarily indicative of anything serious, but we need to know. Regarding insurance, I will have my staff verify your coverage and pre-authorize the procedure. We can also discuss alternative imaging options, though they may not be as informative. I strongly recommend proceeding with the blood tests at the very least. We can schedule those for tomorrow morning. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you believe it is… prudent, I suppose I have little choice. Blood tests tomorrow morning… Yes, that would be acceptable. But please, do keep me informed of any potential costs. My finances are… somewhat precarious at the moment. And regarding the MRI… can we postpone that until after the blood test results are available? Perhaps it will reveal a simple deficiency, and render the more… invasive procedure unnecessary. I apologize for being difficult. I simply… dislike uncertainty. It's a rather unprofessional trait, I admit, given my line of work. But I find it… unsettling.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Buoniconti. We can certainly postpone the MRI until after the blood test results. I understand your concerns about cost, and my staff will provide you with a detailed estimate before proceeding with any further testing. Alright. I’ve ordered the blood tests, and my staff will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and getting adequate rest. If your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience any sudden weakness, confusion, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for your… thoroughness, and your patience. I appreciate your willingness to postpone the more… invasive procedure until we have more information. And… thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It is… reassuring, to a degree. Though the uncertainty remains, naturally. I suppose… I will see you after the blood test results are available. .
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps. Have a good day. .
