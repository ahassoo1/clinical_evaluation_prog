DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhaugh, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been playing up a bit. And, um… dizziness. It comes and goes, you see. It's hard to explain exactly when. My daughter, Sela, she told me I really ought to get it checked. She worries, that one.
DOCTOR: “Playing up,” alright. And dizziness, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dizziness. Like the room is spinning, sometimes. Not all the time, thankfully. It’s just… sudden, you know? It comes on quickly, then goes away. It’s happened a couple of times now. And the hearing… it gets muffled, like someone’s stuffed cotton in my ears. It doesn't last long, but it's worrying. My husband… he used to get something similar, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, dizziness and muffled hearing. Sudden onset, comes and goes. And your husband had something similar… when was that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that was… a long time ago. Before he passed, of course. Years and years. I… I don’t really remember the specifics, Doctor. It was a while back. He went to a specialist, I think? But I wasn’t the one taking him to appointments, you see. His sister did most of that. I just… remember him complaining about it, and feeling unsteady.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, let’s focus on you for now. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Not that I can recall, no. I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem to happen after anything in particular. Sometimes I’m just sitting, reading, and then wham, everything spins. Or I'm walking, and suddenly it's like I'm on a boat! It's very unsettling. I don’t do anything particularly strenuous, you see. Just the usual things.
DOCTOR: “The usual things.” Alright. Any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really, Doctor. I eat pretty much the same as always. Fish, a lot of root vegetables, some fruits when they’re in season. Sela tries to get me to eat more greens, but… well, you know how it is. I've been trying to be better, though, I promise! No, nothing different with the food, no.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the dizziness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… off balance, even when I'm not actively dizzy. Just a little wobbly. And… sometimes a ringing in my ears. A high-pitched sound. It doesn’t bother me too much, really. It's just… there. And… oh! Now that you mention it, I’ve felt a little nauseous a couple of times when the dizziness hits. Not sick, sick, just… queasy.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay, we’re getting somewhere. Off-balance, ringing in the ears, nausea with the dizziness… Have you noticed any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I get my eyes checked regularly with the doctor at the health clinic. Everything seems alright, as far as I know. I wear glasses, you see, but the prescription hasn't changed recently. No blurry spots or anything like that. Just the usual needing to wear them to read small print!
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to take a look in your ears, and do a quick balance test. That's standard procedure when we’re dealing with dizziness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it’s going to be… uncomfortable. My ears are a little sensitive, you see. But do whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhaugh, if you’ll just sit here and lean back a bit. This won't take long. Hmm… slight cerumen impaction. Nothing major. A little redness, but no obvious signs of infection. Okay, I'm going to have you look straight ahead, then I’m going to quickly turn your head to the side… and lie back. This can sometimes trigger the dizziness. Just let me know what you feel.
PATIENT: Oh dear… quickly? It makes me a little nervous when things are quick, you see. Okay… I’m leaning back… straight ahead… just turning my head now… oh! Oh my… yes! There it is! The spinning… it’s started! Everything is going round and round…
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, easy now. Just breathe. Alright, I saw some nystagmus during the test. That's a key finding. It appears we’re dealing with Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo – BPPV. It’s a common inner ear problem. Not usually serious, but can be very disruptive.
PATIENT: BPPV? Oh dear… is that… bad? Will I need… surgery? My daughter will be so worried! And… what does that even mean? Inner ear… I don't understand… Is there anything I can do to make it stop?
DOCTOR: No, no surgery is not needed. It’s not “bad” in the sense of being a serious illness. It’s simply crystals in your inner ear that have become dislodged and are sending the wrong signals to your brain. Think of it like… a tiny speck of dust messing up a perfectly good machine. The good news is, it’s very treatable. There's a maneuver called the Epley maneuver that can often reposition those crystals and resolve the dizziness. We can do that here today, if you’d like. It involves a series of head positions, and it may take a couple of tries. It can sometimes cause a little nausea during the procedure, but it’s usually short-lived. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Crystals? In my ear? Oh dear… It all sounds very complicated. A maneuver… head positions… No, I don’t think I like the sound of that, Doctor. It sounds… unsettling. Would it be alright if I just… thought about it for a bit? Perhaps Sela could help me decide? She’s very good with these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. You can certainly think about it. However, delaying treatment won’t make it go away on its own, and it could recur. The Epley maneuver is the most effective treatment, and we can do it safely here in the clinic. If you prefer, I can give you a referral to an ENT specialist, but there will likely be a waiting period for an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sudden head movements, and being careful when lying down. And please, if the dizziness becomes severe or is accompanied by other symptoms like a headache, fever, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. I'll write you a referral, just in case. And I'll give you a handout explaining BPPV and the Epley maneuver, so you can discuss it with Sela. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. It's… a lot to take in. And thank you for the referral, just in case. I really appreciate it. Perhaps Sela and I can decide what's best. I really need to get home now, you see, before I forget where I parked the car!
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. Just remember what I said about seeking immediate medical attention if things worsen. And try to be careful. Here’s the referral and the handout. Have a good day, Ms. Mayhaugh. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye now… .
