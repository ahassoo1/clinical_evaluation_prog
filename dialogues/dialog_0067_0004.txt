DOCTOR: Good morning, Teah. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you as well. I’m here for my shots, just a routine check-up, really. Gotta keep everything up to date, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Teah. Keeping your vaccinations current is important. And a general check-up is always a good idea. To clarify, are you referring to your yearly flu and COVID boosters, or were you thinking of other vaccinations as well?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Honestly, I just kinda figured whatever you usually do. I haven’t really kept track. Flu and COVID sound right, I guess. Are those the ones I need at my age? I haven't gotten around to thinking too much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Teah. We can definitely figure out what’s recommended for you. Based on your age—you’re 53, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Fifty-three this year. Time flies, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. Okay, so for someone your age, the CDC recommends an annual flu vaccine and an updated COVID-19 vaccine. They also recommend a tetanus booster every ten years, so let’s check when you last had that one. Do you happen to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm... tetanus… let me think. I think I had one a long time ago, maybe when I was working on that building renovation with my husband, years back. But I honestly couldn't say for sure when. Probably more than ten years ago, though. My memory isn’t what it used to be!
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Teah. We can look it up in your records if we have any information from previous visits. Otherwise, it's safest to go ahead and get another booster today just to be sure. Before we do that, though, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I get a little achy sometimes, you know, getting older, but nothing a good night’s sleep doesn't fix. My husband always tells me I worry too much about things. He says I’m as strong as an ox! I don’t take any regular medicines, either. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Teah. No major medical conditions, and just ibuprofen as needed. And you mentioned you don’t take any regular medications. Any allergies to medications or anything else—foods, latex, insect stings?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. I help my husband with his bee keeping sometimes, and haven't had any trouble there either. I'm pretty sure I'm good, but I’ll let you know if anything comes to mind.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! When I was a little girl, I had my tonsils out. That was a long time ago, though, probably when I was six or seven. Other than that, no, not really. Nothing since then. A couple of overnight stays when I had my kids, but that was just for recovery, nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, and otherwise no significant surgical history. That's good to know. Now, a quick question about your family history. Are there any major medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or Alzheimer’s?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a tough one. My mom had some heart trouble when she got older, I think. And my grandpa, on my husband’s side, had diabetes. Other than that, not really. A lot of strong folks on both sides of the family, honestly. They all lived pretty long lives, mostly. It's hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Teah. It is hard to remember. Knowing about your mother’s heart trouble and your husband’s grandfather’s diabetes is helpful. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, definitely not! I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very rarely. And, well, I'm a pretty straight-laced person, never been into any of that other stuff. I get enough excitement just keeping up with my grandkids!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Teah. Very healthy lifestyle choices. Alright, before we proceed with the vaccinations, I’d like to quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure everything sounds good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment, Dr. Pfennig. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay, I am relaxed! I'm trying to think of happy thoughts... like my grandkids. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6, also normal. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Everything sounds good, Teah. Do you have any pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No pain at all, and no shortness of breath. I feel pretty good, actually. Just a little tired sometimes, but that’s to be expected, right? Glad everything sounds good, though! Now, about those shots... are they going to hurt badly? I’m not a fan of needles, if you couldn’t tell.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Teah. Needles aren’t anyone’s favorite! The discomfort is usually very brief, a quick pinch. We’ll do our best to minimize any pain. We'll be giving you the updated COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine today. And based on your history, I recommend a tetanus booster as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. If you think it’s best, then let’s get it over with. I trust your judgment. Just… be quick about it, if you could. Which one first?
DOCTOR: We’ll start with the COVID-19 vaccine. It’s given in the upper arm. I'll clean the area first, and then it will just be a quick injection. Try to relax your arm. Okay, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Ooh, that was a little pinch, but you were right, it was quick! Okay, what's next? I think my arm already feels a little sore. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal, Teah. Some soreness at the injection site is very common, and it should resolve within a day or two. You can apply a cool compress if you like. Now, let’s move on to the flu vaccine, same arm. This one is also just a quick pinch. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay… ready as I’ll ever be. Just… don’t sneak up on me. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: All done. That was the last one. There you go. Both arms are protected. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Well, my arm feels a little… tender. But I suppose it's better to be a little tender than to get sick! Honestly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Thank you for being quick about it, Dr. Pfennig. Now, do I need to stay here for a little while, or can I go? I have grandkids to see!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. I'm glad it wasn't too bad. And yes, it's best to stay here for about 15 minutes just to make sure you don’t have any immediate reaction. Very rarely, people experience a reaction, and we want to be able to monitor you just in case. After 15 minutes, you're free to go and enjoy your grandkids. We’ll just keep an eye on you for a little bit. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. You were very kind and patient with an old worrywart like me. I appreciate it. Fifteen minutes sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special, like ice my arm or anything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. No, just use your arm as you normally would, but avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the rest of the day. A cool compress can help with any soreness. I'll come back in about 15 minutes to check on you. In the meantime, feel free to relax. Do you have any questions before I step out?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m good. Thank you again, Dr. Pfennig. You’ve been wonderful. I'll just sit here and relax... and think about my grandkids!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Enjoy your thoughts, Teah. I’ll be back shortly.
