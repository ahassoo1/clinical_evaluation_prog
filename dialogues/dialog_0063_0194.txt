DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s a bit… fuzzy. Something with my ears, I think? And balance. It comes and goes, you see. My daughter, she said I really should come in, something about it running in the family. I don’t quite recall all the details, though. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: “Fuzzy,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes, very. Like… a wave washing over things. Then it’s gone. It’s not constant, thankfully. Mostly just… off and on. It’s hard to explain. It’s not painful, exactly, just… unsettling. And makes me feel a bit dizzy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Well, “unsettling” doesn't quite give me much to work with, does it?
PATIENT: I suppose not. It's… hard to describe feelings, isn't it? It feels like the room is swaying a little, sometimes. And my ears… they feel blocked, then open, then blocked again. It doesn't last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe? But it's happened a few times now, and my daughter, bless her heart, she worries. She said something about my father having similar problems. Though, to be honest, I don’t remember much about his… well, anything, really. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Your father… right. Well, family history is… sometimes useful. Let’s attempt to be more precise. When did these episodes begin?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. Honestly, I’m not sure. It’s been… months, I think? Perhaps longer? It started slowly, just feeling a bit off-balance now and then. I didn't think much of it at first, put it down to getting older, you know? But it’s been happening more frequently lately, and… well, that’s why I’m here, I suppose. I wish I could give you a more exact date, but my memory… it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Not what it used to be.” Yes, well. We will proceed as best we can. Are you experiencing any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, yes. Sounds seem… muffled, like someone’s put cotton in my ears. But it doesn’t happen every time I feel dizzy. And it usually goes away quickly, like the dizziness. It’s all very… intermittent. It's hard to tell if it's just the dizziness, or if my hearing is actually going. It's all mixed up, you see? I wouldn’t say it’s severe hearing loss, but… maybe a little quieter than usual, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Intermittent, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, very intermittent. Like a radio signal fading in and out. One minute I can hear perfectly fine, the next it's… dull. It’s not constant, Doctor, it comes and goes. It’s always connected to the dizziness, though. I don’t notice it when I’m feeling steady. It’s all very… unsettling, if you don’t mind me repeating myself. It makes it hard to follow conversations sometimes, especially if there’s a lot of background noise. But mostly, it’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's attempt a basic examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of it, if possible. I hope it’s nothing too serious. Honestly, I just want to be able to hear my grandchildren properly when they visit. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. I will need to examine your ears, and perhaps assess your balance. We won’t have all day, however.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I’ll do my best to cooperate, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright? My balance isn’t the greatest at the moment. And please, don’t rush me. It takes a bit longer these days to do… well, anything, really.
DOCTOR: Please, turn your head slightly. Now, open wide.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is this going to be… uncomfortable, Doctor? I’ve always been a bit sensitive about things going in my ears. I used to get terrible ear infections as a child. It’s probably nothing, but… just asking.
DOCTOR: The ear canal appears… slightly ceruminous. And the tympanic membrane… unremarkable. No visible perforations. Now, let's assess your balance. Please stand with your feet together, and close your eyes.
PATIENT: Oh dear. It’s a bit… wobbly, Doctor. I really don’t like closing my eyes. It makes me feel even more off-balance. Is this normal? Perhaps I should hold onto something? I'm trying, really I am, but… it’s not easy. Do you want me to open my eyes? It might be safer.
DOCTOR: Yes, open your eyes. Clearly, a more… comprehensive examination is required.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s much better. I knew I wasn't very good at balancing. It’s always been like that, really. Perhaps it’s just part of getting older? Or maybe it’s something more serious, as you said. I do wish I could be more helpful, but… I'm afraid I'm not much use at these things. Do you need me to do anything else? Just tell me, and I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: We will proceed with a Romberg test. Stand upright, feet together, and look straight ahead. Now, close your eyes again.
PATIENT: Oh dear, oh dear… I… I don’t feel very good, Doctor. This is making me quite dizzy. Perhaps we should stop? I really don't want to fall. It's not safe. Please, can we sit down?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, sit down immediately. We will take this slowly. It appears we have some degree of… postural instability. Now, tell me, have you experienced any falls recently?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Falls… well, not exactly falls, but a few near misses. Tripped over the rug a couple of times, stumbled in the garden… nothing serious, thankfully. My daughter keeps telling me to get rid of the rug, but I like it. It makes the room feel warmer. But yes, I’ve been a bit unsteady on my feet lately. It's getting worse, I think. It worries me, Doctor. It really does. I don’t want to end up breaking a hip, like my neighbor Mrs. Henderson. That’s what I’m afraid of.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your reported near misses and the instability observed, I believe a referral to a physical therapist for balance training is warranted. We also need to rule out any underlying vestibular issues. I will order an audiogram and a VNG test.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… and a physical therapist… It sounds like a lot, Doctor. Is it… serious? Will I have to spend a lot of time in hospital? I’m not very good with all these medical things, you see. And I don’t want to be a bother. I just want to be able to walk around safely, and hear my grandchildren properly. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Mayhugh, let's not be dramatic. These are precautionary measures. It does not necessarily indicate a serious underlying condition. The audiogram will assess your hearing, and the VNG test will evaluate your inner ear function. The physical therapist can provide exercises to improve your balance and coordination. It is a simple matter of ruling out potential causes and implementing appropriate interventions. I will print out the referral forms and a list of local physical therapists. You will need to schedule an appointment independently. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think… Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I used to get a rash from poison ivy as a child, but that was a long time ago. And I’m a bit sensitive to penicillin, but I haven’t taken that in years. Other than that, I don’t think so. I’m usually pretty good with medications. My daughter keeps a list of everything I take, though. She’s very organized, bless her heart. Perhaps she knows more than me. I really wish she was here with me today, she always knows what to say.
DOCTOR: Very well. These forms include the referrals for the audiologist and physical therapist, along with a list of medications you’re currently prescribed, as per your daughter’s records. Please review them carefully and schedule your appointments as soon as possible. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as severe dizziness, hearing loss, or vision changes, seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a lot of paperwork. I suppose not, Doctor, not at the moment. I’m still trying to process everything you’ve said. I’ll have my daughter look over these forms when I get home. She’s very good with these things. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to see me, even if I wasn’t very helpful. I just hope these tests don’t take too long. And I really hope it’s nothing too serious. I think that’s all, thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do try to schedule those appointments promptly. Goodbye, Mrs. Mayhugh.
