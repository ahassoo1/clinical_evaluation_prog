DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Ranjan, nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's about my bruising. It's been getting worse, even though I'm already on blood thinners. It's a bit worrying, to be honest. I take them regularly, like the doctor told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bruising that’s getting worse despite being on blood thinners is definitely something we need to look into. Just to clarify, when you say “worse,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, normally a little bump, you know, if I walk into something, it'd bruise a bit and go away in a week or so. Now? It's like... bigger bruises, and they last longer. Even little things I don’t even remember hitting, I’ll find a bruise the next day. And they're kinda... darker, I guess? I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Courtnye. That’s a really helpful description. Bigger, darker bruises that appear with minimal trauma and lasting longer… that does warrant a closer look. Let's get some more information. First, can you tell me what kind of blood thinner you're taking, and what dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. It's... Warfarin. Yeah, Warfarin. And the dosage... hold on a sec... It's 5 milligrams. I take one every evening.
DOCTOR: Okay, 5 milligrams of Warfarin daily. Good. And how long have you been on this dosage of Warfarin?
PATIENT: About... six months, I think. Maybe a little longer. The doctor put me on it after... well, after the blood clot in my leg. It was pretty bad, so they wanted to make sure I didn't get another one. Six months, yeah, that sounds right. I’ve been getting my blood tested regularly, like they told me to, to check the levels.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months on Warfarin after a blood clot in your leg – that’s important context. And you’ve been having regular blood tests to monitor your levels – excellent. Do you know what your most recent INR result was?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez... the numbers. I always forget those. I think it was... around 2.3? Yeah, 2.3, but honestly, I don't really pay attention to them. The nurse just tells me if it’s okay or not. It was okay when I was there last week, that’s all I know. Sorry, I'm not good with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Courtnye, that’s perfectly alright. A lot of people don’t remember those numbers. An INR of 2.3 is within the therapeutic range, so that’s good. Now, let's talk a bit more about the bruising itself. You mentioned it’s appearing with minimal trauma. Can you think of any specific injuries, even small ones, where you’ve noticed this worsening bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm... well, yesterday I was just carrying groceries, and I bumped my arm on the doorframe. Nothing hard, just a little tap. Usually it'd be a tiny bit of redness, maybe, but this time it's already a big purple bruise. And a few days ago, I was helping my nephew with his homework and he accidentally knocked into me, just playfully, and I got a bruise on my thigh. It’s weird, it’s like my skin is just... extra sensitive, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bruising even with very minor bumps, and it seems like you're noticing it more frequently. And you feel like your skin is extra sensitive. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Let me think… Um, not really. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, maybe? But I figured that was just because it's been so hot lately. And… oh! Now that you mention it, I’ve had a couple of nosebleeds recently. Nothing huge, just a little bit of dripping, but I don’t usually get those. That was maybe a week ago, and then another one a few days ago. Is that… related?
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and the recent nosebleeds are definitely things we need to consider. Nosebleeds can be related to bruising and issues with blood clotting. Now, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you had any other medical conditions besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: Um… Let me think. I have high blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And… I had my gallbladder removed a few years back, but that’s it, I think. Nothing else major. Oh! And I'm allergic to penicillin. Really bad reaction when I was a kid. I always tell doctors that, just in case. Does that answer your question? I'm trying to remember everything...
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Courtnye. High blood pressure, controlled with medication, gallbladder removal, and a penicillin allergy. Good to know. And you've been telling doctors about the allergy – that’s important. What medications are you taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see... It's Lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. I've been on it for… a while now, maybe five years? Something like that. And, like I said, I take the Warfarin too. And sometimes, if my blood pressure gets really high, my doctor lets me take a little bit of… Amlodipine. Just when needed, though. Usually 5 milligrams. I don't take it very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril 20mg daily, Warfarin 5mg daily, and Amlodipine 5mg as needed. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, um... not much, really. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week? Nothing heavy. I'm not a big drinker. And I definitely don't drink every day. I try to stay healthy, you know? I try to eat good food and get some exercise, but it's hard sometimes. Especially with work.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional glass of wine – that’s good to know. And do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, and it was terrible, so I promised myself I never would. I hate the smell of it, too. It makes me cough just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. You've never smoked. Now, Courtnye, before I do a quick physical exam, let me ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had issues with bleeding or bruising easily?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she used to bruise really easily, but we just thought she was old, you know? And my uncle, he had a really bad nosebleed once, and it wouldn't stop, but I don't know if that was related. No one else that I can think of. It wasn’t something we really talked about much, to be honest. Is that helpful? I'm trying my best to remember…
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Courtnye, thank you. A history of easy bruising in your grandmother and a significant nosebleed in your uncle… those are things we should keep in mind. Okay, now I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and then I'd like to take a look at the areas where you've been bruising. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that’s fine. Just get it over with, please. I have a meeting this afternoon, and I’m already running late. I just want to know what’s going on and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're pressed for time. I'll be as quick as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but not dramatically so. Okay, I see the bruises you mentioned. They do appear more extensive than would be expected from minor trauma, and they are varying shades of purple and blue, which suggests they are at different stages of healing. I don't feel any lumps or bumps associated with them. Your skin feels normal to the touch, aside from the discoloration. Your abdomen is soft and not tender. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, the bruising, nosebleeds, and fatigue, along with your history of being on Warfarin, are concerning. It’s important we investigate this further to find out why you’re bruising so easily despite being on the medication. I want to order some blood work. We'll check a complete blood count to see if there are any issues with your blood cells, a coagulation panel to assess your clotting factors, and a liver function test, as the liver plays a role in clotting. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, that sounds… necessary. Just get it done quickly. I really need to get back to work. So, how long will that take? And will I get the results right away?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your urgency. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes. The lab usually takes about 24-48 hours to get the results back to us. Our office will call you as soon as we have them and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, I recommend avoiding any activities that could cause injury, and if you do get injured, apply ice immediately. Also, please avoid taking any over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as they can increase your risk of bleeding. Acetaminophen is okay for pain relief. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. No ibuprofen, just acetaminophen. Avoid getting hurt. Got it. And you'll call when the results are back? Okay. Just... please don't make me wait too long. I really appreciate you getting this sorted quickly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Courtnye. I understand your concern, and we'll do our best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Here’s a printed summary of what we discussed and the instructions for after the blood draw. If you experience any significant bleeding, such as prolonged nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your urine or stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… get it done, please. Thanks. .
