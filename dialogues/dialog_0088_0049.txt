DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I'm Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Nice to meet ya too. Hmm… what did bring me in… now that’s a good question. My niece, bless her heart, she said somethin’ about my ears. Said I wasn’t hearin’ so good. Truth be told, things do sound a bit muffled lately, but… I don’t rightly recall makin’ an appointment myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Sometimes family members help with these things. So, muffled hearing… and when did you first notice that, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh dear. Dates aren't my strong suit, never were. Let me think… it’s been… a while. Maybe… six months? A year? It came on slow-like, ya know? Not all at once. I used to be able to hear the birds chirpin’ clear as a bell. Now… well, now they just kinda… are. If that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Mr. Schneer. Gradual onset is common. And you mentioned the birds… are there any other sounds that you’re having trouble with?
PATIENT: Oh, plenty. The television, for one. My niece keeps turnin’ it up, and then she complains about it bein’ too loud! And people talkin’… I gotta ask ‘em to repeat themselves a lot. Especially when there’s… what do you call it… background noise? Like the radio or someone washin’ dishes. It just all… blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty hearing the TV, needing repetition, and trouble with background noise. Have you noticed it’s worse in certain situations, like a crowded room, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Crowded rooms… oh, yes! Terrible in crowded rooms. It’s like everyone’s mumblin’. I mostly just… smile and nod in those situations. Can’t make heads or tails of anything anyone’s sayin’. It’s easier just to avoid ‘em, if I’m bein’ honest. Even one-on-one, if folks don’t look right at me when they’re talkin’, it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, so worse in crowds and when you can’t see the person speaking. Have you ever experienced any ringing in your ears, or any pain or dizziness along with the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes. A sort of… high-pitched whine. Not all the time, and it doesn’t last long. Usually just for a few seconds. Never had any pain, though. And no dizziness, thank goodness. I get a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, but that's just my age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent ringing, no pain or dizziness, and you attribute some unsteadiness to age. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Medical history… now that’s a tough one. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time, ya know? Mostly just for the sniffles and aches and pains. Let me see… I think the doctor once said somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ a bit high, but I don’t recall much beyond that. I'm on Medicare, if that helps? Never been told I had anythin’ serious, nothin’ that needed constant lookin’ after.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare is helpful. High cholesterol is good to know. And no other major medical conditions that you're aware of. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, fallin’ off a bicycle. But that was… well, decades ago. Haven't been in the hospital for anything since, not that I remember. Mostly just stayed home and let things heal on their own. I was always a stubborn one, didn't like bein' told what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy and a broken wrist in the past. And no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that's another tricky one. My mother… she lived to be a good age, but she had… somethin' with her memory, toward the end. Not sure what they called it. And my father… he was a strong man, but he had trouble with his heart, I think. He used to get awful short of breath. And I had an aunt… bless her soul… she was deaf as a post when she got older. Could barely hear a thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of memory issues, heart trouble, and hearing loss. That’s helpful to know. Do you currently take any medications, or are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little pill for my water retention, the doctor gave it to me a while back. Can't recall the name of it, unfortunately. And allergic… hmm. No, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her baking, and we tried all sorts of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, one medication for water retention, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears, just to get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Just be gentle, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive. They've heard a lot of stories in their time!
DOCTOR: Certainly. Alright, Mr. Schneer, I’m just going to take a look… Okay. I see some wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The ear canals themselves look clear, but there’s a slight dullness to the eardrums. It's not dramatic, but it’s worth noting. I don’t see any signs of infection.
PATIENT: Wax buildup, you say? Well, I do spend a lot of time readin’. Maybe that stirs things up? A bit of dullness… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What does that mean, exactly? Is it somethin' serious? I get a bit worried, you know, when I hear medical words. I just want to be able to hear my niece when she comes to visit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schneer. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it could indicate some fluid or thickening in the middle ear. It’s quite common, especially with age. The wax is definitely contributing, and removing it will give us a better look. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to send you for a quick hearing test, called an audiogram. It's a simple, painless test that will measure how well you hear different sounds and at different frequencies. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A hearing test… sounds sensible. If it'll help figure things out, I'm all for it. Painless, you say? That's good. I’ve had enough aches and pains in my time. Where would I go for this test? And who would… well, who would do it? I don't drive anymore, you see, so I’d need someone to take me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s completely painless. You'll go to an audiologist – that’s a specialist who specializes in hearing. There’s a good one right here in the building, actually, on the third floor. Her name is Ms. Evelyn Reed. My nurse, Sarah, can set up an appointment for you, and we can discuss transportation options if needed. She’ll do the test, and then send the results back to me. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. We can explore options like wax removal, hearing aids, or other appropriate care. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… very organized. Ms. Evelyn Reed, on the third floor… and Sarah will help with the appointment. That's awfully kind of her. Wax removal… that sounds good. Maybe that's all it is. And hearing aids… well, I've always thought those were for very old people! But if it would help me hear my niece, I suppose I'd give it a try. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It’s important to remember that hearing aids are simply assistive devices, and they can significantly improve quality of life. There’s been a lot of advancements in technology, and they’re much more discreet and comfortable than they used to be. Okay, let me have Sarah come in and set up that appointment for you. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now. Just gettin’ rid of the wax sounds good, and seein’ what the test says. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, Doctor. And thank you again to Sarah for helpin' with the appointment. I'm a bit forgetful, you see, so that’s a big help. Maybe my niece will come with me, if she’s free.
DOCTOR: Of course. Sarah will make sure you have all the information you need, and we can certainly discuss having your niece accompany you to the appointment if you'd like. I'll let Sarah come in now. Is there anything else at all before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very patient with an old man like me. I’m always ramblin’ on about somethin’ or another. Just… thank you. It's nice to know someone is listenin’.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It's my job to listen, and I'm glad I could help. I’ll have Sarah come in now and get everything sorted for you. Have a good day, and we'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. .
