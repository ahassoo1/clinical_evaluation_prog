DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is... a check-up, I think. My son, he make appointment for me. I feel… okay, mostly. Just want to be sure everything is good. It has been a while since I see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, a general check-up. That's good preventative care. Your son was thoughtful to schedule that for you. It has been a little while, according to the records... hmm. Let's start with a bit more detail. When you say "mostly okay," are there any specific things you've been noticing, even if they're small?
PATIENT: Small things… yes. My back, it sometimes hurts. Not all the time, but when I bend down, or lift things. And I get… tired easier, I think. Maybe it is just age? I work with cars all day, you know. It is hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain with bending and lifting, and some increased fatigue. And you work with cars – physically demanding work, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, very demanding. I am mechanic. Been mechanic long time. My hands, they are not what they used to be either, but I manage. It is good work, I like it. But sometimes... it is hard.
DOCTOR: I can imagine. A mechanic is certainly a physical job. Let’s talk about the back pain a bit more. Where exactly is the pain located?
PATIENT: It is… lower back. Right here, mostly. Sometimes it go down my leg a little, but not always. It is worse after a long day at the shop, or if I try to lift something heavy without… thinking.
DOCTOR: Lower back pain, radiating down the leg sometimes, worse after a long day or lifting. Okay. And when it radiates down your leg, is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else?
PATIENT: It is… more like a ache, I think. Not sharp, like a needle. More like… heavy feeling. And it go away when I sit down, or when I take a rest. It is hard to explain. It is not bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: A dull ache radiating down the leg, relieved with rest. That's helpful, thank you. Now, let’s switch gears a little. You mentioned fatigue. Has that been a recent change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Maybe six months, maybe more. I just... get tired easier. I used to be able to work all day, and then still do things around the house. Now, I need to sit down more. And I sleep more, but I still feel tired. It is strange.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset of fatigue over the past six months, increased need for rest. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. I have been… a little more forgetful, maybe? Not big things, like forgetting my name, but… little things. Like where I put my glasses, or what I was going to buy at the store. It is probably just age, though. My son, he worry too much.
DOCTOR: A little more forgetful… little things, not major memory issues. Alright. Now, are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: My appetite… maybe a little less. I don't eat as much as I used to, but I still eat. And my weight… I do not know. I do not weigh myself. I am maybe a little thinner, but I do not pay much attention. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Possible slight decrease in appetite, unsure of weight changes. Okay. And how about any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no… sweats at night. Like you said, no weight loss that I know of. I do not feel sick, Doctor. I just feel… old, maybe? And tired. It is probably just age.
DOCTOR: Alright. That gives me a good starting point. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm. High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me many years ago, but I take pills for it. It is okay now, I think. The pills, they work. And… arthritis, maybe? My hands, they hurt sometimes, like you said. But I do not know if it is real arthritis. The doctor, he never said.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension, controlled with medication. Possible arthritis, unclear. Okay. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: No. Just the pills for blood pressure. And sometimes, I take something for pain in my hands, if they are very sore. But not every day. It is… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. I buy them at the store.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed for hand pain. Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My mother, she was allergic to bee stings, but I am not. I am lucky. Never had problem with allergies.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... Surgery… yes. My appendix, when I was young. And… I was in the hospital once, when I broke my arm, many years ago. Just a little break, nothing serious. But no other surgeries or hospital stays.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child, broken arm. Okay. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: My family… my mother, she had heart problems. She died when I was young. And my father… he had diabetes. He lost his leg because of it. My brother, he is healthy, as far as I know. But we do not see each other much. It is sad, but that is how it is.
DOCTOR: Maternal history of heart disease, paternal history of diabetes. Okay. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke, but he… he is gone now. I do not drink alcohol either. Just sometimes, a little glass of wine with dinner. And no… recreational drugs. Never. I am good girl. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Ms. Benites. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands and back. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just let me know if it will hurt. My back, it is a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright. It shouldn't hurt, but please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, let's check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Not drastically high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. And now, your hands... I see some swelling and mild tenderness in the joints, especially here and here. It could be early arthritis, as you suspected, but we may need some imaging to confirm. Finally, your lower back... there's some muscle tenderness, especially with movement. No signs of acute injury. Alright, Ms. Benites. That's a quick physical exam. Everything seems relatively stable, but there are a few things we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. So, what does that mean? My back, and my hands… do I need more pills? Or maybe… an x-ray? It is probably just old age, I think.
DOCTOR: It could very well be age-related changes, Ms. Benites. But to be sure, and to rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order some blood work and an x-ray of your lower back and hands. The blood work will help us check for inflammation and rule out other conditions. The x-ray will show us the condition of the bones and joints. As for pills, let's hold off on that for now. We want to see the results of the tests first. We'll discuss options after that. In the meantime, I recommend some gentle stretching exercises for your back and hands. I can provide you with a handout with some examples. Also, if you're experiencing significant pain, over-the-counter ibuprofen can help, as you've been doing. I'll get the lab order and x-ray requisition ready for you. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that is okay. Blood work, and x-ray… I can do that. Gentle stretching, yes, that sounds good. Ibuprofen, I know that one. How long will it take to get the results? And… will the x-ray hurt? I do not like x-rays.
DOCTOR: The x-ray itself doesn't hurt at all, Ms. Benites. It's just a quick imaging procedure. The technician will position you, take a few pictures, and that's it. As for the results, the lab work usually takes a couple of days, and the x-ray report typically comes back within a week. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they're available. Here are the lab order and x-ray requisition. The lab is located just down the street, and you can schedule the x-ray at the imaging center across from the hospital. Do you have any difficulty getting to these locations, or would you like me to help you schedule those?
PATIENT: No, I can manage. My son, he helps me with those things. He drives me everywhere. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. And… I appreciate you not giving me more pills right away. I do not like taking too many pills. They make me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We want to avoid unnecessary medications whenever possible. That’s why we’re starting with these tests. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as fever, chills, severe pain, or numbness in your legs – please don't hesitate to call the office. I'm scheduling your follow-up appointment now for two weeks from today. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that is fine. I will mark it on my calendar. My son, he will remind me. Thank you again, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel much better now, knowing what is going on. Or, at least, knowing what we are trying to find out. I think I will go home now and rest. And do some gentle stretching.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I'm glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, gentle stretching! It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: It was nice to meet you too, Doctor. Goodbye. .
