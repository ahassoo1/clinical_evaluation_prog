DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. It’s about my foot. It’s been…troubling me. A sore, really. A nasty one. And don’t think I haven’t tried things myself, mind you. I was a scientist, you know. Not one of those kinds, but a proper one. Still, it won’t heal.
DOCTOR: A sore on your foot that isn’t healing… Alright. And how long has this sore been troubling you, Louine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… well, since last November, I reckon. Right after Thanksgiving. Yes, November. It started small, barely noticeable, and I foolishly thought it would just go away. But it hasn’t. It's gotten worse, steadily. And it hurts.
DOCTOR: Since November… so about nine months now. And you said it's been getting worse steadily. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a sharp pain, not usually. It's more of a… a deep ache. Like a throbbing. And it’s worse when I’m on my feet, naturally. Standing, walking… even just shifting my weight. It makes me very cautious about getting around, you understand. I used to be quite active, but now… not so much. It also feels… warm. Not a fever warm, but… inflamed, I suppose. Though I don't appreciate you using fancy words with me.
DOCTOR: A deep ache, throbbing pain that’s worse with standing and walking, and it feels warm to the touch. I apologize for the medical jargon; I'll try to keep things simpler. Okay. Has anything specific caused this sore, as far as you know?
PATIENT: Hmph. Specific? No. Not that I’m aware of. I didn’t stub it, didn’t get it cut, didn’t get a splinter. I do have… what’s the word? The sugar sickness. Diabetes, that's it. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. The doctor said it makes it harder for things to heal. But I keep myself regular, you understand. I watch what I eat. Mostly. It’s just… frustrating. A scientist shouldn’t have a foot like this.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, alright. And you're right to be vigilant with your diet. That’s very good. So, this sore appeared without any injury. Okay. Now, have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm. Let me think. Yes, actually. A little. Not a lot, mind you. It’s… yellowish, sometimes a bit brownish. And it smells… unpleasant. I've been keeping it bandaged, of course, trying to keep things clean. But the bandage… well, it gets soiled. It’s not a pretty sight, I assure you. I try not to look at it too closely. It rather upsets my stomach.
DOCTOR: Yellowish-brownish drainage with an odor… that’s concerning. And you're keeping it bandaged, which is good. Okay, Louine, I'm going to take a look at your foot now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. But be gentle. And don’t expect me to enjoy it. I haven’t had a proper medical examination in… well, a long time. And I don't appreciate being poked and prodded unnecessarily. Just look at it and tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I just need to get a good look to understand what we’re dealing with. Okay, Louine, if you could just lift your foot onto the examination table for me when you’re ready. I’ll start by taking a look at the sore. Alright… I see a sore on the plantar surface of your foot, near the base of your fifth metatarsal. It’s approximately 2cm in diameter, with some surrounding redness and swelling. There is some yellowish-brown drainage present, and there is a distinct odor. The surrounding skin is warm to the touch, and there doesn't appear to be any cellulitis extending beyond the immediate area, but the wound is quite deep. There's a loss of sensation around the wound margins as well.
PATIENT: Hmph. “Loss of sensation,” you say? That doesn’t sound good at all. I knew it wasn’t just a simple sore. My husband had something similar, near the end. It got… awful. Is it… is it serious? Don’t beat around the bush with me, Doctor. Just tell me straight. And what are you going to do about it? I haven't got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Louine. The loss of sensation is a significant finding, especially given your history of diabetes. It suggests there may be nerve damage, which is common with prolonged high blood sugar. And the fact that it’s not healing, combined with the drainage and odor, is concerning for a potential infection, and potentially osteomyelitis – an infection of the bone. We need to determine the extent of the infection. I'm going to order some blood work to check your white blood cell count and blood sugar levels. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any bone involvement. And I'm going to take a swab of the wound to send to the lab for a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. This will help us choose the right antibiotic. In the meantime, we need to keep the wound clean and offload pressure from your foot. I’m going to have the nurse show you how to properly care for it at home, and I'll prescribe a course of oral antibiotics. If the infection is severe or doesn’t respond to antibiotics, you may need further intervention, potentially including hospitalization and, in rare cases, surgery.
PATIENT: Hmph. Surgery? Now you're just trying to frighten me. I don't like the sound of any of this. Blood work, X-rays, cultures… it’s all rather… dramatic. And a hospital? I haven’t been in a hospital in decades. Fine. Do your tests. But I want everything explained to me in plain English, understand? No fancy medical jargon. And I want a second opinion if this gets any worse. I trust my own judgment, you know. A scientist doesn't just blindly follow orders. And what about this… antibiotic? What are the side effects? I don't want to feel worse just to treat my foot. Honestly, it’s all rather upsetting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Louine. I completely understand your concerns. I will explain everything in plain English, and I will make sure you are comfortable with every step of the process. You are right to ask questions and advocate for yourself. I encourage it. The antibiotics I’m prescribing are Amoxicillin-clavulanate. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and stomach upset. Rarely, people can have an allergic reaction, so we’ll be monitoring you closely. If you experience any rash, difficulty breathing, or swelling, you need to seek immediate medical attention. The blood work and X-ray will give us a clearer picture of the infection and rule out any bone involvement. I'll be happy to discuss the results with you as soon as they’re available, and we can talk about a second opinion if needed. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Now, let's get the nurse in here to show you how to care for the wound. And I'll write up the orders for the blood work and X-ray. It's going to be alright, Louine. We’ll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Hmph. Very well. Just… hurry it up, will you? I have things to do. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I don’t want any unnecessary poking and prodding. This is all rather… inconvenient, you know. A scientist shouldn’t have to deal with foot problems.
DOCTOR: Of course, Louine. I'll let the nurse know to be gentle. We'll get everything taken care of as quickly as possible. .
