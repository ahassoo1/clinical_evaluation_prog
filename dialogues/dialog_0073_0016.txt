DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my bruising, really. I’ve been on this blood thinner for… well, a while now, since the heart thing. And lately, I’ve been bumping into things and getting these… sizable bruises. It’s not like I’m falling down stairs, you understand. Just… normal activity and wham, a big purple spot. It's a bit concerning, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Bruising with a history of blood thinner use… yes, that warrants investigation. You said “a while now” – could you give me a more specific timeframe for how long you’ve been on the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it’ll be five years this November, I suppose. Five years and three months, give or take a week. It was right after the… the incident, really. They put me on it immediately, to prevent another one. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to the dates. It’s just been… a long time.
DOCTOR: Five years and three months. And what type of blood thinner are you currently taking, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re asking a lot for a man who doesn’t keep track of dates, aren’t you? Let me see… the little orange pills. Warfarin, is it? Yes, I think it’s Warfarin. The pharmacy handles it, you see. I just… take them. I don't bother with memorizing names. It's all very… clinical, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Warfarin, alright. And are you consistent with taking it?
PATIENT: Consistent? Well, mostly. I mean, I try to be. It’s the same time every evening, with dinner. Sometimes… sometimes I forget, if I’m out. But I always take it as soon as I remember. It’s not like I skip days on end, Doctor. I’m not that irresponsible. It's just… life happens, you understand?
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say “forget,” how long typically passes before you remember to take it?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're really grilling me. It varies. Sometimes just a few hours, maybe until the next morning if I've had a particularly… lively evening. It's never been more than a day, I assure you. I'm not reckless, Doctor. I understand the importance of the medication. It’s just… well, I’m getting older. Things slip your mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Let’s move on. Aside from the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other symptoms… Hmm. Well, I've been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But that could be the heat. It’s been awfully warm, hasn’t it? And… now that you mention it, I’ve had a couple of nosebleeds. Nothing terrible, just a little trickle when I blow my nose. But they're new. Not something I usually get.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and new onset nosebleeds. Okay. And have you noticed any bleeding from other areas – gums, urine, stool?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Nothing like that. Just the nosebleeds, and they weren't exactly… gushing. More like a slight inconvenience, really. I don't go digging around to check, you understand. I’m not a doctor, I just notice things. And frankly, I’d rather not dwell on these unpleasant topics. It’s stressful enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent injuries, even minor ones, that you can recall?
PATIENT: Injuries? Well, I bumped my shin against the coffee table last week. But that’s hardly an injury, Doctor. Just a bit of a thud and a bruise, which brings me back to the original problem, doesn't it? I'm a reasonably careful man, but accidents happen. I'm not exactly a spring chicken anymore, you know? It’s just… frustrating, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at the bruising. We’ll also take a look at your gums and nose to see if there’s any obvious source of bleeding. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Get on with it. I haven’t got all day, you understand. Though I suppose I do now. Just… be gentle, alright? My skin isn’t what it used to be. And try not to poke too much. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 76, regular. Your gums appear slightly pale, and there’s a little bit of dried blood in your nasal passages, but nothing significant. I see several bruises on your arms and legs, varying in size and color – some appear relatively new, others older. The bruising feels… soft, not particularly firm. I’m also noting some petechiae on your lower legs. Do you know what those are?
PATIENT: Petechiae? Now you're using words I definitely don't know. Are those… serious? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious here. You’re finding all sorts of things I’ve never heard of. Is this blood thinner doing something terrible to me? I just wanted to know why I’m bruising, not get a lecture in medical jargon. Perhaps I should have stayed home.
DOCTOR: Petechiae are small, flat, red or purple spots on the skin, caused by broken blood vessels. They can be a sign of several things, and they aren’t necessarily cause for immediate panic. However, combined with the bruising, fatigue, and nosebleeds, it is concerning. We need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture. A complete blood count, a PT/INR to check how your blood is clotting, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help us determine if there’s a problem with your blood cells or your liver function. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite the ordeal. Is it something serious? You're not exactly reassuring me, you know. I mean, what are we looking for here? Am I… dying? Perhaps a second opinion is in order. I just want a simple explanation, not a battery of tests and ominous pronouncements. This is… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I understand your anxiety. I am not trying to alarm you. The tests are simply to gather more information. We need to rule out potential causes for your symptoms, such as a low platelet count, a vitamin deficiency, or a problem with your liver. These are all things that can be addressed. I am not prepared to give you a diagnosis at this time. That would be irresponsible. Let's get these blood tests done, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. If you would prefer a second opinion, I certainly won’t stand in your way, but I believe we are being thorough and proactive here. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. But I expect a clear explanation of the results, in plain English, you understand? None of this medical mumbo jumbo. And if it turns out to be nothing serious, I expect an apology for all this fuss. Honestly, I’ve wasted half the day already. Just… do the tests. .
