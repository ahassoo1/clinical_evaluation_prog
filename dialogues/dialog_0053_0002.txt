DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Doyle Pitmon, I'm one of the doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Pitmon. It’s… well, it’s my waterworks. They ain't been workin’ too good, you see. Hard to… push it out, if you know what I mean. It's been a bit of a bother.
DOCTOR: "Waterworks," alright. So, difficulty with urination… straining, perhaps?
PATIENT: Straining… yes, that’s a good word for it. Like… like tryin’ to squeeze water outta a dry sponge, kinda. Not a strong stream, neither. Just… dribbles, mostly. Been goin’ on for a while now, I reckon. Hard to say how long, my memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. And would you say it's a sudden change, or has it been a gradual worsening over time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I think. Not like it just stopped workin’ one day. It just… got harder and harder, little by little. My husband, he’s noticed it more than me, to be honest. He keeps tellin’ me I take too long in the bathroom. He’s a good man, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain with urination, or after you finish?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, no. More like… a little bit of a burnin’ sometimes. Not every time, just… sometimes. And it’s not a bad burnin’, more like a… discomfort, you see? It doesn't keep me up at night or anything. Mostly just when I'm tryin' to go.
DOCTOR: Discomfort, alright. Now, do you find yourself needing to go more often than usual, or just having trouble emptying your bladder fully when you do go?
PATIENT: Oh, I think I go about the same amount of times. It's just… gettin' it all out is the trouble. Like there’s always a little bit left in there, you know? And I gotta push a lot, like I said. It's just… not easy, that’s all. It's been botherin' me, but I didn't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions, and please just answer to the best of your ability. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. No, I don't think so. Not that I've seen. My eyesight ain’t the best these days, but I reckon I would've noticed somethin' like that, wouldn't I? No, no blood. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt hot or anything. No chills, neither. And my belly...no, it don’t hurt any more than usual for an old lady. I get a little achy sometimes, but that’s just my age, I reckon. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table, if you don’t mind. We’ll just check your abdomen and do a quick assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. An exam, you say? Yes, yes, that’s fine. Just tell me what you need me to do. My old bones aren’t as nimble as they used to be, but I can manage. Lead the way, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your back first, please. We’ll start with listening to your abdomen and then a gentle palpation. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. There we go. A bit creaky, this old body. Go ahead, Doctor. Just tell me if I need to do anything special. And, like you said, let me know if somethin' hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax, Ms. Stoffregen. Deep breaths. Hmm… abdomen is soft, no masses that I can feel. Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A little bit pokey, maybe, but that's probably just my age. You're pressin' a bit hard, but it doesn't hurt, if that makes sense. Just… feels like you're rummagin’ around in there. But no sharp pain or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. I’m just trying to assess for any tenderness. Any pain when I tap here, on your back?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s a bit ticklish! No pain, no. Just… a bit of a surprise. Feels… normal. My back’s always a bit achy, you know? From all the years of… well, livin’. But no special pain from your tappin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention, possibly due to age-related changes in the bladder muscles or a mild blockage. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a post-void residual volume test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests, you say? Well, I don’t like tests, but I suppose if you think it’s necessary… Alright. A urinalysis and a… post-void residual whatchamacallit. Yes, alright. Just tell me what I need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. As long as it gets to the bottom of this botherin' me. I just want to be able to go to the bathroom normally again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Stoffregen. We'll get this sorted out. For the urinalysis, you’ll just need to provide a urine sample. The nurse will give you a container and instructions. For the PVR, you’ll urinate as you normally would, and then we’ll use a handheld device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder immediately afterwards. It’s a quick, painless test. The nurse will assist you with both. While we wait for the results, I recommend you try double voiding - urinating, waiting a few moments, and then trying to urinate again. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Double voiding… hmm. That sounds… alright. Try to squeeze out a little extra, you mean? Yes, I can try that. I used to do that a little bit when I was younger, actually. Seems like you’re tellin’ me to do somethin’ I already know a little bit about. Alright, I'll give it a go. And the nurse will help with the… whatchamacallits? Good. I'm glad I’m not on my own with all this. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will guide you through everything. I’ll also have her schedule you a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results and determine the next steps. If you experience any fever, chills, severe abdominal pain, or inability to urinate at all, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A week… alright. No, I don’t think so. You explained everything so nicely. Just… the waitin’ is the hardest part, I reckon. But I trust you, Doctor. No, I think that’s all. Just thank you again for listenin’ to an old lady and takin’ my worries seriously. It means a lot. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I need to go find that nurse. And maybe have a little sit down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. The nurse is just outside the door. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you need anything at all. We'll get to the bottom of this.
