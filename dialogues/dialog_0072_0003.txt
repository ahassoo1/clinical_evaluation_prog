DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. I'm Dr. Hembrey. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, well, it’s about my hands. They…shake. It’s annoying, really. Been happening for a bit now. Not sure how long, to be honest. Everything feels like a blur these days. Just want it fixed, if that's possible. Don’t have time for this, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. A bit vague is alright, we can narrow it down. When you say “a bit now,” would you estimate weeks, months, or longer?
PATIENT: Months, I suppose. Maybe… six months? Though, honestly, time just slips away. It’s not like I’m keeping a calendar for when my hands started to tremble. Look, I've been a busy man my whole life. Producing, directing… important things. This shaking is just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right. Inconvenient. And is this shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I’m trying to do something… precise. Like, holding a fork, or… signing something. Though sometimes it just happens, you know? When I’m relaxing, even. It’s… unpredictable. Honestly, I just wish it would stop. It makes me look…weak.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything changed in the last six months that might coincide with the start of this?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed?” Everything changes! People get older, things happen… I lost my wife, bless her soul, a couple of years back. That was a big change. Don’t see how that would make my hands shake, though. I haven’t started any new medications, if that's what you’re asking. Just the usual stuff for an old man, you know?
DOCTOR: The loss of your wife is significant, Mr. Baide. Grief can manifest in many ways, though we'll focus on the physical symptoms for now. You mentioned "usual stuff." Could you please list the medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly, I don't even remember! Little blue pill, little white pill… the doctor keeps changing them. Something for my blood pressure, I think. And… something for my cholesterol? Look, I have the pharmacist sort it all out. I just take what they give me. I don’t have time to keep track of pills. It’s ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a precise medication list. I’m going to have my nurse take down everything you can recall, and we’ll verify it with your pharmacy. Now, let's move on to other potential symptoms. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or other joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Not particularly. They ache sometimes, a general ache like an old man’s hands would. But not stiff. They shake, that’s the problem. Not stiff. Honestly, this is all very… tedious. Can’t we just give me something to stop the shaking? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: We will get there, Mr. Baide. It is important to understand why your hands are shaking before determining the appropriate course of action. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Walking? No, I walk just fine. Bit slower maybe, compared to when I was younger, but who isn’t? Balance is… alright. I haven’t fallen or anything. Look, are you going to examine my hands or just ask questions all day? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's perform a brief neurological examination, then. Please extend your arms in front of you, palms up. I'm observing a tremor in both hands, more pronounced on this side. Can you touch your finger to your nose repeatedly with each hand?
PATIENT: There. See? Shaking. It’s right there. Don't need an exam to tell me that. It’s obvious. This is… annoying. Get on with it. Whatever "it" is. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I'm also noting some rigidity in your upper extremities. Now, can you tap your thumb to each of your fingers in sequence?
PATIENT: There! Happy now? It’s slow, it’s shaky, it’s…difficult! Honestly, I used to be able to do this in my sleep. This is just ridiculous. Can we get a diagnosis already? I have a meeting later.
DOCTOR: Based on the neurological examination, and considering your age and symptoms, a provisional diagnosis of essential tremor is a possibility. However, given your difficulty with the finger-to-nose test and the presence of rigidity, we need to rule out other conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease. I'm going to order some blood work to check for underlying medical conditions, and I'd like to schedule you for an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Never heard of it. I haven't had an MRI in… well, ever, I don't think. Look, if it involves needles, I don’t want any part of it. And I certainly don’t want to spend the whole day getting poked and prodded. Can’t we just give me a pill and be done with it? This is all very… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: The MRI is necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis, Mr. Baide. The contrast dye helps us visualize the brain tissue more clearly. While there are potential risks associated with the dye, they are minimal. The nurse will discuss those with you in detail. Refusing the MRI will not allow us to properly assess your condition, and I cannot prescribe medication without a complete workup. I am also going to refer you to a neurologist for a second opinion. Dr. Chen is excellent. Would you like me to schedule that for you?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Now you want to send me to another doctor? This is a complete waste of time. Look, I've dealt with important people my whole life. I don't need opinions. I need a solution. Just give me something to stop the shaking, and I’ll be on my way. I don't have time for tests and referrals and…and dye! Honestly, the bureaucracy of this whole thing is appalling. Just… stop wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration. However, I am ethically obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes a thorough evaluation. I will not prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. Given your unwillingness to undergo the necessary testing and your refusal of a specialist referral, I am afraid I cannot continue this consultation at this time. I would be happy to provide you with a list of neurologists in the area if you reconsider. Otherwise, I wish you good health. The nurse will escort you to the exit. .
