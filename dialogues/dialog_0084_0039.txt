DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Voytek. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lindsey. Well, the nurse told me somethin’ about my cholesterol bein’ high. I don’t rightly know what that means, to be honest. I just got a letter, and she said I should come talk to you about it. I feel fine, mostly. A little achy in the mornings, but that's just gettin’ old, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lindsey, that’s perfectly alright. Many people don’t fully understand what cholesterol numbers mean. We can definitely go over that. And it is common to have some aches and pains as we age. Let me pull up your recent lab results here… Alright, so it looks like your total cholesterol is elevated, and your LDL cholesterol – that’s the “bad” cholesterol – is higher than we’d like to see. Before we dive into what that means for you, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I worked for the county my whole life, lookin’ after folks. Mostly kids, some older folks too. It was good work, important work. As for me… I haven’t been sick much, never really. Had the flu a time or two, a bad cold now and again. My wife, bless her heart, she had some trouble with her heart later on. That was… hard. I don’t recall any serious illnesses for myself, though. No big surgeries or nothin’. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work, I suppose. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Lindsey. Thank you. It’s good to know you’ve been generally healthy. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Losing someone is never easy. Okay, and just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. Never had a reaction to anythin’. Ate all sorts of things as a kid – my mother wasn’t too fussy! I take a little vitamin D in the winter, the nurse suggested it. Said I wasn’t gettin’ enough sun. Other than that… nope. Clean bill of health, allergy-wise. I used to be able to eat shellfish, but haven’t had any in years. Not a craving, really. More's the pity, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. No known allergies, just a vitamin D supplement. Let’s talk about medications a little further. You mentioned the vitamin D – how much are you taking each day?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… the bottle says 2,000 units, I believe. Just one little pill every mornin’ with my breakfast. It's a small, white one. The nurse at the pharmacy told me to take it with food, somethin’ about absorbency, I think. I try to remember. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind. But I’m pretty consistent with it, I'd say. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, 2,000 units of vitamin D daily, that’s good. And you’ve been consistent with that, mostly. Now, let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it wasn't pretty. I promised my wife I wouldn't, and I never did. Always thought it was a foolish habit. Ruined a lot of good lungs, that tobacco did. And drinkin’? I have a beer now and then, maybe one or two on a Saturday night with the television. But nothing regular, I assure you. Not a drinker, really. Never felt the need for it.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Lindsey. No smoking and very limited alcohol consumption. That's very positive. Now, thinking about your diet… can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Well, I mostly eat simple things. Breakfast is usually oatmeal, sometimes with a bit of fruit if I have some. Lunch is a sandwich, ham or turkey, with a side of tomato soup. And dinner… oh, dinner varies. Sometimes it's a piece of fish, baked with potatoes and vegetables. Other times it's just a frozen meal, to be honest. I don't have much appetite these days, and cookin’ for one is… well, it’s just not the same. I try to eat healthy, but it's not always easy. I do like a good piece of apple pie now and then, though. My wife used to make the best apple pie, you know. I miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lindsey. It sounds like you generally eat a balanced diet, even with the occasional apple pie – a good treat, and it's understandable to miss your wife's cooking. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It'll help me get a better overall picture of your health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I ain't afraid of a little listenin' and feelin'. My heart's been strong all my life, but it's good to check. And my lungs… well, they've seen some dust and dirt over the years, but they’ve held up alright. Go ahead, please. I’ll just sit here quietly. Don’t you worry about me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lindsey. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur – it’s not concerning at this time, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I’m also going to check your reflexes quickly. Reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Everything seems generally good, but the elevated blood pressure and slightly elevated cholesterol are what we need to address. I want to order some further blood work – a full lipid panel to get a more detailed look at your cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds reasonable, Doctor. More blood work, eh? Seems I'm spendin' a lot of time at the clinic these days. But if it'll help, then go ahead. Kidney function and blood sugar… never had any trouble with either of those, but it's good to check, I suppose. I trust your judgement. Just let me know when and where I need to go to get it done. And what do we do about this high blood pressure and cholesterol… are we talkin’ pills? I don’t much like takin’ pills, if I’m bein’ honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about taking pills, Lindsey. We’ll start with the blood work to get a clearer picture. Then, we can discuss all your options. For many people, lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – can make a significant difference. We can talk about a heart-healthy diet and maybe some gentle exercises you could incorporate into your routine. If lifestyle changes aren’t enough, then medication might be necessary, but that’s something we’ll decide together. Here’s the lab requisition. You can go to the lab at County General Hospital. They’re open Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm. It shouldn’t take too long. Fasting for 12 hours before the test is recommended - that means no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. We'll review the results when they come back and then come up with a plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: County General… alright. I know the way. Fasting after midnight… that might be a little tough, but I can manage. I usually eat somethin’ small before bed, but I’ll skip it this time. So, no food or sugary drinks… got it. And we'll talk about this plan after the results come back. Lifestyle changes first, you said? That sounds good to me. I might not be as spry as I used to be, but I can still try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little. I appreciate you explainin’ things so clearly. It’s nice to have someone listen, you know?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindsey. I'm glad I could help. And you're right, a little listening can go a long way. We'll take things one step at a time. If you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Here’s my card. Have a good evening, and we'll talk soon.
