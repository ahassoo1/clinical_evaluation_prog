DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a lot. More than usual, you see. It's been going on for a little while now, and I thought perhaps I should mention it. I don't quite recall when it started, precisely, but it’s definitely been weeks. Perhaps a month or two? It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent, you say. Hmm. And when you say frequent, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A rough estimate… that is difficult. I don’t really keep track, you understand. But… let me think. Before, I’d go… normal, like most people. Now? Perhaps every hour or two during the day. And… yes, a couple of times during the night as well, which is new. It’s disrupting my sleep a bit, honestly. I apologize for the vagueness, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verbos. These things happen. Nighttime frequency is concerning. Now, is it a full bladder each time, or just a little bit?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… believe it’s usually a full bladder. Not a completely full, bursting bladder, but… substantial. Certainly not just a dribble, if you follow me. Enough to… well, to require a proper visit to the facilities, you understand. It's not painful, thankfully. Just… inconvenient. And a little worrisome, to be honest. It wasn't like this before, and I haven't changed anything in my routine that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I haven't noticed anything particularly… drastic. I have been feeling a bit more thirsty, perhaps? Though, with the summer heat, one expects that. No burning or discomfort when I go, thankfully. And I don't believe I've seen any changes in… the appearance of things, if you don't mind my being indelicate. Just… the frequency, and perhaps a touch more thirst. That’s about it, I think. It’s all rather puzzling, really. I haven’t been eating or drinking anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mr. Verbos, increased frequency and thirst can be… a number of things. We’ll need to rule out the obvious first. Do you have a history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… I believe her sister had something. A bit of a sweet tooth, she did. But a direct diagnosis? I couldn’t say with any certainty, Doctor. It was quite a long time ago, and family medical history wasn’t discussed as openly as it is today, you understand. I believe she needed to watch her sugar intake, though. Is that relevant? It’s a bit hazy, I apologize. I wasn’t terribly close to my aunt.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mr. Verbos. Alright. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections – anything at all that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… Now, let me think. I had a bit of a cold, perhaps, a few months ago. Nothing serious, just a sniffle and a cough. Resolved itself within a week. Nothing requiring a doctor’s visit, you understand. And… no, I don’t believe so. I try to stay healthy. I walk every day, eat sensible foods. Nothing out of the ordinary, really. I am rather at a loss as to what could be causing this. It’s just… unsettling. A bit worrying, you see. And the sleep disruption is not ideal.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen and do a basic neurological check. Then, I’m going to order a urinalysis and a blood sugar test. That’ll give us a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you deem necessary, I’m happy to comply. A urinalysis and a blood sugar test… yes, that seems sensible. I apologize for my… vagueness throughout this consultation. I do wish I could provide more concrete information. But as you can see, my memory is not what it once was. Please, proceed at your convenience. I trust your expertise entirely.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table, please. We’ll start with your abdomen. I’ll need you to point to any areas of discomfort, if you have any.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. No discomfort specifically, but… I can comply. Here, then? I shall lie down. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nothing obviously tender there. Now, I'm just going to listen to your bowel sounds. Normal. Reflexes seem… adequate. Alright. Now, a quick neurological assessment… close your eyes and follow my finger. Okay, good. Everything seems… within normal limits, for your age. But the tests don't rule everything out. We need those lab results. I'll send you to the lab for a urinalysis and blood sugar test. They’ll give you instructions there. It should be relatively quick. Do you have any questions before I let you get dressed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That all sounds… thorough. I appreciate your diligence. Urinalysis and blood sugar test… yes. I shall go to the lab as directed. No, I believe I have no further questions at this time. I trust you will inform me of the results when they are available? I am… rather anxious to understand what is causing this disruption. Thank you for your time and attention. Perhaps I should ask… is there anything I should avoid in the meantime? Any foods or drinks I should steer clear of? Just to be cautious, you understand.
DOCTOR: Avoid sugary drinks for now. And limit your caffeine intake. We’ll have the results back in a couple of days, and then we'll discuss the next steps. This is a requisition for the lab, and a note to avoid sugary beverages. Don’t worry too much until we have the results. It’s likely something minor. Come back in two days, and we’ll go from there. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you very much for your time and attention. Avoiding sugary drinks and limiting caffeine… yes, perfectly reasonable. Two days, then. I appreciate your reassurance. I shall see you then. Have a pleasant day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Verbos. .
