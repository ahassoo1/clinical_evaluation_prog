DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, welcome. I’m Dr. Valerie Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Hernandez. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, it’s… about a surgery I’m considering. I need to get everything checked out first, I believe. It’s a… a cosmetic procedure. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I don’t recall all the specifics right this moment. It has to do with… improving my appearance, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mackenzi. And don’t worry about the specifics – we can figure it all out together. It’s good you’re getting a check-up beforehand, that’s very responsible. Let me just pull up your records here… Okay, so I see you’re 29 years old. Do you mind if I ask what procedure you’re considering?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. No, not at all. Let me see… it’s… it’s something about my face. I believe it involves… lifting? Or tightening, perhaps? I truly apologize for being so vague. My husband… he passed a little over a year ago, and things have been… a bit fuzzy since then, honestly. It was a sudden illness. I just want to… feel a bit more like myself again, if that makes sense. I think it's a face lift, or something similar.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mackenzi. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s perfectly normal for things to feel… unsettled afterward. There’s no need to apologize at all. We’ll take things at your pace. So, a facelift or something similar—that gives us a good starting point. To get a better picture of what might be involved and if you're a good candidate, could you tell me a bit more about why you're considering it?
PATIENT: Well… it’s difficult to explain. It’s not that I think I’m unattractive, exactly. It's more… I look in the mirror and I don’t always recognize the person looking back. It sounds silly, I know. It's just… I feel… tired. And… older than I am, perhaps? My husband… he always said I had a very youthful appearance. And now… I just want to feel like me again. The me he knew, if that makes sense. It’s… it's a small thing, really. But it would mean a lot to me. I hope that doesn't sound frivolous.
DOCTOR: That doesn't sound frivolous at all, Mackenzi. It sounds like a very valid and understandable desire. It's perfectly normal to want to feel like yourself, especially after a significant loss. And wanting to recapture a part of yourself that feels connected to happy memories is completely reasonable. Okay. Let’s do a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I think I'm generally healthy. I did have a bout of the flu last winter, but nothing serious. And… oh! I have mild allergies. Mostly to pollen, but I manage it with over-the-counter medication. Otherwise… I can’t recall anything major. My husband always handled the doctor appointments, I'm afraid. I really should be more involved. Do you have access to my previous records anywhere? Perhaps from his doctor? It would be very helpful, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good idea. Let me see if we can access anything from previous providers. It can sometimes take a little time to get those records transferred. In the meantime, let’s focus on what we do know. You mentioned mild pollen allergies. Do you have any other allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. No known medication allergies, and I eat pretty much everything. I enjoy cooking, actually. My husband… he was a very picky eater, so I did a lot of the cooking! I don’t recall ever having a reaction to any food. I did have a rather unpleasant rash once when I was a child, from poison ivy, I think, but that was a long time ago. Nothing serious, thankfully. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Mackenzi. This is helpful. Knowing what isn't there is just as important as knowing what is. Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for headaches, if needed, but that’s it. Nothing regularly. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements. My husband… he was always the one who kept track of all of that, too. I really feel quite helpless recalling all of this on my own.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mackenzi. You're doing great. It's common to rely on a partner for these things, and it's understandable that it feels a little overwhelming now. We’ll get through this together. One last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Have you had any previous surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. That’s the only surgery I can recall. Nothing else. It was a very simple procedure, I think. And… oh! I did have a wisdom tooth extracted, but that wasn't really a surgery, was it? It was a long time ago. Nothing major, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, and wisdom tooth extraction. That’s good to know. Okay, Mackenzi. If you’re comfortable with it, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the areas of your face you're concerned about. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I just… I hope I'm not wasting your time. It all feels so… trivial, after everything. But I suppose if I want to feel a bit more like myself again, I should do whatever I can, right?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely not wasting my time, Mackenzi. Your feelings are completely valid, and wanting to improve how you feel about yourself is never trivial. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing concerning at the moment. Heart and lungs sound good. And your skin looks healthy. I’m seeing some natural age-related changes in elasticity, which is perfectly normal, and everything appears symmetrical. Everything looks good from a basic medical standpoint. The elevated blood pressure is something we can monitor and potentially address with lifestyle changes. Now, to get a clearer picture of what options might be available, I think it would be best to get some photographs taken. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. Yes, photographs would be fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to be sure… that I'm making the right decision. And that… I’m a good candidate, if that makes sense. I don't want to go through all of this if it's… not possible. Or if it’s too risky.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. And those are excellent questions. It’s important to be fully informed before making any decisions. The photographs will help me assess your facial structure and skin quality more thoroughly. We’ll discuss all the potential options and risks, and if you're not a good candidate, we can explore other alternatives. If you’re comfortable, we can take the photographs now. We’ll need a few different angles. And don't worry, it's just for medical documentation. And if you'd prefer, you can have a nurse present during the process.
PATIENT: No, that's alright. A nurse isn't necessary. I… I suppose I should just get it over with. Just let me know what I need to do. I'll try my best to hold still. It’s just… it feels a bit strange, having my picture taken like this. But if it helps… then I'll do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mackenzi. Just relax and look straight ahead. This will only take a moment. Okay, perfect. And now a slight turn to the left… great. And now to the right… excellent. Alright, all done. Thank you for your patience. Now, let me review these images and get a better sense of your options. I'll be right back.
PATIENT: .
