DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 52 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Delano Alcorta. Fifty-two, though I feel…well, that’s not important. I’m here about my vision. It’s been…deteriorating, shall we say. Not suddenly, mind you, but gradually. It’s become quite bothersome, actually.
DOCTOR: “Deteriorating,” alright. Gradual onset is important information. Can you describe how it’s deteriorating, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let’s see. It’s…difficult to explain to someone who, presumably, has perfectly good vision. It’s not blurry, exactly. More like…things are fading. The color seems…less vibrant. And at the periphery, it's as if there’s a sort of…dimness. Like looking through a dirty window, but not a dirty window. Do you follow? It's quite frustrating, honestly. It makes reading…difficult. And driving, frankly, is becoming rather precarious.
DOCTOR: “Fading,” “less vibrant,” and “dimness at the periphery.” I see. And you mentioned reading and driving are becoming difficult. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been progressing over a specific timeframe?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not sudden, Doctor. I assure you. I'm not given to dramatics. It's been…well, I'd say the last six to eight months, perhaps? It started subtly, and I dismissed it as simply…getting older. One doesn’t expect everything to remain as sharp as it once was, you know? But it’s become progressively worse. It interferes with my work, naturally. And I pride myself on my attention to detail. It's…unacceptable, frankly.
DOCTOR: Six to eight months, progressive. I understand your concern, Mr. Alcorta. And attention to detail is important. Before we proceed, have you experienced any pain with your vision changes?
PATIENT: Pain? Good heavens, no. Nothing like that. Just…a lessening. A decline. It's not painful to see poorly, Doctor. It's…disconcerting. Though, I must say, my ex-wife would likely find a certain poetic justice in it. She always said I didn't see things clearly enough. A rather unpleasant woman, really. But that’s beside the point. No pain. Just…diminished clarity.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you noticed any floaters, flashes of light, or a curtain-like shadow in your vision?
PATIENT: Floaters… flashes… a curtain? No, no curtains. I’m not imagining a stage production in my eyes, Doctor. Honestly. It’s just…a general dulling. A lessening of…brilliance. And, if I’m being precise, it seems worse in low light. Trying to read menus in restaurants, for example, is becoming a considerable ordeal. I find myself…squinting a great deal. Which, I’m sure, doesn’t help. But no floaters, no flashes, no theatrical curtains. Just…dimness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I think it would be best if we perform a basic visual exam. I'd like to check your visual acuity, peripheral vision, and examine the back of your eye with an ophthalmoscope. It will allow me to get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have your glasses with you?
PATIENT: Glasses? Of course. One doesn't venture forth without them, Doctor. Though they seem…less effective these days. Here. They're quite recent, actually. But, as I said, they don’t seem to be doing the trick anymore. I do hope this won't be a lengthy procedure. I have a rather full afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very good. Please, have a seat. It shouldn't be too long, Mr. Alcorta. We'll start with your visual acuity. I’ll have you read some letters on a chart. Please just read the smallest letters you can see clearly.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, my eyesight is rather compromised at the moment. Don't be alarmed if I struggle. I pride myself on my reading comprehension, but even I have my limits. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Cover your left eye with your hand. And please, read the letters on this chart, starting with the top row, from left to right. Don’t strain, just read the letters you can see clearly. "Starting with the top row..."
PATIENT: Hmm. Very well. Let’s see… …E… P… T… F… Yes, those are…quite clear. Though the font size seems…rather small. Is this standard, Doctor? …D… C… B… Oh dear. I seem to be struggling with these lower letters. Perhaps I should have brought my magnifying glass. This is…disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s try this row. Don’t worry if you can’t see them all. Just tell me the letters you can identify. "Tell me the letters you can identify..."
PATIENT: Goodness… This is… increasingly difficult. Let me see… …F… No, wait… P? It’s rather blurry. Oh… and is that a…V? I’m terribly unsure. This is…most frustrating. It's not as if I've never read a chart before, Doctor. I’m simply…having difficulty discerning the shapes. Perhaps the lighting isn’t optimal? It’s rather dim in here, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s try this with your other eye covered. Cover your right eye this time with your hand. And again, just read the smallest letters you can see clearly on this chart. "Cover your right eye this time..."
PATIENT: Very well. Though I suspect the results will be…similar. My vision seems uniformly compromised, Doctor. It's not as if one eye is significantly better than the other. …E… P… T… Oh dear. I’m struggling from the outset this time. Is this…standard practice, Doctor? To deliberately make things as difficult as possible? I assure you, I have excellent reading comprehension when presented with legible text. This is…rather trying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That’s sufficient for now. Based on your performance, your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. Now, I’d like to check your peripheral vision. "Now, I’d like to check your peripheral vision."
PATIENT: Peripheral vision, you say? Very well. Though I must protest, Doctor, I find your manner somewhat…patronizing. I assure you, I am perfectly aware of my diminished vision. What I require is a diagnosis, not a condescending assessment of my abilities. However, I shall cooperate. Proceed with your test. Though I reserve the right to question your methods if they prove unduly…taxing.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. Please focus your gaze on this central point. I will present a series of lights in your peripheral vision. When you see a light, please indicate by pressing this button. Do not look towards the lights, simply press the button when you see them. "Please focus your gaze on this central point..."
PATIENT: Very well. Though I find this rather…disorienting. It’s difficult to concentrate when one is constantly anticipating a fleeting stimulus. And I suspect my reaction time may be somewhat compromised due to my…age. However, I shall endeavor to provide an accurate response. …There. And…now. Is this…sufficiently accurate, Doctor? I trust you have calibrated the device appropriately? It wouldn’t do to base a diagnosis on faulty equipment, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. That will be sufficient for now. Your peripheral vision is also significantly reduced, particularly in the lower quadrants. Based on these preliminary tests, it appears you have significant vision loss in both eyes, affecting both central and peripheral vision. Now, I’d like to examine the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. This will allow me to assess the optic nerve and retina. “Now, I’d like to examine the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope.”
PATIENT: An ophthalmoscope, you say? Of course. As if one hasn’t endured enough probing and prodding already. Frankly, Doctor, I find your bedside manner…lacking. But proceed, if you must. Though I warn you, I have a rather strong aversion to bright lights. And I expect a clear explanation of your findings, devoid of any technical jargon. I am a reasonably intelligent man, you know. …Just please be expeditious. I have a rather full afternoon, as I mentioned previously. And I trust you’ve thoroughly cleaned that instrument? One doesn’t want to introduce any unnecessary complications.
DOCTOR: "Please look straight ahead." Based on the ophthalmoscope examination, there is evidence of optic nerve pallor and retinal atrophy in both eyes. This is consistent with chronic optic neuropathy. "This is consistent with chronic optic neuropathy."
PATIENT: Optic neuropathy, you say? A rather…ominous-sounding diagnosis. And what, pray tell, does that mean, Doctor? In layman’s terms, if you please. I’m not a medical professional, and I have no desire to decipher a litany of technical jargon. Will I…go blind? Is this a progressive condition? And what, if anything, can be done about it? I expect a straight answer, Doctor, devoid of any euphemisms or condescending platitudes. And I trust you have considered all possible causes? Is this…hereditary? My family has a rather…complicated medical history, as it happens.
DOCTOR: Optic neuropathy simply means there is damage to the optic nerve, which transmits signals from your eyes to your brain. In your case, it appears to be chronic, meaning it has developed over a long period of time. The retinal atrophy indicates damage to the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eye. As for your question about going blind, it's difficult to say definitively. The condition can progress, leading to further vision loss. However, the rate of progression varies greatly depending on the underlying cause. The possible causes are numerous. They include glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, tumors, and vascular diseases. In some cases, it can be hereditary, but that’s not always the case. It’s also possible it’s idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. To determine the underlying cause, we’d need to order further testing. This would include a visual field test, an optical coherence tomography scan, and possibly an MRI of the brain and orbits. We would also need to obtain a detailed medical history and perform a neurological examination. I recommend a referral to a neurologist and an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management. They will be able to determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment options. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: A neurologist and an ophthalmologist, you say? More probing, more testing, more delays. It seems my afternoon will be entirely consumed by this…ordeal. And what, pray tell, is the prognosis, Doctor? Assuming, of course, that a diagnosis is even possible. Will I require surgery? Medication? Or am I simply destined to succumb to this…inexorable decline? And what about insurance? As you may be aware, my coverage is…limited. Will these tests and referrals be prohibitively expensive? I trust you have some suggestions for affordable options? I am not, shall we say, independently wealthy. And frankly, Doctor, I find your bedside manner…lacking. You speak with all the warmth of a tax auditor. A little empathy would be greatly appreciated, you know. This is, after all, a rather distressing situation. Do you have any further insights to offer? Any glimmer of hope, perhaps? Or am I simply to resign myself to a future of increasing darkness?
DOCTOR: The prognosis is…variable, Mr. Alcorta. As I mentioned, it depends on the underlying cause. If we can identify the cause and treat it effectively, we may be able to slow down the progression of the disease. However, in some cases, the condition will continue to worsen despite treatment. Surgery is unlikely to be helpful in your case. Medication may be an option, depending on the underlying cause. For example, if glaucoma is the cause, we can prescribe eye drops to lower the intraocular pressure. However, there is no cure for chronic optic neuropathy. As for your concerns about insurance, I understand your situation. Unfortunately, I am not an insurance expert. I can provide you with a referral to a financial counselor who can help you navigate the insurance process and identify affordable options. I understand this is a distressing situation, Mr. Alcorta. However, I can assure you that we will do everything we can to determine the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment options. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment with me next week to discuss the results of the testing and referrals. In the meantime, I suggest you avoid driving and make any necessary adjustments to your daily activities to ensure your safety. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. You have…sufficiently dampened my spirits. A neurologist, an ophthalmologist, a financial counselor…an endless parade of probing and delays. It seems my future is destined to be a rather bleak one. Very well. Schedule the follow-up appointment, if you please. Though I harbor little hope of a positive outcome. And I trust you will provide me with a detailed summary of your findings? In layman’s terms, if you please. And frankly, Doctor, I find your entire approach…unsatisfactory. You speak with all the warmth of a mortician. A little compassion would be greatly appreciated, you know. This is, after all, a rather distressing situation. Very well. I shall bid you good day. Though I harbor little hope of a positive outcome. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Alcorta. The summary will be provided. Have a good day.
