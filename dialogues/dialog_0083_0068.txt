DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my leg. It’s been swelling up, you see. After… after the cancer stuff. It's just… uncomfortable, and it worries me a little.
DOCTOR: I see. You mentioned “after the cancer stuff.” Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It was… a few years ago now. Breast cancer. They did the surgery, and then… the radiation. And chemo, yes. It was hard, very hard. Everything seemed okay for a while, but then this leg started swelling, maybe six months ago? It comes and goes, but it’s been worse lately. Sorry, I don’t know much about… the details. It was all just… a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Queener. That was a lot, and it’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall all the details. It’s common to feel overwhelmed after cancer treatment. To help me understand what's happening with your leg, could you describe the swelling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly in my right leg. It gets puffy, like… like a balloon, almost. And it feels heavy. Sometimes it’s a little bit painful, just a dull ache. And… it’s warmer than my other leg, I think. Not hot, but… warmer. Is that… normal? I don’t want to bother you with silly questions.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Queener. It’s important to ask questions, and those are very helpful observations. The warmth is something we'll definitely need to investigate. Now, does the swelling fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it does. It’s worse at the end of the day, definitely. If I’m on my feet a lot, it gets much bigger. And if I… sit for too long, it gets worse then too, oddly enough. It’s better when I… elevate it, I suppose. I try to put my feet up, but… it’s not always easy. I live alone, you see. It’s a little difficult to manage sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's good to know about the elevation helping. And it's helpful to know about it being worse with both prolonged standing and sitting. Now, Ms. Queener, have you noticed any changes in the skin on your right leg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The skin… well, it feels a little thicker, maybe? And… sometimes it looks a little red. Not a bright red, just… a little flushed. And… I’ve noticed a few small… spots, I guess. Little brown spots. I thought they were just age spots, to be honest. I don’t pay much attention to them. They don’t… hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, thicker skin, some redness, and small brown spots. Thank you. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Besides the breast cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor put me on pills for it, years ago. I take them every day, I think. And… arthritis, in my hands, mostly. It doesn't bother me too much. Other than that… no, not really. I think. I'm not very good at remembering these things. Is Medicare okay for all this? I worry about the cost sometimes.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover most of what we need to do, Ms. Queener, so don't worry too much about that right now. We'll also check with them to confirm your coverage. Now, can you tell me the names of the medications you're currently taking, including the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Let me see… for my blood pressure… I think it’s Lisinopril? Or something like that. The bottle is… somewhere. I have a lot of little bottles! And… I take something for my arthritis, but I can’t recall the name. It’s a small, white pill. And… that's it, I think. I really am terrible with names, I apologize. I just ask the pharmacist to fill the prescriptions. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Queener. Many people find it difficult to keep track of medications. Don't apologize; we can figure this out. We can also access your medication list through the pharmacy, with your permission. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, good idea, checking with the pharmacy! Yes, please do that, that would be wonderful. Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when I’m around cats, but that’s just a mild allergy, not serious. No reactions to any medications, as far as I know. I’ve never had anything… bad happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you. Now, Ms. Queener, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll definitely want to take a look at your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just… be gentle, please. My legs are a little tender. And… I may shiver a little. I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I'll be as gentle as possible. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Please lie on your back, and I'll examine your right and left legs. Alright. I notice some swelling in your right leg, as you mentioned. The skin is slightly warmer to the touch and feels a bit thicker. I also see some areas of redness and a few small brown spots. I’m also noting some mild pitting edema – meaning that when I press on the skin, it leaves a slight indentation for a few seconds. I'm documenting these findings now. Your pulses feel strong and equal in both legs, which is good. Do you feel any pain when I gently touch your calf muscle here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good about the pulses. And… no, not really pain. Just… a little bit of tenderness, maybe. It’s… hard to explain. Not sharp pain, just… a discomfort. Like a dull ache. When you press on it, yes, that’s where it feels tender. It’s been like that for a little while now. Is it something serious, Doctor? I worry it’s… the cancer coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener, and it’s good that you’re voicing it. It’s important to rule things out. Given your history of breast cancer, we need to be thorough. The tenderness and swelling are concerning enough to warrant further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, I suspect this might be lymphedema, a condition where fluid builds up in the tissues due to a blockage in the lymphatic system. It can sometimes occur after cancer treatment, particularly after removal of lymph nodes. However, to confirm this, and to rule out other possibilities like a blood clot or infection, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymphedema… oh dear. That sounds… complicated. After the surgery, you say? Yes, yes, that makes sense. If that’s what it is, then I suppose tests are a good idea. I just want to know what’s going on. Please, do whatever you think is best. Blood clot… that sounds scary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What kind of tests will you be doing? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Queener. A blood clot is always a concern, which is why it’s important to rule it out. We will start with a Duplex ultrasound of your right leg, to look at the blood flow and identify any blockages. It's a non-invasive test, like an echo, and shouldn't cause you any pain. I would also like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection. And to get a better understanding of your kidney function, we’ll do a basic metabolic panel . We’ll also check your D-dimer level, which can help rule out blood clots. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh, ultrasound sounds… okay. Not painful, you say? That’s good. And blood tests are… well, blood tests. I’ve had plenty of those. CBC, BMP, D-dimer… all those letters! But yes, if you think it’s necessary, then please do them. The more information, the better, I suppose. Will I need to come back another day for all of these tests? I don’t drive, you see, and getting a ride can be… difficult.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask, Ms. Queener. It’s good to plan ahead. We can actually do all of these tests today, in our lab here at the clinic. It will take a little time, but you won't need to make another trip. I’ll write the orders for the lab technician now. They will come to get you when they are ready. After the tests are completed, we’ll send them to the lab for analysis, and I should have the results back within 24-48 hours. I'll then give you a call to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to elevate your leg whenever possible, and try to avoid prolonged standing or sitting. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful about doing them all today! That saves me a lot of trouble. Thank you, Doctor. Elevate my leg… yes, I’ll try. It’s just… easier said than done sometimes. No… I don’t think I have any other questions right now. I’m just… relieved to be getting to the bottom of this. Thank you for listening to me, and for not dismissing my worries.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Queener. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help ease your mind, and I want to assure you that we'll work through this together. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime. The lab technician will be with you shortly.
