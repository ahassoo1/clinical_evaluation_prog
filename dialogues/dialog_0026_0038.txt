DOCTOR: Good morning, Evann. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it's a little difficult to explain precisely. I understand I need some… paperwork completed? Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… well, should something happen. I believe it was called an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to inquire about it. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It’s very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this, and it's quite common for people to find the details a bit confusing. Both Advance Directives and POLST forms are about ensuring your healthcare preferences are respected. To be sure I understand correctly, you're looking to discuss completing those documents today?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. If that’s not too much trouble. I… I don’t recall precisely who suggested it, or even all the reasons why, but it felt important. And I would like to be… prepared. If you could perhaps explain the difference between the two, that would be most helpful. I apologize for my… vagueness.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Evann. It's my job to help clarify things. It is a bit complex. An Advance Directive is a broader document – it outlines your overall wishes for healthcare, things like the type of treatments you’d want or not want in various situations. It generally comes into play when you’re unable to make decisions yourself, but aren't necessarily facing an immediate life-or-death crisis. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is much more specific. It’s a medical order, based on your current health status, detailing what treatments you do or don't want right now. It’s for people with serious illnesses and is generally honored by emergency medical services. Does that distinction make sense?
PATIENT: It… yes, I believe so. The Advance Directive sounds more… general, for the future. And the POLST is for… immediate situations, and very specific orders. It’s helpful to think of it that way. I… I don’t have any serious illnesses, at least not that I’m aware of. Perhaps the Advance Directive would be the more appropriate form for me, then? Though, truthfully, I’m not sure what sorts of things one would even include in such a document.
DOCTOR: That's a very good assessment, Evann. Given your current health, an Advance Directive would likely be the most relevant starting point. And you’re right to wonder what to include. It covers things like whether you’d want life-sustaining treatments like CPR or mechanical ventilation if you were seriously ill, and also includes things like your preferences for pain management and end-of-life care. It’s a very personal document, and there’s no right or wrong answer. We can go through a questionnaire together to help guide you through the different considerations. Before we do that though, just to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s… difficult. I’ve moved quite a bit throughout my life, and honestly, I don’t recall all the doctors I’ve seen. I believe I had a rather severe bout of pneumonia some years ago, perhaps ten or fifteen years back? It required hospitalization. And… I had my appendix removed as a child, naturally. Beyond that… I’m afraid I’m drawing a blank. I generally consider myself quite healthy, though. I do have some… minor joint discomfort, particularly in my knees, but nothing that requires regular treatment. I used to be very active, but… well, that's a story for another day.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia requiring hospitalization and an appendectomy as a child. That’s helpful to know. The joint discomfort is good to note as well. It's not uncommon to have some memory gaps regarding past medical care, especially with frequent moves. Do you recall anything about how the pneumonia was treated?
PATIENT: I… I believe I was quite ill. A high fever, severe coughing… I was given antibiotics, of course. And… I seem to recall being on oxygen for a time. It was a… rather frightening experience, honestly. I was in the hospital for several weeks, I think. Though the exact details are… hazy. I do remember feeling very weak for quite some time afterwards. It took a long time to fully recover. And… I believe I saw a pulmonologist during my follow-up appointments. Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Evann. Antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and follow-up with a pulmonologist. We'll want to document all of that. Knowing you saw a pulmonologist suggests it was a more significant case of pneumonia, which is good to know. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never experienced any severe allergic reactions. I occasionally have a mild skin irritation with certain fragrances, but nothing more than a slight rash. I've always been able to tolerate most medications without issue. And I have no food allergies, to my knowledge. I am reasonably certain of that, at least. My eating habits aren’t particularly adventurous, so I’ve mostly stuck to… common foods.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, mild skin irritation with certain fragrances. Good. And what about current medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications. Occasionally, I’ll take an over-the-counter pain reliever for minor aches and pains, such as ibuprofen, but that’s it. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, whenever it’s capable. Though, admittedly, that becomes more difficult with age.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Evann. Just occasional ibuprofen as needed. We'll document that. And to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that's another difficult one. My family is… scattered, to say the least. I haven’t been in close contact with them for many years. My mother… she passed away several years ago. I believe she had some heart trouble. And my father… I don't recall. He wasn’t present in my life for very long. As for siblings… I have a brother, but I haven't seen him since childhood. I don't know anything about his health, unfortunately. It's not a particularly informative history, I’m afraid. It’s a rather… fragmented family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Evann. It’s common for family histories to be incomplete, especially with limited contact. Knowing your mother had heart trouble is helpful, and we can note that. We'll also document the limited family history overall. And finally, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Certainly not. I maintain a… rather disciplined lifestyle, generally. I believe in taking care of oneself, both physically and mentally. A clear mind and a healthy body are paramount.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Evann. A healthy lifestyle is so important. It sounds like you prioritize your well-being, which is excellent. So, to summarize, you're a 35-year-old female with a history of pneumonia and an appendectomy, no known allergies, no current medications, a limited family history of heart trouble, and a healthy lifestyle. We’ve discussed your desire to complete an Advance Directive. Before we begin going through the questionnaire, would you like to ask me any questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness. I suppose I'm ready to begin, if you are. I trust your guidance. Perhaps… perhaps we could start with the basics? What sorts of things would one even include in such a document? I feel rather… lost, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Evann. It can feel overwhelming at first. We'll take it one step at a time. The questionnaire covers several key areas. First, we’ll discuss your general values and beliefs regarding healthcare. What are your priorities when it comes to quality of life?
PATIENT: Quality of life… That’s a… a profound question. I believe… I believe in maintaining dignity, above all else. And independence, as long as possible. I don’t want to be a burden on others. And… I want to be comfortable. Pain-free, if possible. I suppose those are my priorities. To live a meaningful life, for as long as I can, with dignity and independence. It’s difficult to articulate, but those are the core values, I believe.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Evann. Dignity, independence, and comfort. Those are very important values. We’ll definitely keep those in mind as we go through the rest of the questionnaire. The next question is about your preferences regarding life-sustaining treatments. If you were seriously ill and unable to communicate, would you want CPR if your heart stopped beating?
PATIENT: CPR… That’s a… difficult question. I’ve seen… I’ve seen what CPR can be like. It doesn't always work, and even when it does, it can be… traumatic. Honestly… I think… I think I would prefer not to have CPR. Unless there’s a very high chance of success. I don't want to be kept alive artificially, if there's no real hope of recovery. I’d rather… I’d rather pass peacefully, if my time has come. It’s a… unsettling thought, but I believe that’s my preference.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful and courageous answer, Evann. It’s important to consider these difficult questions. We'll document your preference against CPR. Now, let's talk about mechanical ventilation. This involves using a machine to help you breathe if you're unable to breathe on your own. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator in a similar situation?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… That’s… even more difficult than CPR, I think. The thought of being… trapped, unable to breathe on my own… No. I think I would prefer not to be placed on a ventilator. Unless it’s a temporary measure, with a reasonable chance of recovery. I don’t want to prolong my life artificially, if there’s no hope of regaining my independence. I believe… I believe quality of life is more important than simply being alive. It’s a difficult decision, but I believe that’s my preference.
DOCTOR: That's a very thoughtful and courageous answer, Evann. It’s important to consider these difficult questions. We'll document your preference against mechanical ventilation. Now, let's discuss artificial nutrition and hydration. This involves providing fluids and nutrients through a feeding tube if you're unable to eat or drink on your own. Would you want to receive artificial nutrition and hydration in a similar situation?
PATIENT: Artificial nutrition and hydration… That’s… another difficult one. It feels… unnatural, somehow. To be kept alive artificially, without being able to nourish myself… I think… I think I would prefer not to receive artificial nutrition and hydration, if I’m in a permanent vegetative state, with no chance of recovery. I don’t want to prolong my life artificially, if there’s no hope of regaining my independence. I believe… I believe it’s important to allow nature to take its course. It’s a difficult decision, but I believe that’s my preference. I want to be comfortable, and I don’t want to be a burden on others. I want to pass peacefully, if my time has come.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful and courageous answer, Evann. It’s important to consider these difficult questions. We'll document your preference against artificial nutrition and hydration in the event of a permanent vegetative state with no chance of recovery. Now, let’s move on to pain management. How do you feel about receiving pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it might shorten your life?
PATIENT: Pain management… That… that feels different. Pain is… unbearable. To suffer needlessly… Yes. Absolutely. I want to receive pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it might shorten my life. Comfort is… paramount. I don't want to spend my final days in agony. If my quality of life is poor, and there’s no hope of recovery, I want to be comfortable. I want to be free from pain. I believe that’s my preference. It’s… it’s important to prioritize comfort and dignity.
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful answer, Evann. We’ll document your preference to receive pain medication to relieve suffering, even if it might shorten your life. Now, let’s talk about who you would want to make healthcare decisions for you if you were unable to communicate. Do you have a designated healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: A designated healthcare proxy… No. I don’t believe so. I’ve never gotten around to… formally designating anyone. Honestly, I’m… rather isolated. I don’t have many close family members or friends. I suppose… I haven’t thought about it much. It’s a rather… daunting task. I'm not sure who I would even trust with such a responsibility. I suppose we could leave it open, and let the hospital decide? Or is that not advisable?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. It's very common for people not to have a designated healthcare proxy. Leaving it open to the hospital is an option, but it can be… complicated. The hospital will follow the legal hierarchy, which typically prioritizes immediate family members. However, that can lead to disagreements and conflict, especially if there are complex family dynamics. Alternatively, we could discuss the possibility of appointing a public guardian. They are professionals appointed by the court to make healthcare decisions on your behalf. However, they may not be as familiar with your personal values and preferences as someone you know. It's entirely up to you. We can leave it open, appoint a public guardian, or you can take some time to consider who you might trust with this responsibility. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A public guardian… That… that sounds rather impersonal. I suppose it’s better than nothing, but… I’d prefer to avoid that, if possible. I’m not sure I trust a stranger with such a… personal decision. Perhaps… perhaps I’ll take some time to consider it. Maybe… maybe a distant cousin? I haven’t spoken to her in years, but she’s always seemed… sensible. I’ll think about it. For now, perhaps we can leave it open? And I’ll… I’ll try to reach out to my cousin. Yes, let’s leave it open for now. And I’ll consider my options.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very reasonable plan, Evann. We'll leave the healthcare proxy designation open for now, and you can take some time to consider your options. Now, we're almost finished. Is there anything else you'd like to add or any other specific wishes you'd like to document?
PATIENT: Hmmm… I… I suppose I would like it to be known that I value… simplicity. I don’t want any… extravagant interventions, if there’s no real hope of recovery. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially, just for the sake of it. And… I would like to be treated with dignity and respect, regardless of my condition. I believe that’s all. I think I’ve covered everything. It's a rather… unsettling conversation, but I’m glad we had it. I feel… a little more prepared now.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Evann. Those are very important wishes, and we’ll definitely document them. We've covered everything, and you’ve done a remarkable job articulating your preferences. This is your Advance Directive. It outlines your wishes regarding healthcare decisions, and it will be kept on file with the hospital. Please review it carefully and let me know if you have any questions or would like to make any changes. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you’ve answered all my questions. You’ve been… remarkably patient and understanding. I appreciate your guidance. I suppose… this concludes our conversation? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Evann, this concludes our conversation. I’m glad I could help. Remember, you can always revisit this document and make changes as your preferences evolve. If you have any further questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care, Evann. .
