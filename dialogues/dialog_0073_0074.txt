DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I'm Dr. Korrell. It says here you're ninety years young. Quite a milestone. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good mornin' to you too, Doctor. Ninety years, feels like yesterday and a hundred years all at once, if you know what I mean. My blood pressure's been actin' up, that's why I'm here. My regular doctor told me to come see someone… she said it needed lookin' at.
DOCTOR: Alright. “Acting up” can mean a lot of things. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Well, I get these headaches, mostly in the back of my head. And sometimes I feel dizzy when I stand up too fast. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps checkin' on me, says I look a little… pale sometimes. Mostly just tired, I guess. It’s been goin’ on for a few weeks now, maybe a month. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Headaches and dizziness… and your daughter’s noticed some paleness. Okay. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed… not really. Oh, wait. My grandson, Billy, he moved back home with his little ones. Been helpin' him out with the babies. Lots of extra runnin' around, I suppose. But nothin' major. Just… busier. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Busy can certainly be a factor. And is this headache constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. It ain't there all the time. Some days I don't even notice it. Other days… well, it’s just a dull ache. Not real sharp, more like a pressure, you know? It’s worst in the mornin', usually. And when I get excited, talkin’ with folks, it seems to get a bit worse too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been checking your blood pressure at home at all?
PATIENT: No, honey, I haven’t. My daughter has one of them machines, but I don’t rightly know how to use it. She showed me once, but… well, things slip my mind these days. I just figured that’s what doctors are for – to check these things. Sorry I can't be more help with that.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Steines. That's what I'm here for. We'll get it checked right here. Let’s take your blood pressure now, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, dear. Whatever you think is best. Just gettin' old is a mighty strange thing. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just relax your arm for me, please. And try not to talk while I'm taking the reading, it can affect the results. Now, just breathe normally…
PATIENT: Alright, honey. I’ll be quiet as a mouse. Just let me know if it squeezes too tight, alright? This arm ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. 162 over 98. A bit elevated. Heart sounds… a little fast, but regular. No murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Your heart is beating a bit faster than I’d like, and your blood pressure is definitely higher than it should be. Have you been feeling any chest pain, shortness of breath, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No chest pain, no sir. And I haven't noticed my ankles swellin', but my feet… they feel a little tired sometimes, but that's just from bein' on 'em all day, helpin' Billy with the babies. I haven’t had any trouble breathin' either, thankfully. Just the headaches and dizziness now and then. It’s mostly just… weariness, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a full picture, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it... I think my mama had somethin' like that. But me? Not that I recall. The doctor I used to see, Doc Hemlock, he just always told me to watch my salt. He passed away a few years back, bless his soul. I've been goin' to a different one since then, but she's always seemed so rushed. I don't rightly remember her sayin' anything about high blood pressure. I just figured it was part of gettin' old, you know?
DOCTOR: Well, we'll get to the bottom of it. Now, I'd like to draw some blood for a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. This will give us a better idea of your kidney function and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Always did hate needles. But… if it’ll help, I guess so. Just don’t poke me too hard, alright, dear? And tell me if it's gonna hurt. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat when it comes to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: It’ll be a quick prick, Ms. Steines, I promise. And I'll be as gentle as possible. It's standard procedure when investigating these sorts of issues. The nurse will be in shortly to get that started for you. In the meantime, I'm going to write up a prescription for a mild diuretic to help lower your blood pressure slightly. It’s just a starting point, alright?
PATIENT: A… di-what now? A diuretic? Sounds mighty fancy. What does it do, exactly? I just want to make sure I understand what I'm takin' before I go fillin' prescriptions. I don't want no medicines messin' with my head.
DOCTOR: It’s a water pill, Ms. Steines. It helps your kidneys remove excess fluid from your body, which lowers your blood pressure. It’s a very common medication. But we'll monitor you closely. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've taken a little bit of everything over the years, mostly for aches and pains. I did have a bad reaction to somethin’ once, years ago, but I can't for the life of me remember what it was. My daughter always reminds me to tell the doctors, but… well, my memory ain’t what it used to be. I just try to avoid takin' too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, the nurse will get you started with the diuretic. She’ll go over everything with you in detail. I'm also going to order a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. We’ll need to rule out all possibilities. And I’d like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re responding to the medication. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Two weeks… sounds alright, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I got a grandson who's dependin' on me. But… you're sure this ain't somethin' serious? I just don’t want to be worryin' myself sick over nothin’.
DOCTOR: It's likely just age-related hypertension, Ms. Steines. Very common. But we're being thorough. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain everything in detail. Don’t hesitate to ask her any questions you may have. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: .
