DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. Or, not working well, I should say. It’s… difficult to go, if you understand. It just takes a long time, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like I’ve gone all the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty with urination can be quite bothersome. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this?
PATIENT: Well, it’s been going on for… oh, maybe a month now? It started slowly, just feeling like I had to strain a little. But it’s gotten worse. Now, I really have to push to get anything out. And then I worry I haven’t emptied completely. It’s… unsettling. Do you need to know when it happens? Like, all the time, or just sometimes?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Ms. Yadao. Yes, please, tell me more about when it happens. Is it difficult with every urination, or are there times when it's easier?
PATIENT: It’s… almost always difficult, to be honest. First thing in the morning is the worst, I think. I have to get up and go several times before anything really happens. And at night… well, I wake up a couple of times to go, and it’s the same thing. Slow, and I feel like I'm pushing forever. During the day it's… slightly better, but still not easy. I don’t feel like I can just… go when I need to, if that makes sense. I have to plan around it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Yadao. It sounds like this is significantly impacting your daily life, and planning around it is certainly not ideal. You mentioned waking up multiple times at night. Approximately how many times would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… some nights it’s just once, but other nights… maybe two or three times. It’s hard to say exactly, because sometimes I drift back to sleep quickly, and other times I’m up for a good while. But almost every night, I have to get up at least once. It’s not a full bladder, necessarily, just… the feeling like I need to go, and then the difficulty getting it out. And I worry I’m not getting enough sleep because of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That's very helpful. Now, aside from the difficulty and frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I haven't noticed any pain, thankfully. And no fever or anything like that. Sometimes… sometimes the stream is weak. It doesn't come out with much force, if you know what I mean. It just sort of dribbles. And occasionally, I feel like I haven’t emptied my bladder completely, even after I’ve gone. I have to try again a few minutes later. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Yadao. Weak stream and feeling like you don’t completely empty your bladder are important details. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks… normal, I suppose. The color is usual, and I don’t think it smells any different than usual. I drink plenty of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. I haven’t seen any blood or anything alarming like that. I worry about infections, but I don't have a burning sensation or anything like that, if that’s what you’re thinking.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I'm looking at your chart here. I see you have a history of hypertension, which is well-controlled, and you had your gallbladder removed several years ago. Are there any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Those are the main things. The high blood pressure, and the gallbladder. Oh, and I had a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s not too bad. It doesn’t bother me too much, and I manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers when I need to. Nothing that would affect… this, I don't think. I've never had any problems with my kidneys or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… For my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And when my knees bother me, I take Ibuprofen, but only as needed. Maybe two or three times a week, if that. Oh, and I take a Vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low on it last year. That's it, I think. Just those three things. I don't take anything else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, Ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any problems with medications. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I don't seem to have inherited that allergy. I’ve never had any trouble with hives, or swelling, or anything like that. So, no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, Ms. Yadao, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your abdomen, checking your reflexes, and a gentle pelvic exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me assess your bladder and surrounding structures. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s necessary. A physical exam… yes. I’m a bit nervous about the… the pelvic exam, if you don’t mind me saying. But if you think it’s important, then I’m willing. Just… please be gentle? I haven’t had one of those in a long time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. I understand your apprehension, and I assure you I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. We can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and checking your reflexes, and we can discuss the pelvic exam further before proceeding. First, could you lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… better. Just… let me know what you’re doing as you go, please? It helps to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me listen for any abnormalities in your bladder or other organs. I’m just going to press the stethoscope gently against your skin. You may hear some swishing sounds, that’s normal. Everything sounds normal so far. Now I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if you feel any pain. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… okay. A little bit of pressure, but no pain. It feels normal, I suppose. Just like a regular check-up. You’re pressing… here, and here… And now… a little higher up? No, still no pain. It's a bit uncomfortable lying flat, but that's not you, that's just my old bones. Everything feels… fine, I guess.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes in your legs and feet. This will help me assess the nerves that control your bladder. I’ll use a small hammer to gently tap on your tendons. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Now, before we discuss the pelvic exam, do you have any questions about what we've done so far?
PATIENT: No, not really. Everything seems… standard. You listened, you poked, you tapped. It was all… gentle, like you promised. The pelvic exam… what exactly does that involve? I've… it’s been a very long time, and I don’t really remember. Is it painful? I suppose that's my main worry.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Ms. Yadao. The pelvic exam involves a visual inspection of the external genitals, and then I will gently insert a speculum into your vagina to visualize your cervix. This allows me to look for any abnormalities. I will also perform a bimanual exam, where I gently insert one finger into your vagina and the other into your rectum to feel your uterus, ovaries, and surrounding structures. It can be a little uncomfortable, especially if you haven’t had one in a long time. There may be some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. I use plenty of lubrication, and we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. It helps me assess the strength of your pelvic floor muscles and identify any potential causes for your urinary symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that… explains it better. Visual inspection, speculum, feeling… it sounds… thorough. The feeling part… that’s what worries me the most. I suppose I understand why you want to do it, but… it’s a bit daunting. Is there any way to… make it less uncomfortable? Maybe if I try to relax? I’m not sure I can, to be honest. But I’ll try.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. Relaxation is key, and I completely understand your apprehension. We can take things very slowly, and you are in control the entire time. I will explain every step before I do it. I also encourage you to take deep breaths throughout the exam. Tensing your muscles can actually make it more uncomfortable, so trying to relax your pelvic floor muscles will help. I will use a warm speculum and plenty of lubrication. And again, we can stop at any time if you feel any discomfort. I can also position your legs in a way that is most comfortable for you. Before we start, do you need to empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Oh, good point. Yes, I probably should. It's always better to be empty, I suppose. Give me just a moment. I’ll be right back. And thank you for… being patient. It’s a bit nerve-wracking, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Yadao. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re ready. There’s no rush at all.
PATIENT: Alright. I’m ready, I think. As ready as I’ll ever be. Let’s get it over with, shall we? Just… please remember to tell me what you’re doing, like you promised. And… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Yadao. I will explain every step before I do it and be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to have you lie back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. Then, I’ll gently drape a sheet over your lower body to maintain your privacy. Now, I’m going to perform a visual inspection of your external genitals. This is just to look for any redness, swelling, or other abnormalities. I will tell you before I do anything. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Visual inspection… I understand. Just… don’t surprise me, please. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, I’m just looking at the skin around your vulva. Everything appears normal so far – no redness, swelling, or lesions. Now, I’m going to gently insert the speculum into your vagina. It's a plastic instrument that helps me visualize your cervix. I’ll use plenty of lubrication to make it more comfortable. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort. How are you feeling so far?
PATIENT: It’s… a bit uncomfortable, yes. Pressure, like you said. Not painful, exactly, but… awkward. Is it almost done? I feel like it’s going in quite far. Just… tell me what you’re looking at. It helps to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, we're almost there. I'm just gently opening the speculum to visualize your cervix. It's the opening to your uterus. Everything appears normal so far – your cervix is pink and healthy. I’m just looking for any inflammation, lesions, or discharge. I'll only be a moment longer. Alright, we're done. I'm gently removing the speculum now. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Much better. That was… not pleasant, but I suppose it’s over now. It’s good to know everything looked normal. A little uncomfortable, yes, but… I’m glad it’s done. What’s next? Are you going to… feel things now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Yadao, the next step is a bimanual exam. This involves gently inserting one finger into your vagina and the other into your rectum to feel your uterus, ovaries, and surrounding structures. This helps me assess the size and shape of your organs and check for any tenderness or masses. It may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll use plenty of lubrication. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: It’s… different. A bit awkward, yes, but not painful. Pressure, like you said. I can feel… something pressing. Is that my uterus? It feels a bit… hard. And the other finger… it’s not pleasant, but I can manage. Just let me know what you’re feeling for.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, I’m gently palpating your uterus. It feels normal in size and shape, slightly enlarged but that’s likely due to age. I’m also feeling your ovaries. They feel normal as well, no tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal so far. I’m also checking the surrounding structures. Alright, we’re done. I’m gently removing my fingers now. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Much better. That was… not my favorite part, but I survived. Everything felt normal, you said? That’s good. It’s a relief to hear that. I’m glad it’s over. So… what happens now? Are you going to give me some bad news, or… what’s the plan?
DOCTOR: No bad news, Ms. Yadao. Everything felt normal during the exam, which is very encouraging. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I suspect you may be experiencing urinary retention with overflow, meaning your bladder isn't emptying completely, and some urine is remaining after you go. This can happen with age, as the bladder muscles weaken. To confirm this, I’d like to order a post-void residual test. This involves using an ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. It's a quick and painless test. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A test… yes, alright. If it’s quick and painless, then I suppose it’s better than nothing. Urinary retention… that sounds… unpleasant. So, the bladder doesn’t empty all the way? Is there anything I can do about it? Exercises, or something? I don’t want to have to live with this, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Yadao. It’s good that you’re proactive about finding a solution. Yes, urinary retention means some urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. There are several things we can try. First, we’ll get the PVR test to see how much urine is remaining. Then, we can discuss bladder training exercises, also known as Kegel exercises. These exercises can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles and improve bladder control. We can also discuss timed voiding – going to the bathroom on a regular schedule, even if you don’t feel the urge. In some cases, medication can also be helpful. We'll start with the PVR test and then create a plan based on the results. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A plan. I like plans. Bladder training… exercises. I suppose I can try that. And the timed voiding… I’ve always just gone when I need to, so that will be different. Alright. Let’s do the test. When can I get it done? And what do I need to do to prepare? I don’t want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do the PVR test right here in the office today. No preparation is needed, just come to the bathroom and urinate as you normally would. Then, I’ll use the ultrasound device to measure the remaining urine. It takes just a few minutes. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, come in and show you to the bathroom. She’ll explain everything in detail. After the test, we’ll discuss the results and create a personalized plan to help you manage your symptoms. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect. Maria, you said? Alright. I’ll go with Maria, and get the test done. And then… a plan. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a bit more hopeful now. It’s good to know there are things we can try.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’ll work through this together. Maria will be right in to assist you. Please don’t hesitate to let me or Maria know if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Alright. I will. Thank you again.
