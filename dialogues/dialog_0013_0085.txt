DOCTOR: Hi Gabbrielle, welcome. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, hello. It’s… concerning, really. This patch of skin, you see? It just changed. It wasn’t like this a month ago, and now… well, it doesn’t look right. I keep a very close eye on these things, you understand. One has to, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A changing patch of skin is definitely something we want to take a look at. Just to be thorough, can you tell me where exactly this patch is located on your body?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s on my left forearm. Right… about halfway between my elbow and wrist. It’s quite prominent, even with my sleeves on, which is… irritating. Really, one expects a bit more consistency from one’s own body, don’t you think? It’s not as though it’s a difficult thing to maintain.
DOCTOR: Right, forearm, halfway between your elbow and wrist. Okay. And when you say it changed, can you describe how it changed?
PATIENT: Well, it was… a normal skin tone, I suppose. Perhaps a little paler than the rest, but nothing alarming. Now it’s… mottled. Like someone took a brush and did a very bad job painting it with different shades of brown. And it’s… slightly raised. Not bumpy, exactly, just… not flat. Honestly, it looks rather untidy. I’ve always had very good skin, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, “mottled” with different shades of brown, slightly raised, and not flat. And this change happened over how long?
PATIENT: Oh, I’d say… the last month, definitely. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully. It sort of… crept up on me. I noticed it getting a little darker around the edges, and then the uneven color started. I check regularly, so I’m quite certain it wasn't there a month ago. One has to be diligent, you know. It's not something one can simply ignore.
DOCTOR: Right, crept up over the last month. And have you noticed any other changes besides the color and being slightly raised?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. No, not really. It doesn’t itch, thank goodness. And it’s not… painful, or burning, or anything unpleasant like that. Just… visually displeasing. And a bit worrying, naturally. It’s just… there. A blemish, really. A very unwelcome one.
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching, no pain, just a visual change. Have you noticed any bleeding, oozing, or crusting?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Perfectly dry. Which is… good, I suppose. Though I do keep a very close watch. One wouldn't want it to become something messy, would one? It's always best to address these things promptly. Honestly, it's rather unsettling. A perfectly healthy body shouldn't just develop these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No bleeding, oozing, or crusting. And you said you've been checking it regularly. Has anything changed recently in your life that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Relevant? Goodness. Let me see… No, not really. My routine is quite… fixed. Husband and I mostly stay at home, tending to the garden. We haven’t traveled anywhere. I haven’t changed soaps, or lotions, or anything like that. It’s all rather… baffling. Honestly, I can’t think of a single thing that would cause this. It’s simply… appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, routine hasn’t changed. And just to cover all bases, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. Perfectly healthy, as I said. Husband had a bit of a cough last month, but it cleared up quickly. Nothing serious. I made him plenty of tea and kept him away from the garden, naturally. I’m very careful about germs, you understand. It's rather improbable that a simple cold would cause this, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, that seems unlikely. Okay, let’s take a look at this patch on your forearm. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Here. There. Do be careful not to touch it unnecessarily, if you please. One doesn't want to… introduce anything. It's best to be cautious, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see it. It's about… two centimeters in diameter, slightly raised, irregular borders. It doesn’t feel warm to the touch. There’s no tenderness when I press on it. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes nearby. It's difficult to say definitively just by looking at it, but it does warrant further investigation. I want to rule out a few possibilities. Have you ever had anything like this biopsied before?
PATIENT: Biopsied? Oh, goodness, no. Never. That sounds… rather drastic, doesn’t it? I mean, it’s just a patch of skin. A slightly discolored patch of skin. One doesn't simply go around cutting bits off oneself. Is that really necessary? It seems rather… excessive. I would rather not, if you don't mind. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps a cream? Or some sort of… scan?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and I wouldn’t suggest anything unnecessary. A biopsy is the best way to determine exactly what we're dealing with. It’s a very quick procedure – we numb the area first, so it shouldn’t be painful. It helps us rule out anything concerning, like melanoma, or other skin cancers. While a cream might temporarily improve the appearance, it won’t tell us the cause of the change. As for a scan, it wouldn’t be helpful at this stage, as we need to know what we’re looking for before we can decide if imaging is necessary. However, if you’re very uncomfortable with a biopsy right now, we can start with a Dermoscopy. It's a non-invasive skin surface microscopy that allows a detailed view of skin lesions to help assess the lesion. If the dermoscopy is concerning, then a biopsy would be highly recommended. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A… dermoscopy? That sounds… less alarming than cutting bits off. A detailed view, you say? Very well. As long as it doesn't involve any… instruments penetrating my skin, I suppose that would be acceptable. Yes, let's start with that. A detailed view sounds much more… reasonable. Do be gentle, though. One doesn't want to upset the skin any further.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be very gentle. Okay, I'm going to apply a little gel to your skin to help with the image clarity. It’s a non-irritating gel, completely harmless. Then, I’ll place the dermatoscope on the patch and take a look. It won’t take long at all.
PATIENT: Very well. Do be thorough, if you please. I want to be certain we’re getting a proper view. Honestly, one would think a simple patch of skin wouldn’t require such… scrutiny. But, if it will give us peace of mind, I suppose I can tolerate it. Let me know if you see anything… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some atypical features, which are not typical of a benign lesion. There's some irregular pigmentation and the border isn't sharply defined. While it’s not definitively cancerous, these findings do warrant a biopsy to get a clear diagnosis. I'm going to recommend a shave biopsy. It's a quick procedure where we remove a very thin layer of the skin for examination under a microscope. It usually doesn’t require stitches and heals quickly. Would you be comfortable proceeding with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound… promising. Atypical features? Irregular pigmentation? Honestly, I was hoping it was just a bit of sun damage. A shave biopsy, you say? A bit of skin removed? Is it terribly painful? And will it… leave a scar? I must say, I’m becoming increasingly apprehensive. Perhaps… perhaps we could get a second opinion? Before resorting to… removing bits of me?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, and getting a second opinion is always a reasonable request. I'm happy to refer you to a dermatologist for a consultation. They can review the dermoscopy images and perform their own examination. However, I want to be upfront with you: delaying a biopsy when there are atypical features carries a small risk. The sooner we get a diagnosis, the sooner we can determine the best course of action, if any is needed. The shave biopsy itself is usually quite quick and relatively painless. We numb the area thoroughly with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn’t feel much discomfort. It might sting a little, but it's usually well-tolerated. As for scarring, it depends on the size of the biopsy and your skin's healing ability, but usually, any scarring is minimal and fades over time. Would you like me to make a referral to a dermatologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: A second opinion… yes, that sounds… prudent. I would feel much more comfortable having another professional assess the situation. Especially after hearing about ‘atypical features’. Honestly, the thought of anything being removed… it’s unsettling. Yes, please, a referral to a dermatologist would be most appreciated. And one with a good reputation, if you please. I’d like someone thorough and… reassuring. Do you have anyone you’d recommend?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I highly recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance. She’s a board-certified dermatologist with excellent reviews, and she has a very gentle approach. Her practice is located about 30 minutes from here in Oakhaven. I’ll have my assistant print out her contact information and referral form for you. In the meantime, I’ll document our findings and the dermoscopy images in your chart. It’s also important to protect the area from the sun. I recommend wearing a long sleeve shirt and applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher whenever you’re outdoors. Do you have any questions for me before I finalize the referral?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just the contact information for Dr. Vance, please. And thank you for not dismissing my concerns. Honestly, it’s reassuring to have someone take the time to explain things properly, even if the news isn’t… ideal. Sun protection, yes, of course. My husband always says I’m too pale. Hopefully, this will keep it from getting any worse. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. My assistant will bring that information to you momentarily. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any further questions or concerns after your appointment with Dr. Vance. In the meantime, take care, and remember to protect your skin. Have a good day, Gabbrielle.
