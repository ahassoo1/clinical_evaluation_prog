DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it's… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the bathroom quite a bit. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a while now, I suppose. It's difficult to say exactly when it started, you understand. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But it's enough to be… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's perfectly alright to be embarrassed, but we need to figure out what's going on. “Quite a bit” can mean different things to different people. Can you tell me roughly how many times a day you're needing to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Numbers… yes. That is difficult. Let me think. Perhaps… six, seven times? Maybe more on days I drink a bit of tea. It’s hard to keep track, truly. I don’t really count, you see. Is that… helpful? I apologize for the vagueness. It just feels like… constantly needing to go.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful, Mr. Verbos. Don't apologize. Six to seven times a day is more frequent than average. And does this happen mostly during the day, or are you getting up at night to urinate as well?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. At night too, I’m afraid. Not every night, thankfully. Perhaps two or three times a week? It disrupts my sleep, naturally. It’s not a full bladder each time, you understand. Just… a need to go. It's a rather small amount, often. It’s just… frequent. Is this… concerning? I do try to limit my fluids before bed, but it doesn’t always seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, frequent urination both day and night, even with limiting fluids. And you say the amount is often small. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… No, not really pain. A slight… discomfort, perhaps. A little stinging sometimes, but it’s fleeting. It doesn’t last. It’s not severe enough to keep me from going, you understand. Just… a little irritation. It’s hard to describe. It’s more of a… sensitivity, I suppose. Does that make sense? I’m not sure I’m being very clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, so slight discomfort or stinging, not persistent pain. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… urine? Oh. Well… now that you mention it, perhaps it’s a little cloudier than usual. And the color… I suppose it's not as clear as it once was. A bit… pale, perhaps? I don’t pay terribly close attention, you understand. It all looks rather the same to me, truthfully. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, cloudiness and a paler color. Let's get a quick look at a urine sample. We have a private restroom right down the hall. It’ll help us to get a better idea of what might be going on. Do you think you could collect a sample for me?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. A urine sample. Of course. Down the hall, you say? Very well. I’ll… I’ll go right away. I hope I can manage. It’s been a while since I’ve had to… do this for medical purposes. Do I need a specific container? Or shall I just…?
DOCTOR: There are collection cups in the restroom, Mr. Verbos. And don't worry, the nurses will guide you if you need any assistance. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you get back.
PATIENT: Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. It’s… a little daunting, all of this. But I’ll do my best. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s see what the results tell us. While we wait, let's go over your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
