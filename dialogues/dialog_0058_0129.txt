DOCTOR: Hello Dawnetta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Todoroivich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day. It's my…well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking ‘em for years. Is that what this is about? I just want to know if I need some fancy test or what.
DOCTOR: Black, tarry stool, alright. And you’re concerned it’s related to your arthritis medication?
PATIENT: Well, duh. What else would it be? I haven’t been eating anything…unusual. And I certainly haven’t been bleeding anywhere. I keep myself very clean, thank you very much. It’s those pills, I’m telling you. They always warn you about everything on the television. Is it dangerous? Just tell me straight, I don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. It could be related to the pain medication, yes. Those medications can sometimes cause stomach irritation and bleeding, which can lead to black stools – what we call melena. However, it’s not the only possibility. We need to rule out other things. It’s potentially serious, and we need to investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms – fatigue, weakness, dizziness, or a change in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. “Potentially serious”? You’re just trying to scare an old woman. Look, I'm a little tired, maybe. Who isn't at my age? And my appetite…well, it’s not like I’m a growing girl. I eat when I'm hungry. Honestly, I just want a quick answer. Do I need to stop taking the pills, or don't I? And is there a pill for this problem? Because I need those pills for my joints. They’re all I’ve got.
DOCTOR: It’s not about scaring you, it’s about being thorough. And yes, stopping the pills without knowing the cause could be…problematic. We need to find out why your stool is black. It's not simply a matter of taking a pill for it. We'll need to do some tests. Specifically, I’d like to order a stool occult blood test, and a complete blood count, just to see if there’s any evidence of blood loss and anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, wonderful. More poking and prodding. Fine. Whatever. Just make it quick. And can’t you just…look at it under a microscope or something? I don't fancy giving up a perfectly good stool sample for nothing. And who pays for these tests? Medicare, I presume? I don't have money to throw around on things that probably aren't even wrong.
DOCTOR: We can certainly look at it under a microscope, but that won’t give us the full picture. The occult blood test detects microscopic amounts of blood that you wouldn’t be able to see. It’s more sensitive. And yes, Medicare should cover it, but billing can be…complicated. Our office will handle the paperwork, but you may receive some bills initially. We’ll work with them to resolve it. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab. They’ll call you to schedule the collection. It’s a fairly simple process. Do you have any questions about how to collect the sample?
PATIENT: Oh, collecting it? Honestly, do I look like I've never used a toilet before? Just tell me where to go and I’ll…handle it. But I swear, if this turns out to be nothing, I’m writing a strongly worded letter. And don’t expect me to come back if it’s just a little bit of something I ate. I’ve got better things to do than sit around waiting for test results. Is that it? Am I free to go?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re free to go. The lab is located at… The lab is located at 14 Oak Street. They're open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm. They’ll give you instructions on how to prepare the sample when you arrive. Here's the requisition form. Please take this with you. And I'll have the nurse give you a handout with general instructions as well, just in case. Please call the office if you have any difficulties scheduling the appointment or if you have any questions. Have a…day.
PATIENT: .
