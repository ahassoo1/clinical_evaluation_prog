DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. Though I wish the circumstances were better. It’s my… well, it’s a friend, really. She’s been awfully yellow lately. Her skin, you see. And the doctor she’s been seeing… he’s young, bless his heart, but I don’t think he’s getting to the bottom of it. She has trouble with her liver, or had trouble. Hepatitis, I believe. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. I just want to make sure she gets the right care.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re bringing your friend in because she’s experiencing jaundice – the yellowing of the skin – and you’re concerned about her previous history of hepatitis. That’s very thoughtful of you. To start, could you tell me a little more about your friend?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Yes, the yellowing. It’s quite pronounced, you see. And she’s been… tired. Very tired. As for her… let me think. Her name is… Elara. Elara Vance. She’s… well, she’s a bit older than me, maybe in her early eighties now. She lives alone, which is why I’m bringing her. She’s a quiet woman. Kept to herself mostly, even before all this started. I believe she worked as a… a librarian, for many years. Though details… they slip my mind. Is that helpful? I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Durig, thank you. Elara Vance, early eighties, retired librarian, lives alone… and experiencing fatigue along with the yellowing. Knowing she lives alone is particularly important. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the yellowing and the fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. It wasn’t sudden, you see. It was… gradual. I’d say… maybe six weeks ago? Perhaps a little longer. She called me, complaining of being tired, and I noticed the color when I visited her last month. It wasn’t terribly noticeable then, but it’s gotten… much worse since. Honestly, the dates… they’re all blurring together. It feels like a very long time, though. A very long time.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s easy to lose track of time. Six weeks, and worsening over that period… That’s useful information. Has she had any other symptoms besides the fatigue and yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. She mentioned… some itching. Yes, quite a bit of itching. And she hasn’t been eating much. She says she feels nauseous, but she’s always been a bit of a picky eater, so it’s hard to tell if that’s new. And… she’s been more confused lately. Forgetful, really. Though, well, we’re both forgetful these days, aren’t we? But this seems… different. More pronounced. I believe she also complained of some pain, in her… abdomen, was it? On the right side. But she doesn’t complain easily, so I couldn’t be sure. Is that… helpful? I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Durig, that’s very helpful. So, we’re looking at fatigue, worsening jaundice, itching, decreased appetite, nausea, confusion, and right-sided abdominal pain. Do you know if she’s seen any other doctors recently, besides the young one you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a good question. She doesn't share much, you see. She did mention a specialist… a liver specialist, I think? Several years ago, when she was first diagnosed with the hepatitis. But I don’t know his name, or where he was located. She said she didn’t continue seeing him, something about… cost, I believe. She’s very independent, doesn't like to ask for help. I really couldn't tell you much beyond that. It’s all a bit… hazy. I apologize. I wish I could be more assistance.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Ms. Durig. You’re doing wonderfully. It's very common for patients to have difficulty remembering details, especially regarding past medical care. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions about her medical history, if that's alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Ask away. Though, as I’ve mentioned, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’ll do my best to answer, but please forgive me if I’m… vague. I just want what’s best for Elara. She’s a good woman. A very good woman.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with her past medical history, as best as you know it. Besides the hepatitis, has she ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… She had… high blood pressure, I believe. Years ago. She was on medication for it, but I don’t know if she still is. And… arthritis, in her hands. It bothered her quite a bit, made it difficult for her to… to garden. She loved gardening. She also had… a gallbladder removed, many years ago. Perhaps twenty years ago? It was quite a difficult recovery, I recall. Other than that… I truly can’t recall. She doesn’t talk much about her health. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I wish I could be more helpful. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Durig. High blood pressure, arthritis, and a past gallbladder removal. We'll make a note of those. Has she ever had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a difficult question. I seem to recall something about… her hip. A fall, many years ago. I believe she needed a replacement, or some sort of repair. But it was a long time ago, and the details are… fuzzy. She didn’t talk about it much, even then. It was a painful experience, as I recall. She was quite frail afterwards. Other than that… no, I don’t believe so. But honestly, Doctor, my memory is failing me. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I wish I could offer more concrete information.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Durig. You're providing as much information as you can, and that’s what’s important. A hip replacement or repair in the past. Now, could you tell me about her family history?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history… That’s… a difficult one. Elara… never spoke much about her family. She was… estranged from them, as I understand it. She had a brother, I believe. But they hadn’t spoken in years. I never met him. As for medical conditions… I’m afraid I have no idea. She never discussed it. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I wish I could be more helpful, but I truly don’t know anything about her family’s medical history. I apologize. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Durig. It’s not always possible to have complete family history information, especially in these situations. Now, let's talk about her social history. Does Elara smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a delicate question. She never discussed those things with me, you see. But I can say with certainty that she never smoked. She always disapproved of it. As for alcohol… she occasionally had a glass of wine with dinner, but very rarely. Perhaps once or twice a month? She wasn't a heavy drinker, not at all. And as for… recreational drugs… absolutely not. She would never. She was a very… proper woman. Quiet, reserved, and… very dignified. I can say with certainty she never used any recreational drugs. Is that… helpful? I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to recall personal details.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Durig. No smoking, rare alcohol use, and no recreational drug use. Finally, does Elara have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Let me think. She mentioned… a reaction to penicillin, years ago. A rash, as I recall. Nothing life-threatening, but it made her quite uncomfortable. Other than that… I don’t believe so. She doesn’t take many medications, just something for her… arthritis. A small white pill. I don’t know the name of it. And as for other allergies… no, I don’t believe she has any. She’s generally a very… healthy woman, despite everything. Is that… sufficient? I’m afraid I’ve exhausted my memory, Doctor. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I truly wish I could offer more concrete information. But I’ve done my best.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. You've provided a lot of valuable information, and I appreciate your efforts. A penicillin allergy and a medication for arthritis. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam on Elara, if that’s alright. It will help me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. This will involve listening to her heart and lungs, checking her abdomen, and looking at her skin. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. She… she’s a bit frail, you see. Please be gentle. And… she doesn’t like being touched unexpectedly. A quiet explanation beforehand would be… appreciated. I’ll be right here, if she gets… anxious. I truly appreciate you taking the time to examine her. She’s a good woman, and I want to make sure she receives the best possible care. I apologize in advance if she’s… difficult. She’s not used to being fussed over.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain everything to her as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. I understand she may be anxious, and I'll take my time. You're welcome to stay with her throughout the exam if you'd like. Let's start by checking her vital signs – her blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Hello Elara, my name is Dr. Dashevsky. Your friend has told me a little bit about what's been going on. I'm just going to take a few measurements to start, and then we'll do a quick examination. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. It involves wrapping a cuff around your arm – do you mind if I do that?
PATIENT: .
