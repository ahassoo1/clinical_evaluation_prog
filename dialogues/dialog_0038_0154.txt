DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Auelua, you say? Yes, well... it’s this… trouble I’ve been having. With… going to the bathroom. It keeps coming back, you see. A terrible nuisance, really. I don't... I don't quite recall when it started, exactly. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of trouble with going to the bathroom that keeps coming back. I understand it's been going on for a while now, and you're having trouble pinpointing exactly when it started. That's alright, we can work through it. Could you tell me a little more about how it's trouble?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How is it trouble… Let me see. It… burns, mostly. When I have to go. And sometimes… well, it feels like I haven't emptied everything, you know? It’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And then… the urgency. I have to rush, sometimes. It's dreadful when I'm out shopping. I really don't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning when you go, a feeling of not emptying completely, and urgency – sometimes feeling like you need to rush. That sounds really unpleasant, especially when you're out and about. Is that all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. It’s not… constant, thankfully. There are periods where I don't notice it at all. And then… it flares up. Like it's been doing lately. I… I can't say for certain what makes it worse. Perhaps… drinking coffee? I do enjoy a cup in the mornings. But I can't be sure. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it comes and goes in flares, and you're not sure of anything specific that triggers it, though you suspect coffee might play a part. That's helpful to know. Now, aside from this bathroom trouble, have you noticed anything else different lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… different? Let me think. Oh, well… I've been a little tired, perhaps. More tired than usual. But… I'm an older woman, Doctor. A little tiredness comes with the territory, doesn't it? And… my back aches. It’s been doing that on and off for years, though. I don't think that’s related. No… nothing else comes to mind. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tiredness, but you feel that’s likely age-related, and your back pain is a long-standing issue. Good to know you're aware of those things. Now, have you ever had any medical problems before – anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Significant… That’s a broad question. I… I had my appendix out when I was young. A very long time ago. And… I broke my wrist, once, falling off a bicycle. But… other than that? Not that I recall. I… I think I had the flu, a few times. Nothing serious, thankfully. I don’t go to doctors much. I prefer to… manage things myself, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a young woman, a broken wrist, and occasional flu. That’s good to know. You generally prefer to manage things on your own, I understand. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My husband, he… passed away, oh, it must be fifteen years ago now. Divorced before that, actually. A long time ago. No children, I'm afraid. My mother… she had a weak heart, I believe. And my father… he worked very hard. He… I don’t really recall anything specific about his health. We weren't very close, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your husband passed away fifteen years ago, no children. Your mother had a weak heart, and you don’t recall much about your father’s health. And are you currently taking any medications, Doctor, or any supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not a single one. I… I don’t like taking pills, you see. I prefer to stay natural. No medications, no supplements. Just… a bit of olive oil in my salad, perhaps. And a glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no medications or supplements, just olive oil and occasional wine. Good to know. Alright, Claudene. Now, I'd like to ask a few quick questions and then do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just be listening to your tummy and checking your lower back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Listening to my tummy and checking my back. Yes, go ahead. I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… please be gentle with my back. It’s a bit sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I’ll be very gentle. Okay, I'm just listening to your tummy now. Everything sounds normal – no unusual noises or tenderness. And your back… yes, it is a bit tender here on the left side. Anything sharp when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s… that’s the spot. It’s not sharp, exactly. More… a dull ache. It feels… strained, perhaps. Like I’ve been lifting something heavy. Which I haven’t, of course. I mostly sit and… read. But that spot… yes, that’s the tender one. It's been like that for a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a dull ache in the lower left side of your back, and it's been present for a while. Now, just one last thing. Have you had any recent changes in your urine – colour, smell, or any blood?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… The colour… I suppose it’s been a bit darker sometimes. But I drink a lot of tea, you see. So that could be it. And the smell… I haven’t really noticed anything different. No… no blood. Definitely not. I would remember that, wouldn't I? Oh, no, no blood.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit darker urine, potentially from tea, but no changes in smell or blood. Alright, Claudene. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you've likely got a urinary tract infection – or UTI – with some possible muscle strain in your lower back. The burning, urgency, and darker urine are all consistent with that. The back pain could be related, or just a separate issue. To be certain, I’d like to order a urine test to confirm the infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A urine test. Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. Confirm the infection, you say? Yes, go ahead. I’d like to know for certain. It's been a nuisance for so long, I suppose. What does it involve?
DOCTOR: It’s very simple. You’ll just need to provide a urine sample. I’ll give you a sterile cup, and you'll sit in the restroom and collect a sample mid-stream – that means start urinating, then collect a bit in the cup mid-way through, and finish. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: Oh. Mid-stream. Yes, I think I understand. Start, then collect, then finish. It doesn’t sound… difficult. No. I don’t think I have any questions. Just… where is the restroom?
DOCTOR: Right down that hallway, on the left. I’ll give you the cup, and you can bring the sample back when you’re ready. I’ll be right here. Take your time, and let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. Yes, alright. Down the hallway, on the left. I shall… attempt it. .
