DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my back. It’s been really bad. Hurts a lot, especially when I try to… well, just move, mostly. I think it's worse than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And you said it's worse than usual – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well… I have cancer, you know? It’s in my bones. They told me a long time ago. The pain usually comes and goes, but this… this started a few days ago and it just keeps getting worse. It's like a sharp ache, all down my back. Makes it hard to even sit up straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Larin. It’s good you told me about the cancer diagnosis; that’s important context. So, to clarify, you've been diagnosed with bone cancer previously, and this pain feels different or worse than your usual cancer-related pain. Is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Usually, it's more of a dull ache, you know? Like a heavy feeling. This is… sharp. And it doesn’t go away even when I try to rest. It’s been keeping me up at night, too. I took some of the pills the doctor gave me before, the pain pills, but they don’t seem to be helping much this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain that's not relieved by your usual pain medication, and it’s interfering with your sleep. And just to be thorough, can you point to where on your back the pain is most intense?
PATIENT: Right here. And here. It feels like… all across my lower back, but it’s worst on these sides. It kind of goes around, a little bit. And sometimes I feel it… like, shooting down my legs, but not all the time. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain radiating around to your sides and occasionally shooting down your legs. Let's get a better picture. Have you noticed anything specific that makes the pain better?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Laying down sometimes helps a little, but even then it's not much. Usually nothing makes it better. Warm water… a warm shower… that feels okay for a few minutes, but then the pain comes right back when I get out. I tried sitting in a different chair, but that didn't do anything either. It just… hurts. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any recent injuries, falls, or changes in your activity level that might have triggered this?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven't fallen or anything. I work at the factory, you know? Same job, same everything. No changes there. Just… been working. Been trying to, anyway. It's getting harder to lift things. That’s why I came in, really. Worried it’s something worse, even with the cancer.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no recent injuries or changes at work. It's good you're being proactive about getting this checked out, especially given your cancer diagnosis. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Alright, here I am. Be careful, please. It hurts when someone touches my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm going to gently feel along your spine and back muscles. Let me know immediately if anything is particularly painful. I’m starting on the right side… and yes, I see you wincing there. Definitely some tenderness. Now the left side… similar tenderness here as well. And can you try to bend forward for me, just as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ouch! That really hurts. I can't go much further. It feels like something is… stuck. And it’s sharp, like you said. Sorry, I just… can't bend much further without a lot of pain. It feels like it might make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Don’t push yourself. Now, can you try to lie on your back and lift each leg up, one at a time?
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It hurts a little, but I can do it. It feels a little worse on this side. Like a pulling feeling. I can’t lift it very high, though. It just… hurts too much. It's like a sharp pain shooting down my leg when I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Larin. That’s helpful. I’m noticing some limited range of motion and tenderness on palpation, and pain with straight leg raises, particularly on the left side. Given your history of cancer and the new onset of this sharp, radiating pain, I want to get some imaging done to rule out any spinal compression or other structural issues. I’m going to order an X-ray and an MRI of your lumbar spine. Do you have any metal implants or pacemakers that I should be aware of before the MRI?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any metal implants or anything like that. Just… my regular teeth fillings, I guess? Nothing else. I had a surgery a long time ago, but they took all the stitches out. No metal inside me, I promise. That sounds… scary, an MRI. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, no metal implants – that’s good to know. And no, the MRI itself shouldn't hurt, but it can be a bit loud and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. You’ll have headphones to wear, and we'll make sure you're comfortable. We want to get a clear picture of what’s going on. While we wait for the imaging results, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant to help with the spasm and a slightly stronger pain medication than what you’ve been taking. We’ll also continue with the current dosage of your existing pain medication. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good, I guess. Anything to help the pain. The loud noise… that worries me a little, but if it will help find out what’s wrong, that’s good. And stronger pills… yes, please. I really need something that works. So, two pills now? A stronger pain pill and a muscle relaxant? What are the names of them? I like to know what I’m taking.
DOCTOR: Yes, two pills. I’m prescribing cyclobenzaprine 10mg for the muscle relaxant, and tramadol 50mg for the pain. Please take them as directed on the label. It’s important not to exceed the recommended dose. And, to be safe, avoid alcohol while you're taking these medications. I'm also going to give you a referral to an oncologist to follow up on this, and to a physical therapist for when the pain subsides, to help with strengthening and flexibility. Would you like the contact information for both of them now?
PATIENT: Okay, cyclobenzaprine and tramadol… I'll write that down. And no alcohol… okay, I haven't had any, but good to know. Thank you. And yes, please, the contact information for the doctors. The cancer doctor and… the physical… what did you call it? The one who helps you get strong again? I want to be prepared. I want to get better. It’s just… scary, you know? This pain is different.
DOCTOR: I understand, Larin. It’s completely natural to feel scared. This pain is different, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it. Here's the information for Dr. Anya Sharma, the oncologist, and the contact details for Sarah Chen, the physical therapist. They both have excellent reputations and will be able to provide the best care for you. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, to discuss the imaging results and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. One week. Okay. Dr. Sharma and… Chen. I’ll remember. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. And I really appreciate you listening. It helps to talk about it. I hope… I hope it’s not the cancer spreading. That’s what I’m most afraid of.
DOCTOR: It’s my job to listen, Larin, and I’m glad you feel comfortable talking to me. We will investigate this thoroughly and create a plan to address your pain. We can’t jump to conclusions until we have the imaging results, but rest assured we'll do everything we can. I’ve given you discharge instructions outlining the medications, potential side effects, and when to seek immediate medical attention. Please read them carefully. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, weakness, numbness, or bowel or bladder changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
