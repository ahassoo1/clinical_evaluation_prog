DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thanks, Doc. It's just... I've been incredibly itchy all over. Not like, a rash or anything you can see, just...itchy. It's been going on for a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer, and it's driving me nuts. It’s all over, arms, legs, back… everywhere, really.
DOCTOR: Itchy, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, just… really itchy. It's not like a bug bite itch, more of a… constant, nagging one. It doesn't really get worse with anything specific, just… always there. It's hard to explain. Makes it tough to sleep, honestly. I’m usually a pretty good sleeper, but lately… not so much. Have you seen anything like this before?
DOCTOR: Well, "itchy" is a very broad symptom, Mr. Ferneding. Lots of things can cause it. When did you first notice this starting?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it was probably around the middle of July, maybe a little before. It started gradually, you know? I didn’t really pay attention to it at first, thought it was just dry skin or something. But it hasn't gone away, and it's getting more bothersome. I did start a new laundry detergent around then, now that I think about it… a fragrance-free one, actually, ‘cause my skin's always been a little sensitive. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: Fragrance-free doesn't always mean irritant-free, Mr. Ferneding. Those products still have chemicals. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Let's do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I’m just glad you’re listening, honestly. It's… frustrating when things are just wrong and you can’t figure out why. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your skin. Please lie down on the table. I’m going to take a look, and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs as well, just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if you need me to adjust or anything. I haven't been as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears normal. No visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. Heart and lungs sound clear. No murmurs or wheezes. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the itch, like I said. No fever, no weight loss, no fatigue… nothing else out of the ordinary. My appetite’s been normal, I’m sleeping… well, trying to sleep… and… honestly, I feel pretty good otherwise. It's just this constant itching driving me crazy. It's… strange. I’m usually pretty good at noticing when something’s wrong with my body, and this just feels… off. Could it be stress, maybe? My wife passed away last year, and... well, it’s been a tough year. But I thought I was handling it okay.
DOCTOR: Stress can manifest in various ways, Mr. Ferneding. However, we need to rule out other possibilities before we attribute it solely to that. Have you changed any medications recently?
PATIENT: No, haven’t changed anything there. I’m on just a little something for my blood pressure, been on that for years now, and nothing else. Same pharmacy, same dosage… everything’s been the same. I'm pretty good about keeping track of things like that, you know? My wife was a nurse, and she always said it was important. She’d be… well, she’d be all over this if it were her. Trying to figure it out, looking up every possible cause. I miss her.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your history and the lack of other symptoms, it could be a mild allergic reaction or simply dry skin exacerbated by stress. I’m going to recommend an over-the-counter antihistamine and a good moisturizer. Try those for a week and see if it improves. If it doesn't, or if it gets worse, then we can consider further testing. Do you have any allergies to medications we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No known allergies, Doc. I've never had a reaction to anything before. Antihistamine and moisturizer… alright. I can do that. Seems… simple. Is that all there is to it, you think? I mean, I appreciate you trying to figure it out, and I know you're busy, but… it just feels like something more, you know? But if you think that's a good place to start, I'll definitely give it a try. What kind of moisturizer do you recommend? Something for sensitive skin?
DOCTOR: Yes, something fragrance-free and for sensitive skin. Cetaphil or Eucerin are good options. And the over-the-counter antihistamine… Benadryl or Zyrtec will work. Take it as directed. If things don’t improve in a week, then we’ll talk about running some blood work to rule out other possibilities. Now, do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: Okay, Cetaphil, Eucerin, Benadryl, Zyrtec… I’ll write those down. No, I don’t think that’s it. Just the itch, really. And… well, thank you, Doc. I appreciate your time. I guess I'll try those things and see what happens. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day, Mr. Ferneding. .
