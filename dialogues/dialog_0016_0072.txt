DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Maskal, nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, honestly. I've been... forgetting things. Not huge things, not yet, but enough to worry me. Like, I walked into the kitchen yesterday and completely forgot what I went in there for. It's happening more and more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you’re bringing this up – it’s always better to address these things early. Forgetfulness can be concerning, but it also has many causes, some of which are quite benign. Can you tell me a little more about these instances of forgetting?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not like I forget who people are, or how to do things generally. It's more… small details. Like names of things, or why I walked into a room. Sometimes I'll start a sentence and the word just… won’t come. And recently, I had to ask my neighbor twice what her dog’s name was – I just asked her last week! It’s frustrating, and I'm starting to worry it's something serious.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's more recent memory issues, specifically with recall of details and finding the right words. And you said this is happening more frequently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. And “more frequently” is the right way to put it. It feels like it’s been getting worse over the last… maybe six months? It's hard to say for sure, but that feels about right. Before that, I’d just have the occasional “tip-of-the-tongue” moment, like anyone does. But now… it’s several times a week, easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of progressive memory issues. That's helpful information. To get a better picture, let's go through a little more detail. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or sleep patterns around the same time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My sleep… hasn’t been the best, to be honest. I wake up a lot during the night, even if I'm tired. I toss and turn. As for my mood… I’ve been a little more stressed lately, with work. It's a busy time of year for the practice. But I wouldn't say I'm depressed or anything. Just… a bit on edge, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some sleep disturbance and increased stress. Those can definitely contribute to memory issues. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No serious injuries, no surgeries. I do have slightly high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. I've been on the same pills for about five years now. Other than that… I'm pretty healthy, generally. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-managed hypertension is good to know. And you said five years on the same medication?
PATIENT: Yes, five years. Lisinopril, I think it's called. My family doctor prescribed it, and I get it refilled regularly. No changes to the dosage or anything. I haven’t had any side effects from it, as far as I know. Although, now that you mention it… maybe I’ve been a little more forgetful since I started taking it? But that could just be coincidence, right?
DOCTOR: That's a very important observation, Ebony – noting a possible correlation with the Lisinopril. It's good you're so attentive to these details. While it's not a common side effect, certain medications can contribute to memory issues. Let's get a full list of your medications, just to be thorough. Do you take anything else, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… I take a multivitamin every day, just a standard one. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. That's really it. No herbal supplements, no other prescriptions, nothing like that. I try to avoid taking anything unless I really need it. My mother always said, “Too much medicine is worse than not enough,” so I tend to be cautious.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of memory loss or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: That's a tough one. My grandmother, on my mother's side, she… well, she got very confused towards the end of her life. I don't know exactly what was wrong, honestly. We just knew she wasn't herself anymore. My mother always said it was “old age,” but I never knew for sure if it was something more. No one else that I know of had any serious memory problems. It was a long time ago, so nobody really talked about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandmother with possible dementia, but no other known family history. Let's move on to social history. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I don't drink alcohol at all. Never really liked it. And I've never smoked. Definitely no recreational drugs. I try to stay healthy, like I said. I prefer a good walk to a night out, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I don't have any food allergies or anything like that. I can eat pretty much anything. Wait… actually, I do get a little itchy sometimes when I eat shrimp, but it's not a serious reaction. Just a mild itch. Nothing that requires medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild itch with shrimp, but no serious allergies. That completes our initial history. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and check your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, I will do a brief neurological exam, checking your reflexes and balance. Finally, I'll take a look in your ears and throat. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 130 over 80, but not drastically so. It's good to monitor that. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance is good. Finally, let me just take a look in your ears and throat… Everything looks good here as well. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, because of your concerns about memory loss, and the possible correlation with the Lisinopril, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us rule out other potential causes. I'm also going to order an MRI of the brain, just to get a detailed look at your brain structure. Is that something you're comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then absolutely. Blood work and an MRI… it sounds a bit scary, but I trust your judgement. I just want to know what's happening, and get it sorted out if I can. When can I schedule those?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. It's good you're proactive about this. The MRI will give us a lot of information. I'll have my nurse schedule those for you right away. She'll let you know about any preparation needed for the MRI. The blood work is straightforward – just a routine fasting panel. While we're waiting for the results, I'd like you to keep a daily journal of your memory lapses. Note when they occur, what you were doing, and any potential triggers. This will help us identify patterns. Also, I'm going to recommend a cognitive screening test. It's a simple test that can help us get a baseline assessment of your cognitive function. It doesn’t take long, and it can be helpful to track changes over time. Would you be open to doing that today?
PATIENT: Yes, I can definitely start a journal. That makes sense. And the cognitive screening test… yes, if it helps, I'm happy to do it today. The more information the better, right? I just hope it's nothing serious. But I appreciate you taking this so seriously.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. It’s always best to investigate these things thoroughly. Okay, this test will just involve answering a few simple questions and remembering a short list of words. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Don’t worry if you don’t get everything right – it’s just a baseline assessment. Alright, let's start with your name and the current date…
PATIENT: My name is Ebony Heidenthal, and today is August 2nd, 2025.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: We’re at… Dr. Maskal’s clinic. In the… examination room. Is that right? It's a bit difficult to think clearly, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ebony. It's understandable to feel a bit anxious during this test. Okay, let's move on. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Um… okay. The words are… table, penny, and orange. Right?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are the words. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Please just answer to the best of your ability. … Alright, Ebony, that completes the assessment. Thank you for your patience. Okay, your score is 26 out of 30. That's slightly below average, but not drastically so. It's important to remember that this is just one snapshot in time. We’ll need to monitor your cognitive function over time to see if there are any changes. Now, while we await the MRI and blood work results, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help improve your memory. These include regular exercise, a healthy diet, sufficient sleep, and mental stimulation. Also, I'd recommend avoiding stress whenever possible. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on these topics?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Resources would be great. I'm willing to try anything that might help. I've been meaning to get more exercise anyway, and I definitely need to work on getting more sleep. It's just… life gets in the way, you know? But if this could help, I'll make the effort. Thank you, Dr. Maskal. I really appreciate your help. I'm a little worried, but I feel better knowing we're doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. It’s good you’re being proactive. Here you go. This handout includes websites, articles, and local support groups. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us in four weeks, once we have the MRI and blood work results. In the meantime, please keep the daily journal, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Four weeks sounds good. I will definitely keep the journal, and I'll try to follow the advice in the handout. Thank you again, Dr. Maskal. You've been very kind and helpful. I think… I think I can manage until then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad I could help. Please take care, and I’ll see you in four weeks. Have a good day.
