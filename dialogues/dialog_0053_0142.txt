DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. So, tell me – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. It's… headaches, mostly. Really bad ones. They come and go, but when they do come, they're awful. I get all sweaty and my heart races, too. It's… hard to explain, really. They just hit me, and then… yuck. I don't really remember everything about them, to be honest. Just that they're not fun.
DOCTOR: "Not fun," is…helpful. Right. So these headaches, when did they start?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. When did they start… That’s a tough one. A while ago, definitely. I’m bad with dates. Maybe… six months? Or was it longer? It feels like they've been happening on and off for a long time, but I couldn't say exactly how long. Sorry. I just… things kinda blur together.
DOCTOR: "A while ago." Of course. And have they been getting worse over these… six months?
PATIENT: Hmm. Worse… I don’t know if worse is the right word. They’re… more frequent, maybe? Like, there used to be long stretches where I didn't get them at all. Now… now it feels like they pop up every couple of weeks. And they seem to last longer, I guess. It's hard to say for sure. I just know they’re really disruptive when they happen.
DOCTOR: Disruptive how?
PATIENT: Well, I work, you know? Production work. Can’t really do that when my head’s pounding and I feel like I’m gonna pass out. I have to… call out, mostly. It's not great. And it's just… awful to feel that bad. Makes it hard to do anything, really. Even just watching TV is a struggle sometimes. It makes me feel pretty useless, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Production work. And these headaches...do they come on with any specific triggers?
PATIENT: Triggers… that's a good question. I haven't really noticed any, not that I remember. Stress, maybe? Work is pretty stressful. But it’s always stressful, and they don't happen every time I'm stressed. Bright lights sometimes feel… not good when I have one coming on, but I'm not sure if that's a cause or just… makes it worse once it's already started. Honestly, I'm just kinda guessing here. It's hard to pin down.
DOCTOR: So, let's try to be a little more specific. Do they start on one side of your head or all over?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… usually it feels like it starts… on the right side? Kind of behind my eye. But then it spreads. It doesn't stay just on that side. It kind of… fills up my whole head, eventually. Does that make sense? It’s a throbbing pain, mostly. And… yeah, behind the eye is where it usually begins, I think. If I had to say. It's all a bit fuzzy, sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms with these headaches?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't actually been sick. And I get really sensitive to light, definitely. Makes everything seem too bright. Oh, and… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but not like I'm gonna fall over or anything. Just… off balance, I guess. Does that help? I'm trying to remember everything, but it's like… the details just slip away.
DOCTOR: Have you ever experienced any visual disturbances before or during these headaches?
PATIENT: Visual disturbances… Like what, exactly? I haven't seen anything weird, if that's what you mean. Nothing like, flashing lights or… I don't know, seeing things that aren't there? No. But sometimes things just seem… blurry when the headache is really bad. Like my vision is swimming a bit. Is that what you mean? It's hard to describe. Sorry. I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever had a head injury?
PATIENT: A head injury… Hmm. Not that I remember. I was a pretty active kid, so I probably bumped my head a few times, you know? Like, falling off my bike or something. But nothing serious, not that I recall. Never been knocked unconscious or anything like that. Just… the usual kid stuff. Does that count? I'm really not sure. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: And any family history of migraines or severe headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Family history… That’s another tough one. My mom had headaches sometimes, but I don't really remember how bad they were. She wasn’t one for complaining much. And my dad… I don't really know much about his medical history, to be honest. He passed away a while ago. So, no, I don’t think so? Maybe? I really wish I could be more helpful, but my family wasn’t big on talking about that sort of thing. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your neurological function, blood pressure and pulse. Just standard procedure. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need me to do. Just tell me what to do and I’ll try my best. I'm a bit… shaky sometimes, so if I mess up, sorry in advance. Just let me know. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is… 130 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes, don’t move your head. Left… right… up… down… Good. Now, squeeze my hands… both at the same time. That’s good. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. This might be a little surprising. Tap tap. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, stand up and walk a straight line for me. Okay, a little unsteady, but not significantly so. I’m just noting some mild balance issues. Alright, all done. I’m noting mild balance issues and some reported unsteadiness, but no other significant neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That doesn't sound too bad, right? The unsteadiness… I guess I just get a little clumsy sometimes. Is it…serious? I get worried sometimes about… well, you know. Just feeling off. So, what do you think it is? Is it something I should be really concerned about? I appreciate you checking everything. It's just... all a bit scary when things aren't right.
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, the most likely possibility is tension headaches, possibly with some migraine features. The unsteadiness could be related, or could be something separate. However, given the frequency of your headaches, and your reported symptoms, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything more serious. It's standard procedure when we have recurring headaches. It won’t be definitive, but it will give us a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: A CT scan… Okay. That sounds… intense. Is it expensive? I… don't really have insurance right now. I'm divorced, and it's… complicated. I'm trying to get back on my feet, but things are tight. And… what if it is something serious? What then? I'm not trying to be difficult, I just… I get anxious easily. And I don't want a huge bill I can't afford. Can we talk about the cost before you order anything? And… what exactly are we looking for with the scan? Just… to know.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your concerns, but these scans are necessary to rule out things like structural abnormalities or infection. We’re not just ordering them willy-nilly. As for cost, I can have the billing department provide you with an estimate. However, I’m not responsible for the financial aspects. Regarding what we’re looking for, we’re primarily assessing for any signs of bleeding, tumors, or other abnormalities in the brain. We will also look for any evidence of sinus inflammation, but given your symptoms, that’s less likely. As I said, it is standard procedure. If you are unwilling to undergo the necessary investigations, I can refer you to a neurologist who can offer a second opinion, but they will likely order the same tests. Let's start with the billing estimate, and then we can proceed.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Billing estimate first. That sounds… responsible. Yeah, let’s do that. Just… don't let it be too much. And… tumors are what I was afraid of. But… okay. If you think it’s necessary, then let’s get the estimate. I’m… trusting your judgment. Just… try to be quick, okay? I'm starting to feel a little… anxious again. And thanks… for explaining. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright. The CT scan without contrast is estimated at $350. With contrast, it’s $600. I'm going to go ahead and order the scan without contrast for now. That should be sufficient to rule out most of the serious concerns. A nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood for the routine labs. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: $350… okay. That’s… doable, I guess. If it’s just the one scan, that's manageable. No allergies to contrast dye, not that I know of. I haven't had any scans before, so I've never been exposed to it. Okay. Labs and a scan… Sounds like a plan. I'm… ready when you want me to be. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to get the lab orders. We’ll get those results back as soon as possible, usually within 24-48 hours. Once we have those results and the CT scan report, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you stay well-hydrated, get adequate rest, and try to manage your stress levels. Avoid any strenuous activity until we rule out anything serious. I’m also going to prescribe you a mild anti-inflammatory medication, naproxen, to help manage the headaches in the meantime. It’s over-the-counter, but I’ll write you a prescription just to make things easier. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Naproxen… I've taken that before, yeah. It helps a little. Okay, so labs, scan, naproxen, and then follow up. Sounds good. I think… I think that’s everything. No, I don't have any more questions right now. Just… when do you think I’ll hear about the results? 24-48 hours? I'm just… anxious about waiting. But thank you. For everything. .
DOCTOR: Yes, 24-48 hours is a reasonable estimate, though it can sometimes take longer depending on the radiologist’s workload. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to schedule the CT scan. Once you have a date, please let us know so we can coordinate the follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe headache, fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
