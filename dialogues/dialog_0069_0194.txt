DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a long story, I think. My hearing… it comes and goes. And sometimes the room just spins. It’s happened a few times now. My daughter, she’s the one who really got me to come in. She worries, you see. I don’t always remember things clearly, so… it's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to take your time, and don’t worry about remembering every detail. We’ll figure it out together. So, this hearing loss and dizziness… when did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start… Hmm. It feels like… a while now. Maybe last year? Or the year before? It’s… patchy, in my memory. It wasn’t constant at first. Just… moments. Then it would be okay for weeks, even months. It's been more frequent lately, that’s why I’m here. My… husband, he used to say I didn't listen to him anyway, but that was just teasing!
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's been going on for some time, and it's good you're getting it checked out now that it’s becoming more frequent. “Patchy” is a good way to describe it. Can you tell me more about the dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… not like I’m falling over, Doctor. More like… everything is swaying. Like being on a boat, but I haven’t been on a boat in years! And it makes me feel a bit sick sometimes, but I haven’t actually been sick. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few minutes. But it’s… unsettling. Makes it hard to walk straight, you know? And then my ears ring… sometimes. It all feels connected, but I can’t quite put my finger on how.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more of a sensation of spinning or swaying, not a true vertigo where you feel like you’re falling. And it's accompanied by ringing in the ears sometimes. That does sound connected. To help me understand a bit better, does anything seem to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger…? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. It just… happens. Sometimes when I’m busy, like at work. Sometimes when I’m resting. Sometimes… just when I wake up. I work at the gaming center, you know? Helping people with the machines. It’s a bit noisy there, maybe that has something to do with it? But honestly, Doctor, I can’t say for sure. It feels random.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be consistently linked to any specific activity. Working in a noisy environment could be a factor, we'll keep that in mind. Now, have you noticed any changes in your hearing – besides the coming and going of the loss?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, goodness. Well… everything sounds a bit muffled sometimes, even when I can hear. And… I have to ask people to repeat themselves more often. My daughter says I turn the television up too loud, but I just like to hear it clearly! Maybe it’s getting worse, slowly? It’s hard to tell, you see. It's a gradual thing.
DOCTOR: I understand it's hard to pinpoint gradual changes. Muffled hearing and needing to ask for repetition are definitely things to take note of. Let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… The doctor used to tell me my blood pressure was a little high, but I take a little pill for that. Just a small white one, every morning. And… I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but they’re alright now. Mostly. Nothing else, that I remember. My husband always took care of the medical stuff, and… well, it’s been a while since then.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband. It’s understandable that keeping track of medical details might be difficult. You mentioned a small white pill for blood pressure – do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the name… I honestly haven’t a clue, Doctor. It’s always been the same little white pill. The pharmacist just… gives it to me. My daughter sometimes checks the bottles, but I don't bother trying to remember. It's just part of my routine, you see? Every morning with my tea. I’m not very good with names and numbers, never have been.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. MayHugh. We can look it up in our system. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago. And… I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist, many years later. But other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. It’s all a bit hazy, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken wrist. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone in your family who has had problems with their hearing, dizziness, or ringing in the ears?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. My mother… she had trouble hearing in her later years. She always said it was just old age, but maybe it was something more? And… my brother, he used to complain about ringing in his ears after working with loud machinery. He was a builder, you see. But… other than that, I don’t really know. My family is… scattered, and we don't talk very often. It feels like a lot of people had something, but I can’t recall exactly what.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some family history of hearing loss and tinnitus. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I eat most things, and I’ve never had any problems with pills or anything. I’m not a fussy eater, you see. My daughter always worries about me, but I’m pretty robust, generally. Is that everything, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a bit tired now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. MayHugh, I think that covers everything for now. Thank you for being so patient and sharing all of that information with me. I appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check your ears, balance, and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Anything to help. Just… be gentle, please? My ears are a bit sensitive sometimes. And… well, I get a bit dizzy easily, as you know. But I trust you. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner it’s done, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take things slowly. First, let’s check your ears. This just allows me to look inside and see if there’s any wax buildup or inflammation. Hmm, a little bit of cerumen, but nothing significant. And the same on this side. Both ear canals appear clear. Now, I’m going to listen to your heartbeat and check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My balance is… usually alright, but I feel a bit unsteady when I stand quickly. It’s probably just old age, Doctor. Don't mind me if I wobble a bit. What do you want me to do now?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Having something to hold onto is a good idea. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and stand with your feet together. Okay, and now I’m going to gently push you slightly to the side and see if you can maintain your balance. Okay, that's good. You have some mild balance issues, but nothing overly concerning. It could be related to the dizziness you’re experiencing. I'm also going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes appear normal. Okay, Ms. MayHugh, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That wasn’t so bad, was it? So, what does it all mean, Doctor? Is there something seriously wrong with me? I worry, you see. My daughter worries too. Is it my ears? My blood pressure? Or is it just… old age?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. MayHugh, let’s go over everything. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it seems like you’re experiencing a combination of issues. The hearing loss, dizziness, and ringing in your ears – what we call tinnitus – are all interconnected. The mild balance issues we observed could be a result of the dizziness. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but manageable with your current medication. We may need to adjust the dosage or add another medication if it doesn't come down with lifestyle changes. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing, but it could be related to a few different things. One possibility is a condition called Meniere’s disease, which affects the inner ear and can cause these symptoms. Another possibility is age-related hearing loss combined with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo , which causes brief episodes of dizziness. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I recommend an audiogram to assess your hearing loss in more detail, and a VNG test to evaluate your inner ear function and balance. I’d also like to get a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel just to rule out any other underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Oh dear… those are a lot of big words, Doctor. Meniere’s… BPPV… It all sounds very serious. And more tests… I’m not very good with tests, you see. They make me anxious. Will they be painful? Will they take long? And… what if it is something serious? What are the chances it’s just… old age, really?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. MayHugh. Those are big words, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let me explain them simply. An audiogram is a painless hearing test that measures how well you can hear different sounds. It doesn't involve anything invasive, and it takes about 30-60 minutes. A VNG test evaluates your balance by tracking your eye movements while you're in different positions. It can sometimes cause temporary dizziness, but it's generally well-tolerated, and we have someone there to assist you. It takes about an hour or so. As for it being “just old age,” that’s certainly a possibility, but we need to rule out other causes first. These tests will help us determine the exact cause of your symptoms and develop the best treatment plan for you. Right now, we don't know if it's something serious. That’s why we need these tests. However, even if it is something that requires treatment, many conditions can be managed effectively with medication, therapy, or lifestyle changes. Would you like me to go over the process of scheduling these tests with you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary, then I suppose I should do them. But… could my daughter come with me? I get very confused sometimes, and I worry I’ll forget what you tell me. She’s very good at remembering things. And… could we schedule them for a weekday? Weekends are busy for her. Is that alright? And… what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. MayHugh. It’s perfectly fine for your daughter to come with you. In fact, I encourage it. Having someone there for support and to help you remember things is a great idea. And yes, we can definitely schedule them for a weekday. Let me see… how about next Tuesday afternoon for the audiogram, and Thursday morning for the VNG test?
PATIENT: Tuesday and Thursday… alright, that sounds… manageable. Will they be at this clinic? And… how much will they cost? I don’t want to put my daughter to any trouble. Is my Medicare going to cover them?
DOCTOR: Yes, both tests will be performed here at the clinic. Let me check your Medicare coverage… Okay, good news. Both the audiogram and the VNG test are covered by Medicare, with a small co-pay. The co-pay for the audiogram is $30, and for the VNG test it’s $50. I’ll have the receptionist confirm those amounts when she schedules the appointments. She can also answer any other questions you or your daughter may have about billing. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a referral for these tests and a note outlining the need for them. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a relief about the Medicare. $30 and $50… that’s manageable. No, I don’t think so… not right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Thank you… for being so patient with me. I worry a lot, you see. And… I forget things so easily. But… I feel a little bit better now, knowing what’s going to happen. I’ll call the receptionist tomorrow to schedule the appointments. And I’ll make sure my daughter comes with me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. It’s my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. And remember, we're here to help you every step of the way. In the meantime, try to get some rest and avoid any strenuous activities that might worsen your dizziness. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you again for your time and patience. And… thank you for listening. I appreciate it very much. I'll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if you need anything before then. Have a good day.
