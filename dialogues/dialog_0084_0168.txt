DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit… delicate, really. I’m dating someone, and I just want to be absolutely certain everything is… as it should be, you understand. One has to be careful these days.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That’s very responsible of you. So, you'd like a general check-up, focusing on sexually transmitted infections, is that right?
PATIENT: Precisely. And honestly, Doctor, I’d like to know what exactly I should be worried about. I’ve… heard things, naturally, and frankly, I don’t trust everything one reads on the internet. It's all quite alarming, and I prefer to get my information from a professional. Are there any new… threats, shall we say, that I ought to be aware of?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, and you’re right to ask. There’s a lot of misinformation out there. We’ll definitely cover what’s current. The usual suspects – chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis – are still around, and we see cases regularly. More recently, we’ve seen an increase in mycoplasma genitalium, which can present similarly to chlamydia but requires different treatment. And, of course, HIV remains a concern. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through some history first. Have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Recently, yes. Though I find the phrasing… a bit crude, Doctor. Let’s just say I’ve begun seeing someone new within the last month. It's not a casual arrangement, mind you. We are… discerning adults. But one never knows, does one? He seems perfectly respectable, but I believe in being thorough. Have you seen many cases of this… mycoplasma genitalium? Is it difficult to detect?
DOCTOR: I understand. And yes, Ms. Pandolfi, we have seen a rise in mycoplasma genitalium cases, particularly in the last few years. It can be more difficult to detect than some other STIs, as standard tests don't always pick it up. We use a specific test for it here. To help me determine the best course of action, could you tell me a little more about your sexual activity with your partner?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive. I came to you for a check-up, not a personal interrogation. I assure you, I’m a woman of… experience, and I take precautions. But I suppose if it's necessary for a proper assessment… We engage in typical… adult activities. With protection, naturally. Though, one can never be too careful, can one? And he… he is also circumcised, if that is relevant. I've read that makes a difference. Is it?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Pandolfi. I assure you, I'm only trying to gather the information needed to provide you with the best possible care. The details of sexual activity are relevant, as different activities carry different risks. And yes, circumcision can offer some protection against certain STIs, but it’s not foolproof. To be thorough, let’s also discuss your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections before?
PATIENT: No, never. And I find your tone… condescending, Doctor. I am not some naive young woman, you know. I have lived a full life, and I’ve always been… mindful of my health. But to answer your question, absolutely not. I've never had a positive test result for anything. I pride myself on my discretion and good choices. Is it really necessary to dwell on this? I simply want to be certain, and get on with things. Perhaps a full panel of tests is the most sensible course of action? A complete reassurance, so to speak.
DOCTOR: You are right to want peace of mind, Ms. Pandolfi. And I apologize if my questions came across as condescending – that was not my intention. A full STI panel is certainly a sensible course of action, and we can absolutely do that. It will include tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and mycoplasma genitalium. Before we proceed, let me quickly review your allergies and current medications, just to be complete. Do you have any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. And I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as recommended by my previous physician for… circulatory health. That’s all. Nothing else. Truly. I’m a very straightforward patient, you see. No complications. Just a… prudent woman wanting to be thorough. Can we just get the tests ordered, please? The sooner I know, the better. I have a dinner engagement this evening, and I’d prefer not to dwell on this all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. I’ve ordered the STI panel, including the mycoplasma genitalium test. The lab will call you with instructions on how to provide a sample. It usually involves a urine test, and sometimes a swab, depending on the lab’s protocol. In the meantime, it’s important to avoid any new sexual activity until you receive your results. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I understand perfectly. Abstinence until results. Sensible. Though, frankly, it's rather inconvenient. But one must be cautious, I suppose. Very well. And how long will these results take? I’m attending a gala next weekend, and I’d prefer to know before then. I wouldn’t want any… unpleasant surprises. Can you give me a timeframe? A precise estimate, if possible?
DOCTOR: The lab typically returns STI panel results within 3 to 5 business days. However, the mycoplasma genitalium test can take a little longer, sometimes up to 7 business days, as it requires specialized processing. I’ll ask them to prioritize your results, but I can't guarantee a faster turnaround time. We can call you as soon as they become available. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Ms. Pandolfi?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That will be all. I appreciate you… accommodating my concerns. Though, frankly, I still feel this entire process is rather… unnecessary. But I suppose one can never be too careful. Please do have the lab expedite those results, if at all possible. And thank you for not… judging me. I have a rather sensitive constitution, you see.
