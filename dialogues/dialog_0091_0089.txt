DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Oh, goodness... where to begin? Well, it's this pain, you see. In my lower tummy. It comes and goes, but when it comes, it's quite severe. I believe my records mention something about… something being wrong with my system? It’s all a bit hazy, I'm afraid. I do apologize. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Glymph, no need to apologize at all. We can certainly review your records together. It’s perfectly normal for details to be a bit unclear over time. Let's see… Ah, yes. It appears you've had some previous evaluations regarding potential diverticulitis. Is that correct, or does that not ring a bell?
PATIENT: Diverti… what now? Oh dear. No, that doesn’t… sound familiar at all. I do know I’ve been seen for… problems with my insides before. And something about my… immune system? Lupus, perhaps? That name feels… closer. It's all very frustrating, I must confess. I just want to feel better, and I'm terribly sorry I can't be of more assistance with the specifics.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Glymph. It can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. The records do indicate a previous evaluation for possible Lupus, but it was ultimately inconclusive, and the working diagnosis at the time was Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS. However, there were also notes about recurrent abdominal pain of unclear etiology. To help me understand what’s going on now, could you describe this pain in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, that makes a bit more sense, actually. IBS… yes, I recall a doctor mentioning something like that. A sensitive tummy, he said. But this feels… different. When it flares up, it’s a cramping sort of ache, low down, mostly on the right side, I think. It comes in waves, and it can be quite sharp. Sometimes I feel a little… bloated, too. And… oh, I almost forgot… occasionally, I feel a bit… feverish when it’s at its worst. Though that doesn’t happen every time. It’s all very confusing, isn’t it? I apologize again for my rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. You're providing me with very helpful information, and it's important for me to understand the nuances of your experience. The cramping pain, primarily on the right side, coming in waves, along with the bloating and occasional fever, does warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I’ve been rather tired lately, more so than usual. And my joints… they ache sometimes, particularly in my hands and knees. It's not constant, but it's noticeable. Oh! And I've been having a bit of trouble with my appetite. I don’t feel sick, exactly, just… not very hungry. And sometimes, after I eat, I feel a bit… unsettled, you know? Like things aren't quite digesting properly. Is that helpful? I’m trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Glymph, that's very helpful. The fatigue, joint pain, and decreased appetite, along with the digestive issues, are all important pieces of the puzzle. Now, regarding your past medical history, do you have any other medical conditions that we haven’t discussed?
PATIENT: Oh goodness... let me see. I believe I had… pneumonia, quite a few years back. A bad bout of it, it was. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh… probably twenty years ago now? I don't recall much detail about that, either, I'm afraid. Beyond that… no, I don’t think so. I’ve always been fairly… robust, generally. Until recently, of course. I do take a daily vitamin, and… I suppose that’s all. I hope I’m not forgetting anything important! It’s terribly frustrating when things simply… slip away.
DOCTOR: You are providing me with excellent information, Ms. Glymph. Don’t worry about forgetting anything, we can always clarify as we go. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, thankfully, no. No allergies that I’m aware of, at least. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medications without any trouble. It's one of the few things I don't have to worry about, thankfully. Though, I must admit, I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can help it. I prefer a natural approach, if possible. But I understand when they’re necessary, of course.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Glymph. Now, let's briefly discuss your family medical history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a tricky one. My mother… she had some sort of ailment with her joints, I believe. Something chronic, that caused her a great deal of pain. Arthritis, perhaps? I’m not entirely sure. And my father… he had heart trouble, later in life. He passed away from it, I think. Beyond that… not that I recall. We weren't a particularly close family, so I don’t know much about the medical histories of my aunts and uncles. I apologize for my vagueness. It’s simply… difficult to remember. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Knowing about the possibility of arthritis and heart disease is helpful. Now, just a few more questions before we proceed. Could you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... social history? What does that entail, exactly? I've lived alone for many years now, ever since my husband passed. I don't really have any hobbies to speak of, though I do enjoy reading. I've always been a bit of a homebody, I suppose. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. And… I suppose that’s all. A quiet life, mostly. Is that what you were looking for? I hope I'm not being too dull.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. That’s very helpful information. A quiet life is perfectly fine. And it's good to know you don't smoke and rarely drink. Now, to get a complete picture, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Though… please be gentle? My joints aren’t what they used to be, as I mentioned. And… I'm a bit sensitive, I confess. But do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs, then I’ll palpate your abdomen to assess for tenderness. After that, I’ll check your joints for any swelling or limitations in range of motion. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a very faint murmur. It’s not significant at this time, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. And… how about here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes… that’s… tender. Just a little bit, though. Not excruciating, but… definitely noticeable. It feels… a bit achy, almost. Like a dull pressure. It’s been like that on and off for a few days now. It's worse when I move around, or when I press on it like that. I hadn’t realized it was quite so… sensitive. Perhaps that’s why I’ve been avoiding moving too much lately. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I do apologize for being such a difficult patient.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Ms. Glymph, and you’re not being difficult at all. It’s important for me to understand your discomfort. The tenderness in your lower right quadrant is something we need to investigate further. Now, let’s take a look at your joints. I'm going to gently move your hands and fingers to assess for any limitations in range of motion. I notice some mild swelling and stiffness in your knuckles, particularly on your right hand. And I detect some crepitus when I move your joints. Your knees also exhibit some crepitus, and I detect mild tenderness along the joint line. Do you experience any pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yes, my knees… they do ache a bit when I bend them, especially in the morning. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely noticeable. And you’re right, the knuckles in my hands… they’re a little stiff, especially after I’ve been resting. It's not excruciating, but it's… bothersome. It makes it difficult to do things, like open jars or button my coat. I hadn’t realized it was quite so… pronounced. Is that… arthritis, perhaps? My mother had something similar, I believe. I do apologize for my ramblings. I'm simply trying to recall everything I can.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. You're providing me with very valuable information, and it's important for me to understand your symptoms as thoroughly as possible. Based on your history and the physical examination findings – the tenderness in your lower right quadrant, the joint swelling and stiffness, the crepitus, and your family history – I suspect several possibilities. One is diverticulitis, which is an inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. Another possibility is osteoarthritis, which is a degenerative joint disease. The fatigue and decreased appetite could be related to either condition, or they could indicate another underlying issue. To help me narrow down the diagnosis, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies. These will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein level, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear... tests, you say? A CT scan... that sounds rather… involved. Well, I suppose if it's necessary to figure out what's wrong, I can’t object. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I do hope it’s not too unpleasant. And… what exactly will these tests show? I’m a little nervous, I must admit. I've always been a bit… squeamish about medical procedures. But if it will help me feel better, I’m willing to do whatever is necessary. Just… please explain everything to me in simple terms? I'm not very good with medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I understand your nervousness, and I will explain everything in simple terms. The complete blood count and metabolic panel will give us a general overview of your health and help us rule out any other underlying conditions. The C-reactive protein level will help us assess for inflammation in your body. The CT scan is a non-invasive imaging study that will allow us to visualize your abdomen and pelvis in detail. It will help us identify any signs of diverticulitis, such as inflammation or infection in your colon. It will also allow us to assess the condition of your joints. The procedure itself is quite simple. You will lie on a table, and a technician will scan your abdomen and pelvis using a special X-ray machine. It’s painless, but you will need to remain still for a few minutes at a time. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: No, I believe that explains everything quite clearly, Doctor. A CT scan… sounds a little daunting, but if it will help us figure out what’s wrong, then I’m willing to proceed. When would I be able to have these tests done? And… how long will it take to get the results? I’m a little anxious about waiting, I must confess. I just want to feel better, and I’m eager to get this process moving. I do apologize for being such a worrywart. It's just… I haven't been feeling myself lately, and it's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph. It's perfectly normal to feel unsettled when you're not feeling well, and I assure you, we'll move as quickly as possible. I can arrange for you to have the blood tests done this afternoon at the lab downstairs. The CT scan can be scheduled for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. The results of the blood tests should be available within 24 hours. The results of the CT scan will take a little longer – typically 24 to 48 hours – as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. Once I have the results, I'll contact you immediately to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as high fever, severe abdominal pain, or bloody stools – please go to the emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Tomorrow morning for the CT scan… I can certainly manage that. And I will be sure to rest and drink plenty of fluids in the meantime. And, yes, I will go to the emergency room if my symptoms worsen. You’ve put my mind at ease, thank you. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. It’s reassuring to know that I’m in good hands. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Any dietary restrictions, perhaps? Or any other precautions I should take? I do apologize for all my questions.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Regarding dietary restrictions, for now, I recommend a low-fiber diet until we have the results of the CT scan. This means avoiding foods like whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. You can stick to bland foods like white rice, pasta, and cooked chicken. As for other precautions, try to avoid strenuous activity, and listen to your body. If you feel any pain, stop what you're doing and rest. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you next week to discuss the results of the tests and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. A low-fiber diet… I can certainly manage that. And I’ll be sure to rest and listen to my body. Thank you again for your patience and kindness. You’ve been very helpful. I suppose that’s all for today. I’ll see you next week, then. And thank you again, Doctor. I truly appreciate your care.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. .
