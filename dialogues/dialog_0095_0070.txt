DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, doctor, yes? I… moved here. New place. This, uh, social healthcare… they told me to come. Old doctor… far away now. Not good for me to travel so much, you know? Just checking… things. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. A check-up is a good place to start, especially with a change in doctors. We want to make sure everything is running smoothly. So, "checking things"... can you tell me more specifically what “things” are concerning you?
PATIENT: Concerning? Hmm. Not much, really. I… do makeup. For theater, mostly. Lots of faces. Old faces, young faces… It’s tiring, maybe? My back… sometimes aches. And I forget things. Like names. Not important names, usually. Just… people. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're a makeup artist for the theater, and you’ve noticed some fatigue, back pain, and some memory lapses. Let’s break that down a little. The back pain – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go. Mostly when I… bend a lot. Or hold things. You know, painting faces. It’s not heavy, but… long hours. And I like to make sure it looks perfect, so I… focus. Very focused. Maybe that’s it? It hurts when I stand up fast sometimes, too. Like a… a little shock.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, it sounds like the pain is related to bending, holding positions for a long time, and it’s worse when you stand quickly. That “shock” feeling is good to know as well. We should rule out anything serious, but it sounds like it could be musculoskeletal. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No. Not really. Sometimes… my feet feel cold. Even when they’re not. These shoes… not very warm. Maybe that’s why? Old shoes. Everything is old now, you know? Except the makeup. I keep the good makeup.
DOCTOR: Okay, cold feet even when they're not cold – that's good to know. We'll make a note of that. Let’s talk about your overall health a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… pressure? I don’t think so. Doctor… old doctor, he… always just told me to rest. “You work too hard, Kile.” That’s what he said. I had something… when I was young. In the hospital. But it was… long ago. Very long ago. I don’t remember what it was. Something with… stomach, maybe?
DOCTOR: Alright, so no known diagnoses of high blood pressure or diabetes. And a history of something with your stomach when you were younger, but you don't recall the specifics. That's understandable. We can look into old records if you’d like, though it might be difficult if the doctor was far away. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never liked them. Old doctor… he tried to give me pills for… for sleeping. But they made me feel… strange. So I stopped. Just rest. And strong tea. That’s all. No pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than what you mentioned earlier with your stomach?
PATIENT: Hmm. Surgery… I think so. When I was a boy. My tonsils. They took them out. Very common, I think. And… maybe my appendix? But I’m not sure. Long time ago. Everything is a blur. It’s all just… old now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed and possibly your appendix as a child. We'll document that as "possible" for now. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that your parents or siblings have had?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she was… frail. Always sick. Coughing. Never strong. She died young. Heart, I think. Maybe lungs. It was a long time ago. My father… strong man. Worked in the factory. But he drank. Lots of vodka. He died… well, you know. Old age, I guess. Not a good life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a history of frailty, coughing, and possibly heart or lung issues, and your father had a history of heavy drinking. That’s helpful to know. Let’s talk a little about your social habits. Do you currently drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… what? No. Never. Not me. Maybe a little vodka… sometimes. With friends. Not much. And not often. My father… he drank too much. I learned from his mistakes. I don’t smoke. Never liked it. Bad for the face.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional vodka with friends, but not a heavy drinker. And you do not smoke. That's good. Lastly, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. No, not really. I get… itchy sometimes. From the makeup. But that’s not an allergy, is it? And… dust. Lots of dust in the theater. Makes me sneeze. But that’s everyone, isn’t it? No serious allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional itching from makeup and sneezing from dust, but no known serious allergies. Okay, Mr. Szmyd, thank you for that information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? What does that involve? Will it be… uncomfortable? I don't like being poked and prodded. Old doctor… just listened to my heart. Very quick.
DOCTOR: It won't be anything too uncomfortable, I promise. I'll just be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking in your ears and throat, and feeling your abdomen. I'll also check your reflexes and balance. It should only take a few minutes. It's just to get a baseline and rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: As I go, yes. Please. Don’t like surprises. And… gentle, please. My back… is a little sensitive. And… make it quick. I have… things to do. Makeup to organize.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Gentle and quick, I promise. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure. I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm. It will squeeze for a moment, and then relax. Just relax your arm for me. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally for me. Alright, your heart rate is regular, but I'm hearing some mild crackles in your lungs. That could be a sign of fluid build-up. Do you have any history of shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of… breath? No. Not really. Sometimes… after climbing stairs. But who doesn't? Old age, you know. Lungs aren't what they used to be. The theater is dusty. Maybe that’s it. Crackles… sounds bad.
DOCTOR: It could be the dust, and it’s good you mention the stairs. Crackles can have several causes, and we'll need to investigate further. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just lie flat on your back for me, and I'll gently press on different areas. Okay, your abdomen feels soft and there doesn’t seem to be any tenderness. Now, I'm just going to look in your ears with this light. Your ears look clear. And finally, I’ll just check your reflexes. Okay, your reflexes are normal. That completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, there are a few things I’d like to investigate further. First, your blood pressure is a little high. Second, there are some crackles in your lungs, which could indicate fluid build-up. And third, you mentioned some memory lapses. Would you be willing to do some blood work and a chest x-ray to help us figure out what's going on?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-ray? Is that… necessary? I don’t like hospitals. And needles… I hate needles. Is there another way? Can’t we just… rest? Drink tea? The doctor… old doctor, he never did all this.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Szmyd. It's never pleasant to undergo tests, especially if you've had bad experiences. However, these tests will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any serious conditions. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to heart problems, stroke, or kidney failure. And the crackles in your lungs could indicate pneumonia, heart failure, or other respiratory issues. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, including your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and inflammation levels. The chest x-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart. We can discuss alternative options, but I strongly recommend these tests to ensure your health and well-being. If we don't know what's causing your symptoms, we can't properly address them. We can start with the blood work, and if the results are concerning, we can proceed with the chest x-ray. Do you have any preferences regarding where you’d like to get the blood work done?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work, then. But… quick, please. And gentle. I don’t want a big fuss. And… is it expensive? My… insurance is Medicare. Does it cover everything? I don’t want a big bill. And… no surprises. You promise?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concerns. We’ll make sure it's quick and gentle. And don't worry, we'll handle the billing with Medicare. Most tests are covered, but we’ll verify your coverage before we proceed and let you know of any potential out-of-pocket costs. No surprises, I promise. I’ll write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They’re used to working with Medicare patients. They’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes… okay. Down the hall, you say? Room 203. And you’ll… tell me the results? Not complicated words, please. Just… what it means. Simple. No fuss. And… if it's bad… you'll tell me what to do?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Down the hall, room 203. And yes, I'll explain the results in simple terms, no complicated medical jargon. I promise. And if the results are concerning, I’ll explain your options and recommend the appropriate course of action. We’ll work together to develop a plan that’s best for your health. Here's the lab order. Just take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of everything. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… fifteen minutes, you said? And no surprises. Thank you. I… need to organize my makeup.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen minutes. And no surprises. You go ahead and organize your makeup. And if you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to help.
