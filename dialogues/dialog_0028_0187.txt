DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic. Let’s get this over with. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Chest… hurt. And heart… beat fast. Very fast. Blood… number high, doctor say. I no like. Waste my time.
DOCTOR: Chest hurt and fast heartbeat… and your previous doctor mentioned high blood… numbers?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. High. Very high. I take pills, but… still high. And now this chest… feeling. Like bird… flapping inside. Not good. I busy man, you know. Emergency… things. Need to be fixed.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Bird flapping," I see. And you’re currently taking medication for this high blood… pressure, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Little white pill. Every morning. But doctor keep changing. First one no work. Then another one. Now this one… maybe not working too. I forget the name. Old man, you know? Memory… gone. Just tell me if I okay or not. I no have time for many questions.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, simply telling you if you’re “okay” requires… information. And I need a proper history, despite your… schedule. Do you have any other symptoms besides the chest discomfort and fast heartbeat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind? I… tired, sometimes. Very tired. And… dizzy. When I stand up too fast. That all. And wife… she worry too much. She say I look pale. Old wife always say things. Not important. Just fix the heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness, dizziness when standing… and your wife thinks you look pale. Very well. Now, have you ever had any… serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Serious…? Hmm. Long time ago… when I was young man, I have… fever. Very bad fever. In Korea. Before I come here. And… maybe pneumonia once? I forget. Long time. Nothing now. Just… this heart. And blood. Waste of good time, this whole thing.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia… okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I strong man! No need surgery. Just… pills. Too many pills. And doctors. Always poking and prodding. I no like. My father, he live long life, no doctors. Just strong food and hard work.
DOCTOR: Right. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Wife… she okay. Little old, a little… loud. Children… grown up. Gone. Live far away. Don’t need me. No heart problems in family. No. Strong people. My father, very strong. I told you. No weak hearts. No.
DOCTOR: Okay. No family history of heart problems. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational… substances?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. Bad for you. Wife yell at me if I even look at cigarette. Drink… little bit sometimes. Beer, with dinner. One or two. Small glass. No big. Recreational…? What is this… recreational? I work! Emergency things, remember? No time for… play.
DOCTOR: Right. One or two beers occasionally. And finally, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic…? Hmm. No. I eat everything. Korean food, American food… everything. Maybe… bees? Once I get stung, very small bump. But not… big problem. Wife put cream on it. That all. No. No allergies. Just… this heart. Now can you fix it? I have meetings. Very important meetings.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Let's do a quick examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Just sit back and try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? I never relax! Too much to do. But… fine. Do your… poking. Quick, please. Very quick. And then tell me I okay. That is all I want.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. Pulse is rapid and irregular… 98 beats per minute. No tenderness to palpation. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I’m also noting some edema in your ankles. Do you notice any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Edema…? What is this… edema? Swelling? Maybe… a little. Wife say my shoes feel tight. But I no pay attention. Old man feet… always a little swollen. I walk a lot. Emergency things. Always running around. Is this bad? Just tell me if I can go back to work! Very important meeting. Now!
DOCTOR: The swelling, along with your elevated blood pressure and irregular heartbeat, is concerning. You mentioned taking medication for high blood pressure… Do you have a list of the medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: List…? No. I throw away the paper. Too many papers. Doctor keep changing pills! I just take the little white one. Every morning. With water. Wife get it for me from… the place. Pharmacy, I think. I no remember the name. Just… white pill. Is that enough? Can you just give me something to fix the heart? I no have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the findings of this examination, I suspect your hypertension is poorly controlled, and the irregular heartbeat requires further investigation. I need to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an EKG. We also need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I’m also going to prescribe a temporary medication to help control your blood pressure while we await the results. This isn’t something I can “fix” quickly, Mr. Sobkowic. You need to take this seriously. I recommend a cardiology consultation as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardio… what? Consultation? More doctors? I understand… you want more money. More poking and prodding. Look, I busy man. Important things. This blood pressure… it okay. I feel okay. Just a little fast heartbeat. Just give me a pill and let me go. I no have time for… tests and consultations. Wife will worry too much. Just… a pill. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Sobkowic, I understand you’re busy, but ignoring this could lead to serious complications – stroke, heart attack… This isn’t about money, it's about your health. I strongly advise you follow my recommendations. I'm writing a prescription for a low dose of Amlodipine to start, but this is only a temporary measure. I’m also going to have the nurse schedule you for an EKG today, and I’ll refer you to a cardiologist. I need you to promise me you’ll see them. Do you promise?
