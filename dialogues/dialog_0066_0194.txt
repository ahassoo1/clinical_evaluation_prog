DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, my hearing’s been going a bit funny. And I get dizzy sometimes. It’s hard to explain exactly when it happens, to be honest. My daughter, Lani, she booked the appointment for me. She was worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good of Lani to look out for you. It is tricky when things aren't happening on a regular schedule. So, "funny" with your hearing… can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It’s like… a muffled sound. Like someone turned the volume down really low, or there’s cotton in my ears. It doesn't last long, usually. A few minutes, maybe? Then it goes away. But it’s happened a few times now. And like I said, the dizziness… it comes on suddenly. Not always with the hearing thing, but sometimes. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled sound that comes and goes, a few minutes at a time… and dizziness that sometimes happens at the same time, sometimes not. That gives me a little something to work with. When you say suddenly dizzy, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not like being sick, if that makes sense. Not like the flu. It's more like… the room starts spinning. Not violently, but enough that I have to hold onto something. Or sometimes it just feels like I’m going to fall over. It’s hard to walk straight when it happens. My husband, he used to get it sometimes too. Years ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not nausea or vomiting with it, just a feeling of the room spinning or losing your balance. And your husband had something similar in the past. That’s helpful information. About how long have you been experiencing this muffled hearing and dizziness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It's been… on and off for a while now. Maybe a few months? It's hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, you see. I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first, thought it was just getting old! Lani says I should have come sooner.
DOCTOR: Lani sounds like a very thoughtful daughter! A few months of on-and-off symptoms… alright. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Not really. That’s what’s so frustrating! It doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. Sometimes it happens when I’m just sitting and reading, other times when I’m out shopping with friends. I haven't noticed anything specific that brings it on. Except… maybe when I get stressed? But everyone gets stressed, don’t they?
DOCTOR: You’re right, everyone does get stressed. Stress could definitely be a factor. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, nothing too bad. And the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high last year, so I’m taking a little pill for that. Nothing else I can think of, really. Oh! And I wear glasses, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, high blood pressure managed with medication, and glasses. Good to know. What’s the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure, if you happen to remember?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names don’t stick with me very well. It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning. Lani helps me refill it. She knows all the names. I just tell her it’s the little white one! Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all! That's perfectly alright. We can always double-check with your daughter or look it up in your records. Alright, let me just pull up your chart here… Ah, yes. It looks like you’re taking Lisinopril 10mg daily. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago! That didn't count, did it?
DOCTOR: No, bee stings as a child wouldn’t generally be listed as a medication allergy. Okay, and have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. Must be twenty years ago now? And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when my Lani was just a little one, but I recovered alright. That’s all I can really remember, to be honest. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal about 20 years ago and a bout of pneumonia in the past. Good to know. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! My mother always said smoking was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to smoke, but he quit years and years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’ve never smoked, and your husband quit a long time ago. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a small one. It helps me relax. Nothing more than that, I promise. Not a big drinker at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And finally, do you have any family history of hearing loss, dizziness, or balance problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he used to complain about his hearing being bad when he got older. I think he just put it down to old age. And… My auntie, on my mother’s side, she had terrible dizziness. She had to use a cane a lot. But that was years ago, and I don’t really know what was wrong with her.
DOCTOR: Okay, some hearing loss in your father and dizziness in your aunt. That's helpful. Alright, Terasa, thank you for that detailed history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your ears, your blood pressure and pulse, and do a little balance test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It’s a bit unsettling, this dizziness.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's get started then. First, let's take a listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Sounds good, heart rate is regular at 72, lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look in your ears. Hmm… your ear canals are a little narrow, but there's no sign of infection or wax buildup. The eardrums look normal. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Just let me know what to do. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, as you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. Perfectly understandable. Okay, I'm going to have you stand with your feet together, arms at your sides. Just try to maintain your balance. I’ll be right here to steady you if needed. Okay, good. You’re a little unsteady, but you're able to maintain your balance. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes. Hmm… a little more instability with your eyes closed, as expected. Now, let's sit back down. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing something called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV for short. It's a common cause of dizziness, especially with head movements. It happens when small crystals in your inner ear get dislodged. The good news is it’s usually treatable with a simple maneuver.
PATIENT: Crystals? Maneuver? Oh dear. Is it… serious? Will I need surgery? I don’t like the sound of surgery.
DOCTOR: No, no surgery is definitely not needed. And it's not usually serious, though it can be very disruptive. Think of those crystals as tiny pebbles. When they get out of place, they send the wrong signals to your brain about your head position, which causes the dizziness. The maneuver I’m talking about is called the Epley maneuver. It’s a series of head positions that helps reposition those crystals. It’s quick, it’s generally very effective, and we can do it right here in the office. Would you like me to explain the maneuver in a little more detail, or would you prefer I just go ahead and do it?
PATIENT: I… I think I’d rather you just do it, if that’s alright. All this talk about crystals is making my head spin! Just… be gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing as you go along.
DOCTOR: Certainly, absolutely. I understand. I'll explain every step as I go. Okay, so the Epley maneuver involves a few quick head turns while in specific positions. We’re going to start with you sitting upright, then I’ll have you lie back quickly. We'll then rotate your head to one side, and finally sit back up again. It might feel a little strange, and you might experience some temporary dizziness, but it shouldn’t be painful. Are you ready?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Just… hurry, please. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, lying back now… good. Now, I'm going to turn your head 45 degrees to the right. Keep your eyes open and focus on the ceiling if you can. Okay… and now we're going to roll you over onto your right side, keeping your head turned to the right. Stay here for about 30 seconds… just breathe normally. Okay… and now, we’re going to roll you gently back to the sitting position, keeping your head turned to the right. And there you go. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That was strange. A bit unsettling. I feel a little… queasy. And everything seems to be swimming a bit. But… I don’t feel as dizzy as before, I think. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: That's very common to feel a bit queasy or have some temporary dizziness after the maneuver. It’s a sign that we've likely repositioned those crystals. The queasiness should pass within the next hour or so. Now, I’m going to repeat that maneuver two more times, with a few minutes in between, to make sure those crystals stay in the right place. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, alright. Just… hurry, please. And tell me what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, same procedure then. Lying back now… good. Turning your head 45 degrees to the right. Keep your eyes open and focus on the ceiling. Now rolling you onto your right side, keeping your head turned to the right. 30 seconds… just breathe normally. Okay… and now back to sitting, keeping your head turned to the right. And there you go. That was the second time. One more to go. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: A little better, I think. Still a bit queasy, but not as bad. It's… strange to feel it working, I guess. Everything is a bit blurry, though. And I have a bit of a headache now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of headache and blurry vision are not uncommon side effects. They should resolve within a few hours. Let's do the maneuver one last time, just to be sure. Lying back now… good. Turning your head 45 degrees to the right. Keep your eyes open and focus on the ceiling. Now rolling you onto your right side, keeping your head turned to the right. 30 seconds… just breathe normally. Okay… and now back to sitting, keeping your head turned to the right. And there you go. That’s the last time. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. That was… a lot. I feel… strangely calm, actually. Still a little queasy, and my head is throbbing a bit, but… the room isn’t spinning anymore. I think… I think it worked, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's fantastic to hear! It sounds like the Epley maneuver was successful. The queasiness and headache should gradually subside over the next few hours. Here are a few things to keep in mind for the next 24-48 hours: Avoid lying flat: Try to sleep with your head elevated on a couple of pillows. Avoid quick head movements: Take things slow and be mindful of your head position. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter pain reliever: You can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the headache, if needed. I’m going to give you a handout with these instructions, and a link to a video demonstrating the Epley maneuver, just in case. I’d like to see you back in a week to check how you’re doing. If your symptoms return before then, or if you experience any new symptoms like hearing loss or ringing in your ears, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very kind of you. A video sounds good. No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel much better already. It was very unsettling, this dizziness. I hope I haven’t been too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Not at all! You haven’t been any trouble. It’s always best to get these things checked out. I’m glad we were able to find a solution. Here’s a nurse to schedule your follow-up appointment, and to make sure you get home safely. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, Terasa. And try to rest!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
