DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good mornin’ to ye too, Doctor. It's nice to meet ye as well. Well, I've been havin' a bit o' trouble lately. Been feelin' sick to my stomach most mornin's, and it's worryin' me a wee bit, seein' as how I've got this heart trouble and all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. I see here you do have a history of heart trouble. It’s good you mentioned that. “Sick to your stomach” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not a proper vomitin' kind o' sick, ye ken? More like a... a rollin' feelin', right in the gut. And it usually comes on soon after I wake up. Doesn't matter if I've eaten somethin' or not the night before, it just... happens. And it lingers for a good hour or two, makin' it hard to get goin' with the day. It's been goin' on for, oh, maybe a month now? Hard to say exactly, time flies when ye're older, eh?
DOCTOR: A rolling feeling, right after waking up, lasting an hour or two… for about a month. And it doesn’t seem to be related to what you eat?
PATIENT: That’s right, Doctor. I've been tryin' to keep track, seein' as I've always been a careful man. Had a bit o' fish on Tuesday, a hearty stew on Wednesday, and nothin' at all on Thursday. All the same, the sickness came on each mornin'. I even tried havin' just a biscuit and a cup o' tea before bed, thinkin' maybe it was an empty stomach, but that didn't change a thing. It's a bit of a puzzler, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Benic. It is puzzling when things don’t seem to be connected to anything obvious. Now, besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Aye, well… now that ye mention it, I've been a wee bit more breathless than usual. Not when I'm exertin' myself, mind ye, just… sittin' readin' or watchin' the telly. And my ankles have been a bit swollen at the end o' the day. I thought it was just the heat, to be honest, it's been a scorcher these past few weeks. But maybe it's all connected, eh? I'm no' a doctor, so I'm just guessin' here.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and ankle swelling… those could be connected. Let's get a better picture of things. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No real pain, Doctor. Just a bit o' discomfort now and then, a tightness in my chest, but that comes and goes. I've had that on and off for years with the heart, so I don't pay it much mind unless it's somethin' fierce. It's not a sharp pain, more like a... a heaviness, ye ken? And it usually eases off if I just sit still for a bit. It's not botherin' me enough to take anythin' for it, mind ye.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heaviness in your chest that comes and goes, but isn't severe enough to require medication. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. You mentioned heart trouble, is that correct?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. Diagnosed with heart failure about five years ago now. I see a specialist regularly, get checked up every six months. They've got me on a few tablets, helps keep things steady. Can’t rightly remember the names of them off the top o' my head, but I have a list at home if ye need it. I’ve been pretty good at followin’ the doctor’s orders, tryin’ to take it easy, watch my salt intake, all that. It’s just… this mornin’ sickness is new, and it’s worryin’ me. It feels different than just a bad day with the heart.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Benic, and it’s good you’re following up on this. Knowing your history of heart failure is very important. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m no’ afraid o’ a wee check-up. Anything ye think might help, I’m happy to oblige. Just let me know if ye need me to do anything special. I'm used to havin' a listen with the stethoscope and all. It's the price ye pay for a dodgy ticker, eh?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Your heart rate is regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but there's a little bit of swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. I'm also noting some mild pitting edema when I press on them. Do you experience any shortness of breath when lying flat?
PATIENT: Aye, now that ye mention it… I do need an extra pillow at night these days. Used to be I could sleep flat as a board, but I've been havin' to prop myself up a wee bit more to catch my breath. Not terrible, mind ye, just a bit uncomfortable. I just put it down to gettin' older, bones aren't what they used to be. But I suppose that could be somethin' to do with it, eh? It's been gradual, over the past few months, so I didn't think much o' it.
DOCTOR: Okay, needing an extra pillow at night. Given your history of heart failure and the recent onset of nausea, breathlessness, and ankle swelling, it sounds like your heart failure may be worsening. I want to order some blood tests to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and also a BNP level to assess the level of stress on your heart. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds like a good plan, Doctor. If it helps ye figure things out, go right ahead. I’m not one to argue with a proper medical opinion. Blood tests don’t bother me none. Just tell me where to go and what I need to do. I’ll get it done as quick as I can. Is there anything I need to do beforehand? Like fastin’ or anythin'?
DOCTOR: No fasting is required for these tests. I'll write you a requisition form to take to the lab, it's just down the hall. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I want you to monitor your weight daily and report any significant changes – more than 2 pounds in a day – to the clinic. Also, be mindful of your fluid intake. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s very kind o’ ye, Doctor. Weight and fluids, got it. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. Ye've been very thorough, and ye've explained everything clearly. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen to an old man's worries. I'll get these tests done right away, and I'll be sure to let the clinic know if my weight goes up. Thank ye again, Doctor.
