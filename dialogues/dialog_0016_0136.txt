DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep... belching. It's embarrassing, really. It just happens... a lot. I don't know why.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching… I understand that can be really bothersome, and definitely embarrassing. It's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It's not… like, after I eat always. Sometimes it is, especially if I eat fast. But other times… it just happens. Even when I haven’t eaten for a while. It doesn’t hurt, it just… comes up. Like a bubble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's not consistently tied to eating, and it doesn’t cause any pain. That’s helpful to know. When you say “even when you haven’t eaten for a while,” how long after your last meal typically does it happen?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. Sometimes a couple of hours, maybe? But sometimes... even in the morning, before breakfast. It's hard to say exactly. It feels random. I don't really keep track of it, you know? It just... happens.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s not something people usually track. A couple of hours after eating, or even before breakfast… okay. Now, aside from the belching itself, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… feeling sick? No, not really. I feel okay. Maybe a little… bloated sometimes, after I eat. But not always. And it's not a bad feeling, just… full. That's all, I think. No pain, no… anything else.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some bloating, occasionally, after eating, but no pain or other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I eat mostly the same things. Rice and beans, chicken, sometimes fish. I like fruit. Nothing new, I don't think. Oh! I did try a new soda last week, a really sweet one. But I only had one. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts! A new soda, especially a sweet one, could be a factor. Okay, and have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Um... no, not really. Everything is… normal. I go to the bathroom like usual. Sorry if that’s… too much information.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s important information! Okay, good. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, nothing serious. When I was a little girl, I had the chickenpox, but that was a long time ago. And I had a bad cold last winter, but everyone gets colds, right? I haven't been to the doctor much, to be honest. I usually just try to rest if I'm sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never had surgery. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mom, she has… high blood pressure, I think. And my dad, he had problems with his stomach when he was older, but I don't know exactly what. He just said it was his stomach. They're both okay now, mostly. They live in Cuba.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and some vague stomach issues. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. I don't take any medications. Nothing at all. I try to stay healthy. I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. I've never had a bad reaction to food or anything. Sometimes, if I get stung by a mosquito, I get a really itchy bump, but that's just a mosquito bite, right?
DOCTOR: Right, just a mosquito bite. Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work at the factory, you know? Industrial Engineering. It's not too stressful, mostly paperwork and checking things. I live alone, in an apartment. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little bit of coffee sometimes. I try to walk when I can, but it's hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work in an office environment, live alone, don't smoke, and have a moderate coffee intake. Now, just one last question about your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't drink alcohol. Never really liked it. It makes me feel sick.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for answering all those questions, Lucia. That gives me a really good understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your stomach with my stethoscope and feel your abdomen to see if there's any tenderness. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. It's probably just something I ate, right?
DOCTOR: It very well could be! It's good to rule things out, though. Okay, I'm just gently pressing on your abdomen to check for any tenderness and listening for any unusual sounds. I don't feel any significant tenderness, and your bowel sounds are normal. Your abdomen is soft, but a little bit distended. That could be from the bloating you mentioned. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like this is likely related to gas, possibly triggered by the new soda or something you ate. However, since it's been ongoing, I'd like to order a couple of tests just to be sure. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests... are they expensive? And will they hurt? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lucia. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about tests, especially without insurance. The tests I’m thinking of are pretty simple. A complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function. They'll also check your electrolytes. And a stool sample – just to rule out any bacterial issues. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and the stool sample… well, it’s just a sample. They shouldn’t hurt at all. As for the cost, I'll see if we can get you a discounted rate since you don’t have insurance. I can also connect you with a financial counselor who can help you explore options. We’ll talk about all of that before we proceed with anything, okay?
PATIENT: Okay... that sounds… less scary than I thought. But still… a stool sample? Are you sure that's necessary? And the financial counselor… that would be really helpful. I don’t have much money. So, the blood test and… the other test… if it is necessary. And the discount… that would be good.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Lucia. And yes, I want to assure you that we will only do what is absolutely necessary. The stool sample is just a precaution to rule out any bacterial imbalances that could be causing the bloating and belching. If you're uncomfortable with it, we can discuss skipping it for now and monitoring your symptoms. Let's focus on the blood tests first. I'll write the order now, and the nurse will come in and draw the blood. We’ll then see if that gives us any clues. I’ll also get you the information for the financial counselor. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… better. Just the blood test for now. And the information for the counselor. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re starting small. I don't want to spend a lot of money if I don't have to. And… thank you for being understanding.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. It’s my job to make sure you feel comfortable and informed. I completely understand your concerns about cost, and we'll work together to find the most affordable options. Okay, here’s the lab order, and here’s the information for the financial counselor. The nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’s very gentle. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and trying to eat smaller, more frequent meals. It might help reduce the gas. Do you have any questions for me before Maria comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything for now. Smaller meals… and no soda. Okay. Thank you, Doctor Maskal. I appreciate your help. I hope it’s nothing serious. And thank you for not making me do the… other test right away. That means a lot.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. We'll take it one step at a time. And I understand your concerns, we'll do everything we can to figure out what's going on. Maria will be right in. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns after the blood draw, or if your symptoms worsen.
