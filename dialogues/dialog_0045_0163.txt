DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Good to see you, or, well, seeing you. Eighty-five, huh?
PATIENT: Indeed. A rather… lengthy tenure, wouldn't you agree? Though I maintain a surprising degree of functionality, all things considered. I trust the chart accurately reflects my name – Vantine, Jarvis Vantine. It’s a family name, you see, rather… distinguished. Now, about this diet review… it stems from a regrettable experiment, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see the name is correct. Distinguished, alright. And this “regrettable experiment”… what exactly did that entail, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: It began innocently enough. A friend – rather younger than myself, admittedly – became quite enthralled with the “Breatharian Diet,” you understand. Living entirely on sunlight and… well, air. Utter nonsense, of course, but he was adamant. He convinced me to try a… modified version. A great deal of fruit juices, ostensibly to “prepare” one's system. Then, progressively less and less solid food. It didn't last long, thankfully. But it left me… feeling rather depleted. And my daughter insisted I come and have a professional opinion. A sensible girl, she is.
DOCTOR: Breatharian, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. A most peculiar notion. I gathered it involved a rather… spiritual interpretation of nourishment. The specifics eluded me, and frankly, I didn’t wish to know them. One doesn't need to understand madness to recognise it, you see. The fruit juices were… tolerable, initially. But a man requires more than nectar, wouldn’t you agree? It was the subsequent restriction that proved… unwise. My daughter, Penelope, was quite insistent I discontinue immediately, which I did, naturally. But I've felt rather… off-colour ever since. A touch of lethargy, a general lack of… vim. Perhaps I’m being overly dramatic. Old men are prone to such things.
DOCTOR: Lethargy and a lack of “vim,” alright. And how long ago did you stop this…juice-only regimen?
PATIENT: Let me see… It was just after the Jubilee celebrations, you know. The Platinum Jubilee. June of last year, then. Yes, June of 2024. A lovely event, though rather crowded. I believe it was approximately ten days of purely liquid sustenance, followed by a… gradual reintroduction of biscuits. Digestive biscuits, naturally. One must maintain some standards. And then, a return to a more… conventional diet, albeit a rather diminished one. I haven't quite regained my appetite, you see. It’s rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly a year and two months. And have you noticed any other symptoms besides the fatigue and reduced appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me consider. No, not precisely symptoms, as such. Although… my sleep has been rather fragmented. I wake frequently, and rarely feel truly rested. And my digestion… well, it's not what it once was. A touch of… discomfort, shall we say. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… not entirely harmonious. Oh, and Penelope mentioned my skin appeared… rather pale. She’s quite observant, that girl. Though prone to exaggeration, perhaps. She always insisted I wore a hat. A most unflattering Panama, at that. But I digress. The fragmented sleep, the digestive… irregularities, and the paleness, I suppose. That covers the salient points, I believe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, none whatsoever. I've always prided myself on a rather robust constitution. A daily glass of sherry, perhaps, for medicinal purposes, you understand. But nothing prescribed by a physician, no. I've always found a good night’s sleep and a sensible diet to be the best remedies. Though, clearly, I miscalculated on that last point. I detest the thought of being… medicated. It implies a certain… fragility, doesn’t it? A surrender, of sorts. I much prefer to rely on natural means, when possible. Though I am, of course, here seeking your professional opinion, so I am open to suggestions. Within reason, naturally.
DOCTOR: So, just the sherry. How much sherry would you say you consume daily?
PATIENT: Just the sherry…as if it were a mere triviality! Good heavens. A small glass, mind you. A modest portion. Approximately… 125 milliliters, I believe. With dinner. It aids digestion, you see. My late wife, Beatrice, always insisted upon it. A rather dry Amontado, naturally. One doesn’t quaff inferior beverages. And it's not a continuous indulgence, you understand. Perhaps five evenings a week. Sometimes less. One must maintain a degree of temperance, even in the pursuit of enjoyment. It is hardly a… scandalous habit, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, 125 milliliters of Amontado five nights a week. And no other medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Absolutely nothing, I assure you! Not a single tincture, pill, or potion. I find the entire concept rather… unsettling. Beatrice once attempted to introduce a cod liver oil supplement, but I put a firm stop to that immediately. The taste was simply… barbaric. No, Doctor, I am a man of simple habits, and I have managed to maintain a reasonable degree of health for eighty-five years without resorting to pharmacological interventions. Unless you count the sherry, of course. Which, as I’ve explained, is purely medicinal. I trust that clarifies matters? It seems I am being subjected to an inordinate amount of scrutiny regarding my… evening beverage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Let’s move on to your family history. Any significant illnesses in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Family history… yes. A rather… complex affair, actually. Beatrice’s side was remarkably robust. Sturdy Yorkshire folk, you see. My own lineage… somewhat more delicate. My father suffered from a touch of gout, I believe. And his brother, Uncle Arthur, succumbed to a rather unfortunate bout of influenza in the Great War. But beyond that… nothing particularly noteworthy. My mother was a hypochondriac, of course, but one hardly counts that as an illness. She was convinced she had consumption for most of her life, but it turned out to be merely a touch of… nervousness. So, gout, influenza, and a predisposition to anxiety, I suppose. Not a particularly alarming pedigree, all things considered. Though Beatrice always maintained that I inherited my… particular fastidiousness from my maternal grandmother. A rather formidable woman, by all accounts.
DOCTOR: Alright, so gout and a history of influenza on your father's side, and anxiety on your mother's. Any heart disease, stroke, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… Heart disease. My aunt, Agatha, Beatrice’s sister, suffered a rather debilitating heart condition in her later years. Required… quite a lot of attention, I believe. And, yes. Uncle Cecil, on my mother’s side, succumbed to a rather unpleasant form of cancer. Lung cancer, I believe. A heavy smoker, unfortunately. A dreadful habit. Stroke… I don’t recall any instances of stroke directly, though my grandmother, on my father’s side, suffered a bout of… paralysis in her final years. Whether that was attributable to a stroke, I couldn’t say with certainty. It was rather a long time ago, you see. A rather nebulous affair, as I recall. So, heart disease, lung cancer, and a possible stroke. Not a particularly encouraging list, I must admit. Though one shouldn't necessarily assume a hereditary predisposition, should one? Bad habits are often the culprit, you see. The smoking, in particular. A most regrettable vice.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just standard things—listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, things like that. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. Though I do hope it won’t be overly… intrusive. I’ve always been rather particular about personal space, you see. And I trust your stethoscope is thoroughly sanitized. One can’t be too careful these days. A brisk examination, I presume? No unnecessary… probing, if you please. I’ve been examined by physicians before, naturally, and I’ve always found a degree of efficiency to be… reassuring. Proceed, then. But gently, if you wouldn’t mind. A man of my age is not as resilient as he once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/85. Heart rate is regular, but a bit slow at 62. Lungs sound clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly distended. No masses palpated. Pulses are weak, but present. Skin is pale and dry, as your daughter noted. Overall, it seems you have some mild signs of dehydration and possibly some reduced circulation. We need to run some blood work to get a better picture.
PATIENT: Dehydration, you say? Distended, pale… Good heavens. It all sounds rather… alarming, doesn't it? Reduced circulation, too? I do recall feeling a touch of… coolness in my extremities. Though I attributed that to the rather drafty nature of my drawing room. Elevated blood pressure… I suppose that sherry is to blame. A small glass, mind you! But I see. Blood work, you say? Yes, of course. Whatever is necessary to ascertain the extent of the… malaise. Is it a painful procedure? I’ve always disliked needles. A swift, efficient extraction, if you please. And a plaster afterward, naturally. One must maintain appearances, you see. A man of my age can’t be seen sporting a puncture wound. Proceed, then. But gently. And swiftly.
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be quick. A small puncture, as you said. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, complete blood count, and thyroid levels. It’ll give us a good baseline to see what's going on. We’ll also check your vitamin D levels, as dehydration can often lead to deficiencies. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. It might sting for a moment, but it’s usually over very quickly. Is there anything else I can address before she comes in?
PATIENT: Vitamin D, you say? Dehydration… It all seems rather… involved, doesn’t it? No, I believe that covers most of it. Though… my sleep. You mentioned fatigue, but I haven’t slept soundly in months. Fragmented, restless… Is there anything that can be done about that? A mild sedative, perhaps? Though I’m hesitant to… succumb to pharmacological interventions. And the nurse… is she experienced? A gentle touch is paramount, you see. I don’t wish to… create a scene. A swift, efficient extraction, a gentle touch, and no unnecessary… probing. That’s all I ask. And perhaps a biscuit afterward? A digestive, naturally. It steadies the nerves.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll discuss options for your sleep after we get the blood work results. We can consider some non-pharmacological interventions first – things like improving sleep hygiene and relaxation techniques. As for the nurse, yes, she’s very experienced. Gentle touch is standard procedure. I’ll make a note about your preference for a biscuit. Now, let’s get the blood draw done. The nurse is just outside the door. Nurse, can you come in, please?
PATIENT: Very well, then. A non-pharmacological intervention… a digestive biscuit… Yes. Proceed. Though do try to ensure the needle is… adequately sterilized. One can't be too careful. And perhaps a calming presence? A reassuring word or two would be… greatly appreciated. It’s the unexpected that unsettles me, you see. A swift, efficient extraction, a sterile needle, a calming presence… and a biscuit. That’s all I ask. Very well. Let us proceed.
DOCTOR: Nurse, Mr. Vantine is a bit anxious about the blood draw. Please be as gentle and reassuring as possible. He prefers a digestive biscuit afterward. The nurse will be in shortly. Just try to relax, and let me know if you feel any discomfort during the process. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
