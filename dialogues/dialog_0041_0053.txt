DOCTOR: Hi Kandy, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve been having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom, actually. It’s harder than it used to be, you see. It takes me a while to start, and sometimes it feels like I just… can’t quite go all the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble with urination. That's something we can definitely look into. Hmm… can you tell me a little more about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started, I’d say, maybe six months ago? It was very gradual at first. Just a little bit harder to get started. But these past couple of months, it’s gotten… noticeable. I don’t keep exact track of things, you understand, but it’s been a good two months of really feeling it. It’s not every time, but often enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Right, six months gradually worsening, with the last two months being more noticeable. Okay. And when you are able to go, would you describe the stream as weak, or does it feel normal once you get started?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It’s… not as strong as it used to be, I think. It doesn't feel like it's cutting off completely, but it’s definitely not the powerful stream I remember having when I was younger. It kind of… sputters a bit, if that makes sense. And it takes me a little longer to empty completely. I have to… push a bit, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weaker stream, sputtering, and needing to push to empty. I see. And are you noticing any pain or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain, thankfully. It’s not painful. It’s just… frustrating, you know? And a bit worrying. It’s more of an effort than anything. It doesn’t burn or anything like that. Just… difficult. I’m glad it’s not painful, though. That would be much worse.
DOCTOR: Right, no pain, just difficulty and effort. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in how often you need to go?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I seem to be going more often, especially at night. I usually wake up once, sometimes twice, to go to the bathroom. I didn’t used to do that. During the day it's mostly normal, but those nighttime trips are new. And… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, but sometimes I feel like I have to go even when I just went a little while ago. Like my bladder isn't holding as much.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, especially at night, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… Hmm. Do you have any trouble starting the stream, or does it just take a moment to get going?
PATIENT: It’s definitely trouble starting. It doesn’t come right away like it used to. I have to… wait. And sometimes I have to strain a little. It feels like I have to force it to start. It’s not instant, that’s for sure. I don’t have a sudden urge, it’s more of a slow build-up and then… effort. It's not like a gush, you understand. It's hesitant.
DOCTOR: Right, hesitant start, requiring effort. Okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements lately?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, a little bit. I’ve been a bit more… constipated, I suppose. Not terribly so, but I haven’t been as regular as I used to be. It’s not every day, but it’s definitely been harder to… go to the other bathroom, if you know what I mean. And I have to… push a bit more, like with the urination. It’s all a bit of an effort these days, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation as well, requiring effort. Hmm… Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll need to check your abdomen, and I'll also do a quick neurological exam just to rule things out. Then we'll likely need to do a urine test. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. An exam and a test sounds sensible. I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible. It's just… a bit worrying, as I said. So yes, please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. I hope I’m not making too much fuss. My knees aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: No fuss at all, Kandy. Just let me know if anything feels tender. Now, I'm just checking for any fullness or discomfort. Okay, your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little bit of… distention in the lower abdomen. Not significantly, but it's there. Now, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's get that urine sample. I'll leave you a cup, and I'll be right back. Just try to collect at least a couple of ounces.
PATIENT: Alright, that all sounds fine. Diminished reflexes… I suppose that’s to be expected at my age. Yes, a urine sample. I can do that. Just let me know where I should leave it when I'm finished. I’ll try to get a good amount for you. Just call out if you need anything.
DOCTOR: Just go ahead when you're ready. There's a lid for the cup. And when you're done, just leave it on the counter and I'll take it from there. Take your time. I'll be just outside if you need anything.
PATIENT: Right. Thank you, Doctor. I'll be right back.
DOCTOR: 66 year old, Lithuanian... Medicare... Increased frequency, especially at night... hesitancy... constipation... diminished reflexes... Let's see what the urine sample tells us.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I think I got a good amount for you. Hopefully that will give you some answers.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Kandy. Alright, let's go ahead and run this through the lab. I'm going to step out for just a few minutes while the results come back. It shouldn't take more than ten or fifteen minutes. I'll be right back to discuss the findings with you. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Ten or fifteen minutes is no trouble at all. I'll just sit here and wait. Thank you for your time, and for looking into this for me. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s see... WBCs are normal, RBCs normal… Glucose normal… Protein is slightly elevated… And there’s a small amount of bacteria present… Hmm… Interesting. Alright, Kandy. I have the results back. The urine sample shows a small amount of bacteria present, and your protein levels are slightly elevated. This suggests a possible urinary tract infection, or UTI, and potentially some inflammation in your bladder. It's not a severe infection at this point, but it’s enough to explain your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A UTI… yes, that makes sense. The frequent trips at night, the difficulty starting… it all adds up. And inflammation… well, that’s not surprising. So, what does that mean? Do I need… antibiotics? Is it serious? I just want to get this sorted out, you see. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: You're right to want to get it sorted out. And yes, you likely will need a course of antibiotics. It’s good we caught this early, so we can address it before it becomes more serious. We'll start you on a seven-day course of Nitrofurantoin. It's a common antibiotic for UTIs, and generally well-tolerated. Now, the slightly elevated protein could be related to the inflammation from the infection, or it could be something else. We'll want to monitor that. I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to repeat the urine sample and check your protein levels again. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Seven days of antibiotics… yes, that sounds manageable. And the follow-up appointment in two weeks… absolutely, that’s sensible. I’d want to make sure everything’s clearing up properly. Nitrofurantoin… is that difficult to take? Any side effects I should be aware of? I don’t want anything that’s going to make me feel worse, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Nitrofurantoin can cause some mild side effects in some people, like nausea or stomach upset. It’s important to take it with plenty of water, and preferably with food, to minimize those effects. Rarely, it can cause a reaction in the lungs, but that’s very uncommon. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or a new fever while taking it, stop the medication immediately and contact me. I’m going to write you a prescription for the antibiotics. I’ll also give you some written instructions on how to take it, and what to watch out for. We'll want to make sure you stay well-hydrated – aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. And try to urinate frequently, even if you don’t feel a strong urge – this helps flush out the bacteria. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. With food, plenty of water, and watch out for any trouble breathing… I’ll remember that. Eight glasses of water… I can manage that. And frequent urination… yes, I’ll make a conscious effort. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing what’s going on and what I need to do. Is there anything else I should be doing? Any foods I should avoid? Or anything I can do to help speed up the recovery?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. There aren't any specific foods you need to avoid. Just stick to a healthy diet and stay hydrated. Cranberry juice is often mentioned, but the evidence is mixed, and it can interact with some medications. It's best to focus on water. To help speed up recovery, just continue to follow the instructions – take the antibiotics as prescribed, stay hydrated, and urinate frequently. Avoid strenuous activity for a few days, as that can irritate your bladder. And most importantly, listen to your body. If you experience any worsening symptoms, or new symptoms, contact me immediately. I’m going to print out a summary of our discussion, along with the prescription and written instructions. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You've covered everything so thoroughly. I really appreciate your patience and clear explanations. I feel much more confident now, knowing what's going on and what I need to do to get better. Thank you again for everything. I’ll be sure to schedule that follow-up appointment for two weeks. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns at all. I'll see you in two weeks. Get well soon!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
