DOCTOR: Right. Kahrin Kovtun, age 29. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi. Just the results, please. I was told it was ready and I really need to get back to work. I’m a little tight on time.
DOCTOR: “Results,” is it?
PATIENT: Yes. The tests I had done last week. Everything was normal, right? I just need confirmation so I can… move on. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Well, "normal" is a relative term, isn't it?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, I guess so. Look, I’m a logistician, not a doctor. I just need to know if I’m good to go or if I need to… not be. Can we just get to the point? I remember exactly when and where I had each test done, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s see… You had a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test on July 26th. The CBC and BMP were… within the usual range. However, your TSH is slightly elevated. It's 4.8. Normal is generally considered to be between 0.4 and 4.0.
PATIENT: 4.8? Okay. And… what does that mean? Is that bad? I don’t understand numbers like that. Is it something I should worry about? I haven’t felt any different, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Not feeling different” doesn’t always mean something isn’t going on. A slightly elevated TSH indicates your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormone. It could be subclinical hypothyroidism. It’s not an emergency, but it’s also not something to ignore. It can lead to fatigue, weight gain, constipation… things you might not notice immediately.
PATIENT: Okay… fatigue I get sometimes, but honestly, who doesn’t these days? Constipation… well, that comes and goes. What do we… do about it? Do I need medication? I really don’t want to be on medication if I can avoid it. I have a lot of travel for work. Would that mess things up?
DOCTOR: Travel complicates things, certainly. It’s… less about messing things up and more about maintaining consistency. We need to repeat the TSH test to confirm the result wasn't just a temporary fluctuation. If it remains elevated, then we'll discuss treatment options. Typically, for a level like yours, we’d start with a low dose of levothyroxine. It's a synthetic thyroid hormone. However, before we jump to medication, let’s look at your history. Any family history of thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Hm. Thyroid… my grandmother on my mother’s side had something, I think. She was always cold, even in Tahiti. But she was… old. I honestly don’t remember the details. She passed away years ago. No one else that I know of. I really don’t have time to trace family medical records right now. Is another test enough? And when do we do that? I have a shipment leaving next week, so it has to be soon.
DOCTOR: "Soon" isn't a medical timeframe, Ms. Kovtun. But I understand you have commitments. We can repeat the test in one week. August 9th. That should allow enough time for the results to come back before your shipment. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. I’m pretty healthy, actually. I eat well, try to get enough sleep when I can… it's mostly stress from work. I really just need this sorted so I can focus on that. So, August 9th. And then we see what the numbers say? Okay, good. I can make that work. Is there anything else I need to do? Like, special fasting or anything? I remember reading online about different tests needing different things.
DOCTOR: Yes, you need to fast for 12 hours before the test. No food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And frankly, Ms. Kovtun, I advise against self-diagnosing via the internet. It’s often inaccurate and causes unnecessary anxiety. We’ll interpret your results here, based on your individual health profile, not some random website. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, okay, I understand. No internet diagnosing. 12-hour fast. I just… like to be prepared. It’s part of my job, being organized and knowing everything. So, August 9th, nothing to eat. Got it. Can I schedule that now, please? And… is there a cost for the re-test? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a cost. $75 for the TSH retest. And I'm going to order a complete thyroid panel this time. That’s $150. It will give us a more comprehensive picture, which is advisable given your family history. It’s more responsible, in the long run. Do you want me to proceed with that?
PATIENT: $225? Ugh. Okay, fine. Just… get it over with. It’s better to know, I guess. And… can I just book it now? I really need to go. I have a conference call in an hour. So, yes, book the full panel for August 9th. Let's just be done with this. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: Here. The lab requisition gives the lab specifics for your test, and the financial consent confirms the cost. Please sign and date it. The lab is on Elm Street, across from the hospital. Fasting starts tonight at midnight. Any questions?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the forms. Okay, all done. Thanks. I guess I’ll see you on the 9th. .
