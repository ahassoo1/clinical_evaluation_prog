DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Pierre, suggested I come. He’s been reading things online, you see, about… planning for the future. About what happens if… one is unable to make decisions. He thinks I should have one of those forms. An “advance directive,” he called it. Frankly, I find the whole topic rather… morbid. But Pierre is very insistent.
DOCTOR: I see. An advance directive, yes. A sensible precaution, though I agree, not a particularly cheerful subject. Your husband’s concern is…well, logical. However, before we delve into legal documents, let's ascertain your current state of health. It’s important to establish a baseline, shall we say?
PATIENT: Baseline? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. I’ve always been robust. I teach four sections of French Literature, you know. It’s a demanding profession, requires a sharp mind. I don't get sick. Though, admittedly, I did have a rather nasty bout of… indigestion last month, after a dinner party. But that was the oysters, I suspect. Really, I don’t see the need for a “baseline.” Isn’t this about the form, not a check-up?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, “perfectly healthy” is a subjective assessment. Teaching is mentally stimulating, certainly, but it doesn't preclude underlying…physiological concerns. And indigestion, while potentially oyster-related, could indicate other issues. A thorough review of your medical history and a brief physical examination are standard procedure, even when the primary concern is an advance directive. It provides context. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Chronic conditions? No. Absolutely not. My mother always said strong women don't have chronic conditions. We simply… endure. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, of course, but nothing lasting. A few headaches, but who doesn’t? I take no regular medications. Really, Doctor, I am wasting my time here if we are to simply discuss my hypothetical ailments. My husband seems to think I'm on death's door, which is simply not the case.
DOCTOR: Very well. No chronic conditions, no medications. And you've had the standard childhood illnesses. Has there ever been any… surgical intervention?
PATIENT: Surgical intervention? No. Never. I have always been very careful. Pierre, he’s had his knee done, twice now, because he insists on playing rugby at his age. Utter foolishness. But I… no. Nothing of the sort. I pride myself on maintaining a certain…natural state. Really, Doctor, are you quite certain this is necessary? This feels like a rather invasive line of questioning for a simple form.
DOCTOR: It is standard procedure, Ms. Chilla. To establish a complete medical profile. Now, let’s move on to family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mother, sadly, passed away five years ago. A very dignified passing, I assure you. She was 87. My father… he’s still with us, though he’s quite frail. Living in a retirement community in Marrakech. He's… always been a bit delicate. Never a robust constitution, unlike myself. He had some… heart trouble in his later years, I believe. Nothing specific, Pierre handles all those details. He’s a retired doctor, you see, very meticulous. Really, I'm not sure what relevance this has to… the form. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Ms. Chilla. Family history can indicate predispositions. Your father’s heart trouble is noted. And your mother…what was the cause of her passing?
PATIENT: She… passed away in her sleep. Very peacefully. The doctors said… something about heart failure, I believe. But she was old, you see. It was to be expected. She hadn't been well for some time, although she refused to admit it. Always very stoic, my mother. Absolutely refused any fuss. She would have hated all this… probing. Frankly, Doctor, I find it rather disrespectful to her memory. Can we please just discuss the advance directive now? I have a grading deadline looming, and this is taking up valuable time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, your insistence on avoiding a basic medical assessment is…unusual. While I understand your desire to expedite this process, neglecting a proper evaluation is…irresponsible. However, to satisfy your concerns, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Doctor, are you implying something? I am a French Literature professor! We appreciate culture, refinement… not such vulgar habits. Absolutely not. Never. My husband, he occasionally enjoys a cigar, but I find the smell quite appalling. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps two. A good Bordeaux, or a delicate Sancerre. But smoking? Preposterous. Really, I fail to see the relevance of this line of questioning. Are we assessing my character now, Doctor? Perhaps you should be focusing on the form, as my husband requested, instead of… judging my lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Very well. No smoking. A glass or two of wine. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I've always been remarkably resilient. I can eat anything, travel anywhere. I once ate fried insects in Thailand, quite deliberately, just to prove a point. No reaction whatsoever. Perhaps a slight… indigestion, but nothing significant. Really, Doctor, I am a picture of health. Are you quite certain you are qualified to assess me? I begin to suspect this is a waste of both our time. Perhaps I should seek a second opinion?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, with all due respect, your…robustness is noted. However, a lack of known allergies does not preclude the possibility of an allergic reaction. Now, I am going to perform a brief physical examination. Just a standard check of your vital signs, auscultation of your heart and lungs, and palpation of your abdomen. It will take only a few moments. Please sit back, and relax.
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I will not be subjected to a physical examination. I came here to discuss a form, not to be… prodded and poked like some common patient. I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. This is utterly unnecessary and, frankly, quite insulting. I demand that you simply provide me with the advance directive form and allow me to leave. I have grading to do, and I will not waste another moment of my valuable time on this… charade. I think I will be seeking a second opinion. And perhaps a lawyer. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. As you wish. I will have my staff prepare the advance directive form for you. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider your stance on a proper medical evaluation. It is in your best interest. .
