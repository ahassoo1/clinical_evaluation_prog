DOCTOR: Hi Armando, welcome. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I ain't got all day. Just need a paper signed, if you please. Something 'bout… fixin' myself up a little. My niece said I needed clearance 'fore I do it. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A paper for… what exactly are you hoping to get cleared for?
PATIENT: Look, it’s a… a little nip and tuck. That's all. Don't need to get into details. Just need you to say it's alright. I’m a busy man, Doctor. Towers don't climb themselves, you know. Cellular ain't free.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re short on time, Armando. But to properly complete the clearance form – and to make sure it’s safe for you – I do need a little more information. It’s not about being nosy, it’s about providing good care. Specifically, I need to know what kind of procedure you’re planning. “Nip and tuck” can mean a lot of different things. And I’ll also need to review your medical history to make sure you’re a good candidate. Do you have a list of your medications and any past medical conditions or surgeries?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness gracious. You expect me to remember all that? I take a little somethin’ for my knees sometimes, but that's it. Past surgeries… maybe a tonsil thing when I was a boy? Look, I ain't sick. I just wanna… improve my appearance. This is ridiculous, Doctor. You makin’ a mountain outta a molehill. Clearance. Paper. Sign it. I got work to do. And I don’t have insurance, if that matters. She told me you'd ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I hear your frustration, and I appreciate you telling me you don't have insurance. That absolutely matters and we'll work with that. It is important that I understand what’s being planned, even if it seems simple. "Something for your knees" – can you tell me what that medication is?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… a pill. White one. Comes in a little bottle. Doctor down the street gave it to me. Can't recall the name, been a while. Look, I'm tellin' ya, I'm a healthy man! Worked on them towers my whole life. Strong as an ox! I don't need a detailed examination. Just… write somethin' down that says I'm alright to… do what I wanna do. Is that so hard? This whole thing is a waste of my time. Really.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel healthy, and that’s great. But even healthy people can have underlying conditions or react unexpectedly to procedures. Without knowing what medication you're taking, or even what procedure you're planning, I can't responsibly sign that clearance form. Let’s try this: do you happen to have any paperwork from the doctor who prescribed the knee medication, or a list of your current medications anywhere?
PATIENT: Look, I already told you. I don't have paperwork. It was years ago! Small practice, old doctor, retired now probably. I just went in for a twinge, he gave me a pill, and I took it when my knees bothered me. I don't keep records of everything! And honestly, this is gettin' me nowhere. I think I need to find another doctor. Someone who understands I don't have time for all this… scrutiny. This is just… preposterous. And a waste of perfectly good workin' hours. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando. I understand your frustration, and you are certainly welcome to seek a second opinion. However, I can’t ethically sign a clearance form without more information, as it would put your health at risk. I want to be clear: I’m not trying to be difficult. I’m trying to protect your well-being. Given you don’t have a medication list and are reluctant to provide details about the procedure, I’m unable to proceed. I recommend you schedule an appointment with a primary care physician who can properly assess your health and help you make an informed decision. I can give you a list of doctors in the area. I wish you all the best. .
