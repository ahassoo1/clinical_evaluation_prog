DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Hmm… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I seem to be… going to the bathroom rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, just… a lot. I suppose that’s why I made the appointment. It’s been going on for a little while now, but I thought it best to get it checked. Do you follow? I apologize if I’m not being very clear. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're being perfectly clear, Mr. Verbos. Frequent urination can be disruptive, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. It's very common, and there are several possible causes. When you say “more than usual,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually, I would say… perhaps three or four times a day. Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Even through the night, I find myself getting up. It’s… unsettling, to be honest. I don’t recall this happening before, not to this degree. Is that helpful? I'm terribly sorry for the vagueness. I really struggle with dates and timelines, you see.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, a noticeable increase from three or four times a day to every couple of hours, including waking you up at night. That does sound like a significant change. And it’s perfectly alright to struggle with timelines; we'll figure things out together. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Well… let me consider. No… no pain, as I mentioned. No burning sensation. Thirst… perhaps a little more thirsty than usual, but nothing drastic. I haven’t noticed any changes in… well, in the color or smell, if you don’t mind me being so blunt. I don’t think so, at least. It’s just… the constant need to go. I suppose I’m a little more tired than usual, now that you mention it. Could be the sleep disruption, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, burning, or changes in urine appearance or smell. Increased thirst and some fatigue, possibly related to the disrupted sleep. That helps narrow things down. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see… I believe I had a bout of… something with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with… pills, I think. I’m on Medicare, so I see a lot of doctors, and it all gets a bit muddled, I'm afraid. Nothing major, as far as I recall. And I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, honestly. I used to be quite active, but… well, time takes its toll, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It certainly does. And it's understandable to feel overwhelmed with multiple doctors. We'll take our time. You mentioned being on medication for blood pressure. Do you happen to know the name of that medication, or could you bring a list with you next time?
PATIENT: That would be… difficult, I'm afraid. I don’t keep track of those things. My daughter usually handles the refills and such. Perhaps I could ask her? Yes, that’s a good idea. I can bring a list next time. I apologize for the inconvenience. It's just… everything gets lost in the shuffle, you see.
DOCTOR: No inconvenience at all, Mr. Verbos. It's very common, and we'll manage. Knowing what medications you're on is helpful, but we can proceed for now. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was quite young, I had my appendix removed. And… I believe I had a minor procedure on my knee, years later. It was a sports injury, I think. Nothing serious, just a… a bit of cartilage, perhaps? Honestly, it’s all very hazy. I was much younger then, and my memory… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and a knee procedure. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family, is there a history of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My father… he had some sort of heart trouble, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from diabetes, later in life. My sister… she was always quite healthy, as far as I know. But beyond that… I’m not really certain. We weren’t a very close family, to be honest. We didn’t discuss these things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been a staunch non-smoker. My wife… well, my late wife… she tried it once or twice, but I quickly dissuaded her. I always believed it was a terrible habit. And I’ve always encouraged others to avoid it as well.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, very occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on special occasions. Nothing more. I wouldn’t say I drink regularly. It doesn’t agree with me, to be honest. I prefer a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol consumption. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to ask about your social history. Are you currently employed or retired?
PATIENT: I am retired. I was an environmental engineer, for many years. A rather demanding profession, I must say. Now, I mostly keep to myself. I enjoy gardening, when the weather permits. And reading, of course. A quiet life, mostly.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful. Alright, Mr. Verbos, now I'd like to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed at your own pace. I'm rather used to these things, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart rate is regular and a bit elevated at 88 beats per minute. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles noted. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses or organomegaly. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Everything appears normal so far, Mr. Verbos, but to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever tests you feel are necessary. A urinalysis and a… a metabolic panel, you said? Yes, go ahead. I trust your expertise. I just want to find out what's causing all this… frequent urination. It’s rather unsettling, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verbos. We'll get to the bottom of this. The urinalysis will check for infection or other abnormalities in your urine, and the metabolic panel will give us a better look at your overall health and kidney function. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, but avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything quite clearly. Drinking more fluids… avoiding caffeine and alcohol… yes, I can certainly manage that. I appreciate your kindness and patience. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so I’m grateful for your understanding. I believe that covers everything, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Verbos. And you're very welcome. Please don't hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind later. The nurse will be with you shortly. We’ll call you with the results as soon as they’re available, typically within 24-48 hours. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a restful afternoon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. I appreciate your time and attention. Goodbye.
