DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It's been there for a few weeks now, and it doesn’t seem to be going away. It’s… concerning me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A lump, you say. A few weeks, alright. And concerning you, I understand. Hmm. Can you describe it to me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It feels… firm, not exactly hard, but definitely not soft. About the size of, oh, maybe a plum? It doesn't really hurt, unless I press on it pretty hard. It feels like it's under the skin, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed any changes in it, like getting bigger or smaller, but I'm checking it pretty often now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Alright, plum-sized, firm but not rock solid, under the skin, and no noticeable changes recently. Yes, that’s helpful. And where exactly in your lower abdomen are we talking about?
PATIENT: It’s… on my right side, a little bit below my belly button. Not right on the hip bone, but a few inches over. It's… hard to explain precisely. It's not in the center, definitely more to the right. Would it help if I… point? I don't want to be awkward, but I'm not sure I'm describing it well.
DOCTOR: No, no awkwardness at all. Please, go ahead and point. It’s far better than my trying to guess. Sometimes these things are tricky to put into words. Let me have a look.
PATIENT: Here. Right about here. You can probably feel it better than see it, to be honest. It's not very prominent visually, but I can feel it quite clearly. It doesn't move around much when I touch it either.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I feel it. Not particularly mobile, you're right. Firm, as you said. And no tenderness to the touch… or at least, not significant. It feels… rather deep. Do you have any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain, no fever, no changes in my bowel movements… nothing like that. I have been a little more tired lately, but honestly, who isn’t? It’s been quite hot, and my work keeps me busy. I’m a choreographer, so I’m on my feet a lot. I hadn’t really connected the two, if that makes sense. Just general fatigue, nothing I’d normally go to a doctor about.
DOCTOR: A choreographer, you say. Demanding work, I imagine. Alright, fatigue, possibly related to your workload. No other symptoms to report. Let's go over your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles – but nothing major. No surgeries, no chronic conditions. My wife handles most of the medical appointments, so I sometimes forget details. I have Medicare, so I've seen doctors regularly for checkups, but nothing has ever been… flagged. I’m generally a healthy person, I think. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Generally healthy," alright. And your wife handles the appointments... interesting. Okay. Any family history of cancer, or abdominal issues?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… gallbladder problems, I think, but nothing cancerous. My father, he had high blood pressure, and his brother… he had some kind of colon issue, years ago. I’m not sure of the details. My wife would know more, honestly. We didn’t discuss medical histories much when we were younger, and now… well, it’s a bit late. I don’t want to be unhelpful, Doctor. I wish I could give you more specific information.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some gallbladder issues in your mother, and a colon issue in your father’s brother. Vague, but better than nothing, I suppose. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I don’t take any regular medication. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains after a long rehearsal, but that’s about it. Nothing prescribed, nothing long-term. I try to stay away from medication whenever possible, if that makes sense. I prefer to manage things naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. No regular medications. And any allergies we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything in the past. Food, medication… nothing. I eat pretty much everything. My wife sometimes worries I eat too much, but that’s a different issue entirely. Does that cover it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No allergies, no medications. Let's do a quick exam. Lie back on the examination table, if you would. We’ll listen to your abdomen and do a more thorough palpation. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to rule things out.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position, or anything like that. I'm a bit stiff today, after rehearsals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing normally… no obvious distension… and… hmm. Yes, I feel the lump again. It’s not particularly tender, as you said, but it is somewhat fixed. That's not ideal. It's roughly 2.5 centimeters in diameter. It doesn't seem to be associated with any superficial lymph nodes. Any pain now?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of pressure, obviously, but not pain. It feels… a bit like it’s deeper than I originally thought. Is that… a bad sign? I apologize for asking, Doctor, I'm just a bit worried. I don’t like feeling something I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a bad sign, Mr. Raghunathan, but it does warrant further investigation. The fact that it's fixed is concerning, which is why I want to get some imaging done. It could be a number of things – a lipoma, a hernia, or something else entirely. To be safe, we need a clearer picture. I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. It's the best way to get a definitive diagnosis. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then let’s do it. How long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to prepare for it in any way? I want to make sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering the scan now. You'll receive a call from the radiology department to schedule an appointment, likely within the next 24-48 hours. You may need to drink some contrast beforehand – they’ll explain everything when they call. As for results… typically, it takes 24-72 hours for the radiologist to interpret the scan and send the report to me. I'll call you as soon as I have it. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or changes in your bowel habits, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Sudden pain, fever, changes in bowel habits… I will keep an eye out for those things. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I suppose it’s just… waiting now. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Precisely. Waiting is often the most difficult part. I’m ordering a referral for you with Dr. Anya Sharma, a general surgeon. She is the best one in this rural location, and you can schedule a consultation with her after you've had the CT scan. I'll have my nurse send the results to her office as well. I want to be clear, Mr. Raghunathan, this is a precautionary measure. We haven't determined anything definitive yet. But it's best to have all the information. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time, and for being so thorough. I will schedule the scan as soon as I hear from the radiology department, and then get in touch with Dr. Sharma. Hopefully, it will all be a simple explanation. I appreciate your honesty and your clear communication. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will escort you to the checkout. And do not hesitate to contact the office if anything changes. .
