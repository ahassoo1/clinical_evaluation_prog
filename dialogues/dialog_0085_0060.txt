DOCTOR: Good morning, Blain. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… family history, mostly. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had some… things. Not good things. And my aunt… she went pretty quickly. I just want to make sure I'm not heading down the same path, you know? Preventative stuff, I guess. It’s just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very responsible of you to think about preventative care, especially with a family history of illness. It’s good to be proactive. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about what “some things” were with your grandmother?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, my mother wasn’t really the type to… dwell. Very private. But as I understand it, it was… something with her organs? Like, they just… stopped working. And then there was the… the swelling. Lots of swelling in her legs and… everywhere, really. And my aunt, it was similar, but faster. A lot faster. They said something about… fluid buildup. Honestly, I don’t even know what it was. Just… bad. It was heart failure, probably? Everyone always whispered that, but nobody actually said it. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you for sharing that, even though it sounds difficult to talk about. Swelling, or edema, and organ failure can be symptoms of many different conditions, so "heart failure" is a possibility, but we need more information to narrow it down. Just to clarify, do you know roughly how old your grandmother and aunt were when they began experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. My grandmother… she was probably in her late sixties, maybe early seventies? It was after she retired, I think. And my aunt… oh, god, she was young. Late forties, maybe? It was… shocking. Really shocking. She was still working, still driving… and then, boom. A few months, and she was gone. It wasn't fair. Honestly, that’s why I'm here. I don’t want to just… suddenly be gone. Is that… stupid?
DOCTOR: No, that's not stupid at all. It's very understandable to be worried, especially with a family history like that and witnessing something so sudden with your aunt. It’s smart to be thinking about this now. Okay. So, we're talking about a potential history of heart issues, or something causing organ failure and swelling, with onset in your grandmother in her late sixties/early seventies, and a much more rapid onset in your aunt in her late forties. Now, let's talk about you. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Work’s stressful, you know? I teach engineering. Lots of deadlines. And I've put on a few pounds, but I blame the stress-eating. I haven't noticed any swelling, or… anything like that. I think I’m healthy. Honestly, that’s the frustrating part. I feel fine. That’s why I feel like I’m wasting your time. Is this the kind of thing you can even… test for before something happens?
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all. Preventative care is my job, and it's very common to want to be proactive, especially with family history involved. And yes, there are things we can test for even before symptoms develop. To be thorough, let me ask a few more questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Look, I run a few miles a week, mostly to keep the weight down, so I’d notice shortness of breath, I think. And definitely no chest pain. Palpitations… maybe if I've had too much coffee, but nothing regular. I'm a pretty… analytical person. I notice changes. I wouldn’t have come in here if I was feeling anything obviously wrong. It's just… the anxiety, I guess. You know? The ‘what ifs’. It keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you're very attuned to your body, which is excellent. And it’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious given your family history. Okay. Just to rule out anything else, have you noticed any changes in your urination – like needing to go more or less frequently, or any difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that either. Pretty normal, as far as I can tell. I mean, I drink a lot of water, so… yeah. Normal. Honestly, Dr. Lahn, is there anything wrong with me? You're asking a lot of questions about things I don't have. I'm starting to feel like a hypochondriac. I should probably just go home. Is that a bad idea?
DOCTOR: You're not a hypochondriac at all. I am asking these questions to be comprehensive, and to make sure we aren’t missing anything. You are perfectly right to question if it is a waste of time, and I want to assure you it’s not. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. It’s routine, and will just help me get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and ankles. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with, I guess. It’s just… I have a class at three. And I really need to grade some papers before then. But, yeah, fine. Do your thing. Just… be quick, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick as possible. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 128/80, which is good. And I’m not detecting any edema in your legs or ankles. Your pulses feel strong and equal in both legs. Everything seems normal on initial assessment. Now, just to be cautious given your family history, I would like to order a few blood tests. These will help us assess your kidney function, check for any inflammation, and get a baseline lipid panel. We should also do an EKG, just to rule out any heart abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests and… an EKG. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. As long as it doesn't take all day. And, uh… will it be expensive? My insurance… it’s Medicare, but it doesn’t cover everything. And I'm still paying off some student loans. I'm just… practical, okay? I need to know what I'm getting into financially. Is it something I should even worry about?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Being practical is smart, and it’s a valid concern. The blood tests are relatively standard, and the EKG is quick and painless. With Medicare, your out-of-pocket costs should be minimal, likely just your standard co-pay or deductible for each test. I can have the lab check your coverage details before proceeding to give you a more accurate estimate. To be on the safe side, I’d also like to order a BNP test. That stands for B-type natriuretic peptide. It can help detect early signs of heart failure, even if the EKG and blood tests are normal. It’s a simple blood test, and can give us more peace of mind. Would you like me to include that?
PATIENT: Ugh. Another test? Seriously? Okay, fine. Add the… BNP thing. Whatever it takes to get this over with and know for sure. Just… promise me you're not trying to scare me. I’m already stressed enough. And can you just… explain the results to me in plain English? No medical jargon, okay? I’m an engineer, not a doctor. I understand logic and data, just… not organ failure. And if everything’s normal, can I just… go back to my life? This is… consuming my time.
DOCTOR: I promise you I’m not trying to scare you. We’re just being thorough, especially given your family history. It's always best to have as much information as possible. And absolutely, I will explain everything in plain English, no medical jargon. I understand you're an engineer, so I'll approach it logically and with data. And yes, if everything comes back normal, you can absolutely go back to your life. That’s the goal! I’ll order the blood tests and EKG now. The lab technician will draw your blood, and the EKG will be done right here in the clinic. It should take about 30-45 minutes total. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, are there any questions I can answer for you before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. Just… get it over with, okay? Thanks, Dr. Lahn. I appreciate your… patience. And hopefully, it’s just a waste of time. That would be… good. Really good. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I understand your anxiety, and I hope we can put your mind at ease. I'll have the technician come in shortly to draw your blood. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while we're waiting.
