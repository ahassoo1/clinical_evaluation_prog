DOCTOR: Hi Evann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I believe I’m here to discuss some paperwork regarding future medical decisions. I was advised to obtain an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form, I don't quite recall which was recommended. It was suggested to me, but the details are… a little hazy, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It can be a lot to take in. So, you’re looking into planning for future healthcare decisions – that’s very proactive of you. Let’s clarify things. An Advance Directive is a general document outlining your wishes, while a POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a medical order specifically for serious illness. Do you have any idea why someone suggested you look into these forms?
PATIENT: A general outline versus a specific order… that does help clarify things, thank you. As for why… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. It was… after a rather unpleasant incident, some months ago. I was unwell, and… there were discussions. People were speaking about me, it felt like, rather than to me. A friend, I believe, was quite insistent I get something in writing, to avoid similar situations in the future. But beyond that… the specifics escape me. I apologize for my vagueness. My memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Evann. That actually gives me a good starting point. It sounds like there was a period of illness where you felt your wishes weren’t being fully respected or communicated, and a friend rightly stepped in to advocate for you. That’s a valid reason to explore these options. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little more about this incident?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult to recall precisely. It was a respiratory illness, I believe. A severe infection. I was in the hospital for some time. There was a great deal of… beeping. And faces. So many faces. I remember feeling… overwhelmed. And… a sense of detachment. I wasn’t able to clearly communicate my wishes, or perhaps they weren’t… fully heard. There were decisions made about… interventions. I don't recall the specifics of what was done, only the feeling of powerlessness. It was… unsettling. I believe my ex-husband was involved in some of the discussions, and… we don’t always see eye to eye. That may have contributed to the confusion. I apologize again for the lack of detail. It's like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly understandable. A severe illness, a hospital stay, and a feeling of not being fully in control is a lot to process, and it’s common for details to be fuzzy. It sounds like there was some concern about communication and potential disagreements about your care. Given that, it’s good you’re thinking about this now. Let's start with a quick review of your current health status. Have you been seeing any other doctors recently?
PATIENT: Yes, that's a fair assessment, Doctor. It was… a trying time. As for my current health… I do see Dr. Chen, my primary care physician, for regular check-ups. He’s quite thorough. I had a routine appointment with him just last month, and everything was… satisfactory, I believe. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but he’s managing it with medication. Aside from that… I’m generally well, considering. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle; I enjoy long walks, and I am careful with my diet. Though I do occasionally forget to take my medication. A minor detail, perhaps, but… a habit I am working on.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So you’re under Dr. Chen’s care, blood pressure is being managed, and you’re generally healthy with regular walks and a good diet, despite occasionally forgetting medication. We can certainly document that for completeness. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I believe I have a mild sensitivity to penicillin. Not a severe reaction, thankfully, just a rash. And… I am rather sensitive to certain pollens, particularly birch. It causes… a great deal of sneezing and watery eyes during the spring months. Aside from that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing life-threatening, at least. Is that the sort of detail you require, Doctor? I apologize if I am being… unhelpful. It’s difficult to recall everything.
DOCTOR: No, you’re being perfectly helpful, Evann. It's good to know about the penicillin sensitivity and the seasonal allergies. We’ll document those as well. Are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, aside from the blood pressure medication… Dr. Chen prescribed a mild antihistamine for the seasonal allergies. Cetirizine, I believe it’s called. I take it as needed, usually during the spring and fall. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for headaches. But that's infrequent. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Oh, and I occasionally take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months. My levels were a little low during my last check-up. I apologize for the constant additions. It seems my mind is a rather disorganized archive.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. It’s good you're so proactive about your health. Cetirizine for allergies, ibuprofen as needed, and Vitamin D – all helpful information. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a difficult question. My family is… rather dispersed. I grew up primarily with my mother, and she didn’t discuss medical conditions often. I know my grandfather, on my mother’s side, suffered from diabetes. And… my aunt, I believe, had heart problems later in life. But beyond that… I’m not entirely sure. My mother wasn’t particularly forthcoming about such matters. I apologize for my lack of knowledge. It’s a gap in my understanding, I suppose. I’m not close to many relatives, and the information hasn’t been readily available. It may be a detail we cannot readily ascertain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Evann. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. We can document what you do know – diabetes in your grandfather and heart problems in your aunt. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke, nor do I drink alcohol. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I’ve never had an inclination towards such habits. I find them… detrimental to one’s health, and frankly, rather unappealing. I do enjoy a cup of green tea occasionally, but that’s hardly a vice. A rather uneventful social history, I’m afraid. Perhaps disappointingly so.
DOCTOR: Not at all! It's excellent to hear. Now, let's do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed as you see fit. I trust your judgment entirely. I will endeavor to remain still and cooperative. Do let me know if there is anything I can do to assist you.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's check your vital signs. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. That blood pressure is a little elevated, as we discussed with Dr. Chen. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Throat is clear, ears appear normal. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Neurological function appears intact. Everything appears within normal limits, Evann. Now, considering everything we've discussed, and your desire for Advance Directives, let’s talk about what those are and which one might be best for you. Do you have any initial questions?
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring, thank you. It’s good to know everything appears within normal limits, despite the slightly elevated blood pressure. As for my questions… yes, I believe I do. I confess, I’m still rather unclear on the distinction between the various types of Advance Directives. I understand the general principle – outlining my wishes for future care – but the specifics are… nebulous. And I'm uncertain which one would be most suitable for my circumstances. I recall something about a ‘living will’ and a ‘durable power of attorney for healthcare,’ but I’m unsure of the differences, or their implications. Perhaps you could elucidate those points for me, Doctor? And advise me on which one aligns best with my expressed desires, given what we’ve discussed today?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Evann. That’s a very good question, and it’s wise to be thorough. Let’s break it down. A Living Will—also known as an advance directive—is a document that specifies the types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you become incapacitated and unable to communicate your wishes. It typically covers things like life support, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. A Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare, on the other hand, designates someone—your healthcare proxy—to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to do so. They’ll make choices based on what they know about your values and wishes. The main difference is that a living will specifies what treatments you want or don’t want, whereas a durable power of attorney for healthcare appoints who will make those decisions. Given your situation—feeling your wishes weren't fully respected during a previous illness and wanting to proactively plan for future care—I think a combination of both would be ideal. A Living Will can outline your specific preferences regarding life-sustaining treatment, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare can ensure someone you trust is advocating for you and making decisions according to your values. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies things considerably, thank you. A Living Will outlining what I desire, and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare appointing who will advocate for me… that does seem like the most comprehensive approach. It addresses both the content of my wishes, and the assurance that they will be faithfully executed. However… appointing a healthcare proxy raises a further question. I am… somewhat estranged from my ex-husband, and my family is dispersed. I don't have anyone immediately available whom I entirely trust to make such critical decisions on my behalf. Who could I appoint, given my circumstances? And what if they were… unavailable when a decision needed to be made? It’s a rather daunting prospect, honestly.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Evann, and you’re right to consider those potential challenges. It’s better to address them now than to be caught unprepared. You don’t have to appoint someone immediately. It's perfectly acceptable to take your time and find the right person. If you don’t have a close family member or friend you feel comfortable with, you could consider a professional healthcare advocate. These individuals are trained to make medical decisions based on your values and preferences, and they’re legally bound to act in your best interest. It’s an additional expense, of course, but it can provide peace of mind. Alternatively, some hospitals have ethics committees that can assist with decision-making in situations where you don’t have a designated proxy. To start, let's explore if there's anyone at all, even an acquaintance you trust implicitly, who might be willing to serve as a backup proxy. If not, we can discuss the possibility of a professional advocate or explore hospital ethics committee options. We'll find a solution that works for you. And, regardless of who you choose, it's crucial to have a thorough conversation with them about your wishes, values, and preferences.
PATIENT: That’s… incredibly reassuring, Doctor. Knowing there are alternatives beyond immediate family or close friends is a great comfort. The prospect of a professional advocate hadn’t occurred to me, but it does seem a sensible option. I believe I do have an acquaintance, Dr. Anya Sharma, a fellow etcher. She is a level-headed and compassionate individual, and I trust her judgment implicitly. I could perhaps discuss the possibility of her serving as my proxy. However, I confess I’m uncertain about the legal formalities involved. What documents would I need to complete, and where would I obtain them? It's a rather daunting prospect navigating the legal aspects of this process. Is there assistance available to guide me through the necessary paperwork?
DOCTOR: That's excellent! Dr. Sharma sounds like a very good potential proxy. And you’re right to ask about the legal formalities – it can be overwhelming. Fortunately, there are several resources available to help you. Each state has specific requirements for advance directives, but generally, you’ll need to complete a Living Will form and a Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare form. These forms are readily available online through your state’s health department website. There are also pre-printed forms available through organizations like the American Bar Association and the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization. More importantly, it's crucial to have these documents witnessed and notarized according to your state's laws. This ensures they're legally valid. Additionally, it’s strongly recommended to discuss your wishes with your primary care physician, Dr. Chen, and provide them with a copy of your advance directives. We can also provide you with resources and guidance here at the clinic. We have information packets with the necessary forms and a list of local legal professionals who specialize in estate planning. Would you like me to provide those to you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor, that would be immensely helpful. Information packets and a list of local legal professionals would be invaluable. I confess, I am rather unfamiliar with estate planning, and navigating the legal aspects of this process feels daunting. Your assistance is greatly appreciated. Knowing there are resources available to guide me through the necessary paperwork provides a tremendous sense of relief. It’s… comforting to know I’m not navigating this alone. Perhaps, once I’ve reviewed the information packets, I could schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the specifics of my advance directives with you? It would be reassuring to have your expert opinion on the content of the forms, and to ensure they accurately reflect my wishes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Evann. That’s exactly what we’re here for. Here you go. This packet contains the necessary forms, as well as information on your state’s specific requirements. The list includes several attorneys who specialize in estate planning and can assist you with the legal formalities. And yes, please schedule a follow-up appointment. I’m happy to review your advance directives and ensure they accurately reflect your wishes and values. We can also discuss any questions or concerns you may have. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all for today. You have been immensely helpful, and I am deeply grateful for your patience and guidance. You have clarified a great deal of confusion, and I feel much more confident navigating this process now. Thank you again for your assistance. I shall schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist on my way out. Have a pleasant afternoon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Evann. It was my pleasure assisting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful afternoon as well, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
