DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 79 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… well, my hands shake. Been happening for a bit now, I guess. Honestly, time gets away from me, you know? Hard to say how long. It's why I'm here, I suppose. Don't bother me too much, alright? I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I understand time can be difficult to keep track of. We’ll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. When you say your hands shake, can you describe the shaking?
PATIENT: Describe it… hmm. It’s not like a tremble, exactly. More like… a jitter? It happens when I try to do things. Like, holding a cup of coffee… or buttoning my shirt. It’s worse when I’m trying to be precise, I think. And it’s in both hands, mostly. Though… maybe one is worse than the other? Hard to say, really. It’s just… annoying. Is that helpful? I don’t even know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Jezik. Knowing it’s worse with precision and happens in both hands gives us a good starting point. And yes, it’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure exactly what I need to know – we’ll figure it out together. You mentioned it's been happening "for a bit now." Has it been gradually getting worse, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Definitely gradually. It wasn't… bang, suddenly shaking. More like… I noticed it getting harder to steady things. A little spill here, a dropped fork there… things like that. It’s been… well, a while since the forks. I don’t remember specifics. Old age, I guess. Everything blends together after a time. It's not that bad, you know? I can still manage. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Jezik. It’s helpful to know it started gradually. And I appreciate you letting me know you can still manage, mostly. Now, have you noticed the shaking at rest, or only when you're trying to do something?
PATIENT: At rest… hmm. That's a good question. I… don’t think so. Not usually. When I’m just sitting, watching the telly, I don’t notice it. It’s when I use my hands, like I said. Trying to write, or… or hold something steady. Does that make sense? Honestly, I mostly just notice it when it gets in the way. And it's getting in the way more lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. So, it sounds like it's primarily an action tremor. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other things, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any stiffness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Stiffness… now that's a thought. Sometimes, yeah. In the mornings, mostly. I thought it was just getting old. Like everything else creaks and groans a bit when you start the day. It usually loosens up after I get moving. Not terrible, though. I can still get by. I don’t know if that's what you're asking about. It's hard to tell what's normal at my age, you know? Everything aches.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. It is difficult to differentiate normal age-related changes from something else. Morning stiffness is good to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. No, not really. I haven't fallen or anything. I used to be a pretty good dancer, you know. Though that was… a long time ago. I walk alright. Maybe a little slower than I used to. But I haven't stumbled or anything. I don’t think so. It's hard to say. I don't pay attention to things like that unless I fall flat on my face. Is that what you want to know? Can we hurry this up? I have an appointment to… well, it doesn't matter.
DOCTOR: No, we can absolutely move at your pace, Mr. Jezik. And no, you're not being rushed. It’s good to know you haven't experienced any falls or significant balance issues. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. Have you noticed any changes in your speech, like slurring or a quieter voice?
PATIENT: Speech… no. Nobody's told me anything. I talk just fine, as you can see. Maybe my wife complained about something… but she complained about everything. Divorced, you know. Always finding something. No, my speech is alright. I don't think so, anyway. Can we get this over with? I’m starting to get… fidgety. It's probably the shaking.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We can proceed with the physical exam now if you’re comfortable. It will just involve a few simple tests. We’ll check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands more closely. Could you please sit up straight for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. Straight… like this? I haven't sat this straight in years. This chair isn’t very comfortable. Just… hurry it up, alright? I haven’t got all day. And don't poke me too much. I don't like being poked.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just going to have you extend your arms in front of you, palms up. Do you notice any shaking at rest like this?
PATIENT: No. Not really. A little jittery, maybe, but nothing like when I try to use them. It’s… calmer, I guess. Look, are you seeing anything? Because I really need to get going. I have… things to do. Important things. It's probably just old age, anyway. You doctors always worry too much. It’s just my hands, alright? Just my hands.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. There's no significant tenderness to the touch. Now, could you please tap your thumb against each of your fingers, one at a time?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… harder than it looks. I used to be good at things like this. Fine motor skills, they called it. But that was a long time ago. Everything gets harder. Are you writing all this down? Because I doubt it will mean anything. It's just my hands, alright? And they're getting old. Can we stop now? It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: I see, Mr. Jezik. The movements are a little slow and there is some mild tremor present. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. Could you please relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Relax… alright. Like this? I’m not good at relaxing. Always been a fidgeter. My wife used to complain about that too. She complained about everything. Are you going to hit my knees with that little hammer thing? I don't like that. It always makes me jump. Just… be quick, alright? I have things to do. And I’m starting to feel… uncomfortable. This is probably all a waste of time. It’s just my hands. Old hands.
DOCTOR: The reflexes are a bit diminished, Mr. Jezik, but within the normal range for your age. Based on what you’ve described and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you are experiencing an essential tremor. This is a common neurological condition that causes shaking, particularly in the hands, and it often worsens with age. However, it’s important to rule out other possible causes. Would you be willing to get a blood test to check your thyroid function and rule out any vitamin deficiencies?
PATIENT: Blood test? Oh, for… Look, Doctor, I really don’t want to go sticking needles in me. I’ve got enough problems as it is. And what’s the point? You said it's just… essential tremor? That sounds… serious. I just want it to stop shaking, that's all. Can't you give me something for it? A pill? Anything? I don’t want blood tests and… and all that. It’s just my hands, alright? Can't you just give me a pill for my hands? I've got things to do, remember? And I don't have time for all this. Just… a pill. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Jezik. It’s certainly not my intention to make you uncomfortable. While a pill is an option, it’s important to have some baseline information before starting any medication. The blood test would help us rule out other conditions that can cause tremors, ensuring we're treating the correct issue. It would also help us determine the best course of treatment and monitor for any potential side effects. However, if you’re truly opposed to a blood test, we can proceed with a trial of medication. There are several options available, such as propranolol or primidone, that can help reduce the severity of the tremors. Would you prefer to discuss the potential benefits and risks of each medication before making a decision?
PATIENT: Medication… alright. If you’re sure it won’t make me worse… and it’s just a pill… I guess I can try a pill. But no blood tests. I really don't like needles. And if it doesn't work, I'm not coming back. My hands are just getting old. That's probably all it is. But a pill… if it will stop the shaking, just a little bit… alright. Tell me about the pills. What are they? What do they do? And what are the side effects? Don’t leave anything out. I want to know everything. And can I still have my coffee? I need my coffee.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’m happy to discuss the medication options with you. The two most common medications for essential tremor are propranolol and primidone. Propranolol is a beta-blocker, typically used to treat high blood pressure, but it can also help reduce tremors. It works by blocking the effects of adrenaline, which can worsen shaking. Common side effects include fatigue, dizziness, and slow heart rate. Primidone is an anti-seizure medication that can also be effective in reducing tremors. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Both medications can have potential side effects, and it’s important to be aware of them before starting treatment. We would start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your response and any potential side effects. Regarding your coffee, it’s best to limit your caffeine intake while taking these medications, as caffeine can worsen tremors. It’s not necessary to completely eliminate it, but reducing your consumption would be beneficial. Would you prefer to start with propranolol or primidone?
PATIENT: Hmm… propranolol… sounds… worse. Beta-blocker… high blood pressure… I don’t have high blood pressure. Prim… primidone… anti-seizure… sounds… less bad. I don’t have seizures. So, primidone. That sounds… better. As long as it doesn’t make me sleepy. I need to be awake. And I need my coffee. Just a little bit. Less coffee, you said? Alright. Less coffee. As long as it doesn't make me sleepy. So, primidone it is. Let's get this over with. Do I need a prescription? And can I still drive? I need to drive. I have… important things. Just give me the prescription. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I’m happy you’ve made a decision. I’m prescribing primidone, 25mg to be taken twice daily. It’s important to start with this low dose and gradually increase it as tolerated. Here is the prescription. You can take this to any pharmacy. Regarding driving, it’s generally safe to drive while taking primidone, but it’s important to be aware of potential side effects such as drowsiness or dizziness. If you experience any of these side effects, it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. It’s also important to avoid alcohol while taking primidone, as it can enhance the sedative effects. And please, schedule a follow-up appointment with me in four weeks so we can assess your response to the medication and make any necessary adjustments. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Four weeks… alright. I'll try to remember. No alcohol… that's… doable. I don't drink much anyway. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. No, I think that's it. Just… please don’t make me come back if it doesn't work. I have… things to do. Important things. And I'm getting old. It’s probably just old age anyway. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. And… good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. I understand your concerns, and I hope the medication provides some relief. Please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any side effects. Have a good day as well, Mr. Jezik. And take care.
