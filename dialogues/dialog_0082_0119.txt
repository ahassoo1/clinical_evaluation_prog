DOCTOR: Good morning, Jinnie. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. It’s a rather delicate matter, really. Something I wouldn't normally discuss with just anyone. It concerns… a friend. A male friend, you understand. He’s been… discharging. Yes, discharging. From… down there. It’s quite unpleasant, and frankly, concerning. He asked me to come speak with you as he’s… well, he's embarrassed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and I appreciate you coming in on his behalf. “Discharging,” you say… is that a fluid, Jinnie?
PATIENT: Well, of course it’s a fluid, Doctor. What else would it be? Honestly, sometimes I wonder about the training they give these days. It’s… a yellowish color, I believe. And not a large amount, thankfully, but enough to be… noticeable. He’s also been feeling a little… discomfort. A burning sensation, he says. Though he’s a stoic sort, you understand, so it must be rather bothersome if he’s mentioning it at all.
DOCTOR: Right, a yellowish discharge and some burning… and it’s a recent development, or has this been going on for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not been terribly long, no. Perhaps… a week, maybe a little more? He’s not one to pay much attention to these things, you see. He’s always been very… focused on other matters. Work, mostly. Quite a dedicated man, really. But he noticed it after… well, after a rather… intimate encounter. He’s usually very careful, but one can’t be too certain, can one? It's terribly irresponsible of people these days.
DOCTOR: I see. And is he experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, he’s a bit… agitated, naturally. Worrying about these things tends to do that to a person. And he’s been… frequenting the restroom, shall we say. More often than usual. Nothing terribly drastic, just… a little more frequent need to… relieve himself. He hasn't mentioned any pain, thankfully. Though I suppose he wouldn’t tell me if he was suffering terribly, would he? He always tries to be… strong. It's exhausting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Has he had a fever or chills at all recently?
PATIENT: A fever? Goodness, no. He’s not the type to come down with… common ailments. He’s very robust, you see. A strong constitution. Though… now that you mention it, he did complain of feeling a little… warm last night. But he attributed it to the heat. It's been terribly muggy lately. And he had a rather rich dinner. I believe he had paella. Perhaps it was that. It's very spicy, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has he noticed any swelling, redness, or sores anywhere?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, I don’t believe so. He's quite particular about his appearance, you see. He would have noticed immediately if anything was… amiss. Redness… hmm. Perhaps a slight flush, but that could have been the paella again! Honestly, that dish is quite potent. As for sores… well, I haven't examined him, Doctor. I'm not a doctor, you know. I'm just a concerned friend. Though he did mention a little… discomfort. A slight itching, he said. But it could be anything, really. The weather is dreadful, as I said. Everything itches these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like we have a few things to consider. Would you mind if I did a brief exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on?
PATIENT: An… exam? Well, I hadn’t anticipated that. I suppose… if it’s absolutely necessary. But I must insist on a female nurse present at all times. And I would like a thorough explanation of everything you’re doing. I don't approve of unnecessary… probing. It’s rather indelicate, you know. And I really don’t want to see anything unpleasant. Perhaps you could just… look? From a distance? It's really terribly embarrassing for both of us.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand your concerns, and I would never proceed without your full consent. I assure you, everything will be done with the utmost respect and discretion. A nurse will be present throughout the exam. A quick visual inspection may give us some clues, but to properly assess the situation, I'll need to do a brief physical exam. It’s very important to rule out any serious issues. I'll explain everything as I go and stop immediately if you’re uncomfortable. It is also vital that I examine him, not just view from a distance, in order to gather the correct information. Would you like me to explain what that entails?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose I should hear what it entails. Though I remain skeptical. It all sounds rather… invasive. And I still maintain that paella is likely the culprit. But very well. Explain yourself, Doctor. And please, be brief. My time is valuable, you know. I have appointments. And a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as quick and respectful as possible. The exam will involve a visual inspection of the area, and a gentle palpation – that is, feeling – of the abdomen and groin to check for any tenderness or swelling. I would also need to check his temperature. I may ask him to provide a urine sample to check for any infection. We will also check his vital signs – blood pressure and pulse. Everything will be explained to him before it's done and we can stop at any point. Are you happy with that?
PATIENT: Well… it sounds less appalling than I anticipated, I suppose. Though I still think the paella should be investigated first. A thorough examination of the ingredients, perhaps? But very well. We can proceed with your… palpations. Though I expect a full explanation of everything you’re doing, at every step. And no unnecessary… touching. And I do insist on a female nurse present. I'm terribly squeamish, you know. This is all very distressing. And I expect a diagnosis and proposed course of action immediately afterward. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. A nurse will be here momentarily. I will explain every step of the exam as I perform it and we can pause or stop at any time. I will also note your concern about the paella. After the exam, I will give you my assessment and propose a course of action. Just to confirm, is he able to provide a urine sample?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Well, he's a rather private individual, you see. But I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. I’ll have to… ask him. It might be awkward. He's not one for… bodily fluids. Though he manages paella quite well. Let me see if I can convince him. Honestly, this is all terribly inconvenient. It's just paella, I tell you! I suspect the spice level was far too high. But yes, I will attempt to obtain a… sample. Though I make no promises. This is all very distressing.
