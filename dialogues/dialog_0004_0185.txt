DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s my breath. It smells. Bad. Obviously. I just need something to fix it, quickly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Bad.” Can you describe “bad” for me?
PATIENT: Like… rotten. Like something died. Honestly, I don’t need to describe it, do I? It's unpleasant. People have mentioned it. Is that good enough for you? I work outside, fixing roads. It’s not exactly a perfume counter environment, but still.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to be specific, Zelina. “Rotten” could mean many things, and the cause of a bad odor can vary considerably. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, I don’t know. A while. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, honestly. I just noticed it’s been… worse lately. Look, I don’t sit around analyzing my breath, okay? I have a job to do. It's probably the food I eat. I eat what I can when I can.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy. However, determining the cause of a persistent odor is important. "What you can when you can" is also not very helpful. Can you give me a typical idea of what you eat in a day?
PATIENT: Seriously? You need a list? Fine. Okay, usually it’s… coffee, black. For breakfast. Lunch is usually a sandwich, whatever the gas station has. Sometimes chips. Dinner… depends. Leftovers, sometimes fast food if I'm really tired. Look, it’s not gourmet, okay? I'm a highway worker, not a food critic. Does it matter? Just fix the smell.
DOCTOR: It does matter. Certain foods can certainly contribute to bad breath, but a persistent odor can also indicate other issues. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I'm not sick. I just… smell. No, nothing else. Look, is this going to take long? I have to get back to work. People are relying on me. Honestly, it's probably just stress. It's a stressful job.
DOCTOR: Stress can contribute, yes. But we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you experienced any fever, nasal congestion, postnasal drip, sore throat, cough, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: No! Look, I told you, I’m fine. A little tired, maybe, but I work outside all day! I haven’t been sick. No fever, no… nasal conge… whatever that is. Just a bad smell. Can we just get a mouthwash or something? I really don’t have time for this interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination. Specifically, I'll need to look in your mouth and throat, and listen to your lungs. This will help me rule out some potential causes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But be quick about it. I have things to do. And don’t touch me with cold hands or anything. It’s disgusting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please open your mouth wide and say “Ah.” I need to examine your throat and the back of your tongue. Your throat is slightly red, but no visible exudate. Tongue appears normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles.
PATIENT: Can we be done now? It’s really not pleasant having someone poke around in my mouth. Is it something serious? You're making me nervous. I just want a quick fix. A prescription, maybe?
DOCTOR: Based on the examination, there’s no clear indication of a serious infection or lung issue. However, your red throat could indicate mild inflammation, but it’s not necessarily the cause of the odor. Given your diet and the lack of any obvious medical cause, it’s likely the odor is related to poor oral hygiene and potentially some dietary factors. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to recommend a thorough dental cleaning and assessment, to rule out any underlying dental problems. I also recommend improving your oral hygiene – brushing twice a day, flossing daily, and using an antibacterial mouthwash. Would you be willing to provide a stool sample?
PATIENT: A… a what now? Are you serious? A stool sample?! Look, I told you, it’s my breath. You want to look at my… poop?! This is ridiculous. No. Absolutely not. I’m not doing that. Just… give me something for the smell. Anything. I'm wasting my entire day here. A prescription for mouthwash. That’s all I need. And I’m leaving. Now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. While I strongly advise against ruling out potential underlying causes, I understand your reluctance. I can prescribe an antibacterial mouthwash. It may help temporarily reduce the odor. However, please understand this is not a long-term solution, and the odor may return if you don't address the underlying issues of oral hygiene and diet. Here is a prescription for chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% mouthwash. Use as directed. I also recommend scheduling a dental appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
