DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s this unsteadiness I’ve been experiencing. It’s rather… unsettling, to be frank. I find myself losing my balance, and it’s been happening more frequently. I don’t quite recall when it started, exactly. It feels like… a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unsteadiness can be concerning. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “A while” is a bit vague, so let’s try to pinpoint it a little more. Has this been happening for a few days, a few weeks, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weeks, I believe. Perhaps… several weeks. It's difficult to say with any certainty. Things… don't always stick in my memory these days. It definitely wasn't just a few days ago, though. It's been… gradual, I think. At first, it was just a little wobble, and now… well, now it’s more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, several weeks of a gradual onset of unsteadiness. Thank you for clarifying. Can you describe what the unsteadiness feels like?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not exactly dizziness, Doctor, not like spinning. It's more… a loss of my footing, almost like I’m on a boat. It happens without warning sometimes, and other times it feels like my legs are just… weak. It’s a strange sensation, difficult to explain. I’m terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that's a perfectly good description, Ms. Snerling – a “loss of footing” and feeling like you're on a boat is very helpful. And it’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to explain. You mentioned it happens without warning sometimes and other times with weakness. Does anything specific seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I honestly don't know. It doesn't seem to be related to any particular activity. I’ve noticed it while walking, standing… even when I’m just sitting, though that's rarer. I work with a drill, quite a heavy one, and I haven’t… noticed it specifically linked to that, though I suppose it's possible. I truly can’t say for certain. It just… comes and goes. It's rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It’s helpful to rule things out. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. No… not really. No headaches, no blurred vision, no ringing in my ears. My appetite is… normal, I suppose. Perhaps a little less than usual, but I’ve attributed that to stress. I haven't been sleeping particularly well, either, but that's… well, that’s been the case for a while now. It’s difficult to say what's caused by what, if that makes sense. I don’t believe there’s been anything else, though.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Snerling. No headaches, vision changes, ringing in the ears. And you mentioned a slightly decreased appetite and difficulty sleeping. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical history… That’s… complicated, Doctor. I… lost my husband a few years ago, and things were rather chaotic after that. I went to a doctor then, of course, but I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. Just… the usual check-ups, I believe. Nothing major, nothing that was ever… explained to me in detail. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do take a daily vitamin, if that’s of any consequence.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. It’s completely understandable that things were difficult after losing your husband, and it's alright if you don’t recall specific details. A daily vitamin is good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, Doctor. Not that I recall. Nothing… major, certainly. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe, but that was a very long time ago. And… I had a rather nasty fall a few years back, and required some stitches, but that wasn’t a surgery, exactly. Just a quick visit to the emergency room. No… no surgeries, as far as I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Now, thinking about your family—do you have a history of any medical conditions in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another… difficult question, Doctor. My parents passed away some time ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my siblings. I believe my father had some… heart trouble, later in life. And… my mother suffered from arthritis, I think. But beyond that… I'm afraid I don't know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t… discuss those things very often. It’s terribly frustrating to be unable to provide a more helpful answer.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother is helpful to know. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, besides your daily vitamin?
PATIENT: Just the vitamin, Doctor. That’s it, I assure you. Nothing for blood pressure, or… anything else. I’ve… avoided taking medication whenever possible. I prefer… natural remedies, if I can find them, but truthfully, I haven’t found anything that helps with this unsteadiness. I’m very careful about what I put into my body, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a daily vitamin. And no known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve… always been quite fortunate in that regard. No rashes, no swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing like that, thankfully. I've always been able to eat… pretty much anything. Though, again, I'm careful about what I consume. It's just... good practice, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, before we do a brief physical exam, let's talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I've never smoked a day in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine on a special occasion, but that’s it. And… recreational drugs? Never. I work with heavy machinery; I have to remain completely clear-headed at all times. It’s simply… not an option. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. That's helpful to know. And lastly, before we proceed to the exam, can you describe your typical work day?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I’m a rotary drill operator. It's… physical work. We operate heavy machinery, drilling into the earth, mostly for oil and gas extraction. It involves a lot of standing, lifting, and maneuvering around equipment. It can be quite demanding, especially in the heat. I work long shifts, typically twelve hours a day, six days a week. It's… not glamorous work, but it’s honest, and it provides for me. It’s just… recently, it’s been more difficult. This unsteadiness makes it harder to focus, and I worry about… accidents.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing all of that, Ms. Snerling. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and testing your balance and coordination. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Please, proceed. I trust your expertise. I’m… ready when you are. I’m hoping we can discover the cause of this unsteadiness, and perhaps find a solution.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind, please sit up straight on the examination table. First, I'll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Standing. It’s… a little difficult, truthfully. I… I need to hold on, just for a moment. It’s worse when I haven't been moving for a while, I believe.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, please hold on to the table. I see what you mean. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like you to close your eyes and try to stand still for a moment. This is just to assess your balance without visual cues. I see some slight swaying. Now, can you try walking a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, for about ten steps?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's… rather difficult. I'm afraid I’m not very graceful. It’s… much harder than it looks. I feel… unsteady. Perhaps we should stop before I fall.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine. It's good we’re seeing this. Alright, please sit back down. Based on this brief exam—the swaying with your eyes closed, the difficulty walking a straight line—it seems like there is some issue with your balance. It could be several things, ranging from inner ear problems to issues with your nervous system. The Romberg test was positive, indicating potential proprioceptive deficits. It’s too early to say for certain. I’d like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I’m thinking an audiogram to check your hearing, and an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural issues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An audiogram and… an MRI? Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. If that’s what’s necessary to determine the cause of this unsteadiness, then please, proceed. An MRI sounds… rather serious. Is it something to be worried about? I do hope it’s nothing… too severe. But I trust your judgment. Please, let me know what the next steps are.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to feel apprehensive, Ms. Snerling. An MRI is often done to rule things out as much as to find problems. We're being thorough. I’m ordering it primarily to get a baseline and ensure we haven't missed anything serious. We will discuss the results in detail once they are available. In the meantime, to ensure your safety, I would advise you to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have a clearer diagnosis. I will also write you a note for your employer explaining this. I will also refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Avoiding driving and heavy machinery… yes, that sounds prudent. A neurologist… that sounds… sensible. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. A referral to a neurologist, the tests… yes, please. I’m hoping we can find some answers soon. It's just… unsettling to feel so unsteady, and I worry about falling and injuring myself. Thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. What’s the next step in terms of scheduling these appointments?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Snerling. It’s my pleasure to help. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule the audiogram and neurology appointment for you. She’ll also give you the order for the MRI, along with instructions on how to prepare. It's important to let the MRI technician know if you have any metal implants or concerns about claustrophobia. We will follow up with you in about a week to discuss the results of the audiogram. I will also send a copy of the MRI results to the neurologist before your appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Thank you. Sarah scheduling the appointments, the MRI instructions… yes, that’s very helpful. Knowing there’s a plan in place… it eases my mind considerably. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate your reassurance and your thorough approach. I’ll await Sarah’s arrival.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Snerling. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'll let Sarah know you’re ready for her. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
