DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I want to... find out more about where my family come from. My people, long time ago. I hear you can do a test with... spit, maybe? To see where we really from. I’m Laury, by the way.
DOCTOR: Good morning, Laury. Yes, I understand. You’re interested in genetic ancestry testing. We can certainly discuss that. It does involve a saliva sample, yes. Just to clarify, are you looking for information about your ethnic origins, tracing your family's history through genetics?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Ethnic… origins. That the right word? My grandma, she tell stories of islands, far away. But… old stories. I want to know. Not just stories. My kids, they ask too. Want to know where we really come from. Is it… expensive?
DOCTOR: It's a reasonable request, Laury, and ancestry testing has become quite popular. Yes, “ethnic origins” is a good way to put it. The cost varies depending on the company and the depth of the testing they offer. Generally, it ranges from around $100 to a few hundred dollars. We don't directly perform the testing here at the clinic, but we can order a kit for you from a reputable laboratory. Before we do that, though, I want to make sure you understand what the testing can and cannot tell you. It's important to have realistic expectations. Are you familiar with how these tests work at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. I just hear people talking. They say it tells you… which country? Which island? I don't understand how spit can tell you that. Maybe you can explain? I'm not so good with… science things. Just want to know if my grandma’s stories are true. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It does sound a bit far-fetched, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: It is far-fetched! I thought so too, at first. But... Doctor tell me it's okay? That's why I come here.
DOCTOR: It is okay, Laury, and it's a legitimate field of study. Think of it this way: your DNA is like a very long book of instructions, and certain parts of that book are more common in people from specific regions of the world. These tests analyze variations in your DNA – what we call genetic markers – and compare them to databases of DNA from people with known ancestry. It won't pinpoint your exact village, but it can give you a good estimate of your ethnic origins, sort of like tracing branches on a family tree, but using your genes instead of records. Does that make a little more sense?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long book… I think I understand a little. So, it's not like… magic? Just looking at little bits of my spit? And it tells what country my people come from? Not exactly where, just… country? Like Marshall Islands maybe?
DOCTOR: Exactly. No magic involved, thankfully! It’s a complex process, but you've got the gist of it. It analyzes variations in your DNA. And yes, it can often identify regions like the Marshall Islands. It's important to remember it provides an estimate based on current databases. The databases aren’t perfect, and sometimes the results can be broad. Also, ancestry isn’t always simple; often there’s a mix of origins. Before we order a kit, I want to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to make sure there are no contraindications. Do you have any allergies or known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Just… old bones. You know, aches and pains. I’m 85. And my heart… sometimes it beat fast, but Doctor give me pills for that. I take them every day. Medicare pays for them. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important, thank you for telling me. “Old bones” and the fast heartbeat are good to know. The pills for your heart are also important information. Just to clarify, what is the name of the medication you take for your heart?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The bottle is… somewhere in the kitchen. It’s a little white pill. My daughter, she fill it for me. I think… starts with a “D”? Digoxin? Is that right? Or something like that. I forget so easy these days.
DOCTOR: Digoxin, okay. That's helpful. We need to make sure Digoxin doesn't interact with anything involved in the testing process, though it's unlikely. And good that you're taking it regularly. Now, have you ever had any genetic testing done before, for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. First time. I’m too old for… fancy tests. My grandma, she just use stories. And feeling in her bones. That’s all she needed. But my kids… they want science. So I try. Is the spit test… painful? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles at all, Laury. It's a very simple process. You simply provide a saliva sample in a tube, usually after not eating or drinking for a short period. The kit will have very clear instructions. It’s completely painless. Do you think you'd be comfortable collecting the sample yourself, or would you prefer that a nurse assist you?
PATIENT: I think I can do it myself. I'm still strong, even if my bones ache. Just need good instructions. And… maybe my daughter can help me read them, if they're too small. So, you order the… kit? And then I spit in it? It sounds silly, but... okay. How long does it take to get the answer? My kids are very impatient.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can order a kit for you. We'll use a company called 23andMe; they have a good reputation and relatively clear results. It does sound a bit silly, I agree! But it’s a fairly straightforward process. Once the kit arrives, you send the sample back to the lab, and it typically takes about 6-8 weeks to get the results. Six to eight weeks – it can feel like a long time when you’re eager to find out! They'll email you a link to access the results online. Would you like me to order it for you today?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, please. Order it for me. Six to eight weeks… I guess I can wait. Maybe my grandkids will be excited too, when they hear. And... tell me, Doctor, is it okay to tell the company about my heart pills? Just so they know? And… will they keep it secret? I don't want everyone knowing my business.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I'll make a note on the order form about the Digoxin. And you're right to ask about privacy. 23andMe has a privacy policy that outlines how they use and protect your data. They state that they won't share your personal information with third parties without your consent, and they allow you to control what information you share. I'll provide you with a link to their privacy policy when I give you the kit. It’s always a good idea to review it yourself. Do you have any other questions before I place the order?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. You explained everything very nicely. And… I hope it tells me something good about my grandma. Maybe I'll finally know where we really come from. Now... how much do I owe you for ordering the… spit kit?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Laury. I'm happy to help. The cost of the kit is $199, plus a small fee for my time ordering it and reviewing the results. That comes to a total of $210. Here's the form, and it includes information on how to send the sample back and access your results online. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I hope you find the answers you're looking for. Please call the office if you have any questions once you receive the kit.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. Alright then… I guess I’ll be spitting! .
