DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Though I must say, this establishment isn’t quite what I expected. A… Burmese doctor, you say? Well. I suppose things change. I’m here… let me see… my wife insisted, really. Something about a… a little dribble. A most unpleasant business, and frankly, rather embarrassing to discuss with a… a younger woman. But here I am. It’s been going on for…oh, I don’t know exactly. A few days, perhaps? It’s rather inconvenient, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Mr. Krok. Please, don’t feel embarrassed. It’s my job to help, and I assure you, I’ve heard it all before. A “little dribble,” as you put it… is this happening with urination, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Do you think I wouldn't know the difference? It’s… not with urination. It’s… after. A most unwelcome surprise, if you catch my meaning. And it’s… not a large amount, mind you. Just… enough to be bothersome. A stain, if you’re particularly unlucky. My wife is quite particular about cleanliness, you see. It’s causing a great deal of fuss, frankly. Is that clear enough for you? I’m not a medical man, you understand; I deal with tractors and combines, not… fluids.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s much clearer, Mr. Krok. So, it’s a leakage after urination. And it's causing some staining, which is understandably concerning to your wife. Has this been a sudden onset, or has it been gradually worsening over time?
PATIENT: Gradual? Honestly, I haven't been keeping a precise log of my… emissions, Doctor. How would one even do that? It just… started. Perhaps a week ago? Maybe less. It’s all rather blurry, to be frank. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. I find myself misplacing things, forgetting names… it’s the age, I suppose. Though my wife seems to think I’m simply… inattentive. A ridiculous notion, of course. But the point is, I don't recall it being a slow build-up. It simply is. A most unwelcome development.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly normal to have some memory lapses as we get older, Mr. Krok. And it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when these things start. So, roughly a week ago you noticed this leakage after urination. Has it been happening with every urination, or just some?
PATIENT: Now there's a question. Let me see… I believe… yes, I think it’s with most of them. Though I wouldn’t swear to it on a Bible. Sometimes I’m… preoccupied, you see. Thinking about the harvest, or the price of fuel. It's a demanding profession, farming. One doesn’t have time to meticulously catalog every… instance. But generally speaking, yes. Most of them. Is that satisfactory? It’s rather undignified discussing this, you know. I haven't spoken of such things since… well, never, really.
DOCTOR: It is perfectly satisfactory, Mr. Krok. You're providing me with very helpful information. And I appreciate your patience in discussing this. It’s not easy to talk about these things. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this leakage?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Goodness me, what would those be? Let me see… No burning, no pain. It doesn’t itch, if that’s what you’re asking. And no fever, certainly. I feel perfectly well otherwise. A bit tired, perhaps, but that’s the age, again. I suppose my wife was concerned about… well, she mentioned something about a smell. A most unpleasant accusation, if you ask me. I maintain a strict regimen of cleanliness, I assure you! But… yes, perhaps a faint odor. Not strong, mind you. Just… noticeable. Is that what you meant by symptoms? Honestly, this is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Krok. No burning, no pain, no fever, and a faint odor. Alright. And just to clarify, have you had any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now you’re asking about my… my excretion? Good heavens, Doctor! What does that have to do with anything? I came to you about a dribble, not… that. This is becoming quite ridiculous. I feel as though I’m being subjected to some sort of… interrogation. I assure you, my bowel habits are perfectly regular. I have no need to discuss such private matters with a… a female physician. Honestly. Is this standard practice? I think I’d like a second opinion.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Krok. I understand your discomfort, and I didn’t mean to upset you. I ask about bowel habits because sometimes changes can be related to bladder control issues. It’s simply part of a thorough assessment. We can certainly skip that question if you prefer. Now, let's return to the dribbling. Before we proceed, would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Goodness gracious. Must everything be so… invasive? I suppose… if you insist. But I warn you, I’m not particularly flexible. And I’d prefer it to be as quick as possible. I have a tractor awaiting repairs, you see. A perfectly good Massey Ferguson, wasting away as we speak. But… yes. Proceed. But be gentle, Doctor. And please, try to keep the questions to a minimum. I find this entire process rather… degrading.
