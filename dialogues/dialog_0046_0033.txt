DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m even here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this appointment. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s terribly inconvenient, really. I have patients waiting, you know. Important ones.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Julie. It sounds like your assistant was concerned about some changes in your vision and hearing. That’s a very valid reason to come in for an evaluation. Even if you’re not sure what’s going on, it’s good to get things checked out. To help me understand what’s been happening, could you tell me a little more about these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… blurry. Everything is a bit blurry, and the sounds are muffled. Like someone put cotton in my ears. It came on rather suddenly, actually. I was in the middle of a rather complex surgery, and then… well, it just was. Honestly, I’m surprised I managed to finish it at all. A less capable surgeon might have made a mess of things. Do you need me to be more specific? It all feels rather… unimportant.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Julie. The sudden onset is important information. And it’s certainly not unimportant – changes in vision and hearing, especially when they happen quickly, need to be investigated. Could you tell me approximately when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I never could keep track of them. Let me think… It was… sometime last week, I suppose. Perhaps Tuesday? No, Wednesday. Yes, Wednesday, I believe. It was definitely a day I had a particularly difficult case. A rather… demanding mother, if I recall correctly. Is this truly necessary? I have a waiting room full of people.
DOCTOR: Okay, Wednesday of last week. Thank you. And it sounds like it began during a surgery. Just to clarify, did this happen gradually, or did it feel like it came on all at once during the surgery?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. I told you. It was during the surgery. One minute everything was perfectly clear, the next… not. It wasn’t a slow fading, if that’s what you’re implying. It was quite abrupt, actually. Honestly, it was rather unsettling. Are we finished yet? I really must get back to my practice. These are very important people waiting, you know. Not everyone can simply reschedule their lives.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. You’re right, it sounds like it came on very suddenly during the surgery. That is important information. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Then I’ll perform a quick examination. It will help me determine the best course of action. First, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the blurry vision and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Doctor, I am a surgeon. I don’t have time for… symptoms. I’ve been rather busy, as you can imagine. Let me see… I suppose I’ve been a little… fatigued. But that’s hardly unusual. I work long hours, you know. And a slight headache, perhaps. But again, hardly noteworthy. Is this going to take much longer? I'm starting to feel quite lightheaded, now that you mention it. Though that could be the lack of coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a headache. And you mentioned feeling lightheaded just now. When did the lightheadedness start?
PATIENT: Oh, the lightheadedness… that’s new, I think. Just now, really. Perhaps a little before, but I hadn’t noticed. I've been rather preoccupied, as I've mentioned. Honestly, Doctor, I find this entire process rather… demeaning. I’m a physician, not a… a patient. Can’t we simply skip the examination and prescribe something? Something strong? I have a very important gala to attend next week, and I simply must be at my best.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie, and I assure you, this isn't about demeaning anyone. As a physician myself, I know how valuable your time is. However, because these symptoms – the sudden vision and hearing changes, the fatigue, the headache, and now the lightheadedness – came on relatively quickly, it's important to rule out anything serious. Skipping the examination wouldn't be responsible, and prescribing something without knowing the cause could potentially be harmful. Would you be willing to let me perform a brief neurological exam and check your ears and vision?
PATIENT: Fine. Do whatever you must. But make it quick, Doctor. I truly haven't the patience for this. And please, be gentle. I have very sensitive hands. They're rather essential to my profession, you know. Honestly, the indignity of it all… .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, we’ll do a quick neurological exam. Your blood pressure is 140/90, your pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. That blood pressure is a little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds are normal, and your lungs are clear.
