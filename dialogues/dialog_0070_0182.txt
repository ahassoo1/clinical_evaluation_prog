DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Abady, you say? Right. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it. I need to be cleared for a little…procedure. The wife – God rest her soul – always wanted me to get it done, and now I finally am. It’s a cosmetic thing, not that it’s any of your business what exactly it is. Just need a quick look-over so I can get it scheduled.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand you’re looking for a medical clearance for a scheduled procedure. I assure you, all information you share is confidential. While I respect your privacy, a thorough assessment is necessary to ensure your safety and suitability for any procedure, even a cosmetic one. To start, could you tell me a little more about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? Honestly, it’s…fine. I’m eighty-one years old, for goodness sake. What do you expect? I get a bit creaky in the mornings, but that's just old age. I still manage to get around, though. Used to be a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard work, that was. Built to last, I suppose. I eat…reasonably. Not much point in worrying about cholesterol at this point, is there? I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a long time. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Orwin. It's helpful to have that perspective. Knowing your history of being a terrazzo worker is good information, as that could potentially impact some things. And yes, understanding how often you've seen a doctor recently is relevant. To clarify, when you say you eat “reasonably,” could you describe a typical day’s diet for me?
PATIENT: Typical day? Ugh. Look, I’m not one for fuss. Coffee, usually. Black. Toast. Sometimes with a bit of jam. Lunch is a sandwich, maybe. Ham and cheese. Nothing fancy. Dinner…well, whatever’s easiest. Sometimes soup. Sometimes a bit of fish if I’m feeling ambitious. I take a multivitamin, does that count? Honestly, I'm a simple man. I don’t need a lecture about balanced diets. It's not like I'm training for a marathon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. No lecture, I assure you. Just gathering information. The multivitamin is a good start. Now, have you been experiencing any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Not really. A bit tired sometimes, but that’s to be expected, isn’t it? My knees ache a bit, like I said. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I have glasses. Nothing major. I’m not dropping dead or anything. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I’ve got a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting there, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for sharing that. It’s good to know you aren’t experiencing any alarming symptoms. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it years ago, but I didn't pay much attention. Gave me some pills, I think. Didn’t really bother with them. Felt fine. Diabetes, no. Heart disease, no. Never had any serious illnesses, if you want to know the truth. Just the usual colds and flu. And a bit of arthritis in my knees, I suppose. But that’s just old age, again. Honestly, I'm a tough old bird. I've lived a long life, and I'm still kicking.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your resilience, Mr. Orwin. Knowing about the potential high blood pressure is important, even if you weren't consistent with medication. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly? Goodness, that was… decades ago. Maybe the 90s? I don't keep track of these things. It wasn't anything serious, the doctor said. Just something to keep an eye on. I went to a different doctor back then, in…well, it doesn’t matter. He retired years ago. I haven't really bothered with doctors since. Are we almost done here? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, the 90s is helpful to know. And I understand your desire to keep things moving. Let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, stroke, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be ninety, but she didn’t have much of anything, to be honest. Just…old age. My father had a bit of a cough in his later years, maybe bronchitis. My brother… he had a heart attack, I think. Years ago. But he smoked like a chimney, so it’s not surprising, is it? Other than that, not really. We’re a pretty hardy bunch, my family. We just get old and then…stop. Is that enough family history for you? I really don't remember much more.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Mr. Orwin, thank you. Knowing about your brother's heart attack is important, especially given your own potential history of high blood pressure. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the multivitamin, like I said. And occasionally an aspirin if I have a headache. But that's it. I don't believe in loading up on pills. They just cause problems, in my experience. I prefer to let nature take its course. Honestly, I'm a very simple man. I don't need a pharmacy to stay alive. Are we finally going to get to the actual exam? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your impatience. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. If you don’t mind, please have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t expect miracles. I'm eighty-one years old, remember? Everything’s a bit…worn out. Just hurry up and tell me if I'm good to go, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I will be as quick and thorough as possible. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a bit…irregular, Mr. Orwin. A few extra beats I’m hearing. And your lungs sound clear, but your breathing is a bit labored. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150 over 90. Not dangerously high, but certainly something to be aware of. Finally, let’s take a look at your knees. There’s some crepitus in both knees, which is common for someone your age. There is also some mild swelling. Do you experience pain with movement?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. Especially in the mornings. Or after I've been on my feet for too long. It's just a bit of stiffness, really. Not excruciating. I can still get around, like I said. But it's not as easy as it used to be. Honestly, I’ve lived a long life. Everything gets a bit worn out eventually, doesn't it? Are you going to tell me I can’t have my procedure, or what? Because frankly, I'm not going to bother with a lot of fuss. It's just a little cosmetic thing, not a life-or-death situation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. Based on what I’ve found during the exam – the irregular heartbeat, elevated blood pressure, and knee issues – proceeding with any elective procedure without further evaluation would be unwise. I’m not saying you can’t have the procedure, but we need to get a better understanding of your cardiovascular health first. An electrocardiogram would be a good starting point to assess the irregularity I heard. And given your history of potential high blood pressure, a more thorough blood pressure monitoring over a few days would be beneficial. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?
PATIENT: An ECG… blood pressure monitoring… honestly. More tests? More waiting? Look, I've wasted enough time here already. Is this absolutely necessary? I mean, it's just a little…adjustment. Not open-heart surgery. Can't you just give me the okay and be done with it? I really don't have the patience for all this medical nonsense. I'm eighty-one years old. At this point, what’s the point of worrying about every little thing? Is this going to take long? I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Orwin, and I truly apologize for the inconvenience. However, as your physician, my primary responsibility is to ensure your safety. An irregular heartbeat, even if it's mild, could indicate an underlying condition that needs to be addressed before undergoing any procedure, even a cosmetic one. It’s not about worrying about every little thing, it’s about minimizing potential risks. Think of it this way: we're simply taking a few precautionary steps to ensure a smooth and safe experience. The ECG and blood pressure monitoring are relatively quick and non-invasive. Would you be willing to consider these tests, or would you prefer I refer you to a cardiologist for a more comprehensive evaluation?
PATIENT: A cardiologist? Absolutely not. That sounds like even more wasted time. Fine. Fine. Do the tests. But make it quick. And don't tell me I need to come back for a follow-up every five minutes. I’m eighty-one years old, not a spring chicken. Just get it over with so I can finally get this thing done and be on my way. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just…hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I will expedite the process as much as possible. We’ll start with the ECG right here in the office. It will only take a few minutes. Then, I’ll have the nurse give you instructions for home blood pressure monitoring. You’ll need to take your blood pressure twice a day for the next three days and record the readings. Nurse, can you please prepare the ECG and bring in the blood pressure monitoring instructions?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just relax, and I’ll let you know when we’re finished.
