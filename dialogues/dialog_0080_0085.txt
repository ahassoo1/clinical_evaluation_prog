DOCTOR: Hi Gabbrielle, welcome. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this discoloration on my skin. It’s quite bothersome, really. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t gone away. It's on my left forearm, mostly. Though, honestly, I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with it, which is why I’m here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, discoloration… a few weeks ago, on your left forearm. I understand wanting to get it checked out. Can you describe the discoloration to me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a rash, exactly. It’s not bumpy or itchy. It’s… a sort of brownish hue. A little uneven, if I’m being precise. Not a vibrant brown, more of a… faded ochre, perhaps? And it’s not like a bruise, it doesn't feel… impacted, if you understand. Honestly, it just looks wrong. I keep thinking it's something silly, but my husband insisted I come get it looked at. He worries too much, really.
DOCTOR: Faded ochre, uneven… not bumpy, not itchy, doesn't feel like a bruise. Your husband sounds like a good man, taking good care of you! Have you noticed it changing at all since you first noticed it – getting bigger, darker, lighter, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, he does fuss. But I appreciate it, I suppose. As for changing… hmm. It might be slightly bigger. Very slightly. It’s hard to say with certainty; I don't stare at it constantly, you know. The colour hasn’t really changed, though. It's consistently… that faded ochre. And no, it’s not painful or anything. Just… aesthetically displeasing. I’m quite particular about my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly larger, but colour remains the same, no pain. And you're particular about your appearance, I understand. Have you been spending more time in the sun recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I actively avoid the sun. It's dreadful for the skin, you know. And it gives me headaches. My husband and I took a short trip to the lake a month ago, but I was under a large umbrella the entire time. Really, I’m very careful. I use SPF 50 religiously, even on cloudy days. It’s probably not sun damage. It has to be something else.
DOCTOR: Okay, actively avoid the sun, SPF 50 religiously… good, that’s very conscientious of you. Have you noticed any similar discolorations anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just this one spot. And it’s quite… prominent, really. I would notice if there were others. I'm very aware of my body, you see. It’s not like I haven't looked for anything else. Honestly, I think it’s rather strange to only have one. It doesn't seem… logical. Perhaps it's some sort of fungal infection? My grandmother used to get those. Dreadful things.
DOCTOR: Fungal infection is a possibility, we can certainly consider that. Would you mind if I take a closer look at the discoloration?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please, do. The sooner we determine what it is, the better. Honestly, the uncertainty is the most bothersome part. It’s not like I haven’t tried creams, you know. Just… normal moisturizers, really. Nothing specific, but… one can hope. There you are. It's right… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing an irregularly shaped patch of brownish discoloration, approximately 3 centimeters in diameter. The borders are somewhat indistinct. No visible scaling or crusting. Skin texture feels normal to the touch, no palpable elevation. I don't feel any obvious lymph node swelling in your armpit either. Do you have any history of eczema, psoriasis, or other skin conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, three centimeters, you say? That sounds… larger than I thought. Honestly. No, no eczema, psoriasis, nothing like that. My skin has always been… rather normal. A little dry in the winter, of course, but nothing requiring a doctor's attention. My mother always said I had “good bones,” which I assume applies to the skin as well. It’s just… strange. This is very unlike anything I've ever experienced. Are you sure it's not some sort of insect bite? Perhaps a mosquito? Though, I haven't been bitten recently…
DOCTOR: Okay, no eczema, psoriasis, no history of insect bites. Given the description and the lack of other symptoms, it’s less likely to be an insect bite, but it's good to rule things out. To be thorough, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my appendix removed when I was a child, of course. A very routine procedure, really. And I have slightly elevated cholesterol, but my doctor has it under control with diet and exercise. Other than that… no, nothing significant. I'm generally quite healthy, you see. My husband always says I'm a “picture of health,” though he tends to exaggerate. And I have Medicare, if that’s relevant. I made sure to bring my card, of course. Here it is, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed as a child, elevated cholesterol managed with diet and exercise, Medicare… good to know. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. I've never had a reaction to anything. Not even penicillin, which I understand many people are allergic to. My husband is the one with allergies, actually. He’s allergic to dust mites and pollen, the poor thing. He sneezes constantly in the spring. But me? No. Perfectly fine. I’ve always been able to tolerate anything. Really, I'm quite resilient, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. To get a better understanding of the situation, would you mind if I quickly examine the rest of your skin for any other unusual moles or markings?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I assure you, you won’t find anything. As I said, I'm very diligent about my appearance and regularly check myself. But if it will put your mind at ease, please, proceed. Just be gentle, please. My skin is rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm seeing several benign, symmetrical moles of varying sizes throughout your skin. No unusual or concerning findings. No other areas of discoloration or rash. The skin appears generally healthy, as you said. Based on what you've told me and my examination, this discoloration is most likely a simple hyperpigmentation, possibly from a minor, unnoticed injury or inflammation. However, to be absolutely certain and rule out any other possibilities, I recommend a skin biopsy. It's a quick and simple procedure where we take a small sample of the skin for analysis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh. A biopsy… is that really necessary? It sounds rather… invasive. And I assure you, I haven’t injured myself. I’m very careful, you see. Is there… is there really no other way to determine what it is? Perhaps a cream? Or some sort of… scan? I'm not particularly fond of procedures, you know. And I read online that biopsies can leave scars…
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, and it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about a procedure. A biopsy is the most definitive way to determine the cause of the discoloration and rule out anything serious, such as skin cancer. While most hyperpigmentations are benign, it’s always best to be thorough, especially given the slight irregularity of the borders you described. The procedure is very quick and minimally invasive. We use a small local anesthetic to numb the area, then take a tiny sample of skin using a specialized instrument. The sample is sent to a lab for analysis, and we typically get results back within a week. The risk of scarring is minimal, and we can discuss options to minimize any potential marks. We can certainly try a topical cream first, but if the discoloration doesn’t improve or worsens, we'll still need a biopsy to rule out anything serious. Would you like me to explain the biopsy procedure in more detail, or would you prefer to discuss the risks and benefits of trying a cream first?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It doesn't look very pleasant, does it? Honestly, I’m rather averse to anything involving needles. And a week to get the results… that seems like an awfully long time. Perhaps… perhaps we could try the cream first. But a very strong cream, if you have anything particularly effective. And if it doesn't work, I suppose… I suppose I can consider the biopsy. But I want all the details. Everything. The risks, the recovery time, the potential for scarring… everything. And I want to know who will be performing the procedure. I prefer a female doctor, if possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can definitely try a topical cream first. I have a prescription for a hydroquinone and triamcinolone cream, which is often effective for hyperpigmentation. It's a potent combination, so we’ll start with a lower strength and see how your skin responds. We'll apply it to the affected area twice daily for six weeks. I’ll provide detailed instructions on application and potential side effects. It's important to wear sunscreen during this time, as the cream can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. If the discoloration doesn’t improve or worsens after six weeks, we’ll schedule a biopsy. Dr. Anya Sharma, one of our dermatologists, is excellent and very experienced with biopsies. She's female, as you requested, and very gentle. We’ll thoroughly discuss the procedure, risks, recovery, and potential for scarring during that consultation. You’ll have plenty of time to ask questions and make an informed decision. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds much better. Dr. Sharma, you say? Female? Good. And a strong cream, as you promised. And the sunscreen, of course. I'm very diligent about that already. Please, make sure the instructions are very clear. And if I experience any… redness or irritation, I should call, correct? I’ll write everything down, just to be sure. Though honestly, I do hope it doesn’t come to a biopsy. Needles… simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll print out detailed instructions on the cream application, potential side effects, and a list of things to watch out for. And yes, if you experience any significant redness, irritation, burning, or swelling, please call us immediately. We're here to support you throughout this process. Here's the prescription for the cream, and these instructions provide all the information you'll need. Please follow the instructions carefully, and feel free to call us with any questions or concerns. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in six weeks to assess your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, six weeks. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. And for recommending Dr. Sharma. I do hope this cream works. Honestly, I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures. But if it’s necessary… well, I suppose I’ll have to face it. Alright. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And please, do let me know if you need anything further from me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gabbrielle. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I’m optimistic the cream will work, but we’ll be here to support you every step of the way. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in six weeks.
