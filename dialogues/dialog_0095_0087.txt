DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. The usual. Honestly, I don’t really remember why I need it, just that the nice lady on the phone said I did. Getting old, you know. Things slip. Can we just… get it done?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Croonquist. It's very common for things to be a little fuzzy. We can definitely get the lab work done. But just to be sure I have everything correct, and to make the results as helpful as possible, could you tell me if you've been having any specific symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I recall. Everything feels… normal, I suppose. A little creaky, but that's just age, right? I haven't been sick sick. No cough, no fever… I eat, I sleep… mostly. Look, is this going to take long? I promised my neighbor I'd help him with something this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, "no cough, no fever," that’s good. Just to get a clearer picture, when you say “creaky,” where exactly are you feeling that?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. Knees, back… shoulders. It’s… old man stuff, Doctor. You know? Like a rusty gate. Honestly, I don't think it's anything new. It’s just… always there. Can we just skip the questions and get to the blood draw? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We can proceed with the lab work. But to ensure I order the right tests, and to rule out anything serious, could you just tell me briefly about any past medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed with… oh dear. That’s… a good question. I've been to doctors, of course, over the years. But what did they say? I honestly can’t recall. Something with my heart, maybe? Or was it my blood pressure? It was a long time ago. Really, I’m not good with remembering these things. Just… the standard old man check-up stuff, I presume. Can we just… please? I’m starting to feel a bit flustered.
DOCTOR: Okay. No worries. Let's try this. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. A little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white one. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take something over the counter… ibuprofen, I think? It helps a little. Honestly, I get my neighbor to help me with the names sometimes. He's got a good memory. Is that enough information? I really don't like being questioned like this. I just want the tests done.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a small white pill for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I’ve traveled a bit, you know, tried all sorts of foods. No problems. I don’t break out in rashes or anything. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. I just need to get this over with. Can we please just do the lab work now? I’m sure it’s all routine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist. We will proceed with the lab work. However, I need to document that you are reluctant to provide a full medical history. And I strongly recommend that you consider bringing a family member or friend to your next appointment to help recall important information. It's important for your health. Now, let's go ahead and get those blood samples drawn. The nurse will be right with you. She’s very good.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I'm going to go sit down and wait. Don’t bother me unless it’s absolutely necessary. And… please tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be.
