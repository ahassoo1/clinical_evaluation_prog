DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Sham. It is good to meet you. I have… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. A discharge, I think you would call it. It started a few days ago, maybe three? It is the left ear.
DOCTOR: Okay, ear discharge…left ear, started about three days ago. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. It is… not much, but it is there. It is a little bit… yellowish. And sometimes, a small bit of… like, dried blood. Not a lot of blood, just a little speck. It does not hurt, but it is… uncomfortable. Like something is in there. Also, I cannot hear as well from that ear now. It is muffled.
DOCTOR: Yellowish discharge with occasional dried blood… discomfort, muffled hearing in the left ear. Alright. Have you had any fever, pain, or dizziness associated with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. No pain, as I said. And no dizziness. Everything spins normally. I have been… a little tired, but I am always a little tired. It is the summer heat, I think. But no extra tired, if that makes sense. Just the normal tired.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed this happening before, or is this a new issue?
PATIENT: This is new, Doctor. Never happened before. I have had a few colds in the winter, normal things. But never this… leaking. I am a teacher, you see. I have many students, so I get little coughs and sniffles sometimes, but nothing like this. This is different. It worries me a bit because I need to hear well for my job.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. Let’s take a quick look at your ear. I'll use an otoscope. Just lean forward a little, please.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Lean forward… is that right? I am not very good with… with these things. I hope it does not hurt. I will try to stay very still.
DOCTOR: Alright… okay. I see some inflammation in the ear canal and a small amount of discharge. The eardrum itself looks a bit cloudy, but I can still see it. No visible perforations at this time. It looks like you might have otitis externa – an outer ear infection.
PATIENT: Otitis… externa? Is that… serious, Doctor? Will it affect my hearing permanently? I really need my hearing for teaching. What will we do about it? I hope it is not something that will take a long time to fix. I have students waiting.
DOCTOR: No, otitis externa is usually not serious, Mr. Radillo. It's quite common, especially in the summer months. The inflammation is what's causing the muffled hearing, and thankfully, it’s usually very treatable. We'll likely start with ear drops – antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drops. I’ll also prescribe a small course of oral antibiotics just to be safe. It should clear up within a week or so. It's important to keep the ear dry during treatment, so avoid swimming or getting water in the ear.
PATIENT: That sounds… good, Doctor. Ear drops and pills. I can do that. Keep the ear dry… yes, I can manage that. No swimming, no problem. Will the pills make me… sleepy? I need to be alert for my students. And… how do I put the drops in? I have never done that before. I worry about doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: The oral antibiotics shouldn’t cause significant drowsiness, Mr. Radillo, but if you do experience any, please be careful driving or operating machinery. As for the ear drops… you’ll want to lie on your side with the affected ear facing up. Gently pull your ear up and back – that’ll straighten the ear canal. Then, put a few drops into your ear and stay lying on your side for 5 minutes to let the drops soak in. A warm compress can help with discomfort, too. These instructions are all on here as well, so you can refer to them.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That is very helpful. Lie on my side… pull the ear back… soak for five minutes. I think I can remember that. And the warm compress. This sheet is good, yes. Very good. Will I need to come back for a check-up? To make sure it is better? And is there anything else I should be aware of? Any foods to avoid? Or anything like that? I just want to be sure I do everything right.
DOCTOR: Yes, I would like to see you back in one week to check your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then – if you experience increased pain, fever, or significant hearing loss – please call the office immediately. No specific foods to avoid, thankfully. Just continue to keep the ear dry and follow the medication instructions. Any other questions for me, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything very clearly. Thank you for your time. I appreciate your help very much. I will follow your instructions carefully. And I will make an appointment for next week. Goodbye, Doctor Sham.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. Glad I could help. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. The receptionist will schedule that follow-up appointment for you. Get well soon. Goodbye.
