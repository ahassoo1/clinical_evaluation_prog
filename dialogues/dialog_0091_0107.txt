DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I understand you're here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my heart, it… feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It just… flutters. It makes me feel a little scared.
DOCTOR: I see. “Fluttering” is a good way to describe it. And it makes you feel scared, which is understandable. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. When did you first notice this feeling, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three months ago? Around May, I think. Yes, May. It wasn't so bad at first, just a little skip here and there. But it's been happening more now, last few weeks especially.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressive over the last three months, worsening in the recent weeks. Can you tell me more about when it happens?
PATIENT: When it happens… it's not always after I do something. Sometimes I’m just sitting, watching TV with my wife, and it starts. Other times, I feel it when I walk up the stairs. Or after I carry something heavy at work. Not every time, just… sometimes. It doesn’t seem to have a pattern, really. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds like it’s somewhat unpredictable, occurring both at rest and with exertion. And you mentioned it happens when you’re carrying heavy objects at work. Could you describe your work for me?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I work at a… a chemical place. We make… things for cleaning. I check the machines, make sure they are working right. I move pipes and… big containers. It's… physical work. Sometimes it gets hot, very hot. I wear a suit, a special suit to keep safe.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that, Mr. Puder. So, physical work in a potentially hot environment, wearing protective gear. That's helpful information. Do you notice if the episodes are more frequent or more severe after a particularly strenuous shift or in hotter conditions?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that is it! When it’s very hot at work, it happens more. And when I have to lift a lot of heavy things, it gets worse. Like… faster, and it lasts longer. My wife says I look… scared. She worries.
DOCTOR: I understand your wife is concerned, and it’s good she’s looking out for you. It sounds like exertion and heat may be significant triggers. Now, let's talk about what you feel during these episodes, besides the rapid beating. Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… I feel a little dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… light. And… my chest feels tight. Like someone is squeezing it. It doesn't last long, maybe a few minutes. I try to take deep breaths. That helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and chest tightness accompanying the rapid heartbeat. That's important information. And you find deep breathing provides some relief. Have you ever experienced any pain in your chest, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, not pain. Never pain. It's… squeezing. Like a heavy feeling. Not sharp, not like… if something was broken. Just… uncomfortable. I don't like it. It scares me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No sharp chest pain, but a squeezing sensation. That’s helpful. Now, let’s briefly go over some other medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I… I don't go to the doctor much. I usually feel okay. I eat good food, try to sleep enough. This… this heart thing is new. My wife told me I should come see you. She is always right.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, but that's it. Just a cast. It healed fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations, just a childhood broken arm. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. I… I don't take any pills. Nothing. I don't like taking medicine if I don't need it. My wife says I’m stubborn.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies or current medications. Now, just a few questions about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or sudden death?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… trouble with his heart. He was older, though. Maybe 70s. He… he got sick, and he died. The doctors said it was his heart. My mother, she was fine, very healthy. And my brother, he is healthy too, as far as I know. He lives far away, we don’t see him much.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Mr. Puder. A history of heart problems in your father is relevant. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. I drink maybe… one cup of coffee in the morning. Sometimes a little tea with my wife. I don't smoke, never smoked. I drink a little water with dinner. I try to walk when I can, but my work is… tiring. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol, maybe one or two beers with friends sometimes. Not every week.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Puder. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take your pulse. This will give me a better idea of what's going on. Would you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. I will sit. Relax… I will try.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is currently 88 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is 135/85. Your pulse feels strong and regular. I'm listening to your lungs now… they sound clear. I'm going to palpate your chest and abdomen... no tenderness noted. I'm also checking your thyroid... no enlargement or nodules detected. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I suspect we may be dealing with palpitations, possibly related to anxiety or stress, but it’s important to rule out other causes. We should perform some tests, including an electrocardiogram to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to check your electrolytes, thyroid function and complete blood count. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If it will help find out what’s wrong, yes. Tests are okay. I want to know what is happening with my heart. Anxiety? Maybe. Work is… stressful sometimes. But I still want to know.
DOCTOR: Very good. I'll order those tests for you now. The ECG can be performed here in the clinic. For the blood test, the nurse will draw some blood samples. It will take a few minutes. While we're waiting for the results, I want to emphasize the importance of avoiding strenuous activity, especially in hot environments. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think I understand. No pain, get help. Okay. Strenuous… no hard work. And no hot places. I will tell my boss. Will the tests tell me if it's serious? That is what I worry about.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid concern, Mr. Puder. The tests will help us determine the cause of your palpitations. Most palpitations are not serious, often related to lifestyle factors or benign arrhythmias. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying heart conditions. The ECG will look for any irregular heart rhythms or signs of heart damage. The blood tests will help rule out electrolyte imbalances or thyroid problems that can cause palpitations. I understand you're anxious about this, and we'll work through this together. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them thoroughly and create a plan to address your concerns. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or alcohol swabs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies to… latex or… swabs. I’m okay. Thank you. I will wait for the nurse. I hope it doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse should be with you momentarily. In the meantime, try to relax and take deep breaths. If you feel any discomfort during the blood draw, please let the nurse know immediately. I’ll be back shortly to discuss the test results with you once they are available. In the interim, do not hesitate to ask the nurse if you have any questions.
