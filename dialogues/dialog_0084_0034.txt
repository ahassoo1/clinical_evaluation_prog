DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's nice to meet you too. I just... moved here? And I think I need to, like, get checked out 'cause of the Medicare thing? I don't really remember everything, sorry. It's all a bit new.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Moving is stressful, and new insurance can be confusing. We’ll take things slow. You’re here for a general check-up to establish care with Medicare, is that right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. A check-up. I think that's what my husband said. He did all the paperwork. I just… showed up. Is that okay? I didn't want to bother anyone if it wasn't a real appointment.
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely okay, Emileigh. Your husband likely did schedule an appointment for you as part of getting you set up with Medicare. We just need to confirm a few things. No bother at all. First, let’s just go over a little bit of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really? I mean, not for a long time. I think I went when I was a kid, for shots or something. But then… not so much. I mostly just… fixed things. Like, machines and stuff. I don't really get sick often, if that helps?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, infrequent doctor visits, but generally healthy. We’ll definitely want to get a baseline established. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. My husband would know better, I guess. He always asks if I'm feeling okay. He worries a lot. I… honestly can't remember. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe he wrote it down?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look through your records. Sometimes it helps to jog the memory. While I do that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Uh… no. Not really. I take… a vitamin, sometimes? It's just a multi-vitamin, for energy. My husband gets it for me. It's orange. That's all I know. I don't take anything else, I don't think. Definitely no pills or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. Good to know. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I’ve eaten lots of different things. My husband makes really good fish stew. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, not that I remember. Sometimes I get itchy when I work with metal, but that's probably just… the metal? Not an allergy, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family… My mom… she's gone now. And my dad… I didn't really know him. My husband's family is really big, but I haven't met most of them yet. He says his grandma had… something with her heart? But I don't know what. He talks about it sometimes. I'm really bad with names and stuff. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. It's okay that you don’t have a lot of details. We can skip that for now if you’re not comfortable. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Definitely not. I don’t like any of that. My husband doesn't either. We mostly just… work and watch TV. And he likes to fish. It’s a pretty quiet life. I don't go out much.
DOCTOR: Okay, very healthy habits there. Now, before we move onto a quick physical exam, can you tell me about any current symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Um… I get tired sometimes, but I always have. It’s just… from working. And my hands ache a little, but that’s normal, right? From fixing things all day? I don’t really… feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… tired and achy. Nothing major. I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and hand aches. We'll definitely take a look at that. Just to clarify, when you say "tired", is it just a general feeling of being run down, or is it more like you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, or falling asleep at night?
PATIENT: It's… both, I think. Like, I can get out of bed, but it's hard. And I don't sleep very well. I wake up a lot. And then I just feel… heavy, all day. Like I'm dragging myself around. It's hard to explain. It's just… always been that way, a little bit. But maybe it's getting worse? I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue that's been ongoing, potentially worsening, with some trouble sleeping. Let's do a quick physical exam and then we can talk about some potential causes and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… don't be too long, okay? I don't really like being touched. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll take it slow and be mindful of that. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let's start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat and ears. It shouldn't take long. If you could step on the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… Is it going to hurt? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles today, Emileigh, I promise. Just a simple height and weight check. Okay, you're 5'0" and 181 pounds. That's good information to have. Now, let's check your blood pressure. It’ll just be a cuff around your arm for a minute. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay… Is something wrong? It feels funny when you listen to my chest. Like I can't breathe right. My husband said my heart is strong, but I always feel… fluttery sometimes. Especially when I’m tired. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, just breathe normally. It's normal to feel a little strange when listening with the stethoscope. I'm just listening to make sure everything sounds clear. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern, but it’s something we’ll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, but a little bit of congestion. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Everything looks normal here. Now, I'd like to check your ears. Your ears look clear as well. Everything looks generally okay, but the slight murmur and the congestion are things we need to address. Now, I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG, just to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? What is an EKG? Is it going to hurt? And blood work… I hate needles. I get really dizzy. My husband said I faint easily. He always has to hold my hand. I don't want to do those things. Maybe… maybe I’m just tired. Maybe I just need to rest?
DOCTOR: Okay, Emileigh, it's alright. You're getting understandably anxious, and we can slow down. Let's address your concerns. An EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We just place some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn't involve any needles. It just gives us a better look at how your heart is functioning, especially since I heard a murmur. As for the blood work, yes, it does involve a needle, but we can take things very slow. We can have you lie down, and the nurse will draw the blood. She’s very experienced and gentle. And yes, your husband can absolutely hold your hand. We can even have you sit in a comfortable chair. We will take all the precautions necessary to make sure you don’t get dizzy or faint. Given your fatigue and the murmur, it's important to rule out any potential underlying issues, like anemia or a heart condition. I want to be thorough and make sure you’re healthy. But we can also start with some simpler things first. We can try some lifestyle changes – getting more rest, eating a healthy diet, and light exercise. If things don’t improve, then we can consider the blood work and EKG. What do you think?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes… yeah, I guess we could try that. My husband is always telling me to rest more. He makes really good soup. And he walks with me sometimes, but I get tired easily. No needles right away? Just… rest and soup? And maybe some walking? And if I still feel tired, then we can talk about the stickers and… the other thing? Okay… okay, that sounds… better. Thank you. Maybe that’s all I need. Just some rest. And soup. And my husband holding my hand. That would be nice.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a good plan, Emileigh. We'll start with rest, a healthy diet, and gentle exercise. We will re-evaluate in a month and see how you're feeling. If your fatigue persists or worsens, then we can revisit the blood work and EKG. I’m going to write you a note recommending a light exercise routine and emphasizing the importance of getting adequate rest. I will also provide you with a list of healthy foods to incorporate into your diet. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fainting spells, please come to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you for being so nice. And for not making me do the… stickers right away. And for letting my husband hold my hand. That’s really important. I guess… just thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. I understand that these things can be frightening, and I want you to feel comfortable and safe. It was nice meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you again in a month. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, and please give your husband my best.
