DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something about a letter? A pet letter, I think. My daughter, she said I needed one. Honestly, I can’t quite remember what it’s for, but it has something to do with… well, a pet. I have a lot on my mind, you know? It's probably important, though, or she wouldn’t have sent me.
DOCTOR: A "pet letter," you say. Alright. And what sort of symptoms are you experiencing that prompted your daughter to think a doctor's visit was needed?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What symptoms? I don’t have symptoms! I just… need a letter. She said something about needing proof… proof of… something. Maybe proof I’m responsible? Look, I'm a perfectly capable woman, I've always been. I just… I don't understand why a doctor needs to be involved in this. Is this usual?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wrye, it's not typical for me to write letters confirming someone's responsibility… especially without understanding the context. It sounds like there’s some confusion here. Let's try to clarify. Do you own a pet?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I do. A lovely little chihuahua. Her name is Precious. She's… well, she’s a bit yappy, honestly. A real handful, but I love her to bits. She's small, you wouldn't believe how small. And she sheds everywhere. That's probably what this is about, isn't it? Some kind of… housing thing? My daughter is always going on about rules and regulations. Honestly, it's exhausting.
DOCTOR: So, your daughter has asked you to come see me regarding documentation relating to Precious and potentially your housing situation?
PATIENT: Yes! Exactly. That sounds right. She mentioned something about the landlord… and some rules about pets. It’s probably some silly rule about the size or the breed or… I don’t know. She can be so dramatic, my daughter. Always jumping to conclusions. But she said I needed a letter from a doctor saying I'm… fit to own a pet? Is that even a thing? I mean, I’ve had Precious for three years now, haven’t I? She’s perfectly happy and healthy, and so am I!
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, it's unusual for a landlord to require a letter from a physician stating someone is "fit to own a pet." It sounds like your daughter may be misinterpreting something. However, sometimes landlords do request documentation to ensure a pet owner can adequately care for an animal, especially if there are concerns about allergies or potential disturbances to other tenants. Let's start with a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions that might affect your ability to care for Precious – for example, any physical limitations, cognitive issues, or mental health concerns?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I had a bad knee a few years back, but that’s all better now. I can walk just fine. And… let me think. My daughter keeps telling me I'm forgetful, but that’s just because I have a lot on my mind! I’m a busy woman, you know? I run a small… well, I used to run a small entertainment business. It's complicated. But I am perfectly capable. I feed Precious, I take her for walks, I cuddle her, I give her treats… What more could a landlord want? Honestly, this is ridiculous. They should be asking my daughter, she's the one with all the worries!
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your memory or ability to concentrate lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Oh, you know, the usual things. I misplace my keys sometimes. I forget what I went into the grocery store for. It happens to everyone, doesn’t it? It's not a big deal. My daughter makes a mountain out of a molehill, always has. She worries too much. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being questioned like this. I came here for a letter, not a… an interrogation! Is this going to take long? I have an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but I'm asking these questions to ensure I can provide accurate and appropriate documentation, if needed. It's my professional responsibility to assess your overall well-being. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I live alone. After the divorce, it’s… it’s just me and Precious now. It’s quiet, but I’m used to it. My daughter visits sometimes, thank goodness. She worries, as I’ve said. Always checking up on me, making sure I’m eating right, that I haven’t fallen or… something. It's sweet, I suppose, but sometimes I just wish she’d leave me alone. It’s my life, after all. And I can manage just fine on my own. I’ve always been independent.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, I need to be clear. Do you understand why your daughter asked you to come see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, no, I really don't. She just said I needed a letter, something about the landlord and Precious, and that I had to get it from a doctor. She didn’t explain anything properly, as usual. She just handed me the paperwork and told me to make an appointment. I’m starting to think this is all a waste of my time. I just want to know if you can write the letter or not. Is that too much to ask? I’m a perfectly responsible pet owner, and if the landlord has a problem with that, that’s their problem, not mine.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, based on what I'm hearing, your daughter likely believes there's a concern regarding your ability to adequately care for Precious, potentially due to a perceived change in your cognitive function or overall health. It's possible the landlord has expressed concerns and is requesting documentation to ensure the pet’s well-being. Before I can write any letter, I need to assess your current condition. I understand you're frustrated, but I need your cooperation. Would you be willing to allow me to perform a brief cognitive assessment and a general physical exam?
PATIENT: A… cognitive assessment? You mean like a test? Oh, goodness. No. No, I don't think so. I am perfectly fine, thank you very much. I don't need to be "tested." This is getting ridiculous. I came here for a simple letter, not a… a medical examination. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your time, but if you can't just write the letter, then I think I'll just go. I can find another doctor who won't question my abilities. This is all a bit insulting, frankly. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but as a physician, I have a professional responsibility to ensure any documentation I provide is accurate and reflects a thorough assessment of your well-being. I cannot, in good conscience, write a letter without knowing your current health status. I recommend you discuss these concerns with your daughter. Perhaps she can provide more information regarding the landlord's specific requirements. I wish you all the best. .
