DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, welcome. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor, I don’t even know where to begin. It all happened so quickly. My vision… it’s just gone. And the sounds... muffled, like someone put cotton in my ears. It's quite inconvenient, frankly. I have a very busy schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, "gone" and "muffled" – that definitely sounds concerning, and I understand your frustration, especially with a busy schedule. Let’s try to unpack this a bit. When did you first notice these changes – the vision and hearing issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a good question. It was… a few days ago, I suppose. Perhaps last week? Everything feels rather blurred together lately. I really can't pinpoint it precisely. Is it important? I mean, does the exact day matter?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to get a timeline, yes. But don't worry if you can't be exact. Roughly last week, then. Was this a sudden change, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Sudden, doctor, quite sudden. One day I was… seeing and hearing perfectly well, the next, this. It wasn’t a slow fade, if that's what you’re asking. It just… happened. And it’s terribly unsettling, you know. I have commitments.
DOCTOR: Right, a sudden onset is important information. And I absolutely understand how unsettling this is, and that you have commitments. Now, can you describe the vision loss a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? It’s gone, doctor. I can barely make out shapes, honestly. Everything is… dim. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? It's not as if it's patchy or blurry around the edges, it's just… absent. I find it incredibly frustrating. I expect you to be able to fix this, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, "absent" vision, like looking through a dirty window. And you said both ears are muffled?
PATIENT: Yes, both. Though… now that you mention it, the left one seems slightly worse. But truthfully, I haven’t paid much attention. I don’t have time to catalogue the nuances of my deteriorating senses, doctor. I’m a surgeon, you know. I perform surgeries, I don’t have them. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Right, a bit worse on the left side. And I appreciate that you're a busy surgeon, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s important to rule out some serious causes, though. Before we proceed with an exam, have you had any recent head trauma, any fever, or any recent illnesses like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Head trauma? Goodness, no! I haven't been involved in any sort of… accident. And a fever? I don’t get fevers. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. As for colds… well, I had something a few months ago, perhaps? A minor sniffle, nothing more. I simply continued working. It’s hardly relevant, is it? This is about my vision and hearing, not a childhood ailment.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent trauma, no fever, and a mild cold a few months ago. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a very small dose of something for my blood pressure, I believe. And… a vitamin D supplement, of course. Everyone needs vitamin D. As for anything else… I honestly can’t recall. I have a lovely pharmacist who handles all of that. She knows everything. Why are you asking me? I thought you were going to fix me, not interrogate me about my medical history!
DOCTOR: Alright, small dose of something for blood pressure and vitamin D. We'll confirm the specifics with your pharmacist. Now, one last question before the exam – do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I'm aware of. I've always been quite robust. Honestly, doctor, I find this line of questioning rather tedious. Are we going to do something soon, or are you simply collecting data for a research paper? My time is valuable, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, let's proceed with a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and then I'll do a neurological exam, checking your reflexes and cranial nerves. Then I’ll take a look at your ears and eyes. If you could just sit up here for me, please.
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. I have a lunch meeting with several colleagues. And I do hope you have a solution. This is… quite inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Let's start with your ears. Hmm… the tympanic membranes look normal, no signs of infection. Now, let’s check your pupils. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but… diminished response. And now, let’s follow my finger with your eyes. Tracking is a bit sluggish, and there's some nystagmus—involuntary eye movement—especially when looking to the left. Okay, that’s helpful. Now, let me check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Nystagmus? Sluggish tracking? Are those medical terms for ‘you haven’t found the problem yet’? Honestly, doctor, I’m beginning to lose patience. And I haven’t even mentioned the lunch meeting. This had better not be a wild goose chase. I expect results, not jargon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Burdette. These findings – the diminished pupillary response and the nystagmus – are concerning, and they point us in a particular direction. It doesn't necessarily mean a definitive diagnosis right away, but it guides our next steps. I want to order an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. It will help rule out several possibilities, including a tumor or inflammation affecting the optic nerves or the brainstem. I also recommend a consult with a neurologist to further evaluate your vision and hearing. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? A neurologist? Goodness. This is… far more serious than I anticipated. A tumor? Honestly, doctor, you're alarming me. I haven't time for extensive testing and consultations! I have a practice to run, patients to see… This is entirely unacceptable. Is there nothing else? Some sort of… quick fix? A strong medication? Something? I simply haven’t time for all this. It’s… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your busy schedule, Burdette. I truly do. However, given these initial findings, rushing to a “quick fix” without a proper diagnosis could be detrimental. I want to emphasize that I’m not saying you have a tumor, but we need to rule out all possibilities to ensure the best possible outcome. We can schedule the MRI as soon as possible – perhaps tomorrow morning?
