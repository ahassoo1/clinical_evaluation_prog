DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Glowka. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, things have been… not right. My memory. It is becoming… troublesome. I want to find out why. Quickly, if possible. I have many commitments.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. It’s certainly concerning when your memory begins to change, and I appreciate you coming in to get it checked out. "Troublesome" is a good way to describe it – can you elaborate on what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It is… difficult to explain. Not forgetting everything, you understand. More… small things. Names, sometimes. Where I put my keys. Appointments… though I write them down, I still… question if I did. And… repeating questions. I ask my housekeeper the same thing twice in one hour. It is… frustrating. And worrisome. My blood pressure has been… high, the doctor told me. Is that… connected, do you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. So, it's not a complete loss of memory, but more difficulty with recall of recent events and information – names, misplaced items, questioning things you've already done, and repeating questions. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned your blood pressure has been high. Yes, high blood pressure can sometimes be associated with memory problems, although it’s not always the direct cause. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions. First, how long have you been noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Approximately… six months, I believe. It started… subtly. I dismissed it as stress, you understand. I manage many properties, many people. Very busy. But then… it became more frequent. More noticeable. My housekeeper pointed it out. She is very observant. Six months, yes. Perhaps a little longer. It is… hard to pinpoint exactly. I try to keep a calendar, but… well, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint. Six months is a good starting point. And it’s very perceptive of your housekeeper to notice. Now, Ms. Alvara, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… yes. I had… pneumonia, perhaps ten years ago. Recovered fully. No other… serious illnesses. My husband… he passed away five years ago, from a heart condition. I have regular check-ups with my primary care doctor. He monitors my blood pressure, my cholesterol. He says I am… generally healthy, for my age. But the blood pressure… it is always a concern. No surgeries, no… major injuries. I take medication for the blood pressure, yes. A small pill, each morning. That is… all, I think. I do not… enjoy hospitals. Or doctors, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia about ten years ago, with a full recovery, and you've been managing your blood pressure with medication. I'm sorry to hear about your husband; that must have been very difficult. It's good that you have regular check-ups. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is… a good question. I do not… memorize medication names, you understand. My pharmacist… he gives me the bottle. I simply take the pill, each morning. It is… a small white pill. I believe it begins with an ‘A’… amlodipine, perhaps? I am not certain. I would need to look at the bottle to be sure. It is in my kitchen. I apologize for my… lack of precision. It does not seem important. I simply take it as prescribed.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. Amlodipine is a common medication for blood pressure, and it’s good you’re taking it as prescribed. Don’t worry about memorizing the name; it's more important that you are taking it. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely none. I eat everything. I travel… I have never had a reaction. No hives, no… swelling. Nothing. I am very… resilient, I suppose. No allergies to pollen, dust… nothing. I have been fortunate in that regard. My husband, he had… a sensitivity to shellfish, but I do not. I am quite certain. No allergies, at all.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Alvara. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… occasionally. Very occasionally. A small glass of wine… with dinner, perhaps once a month. Never more than one glass. I do not… enjoy it particularly. It makes me… sleepy. And I have many commitments, as I mentioned. I prefer tea. Herbal tea. Camomile, mostly. I do not… smoke. Never have. I find it… distasteful. And I walk… I walk every morning. About thirty minutes. A brisk pace. I try to maintain… a healthy lifestyle. For my age, yes.
DOCTOR: That sounds very sensible, Ms. Alvara. Moderate alcohol consumption and regular exercise are both excellent habits. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a difficult question. My mother… she became… confused, towards the end of her life. But she was very old. Ninety-five years. I attributed it to… old age, you understand. She forgot… where she was sometimes. And my father… he was very… practical. He did not… discuss such things. I do not… recall any specific diagnoses of dementia or Alzheimer’s. There was… an aunt, perhaps, who had… difficulty remembering names, but it was… long ago. I am not… certain. My family… we do not… discuss such things openly. It is… considered… private. I apologize for my… lack of detail. It is not… something I have given much thought to.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Alvara. It's common for those details to be unclear or not discussed. Knowing there was some confusion in your mother is helpful. Now, I would like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I suppose so. Quickly, if possible. I have… a luncheon appointment, you understand. But… yes. A brief exam. As long as it does not… take too long. What… what does it involve? I prefer… minimal prodding.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I will keep it as brief as possible. It will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – and a few simple tests to assess your memory, balance, reflexes, and coordination. I'll also look in your ears, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly assess your gait. It’s just a general check to help me understand what might be going on. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please have a seat and relax your arm.
PATIENT: Very well. Quickly, if you please, Doctor. I do not… enjoy being idle. My time… is valuable. Though I trust your expertise, of course. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Alvara. I understand your time is valuable. I will be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today – 148 over 92. It’s not drastically high, but it’s something we’ll want to monitor. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’d like you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please don’t blink, and just follow the movement.
PATIENT: There. Is that… sufficient? My eyes… are perfectly functional, Doctor. I read… extensively. Many books. Historical biographies, mostly. I do not… require an examination to prove my eyesight. Though I understand it is… procedure. Please proceed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly sufficient, Ms. Alvara. Your eye movements appear normal. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Hmm. Let me see… It is… August. The second of August, 2025. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. I believe. Is that… correct? It is… difficult to keep track sometimes. I have many appointments, as I mentioned. And many commitments. I apologize for any… lapses.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Ms. Alvara. August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words… Very well. Proceed. I am… reasonably good at memorization, despite my… recent difficulties. Though, it is… unsettling. What are the words, Doctor? Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember them, and I'll ask you to recall them later. Now, can you tell me what year we are in?
PATIENT: The year… is 2025. As I said… August 2nd, 2025. I do not… understand the purpose of repeating questions. It is… inefficient. But I am cooperating, of course. I believe… I am perfectly aware of the date. As well as the year. Now… what is the next… examination?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it seems repetitive, Ms. Alvara. I am simply assessing your overall cognitive function. It helps me to determine the cause of your memory concerns. Now, I’d like to check your balance. Could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But I do not… enjoy being tested. My balance… is perfectly adequate. I walk every morning, as I mentioned. A brisk pace. But I will… comply. There. Is that… sufficient? I do not… wish to fall. Or cause a scene. It is… most undignified.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly adequate, Ms. Alvara. Your gait appears normal. Now, I asked you to remember three words earlier: apple, table, and penny. Could you please tell me those three words?
PATIENT: Three words… Apple… hmm. Table… yes. And… the third word… escapes me. It was… something small. Metallic, perhaps? I… I cannot recall. It is… most frustrating. I know I heard them. Apple… and table… but the third… it is… gone. I apologize. This is… most unsettling. It is the… penny, yes! I remembered. It was the penny. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, you correctly recalled “penny.” You had some difficulty with immediate recall, but you were able to retrieve it with a little prompting. Now, one final test. I am going to ask you a few simple questions about your recent past. Can you tell me what you had for breakfast this morning?
PATIENT: Breakfast… this morning? Hmm. Let me see… I believe… I had… tea. Herbal tea. Camomile, mostly. And… toast. Yes, toast. With… a small amount of marmalade. Though, to be honest, Doctor, I rarely pay attention to such details. My housekeeper prepares it. I simply… consume it. It is… a rather unremarkable meal. Now… are we finished? I have a luncheon appointment, you understand. And many commitments.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, we are nearly finished. Based on my examination, your vital signs are slightly elevated, and you have some difficulty with recent recall, particularly immediate recall of information. However, you are able to recall information with prompting, and your neurological function appears otherwise normal. Given your concerns about memory changes, and your elevated blood pressure, I would like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Specifically, I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level. I would also like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, twice a day, and keep a log of the readings. Based on the results of these tests, we can determine the next course of action. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and monitoring my blood pressure… It is… inconvenient. But I suppose… necessary. If it will… alleviate my concerns. Very well. Order the tests, Doctor. But please, ensure they are conducted efficiently. I do not… enjoy spending time in medical facilities. And the monitoring… I will attempt to comply. But I have many commitments, as you understand. Now… can I schedule the tests for tomorrow morning? And may I have a copy of your report for my primary care physician? I trust he will appreciate a comprehensive overview. And… quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I can arrange for the blood tests to be conducted tomorrow morning. I’ll send the order to the lab electronically, and they should contact you directly to schedule an appointment. I’ll also ensure the results are sent to your primary care physician promptly. And I’ll provide you with a copy of my report today. I’m also going to give you a handout with instructions on how to monitor your blood pressure at home, along with a blood pressure log. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as confusion, dizziness, weakness, or severe headache – please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I believe that covers… everything. Thank you, Doctor. Though… I must reiterate my preference for efficiency. My time is… valuable. Very well. I shall… take my leave. I have a luncheon appointment, you understand. Good day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. I understand. I appreciate you coming in today, and I hope the tests provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. Have a pleasant day, and enjoy your luncheon.
