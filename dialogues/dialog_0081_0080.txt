DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over, said I needed a check-up to be all set. Nothing specific bothering me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, yes. While I appreciate Medicare’s… thoroughness, a check-up requires more than just signing papers, Ms. Fabing. It requires an actual assessment of your health. We need to establish a baseline, understand your medical history. It’s… standard practice. Let’s start with this: have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. Sorry, I guess I just figured it was just paperwork. Yes, I've been feeling pretty good, actually. No complaints, knock on wood. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Usual aches and pains” is…vague, Ms. Fabing. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Well, my knees bother me a bit when the weather changes, you know? And my back gets stiff if I’ve been bending a lot at work. Nothing I can’t usually work through, just… things that remind me I’m not twenty anymore. I install and repair valves, so there's a lot of crouching and lifting. It’s honest work, though.
DOCTOR: Manual labor. Yes, predictably. And how long have you been doing this… valve work?
PATIENT: About fifteen years now. Started right after high school. My dad did it, and his dad before him. It’s a good trade, steady work. Though I reckon it’s starting to show on my body a little bit!
DOCTOR: Fifteen years of repetitive strain… We'll need to document that thoroughly. Have you experienced any acute injuries related to your work?
PATIENT: Acute? You mean like… sudden injuries? Hmm. Let me think. A few pulled muscles over the years, nothing serious enough for a doctor, I didn’t think. Once twisted my ankle pretty good, but I just iced it and wrapped it. Didn't go to the hospital or anything. Mostly just… soreness that goes away after a bit.
DOCTOR: "Didn't think" isn't a diagnosis, Ms. Fabing. We need specifics. Was there any swelling with the ankle?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it definitely swelled up. Pretty big, actually. I remember having to stay off it for a couple days. My husband, Dale, wrapped it real tight. It turned purple and everything, but it went down after a few days like I said. I just… I've always been one to tough things out, I guess. Didn't want to make a fuss.
DOCTOR: “Making a fuss” isn’t preventative medicine, Ms. Fabing. Alright. And beyond the musculoskeletal issues – which, predictably, are related to your occupation – do you have any other health concerns?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had the flu a couple years back, but that's about it. Dale worries about my blood pressure sometimes, says I get flushed easily, but I haven't had it checked in a while. Medicare didn't say anything about needing a blood pressure check… Is that something I should have done?
DOCTOR: It’s…prudent, Ms. Fabing. And frankly, concerning that you haven’t had routine screenings. Let’s take a look. Please roll up your sleeve. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I always figured if something was wrong, I'd feel it, you know? But I guess it's good to check. Dale will be pleased I'm finally getting this done.
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. Slightly elevated. Not alarming, but warrants attention. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… high, isn't it? I don't think so, no allergies that I know of. I haven't taken much in the way of medicine, to be honest. Maybe some ibuprofen for headaches, but that's about it. Dale's allergic to penicillin, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy in the spouse… noted. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that's about it. And like I said, the flu a couple years ago. Otherwise, I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. I've always been a strong one.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years back, from… well, old age mostly. My dad's still with us, though. He's 82, pretty good shape for his age. He's got a bit of arthritis in his hands, like me, and his heart isn't what it used to be, but he's still pretty independent. He lives on the reservation.
DOCTOR: Maternal death, age unspecified, presumed cardiac. Paternal living, age 82, arthritis, cardiac issues… predictable. Did your mother or father have any history of hypertension, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I don't really know. We didn’t really talk much about medical things, to be honest. My mom just… got sick, and then she was gone. And my dad doesn't talk about it much either. I think he might have had his blood pressure checked at some point, but I don't remember what the doctor said. I'm sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. We weren't really a "doctor talkin'" family.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your lifestyle, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: Well, I work hard, like I said. I try to eat pretty healthy, mostly home-cooked meals. Dale does most of the cooking, he's a good cook. We don't drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. I don’t get a lot of exercise though, I admit. Long days at work leave me pretty tired.
DOCTOR: Predictably sedentary. Alright. Last question, Ms. Fabing. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the usual aches and pains, I don’t take anything for those. I've always been one to try and tough things out, you know? Maybe I should be takin' somethin', but I never really got around to it. Is that somethin' I should be discussin' with you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fabing, that is precisely something you should be discussing with me. Based on your blood pressure reading, family history – or lack thereof – and sedentary lifestyle, I recommend we start a low-dose antihypertensive medication. We'll also need to schedule some bloodwork to assess your cholesterol and kidney function. We need to take this seriously, Ms. Fabing. Ignoring these issues will only lead to more significant problems down the line.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… a lot. Medicine already? I guess my blood pressure is high. I didn’t realize it was that serious. I was hopin’ to just fill out some forms and be on my way. But if you think it’s best… what kind of medicine are we talkin’ about? And what about the bloodwork? Is it gonna be a long process? I'm just… a little overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s a low-dose thiazide diuretic. Relatively mild side effects. As for the bloodwork, it's standard. We’ll need a complete metabolic panel and a lipid profile. It’s a simple draw, a few vials of blood. It will take a few days to get the results back. Frankly, Ms. Fabing, it’s not a “process.” It’s preventative healthcare. We’re trying to avoid a far more significant “process” down the line – like a stroke or heart attack. The nurse will draw your blood. I’ll review the results when they come back and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A stroke… that doesn’t sound good. No, I don't think so, not right now. Just… the medicine. Is it gonna make me feel… different? I’ve always been pretty good at takin’ care of myself, I just… I don’t like feelin’ like somethin’s wrong with me, you know? Dale will be glad I'm finally gettin' this checked out, though. He worries a lot. I guess I should probably listen to you, and to him. Where does the nurse draw the blood?
DOCTOR: It might cause slight dizziness initially, Ms. Fabing. Stay hydrated. And it’s not about “something being wrong with you.” It’s about proactively managing your health. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. The nurse will explain the procedure. Patient reluctant, but compliant. Schedule follow-up appointment for review of bloodwork results. Don’t delay. It’s in your best interest.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go get my blood drawn now.
