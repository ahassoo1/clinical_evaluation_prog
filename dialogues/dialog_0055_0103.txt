DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. I am Dr. Eaddy. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, my back. It’s been hurting. Not a new thing, you understand. But… worse lately. Lower back, mostly. Feels like… old wood creaking, maybe? And stiff. Very stiff.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is a chronic lower back pain that has recently exacerbated. “Old wood creaking,” you say… a useful description. And when you say “lately,” could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started getting worse maybe… a month ago? A little over a month. Before that, it was just the usual aches. But now, it makes it hard to… well, to get up from a chair. And bending over? Forget about it. It's a real struggle. I used to garden, you know. Can’t do much of that anymore.
DOCTOR: A month ago, with increasing difficulty ambulating and bending. Gardening is… problematic now. Do you recall any specific injury or event that might have triggered this increase in pain?
PATIENT: No, no injury. Nothing I can remember. Just… woke up one morning and it was worse. I didn't lift anything heavy, didn't fall or anything. It just… was. My ex-wife always said I was getting old, maybe she was right! But it's more than just old age, I think. It feels… deep. Like something’s broken, but I know it isn’t.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No inciting incident. And you describe the pain as “deep,” not a sharp, radiating sensation?
PATIENT: No, not sharp. Dull, mostly. Aching. And… heavy. Like someone put a stone on my back. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little, but not often. Mostly just in my back. I tried some of those creams, you know? The ones you rub on. Didn’t do much good.
DOCTOR: Creams, of course. And this discomfort, does anything alleviate it?
PATIENT: Well… lying down, sometimes. But I can’t spend all day in bed! And… warm baths help a little. Just for a bit. But it comes back. Nothing really helps for long, you understand. It's just… there. A constant reminder. It makes sleeping difficult too, sometimes.
DOCTOR: So, lying down and warm baths offer temporary relief. And it’s impacting your sleep. Very well. Now, let’s move on to other things. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. Not really. Sometimes my feet feel… cold. But I always have cold feet! It's the circulation, I think. My doctor… the old one… said something about that. Not the main problem, though. The pain is the main problem. And the stiffness. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a muscle ache, it's… deeper.
DOCTOR: Cold feet, possibly related to circulation. We are focusing on the back pain, Mr. Vankampen. Now, have you noticed any weakness in your legs, or difficulty with bladder or bowel control?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no trouble with… that. Everything works, thankfully. No weakness in my legs. I can walk, you know. Slowly, sometimes. But I can walk. I just… can’t bend over to pick things up anymore. That’s the biggest trouble. I don’t want to fall. It's embarrassing, asking for help with simple things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My old doctor… he said my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. They gave me pills for that. I stopped taking them a while ago, though. Felt better without them. And… I think I had a little bit of arthritis in my hands, years ago. But nothing serious. Not like this back. No diabetes, no heart disease, nothing like that. Just… old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Discontinued blood pressure medication. A history of mild arthritis. And no other significant medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Not a fan of hospitals, you understand? Too many germs. And… I don't like being cut open. Never needed it, thankfully. Just a few stitches when I was a boy, falling out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. This back is different. It's… a constant ache. It’s wearing me down.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. A childhood injury. And you are experiencing chronic lower back pain. Now, are there any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not really. Just… some vitamins, you know? For old people. Vitamin D, I think. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something… a sleeping pill, maybe? But not every night. Just when I really can’t sleep. Nothing else. I try to avoid pills, if I can. They never really work, anyway.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D and occasional sleep aid. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve taken a lot of pills in my life, you understand? Doctor gave me things for my blood pressure, for headaches… never had a reaction. Just… didn't feel good, sometimes. But never an allergy. I'm pretty lucky, I think. Except for this back, of course. That's a real bother.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a physical examination. If you’ll please lie down on the examination table. I need to assess your range of motion and check for any neurological deficits.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. Okay. That table… is it hard? My old back isn’t so good with hard things. But… alright. I'll try. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Please lie supine, Mr. Vankampen. I will begin with palpation to assess tenderness. Let me know if you experience any discomfort at specific points. I'm noting some muscle spasm. And there is definite tenderness over the L4-L5 vertebral bodies. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Ooh! That’s… tender, yes. Very tender. L4-L5, you say? Sounds important. And bending… I can’t… can’t get all the way. It’s too painful. Just… gets stuck. Like something’s blocking me. It’s not a muscle thing, I don’t think. It’s… deeper. It’s getting worse just doing that.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion, with pain on flexion. Now, let’s assess your neurological function. I’m going to check your reflexes. Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Sensation is intact to light touch in the lower extremities. And finally, I’m going to check your strength. Can you lift your right leg while lying flat?
PATIENT: Alright. Legs… okay. Like this? It's… harder than it used to be. Not weak, exactly. Just… difficult. Takes more effort. I can do it, but it’s not easy. Feels… strained. Like I'm pushing against something. It’s not a sharp pain, it’s just… uncomfortable. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, but with noted effort. Based on my examination and your history, Mr. Vankampen, it appears you are suffering from chronic lower back pain, likely due to degenerative disc disease and muscle spasm. We will need to obtain some imaging studies to confirm this diagnosis and rule out any other underlying pathology. I am ordering lumbar X-rays. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and consider over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen. I will also prescribe a muscle relaxant to help alleviate the spasm. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Lumbar X-rays… alright. Degenerative… that sounds serious. And muscle relaxant… pills again, eh? Ibuprofen… I’ve tried that, Doctor. Didn’t do much good. But… alright. I’ll try the muscle relaxant. Is it safe? And… what does all this mean? Will I be able to garden again? That’s… important to me. I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant is safe when taken as directed, Mr. Vankampen. There are potential side effects, such as drowsiness, but they are generally mild. Degenerative disc disease is a common condition associated with aging. It means the discs between your vertebrae have begun to wear down, causing pain and inflammation. It’s not life-threatening. As for gardening… It’s difficult to say definitively. The goal of treatment is to alleviate your pain and improve your function. With appropriate management, you may be able to return to some of your activities, but you may need to modify them to avoid further injury. We will assess your progress after the X-rays and determine the best course of action. I will also provide you with a referral to physical therapy. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… alright. That sounds… good. Maybe. Strengthening… I'm not so good at exercises anymore. I guess… alright. I'll try. The pills, the therapy… I hope it works. I really do. When will I get the results from the X-rays? And… will I need more pills after that?
DOCTOR: The X-ray results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will contact you as soon as I have them. As for additional medication… That will depend on your response to the initial treatment plan. We will reassess your pain levels and functional limitations after the X-rays and determine whether further intervention is necessary. I have ordered the X-rays, and sent the prescription for the muscle relaxant to your pharmacy. The physical therapy referral has been sent as well. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Vankampen?
