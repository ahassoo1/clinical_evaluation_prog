DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, just call me Lawton. Nice to meet you too, I guess. Honestly? My stomach’s been… puffy. Bloated. It’s annoying, alright? Been happening for a bit now. I don’t really do doctors, so let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton, no problem at all. “Puffy and bloated” – I understand. And I appreciate you coming in despite not being a big fan of doctors! Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. When you say “a bit now,” roughly how long has this been happening?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t keep track of that stuff. Weeks, maybe? A month or two? It comes and goes. It’s not like it’s constant. Look, I work long hours, okay? Pile driving. Not exactly a job where I'm thinking about my gut. It just… happens. And then it doesn’t. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lawton. Weeks to a month, coming and going – that gives me something to work with. And pile driving… that is a physically demanding job. Okay. Can you describe the bloating a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it…? Like… full. Tight. Like I ate way too much, even when I haven’t. And sometimes it’s… gassy. Look, I’m not gonna get into specifics, alright? It's uncomfortable. That's it. It just feels… wrong. Like there's too much stuff in there. Is that descriptive enough for you? I really don't like talking about this.
DOCTOR: Yes, Lawton, that's helpful. “Full, tight, like too much stuff” – I understand. And you don’t need to go into any details you’re not comfortable with. Does anything make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Worse… heavy meals, I guess. Anything greasy. But honestly? It seems kinda random. Sometimes I can eat whatever, sometimes I can't. Doesn't really seem to have a pattern. Better… laying down? Maybe? I dunno. I just try to ignore it when I can. Look, I'm a practical guy. If I can work, I work. I don't sit around analyzing my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and greasy meals can make it worse, and laying down helps a little. That's good to know. It sounds like it’s not consistently triggered by anything specific. Do you have any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like…? Look, I’m not a hypochondriac, alright? No, I don’t have anything else. I get tired, but that’s the job. Pile driving is exhausting. No… I haven’t noticed anything else. No pain, no… changes in anything, alright? Just the puffy stomach. Can we just figure out how to make it stop? I got a shift starting in a few hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or changes in bowel habits, just the bloating and tiredness from work. That’s helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I just want to listen to your stomach and feel around a bit. It’ll give me a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I really don't see the point, but fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick, alright? I haven’t got all day. I'm a busy man. And don't poke around too much. I’m not comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lawton. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just listening to your abdomen, and feeling for any tenderness. Please lie back on the exam table when you're ready. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds – nothing out of the ordinary there. And I don't feel any significant tenderness when I gently press on your abdomen. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which is consistent with the bloating you’ve described. Your weight is 144 pounds and height is 177cm. Given your description and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing some form of functional bloating. This means your digestive system isn’t working quite as efficiently as it should, leading to gas and discomfort. It's fairly common, and often related to diet or stress.
PATIENT: Functional…? Look, Doc, are you saying there's nothing wrong with me? That I’m just… imagining it? Because I assure you, this is very real. And stress? I work a dangerous job for a living. Of course I’m stressed! So, what now? Am I supposed to just… live with this? This is ridiculous. I came here for a solution, not a fancy label.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Lawton. I’m not saying you’re imagining it – it’s very real to you, and that’s what matters. “Functional” just means we haven’t identified a specific disease causing it yet. It doesn’t dismiss your discomfort at all. And you’re right, your job is physically demanding and stressful, and that can definitely contribute to digestive issues. What we can do is try some things to manage it. I'd like to start with a few dietary adjustments. Have you tried keeping a food diary to see if you can identify any triggers?
PATIENT: A food diary...? Seriously? Now I gotta write down everything I eat? Look, I told you, there doesn't seem to be a pattern! I eat when I can, whatever’s available. It’s not exactly a gourmet lifestyle, alright? I don’t have time for that. And honestly? I don’t see how writing things down is gonna magically fix my stomach. This is getting more and more frustrating. Can't you just give me something to take? A pill, anything? I really don’t want to spend my life cataloging my meals.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Lawton. It does sound like a lot, and I apologize for that. You’re right, a food diary isn’t ideal, especially with your schedule. Let's try a different approach then. Instead of a full diary, how about we focus on some general dietary recommendations for a week or two?
PATIENT: Fine. Recommendations. As long as it doesn't involve a notebook. Just tell me what I gotta eat, and I'll try. But no promises, alright? I'm a practical man. If it doesn’t work, I’m not wasting my time. What are these magical recommendations then? And can we hurry this up? My shift…
DOCTOR: Okay, perfectly understandable. Let's keep it simple. First, try to avoid carbonated drinks – they can contribute to gas. Second, see if reducing processed foods and increasing fiber intake helps. Things like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Third, smaller, more frequent meals can sometimes be easier on the digestive system than large ones. And finally, try to drink plenty of water throughout the day. We can also try an over-the-counter medication called simethicone. It’s a gas reliever, and might provide some temporary relief. It's generally safe, but it’s always best to check with a pharmacist before starting any new medication. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: No fizzy drinks… less junk… more… vegetables… and tiny meals? Look, Doc, I eat when I can. It's not exactly a Michelin star restaurant out there on the job site. Fine, I'll try, but don't expect miracles. And that… simethicone thing? I’ll ask the guy at the pharmacy. Honestly, this whole thing feels like a waste of time, but I guess I gotta humor you. Can I go now? I really need to get going. This shift… it's important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lawton. I understand your skepticism, and I appreciate you being willing to try these suggestions. Let's see if they make a difference. If you don't see any improvement after a week or two, or if your symptoms worsen, please come back, and we can explore other options, perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist. Here's some more information on those dietary changes. And yes, you’re free to go. Get to your shift, and take care of yourself. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. .
