DOCTOR: Hi Colt, good to see you. I’m Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I don't much like coming to doctors, if you want to know the truth. It’s these… episodes. My wife, Soriya, she’s the one who made the appointment. I keep getting confused, you see. Little things, mostly. But she worries.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good Soriya is looking out for you, and it's smart to get things checked out when you're noticing changes. "Episodes" is a good way to put it. Can you tell me a little more about these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Where to begin? It’s not like I’m wandering around lost or anything. It’s… remembering things. Or not remembering. Like yesterday, I went to the hardware store for tile adhesive – perfectly normal day – but I couldn’t for the life of me recall the name of the brand I always use. Always use! I just… stared at the wall of products. Soriya had to tell me. And then there was the time I couldn't remember how to get home from my son’s house. I’ve driven that road a thousand times. A thousand times! It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I see. So it's not a complete loss of memory, but difficulty recalling specific things, even things you do frequently. And it's happening more often recently?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It’s not like one of those stories you hear on the television. Just… gaps. And yes, it has been more lately. It used to be maybe once a month, something I’d brush off. But now… it feels like once a week, at least. Sometimes more. And Soriya says I repeat myself. I don’t feel like I’m repeating myself, but she insists. Women notice these things, you know. They always do.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Colt. And Soriya is right to bring it up if she's noticing repetition, that’s a key thing to look at. Let's try to get a better picture of what's going on. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Hmm. Not really. I mean, I retired last year. That was a change, I suppose. Been doing tile work since I was a boy. A lifetime of it. But I haven’t been doing much different otherwise. Same routine, same meals, same everything. No new medications, no falls or bumps to the head… Nothing that I can think of that would cause this. Honestly, I think it’s just… old age creeping up on me. Though I don’t much like thinking about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major changes in routine or medication. Retirement is a significant life event, though, and sometimes those adjustments can take a while to settle into. It’s good you haven’t had any head injuries or falls. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything before?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back. The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. Other than that… nothing much. Always been a healthy man, always working hard. A little arthritis in my knees, but who doesn't have that at my age? Nothing serious, I assure you. I’ve always been very strong. Still am, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you stopped taking medication for, and some arthritis in your knees. And you've been generally healthy otherwise. That’s helpful. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. Not once. Not even as a boy. A few broken bones here and there from working, but nothing that required a hospital stay. I've always been able to patch myself up. Soriya, she’s always fussing over me, telling me to see a doctor for every little ache and pain, but I tell her, "I’ve been doing this for sixty years, I know my body." She worries too much, that woman. A good woman, but… a worrier. I mean, a broken arm when I was a teenager falling out of a mango tree, but that was just a cast, no hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family who has had memory problems, or something like Alzheimer's or dementia?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question… Let me think. My mother, she… well, she got a bit confused towards the end. But she was very old, you know? Lived to be ninety-five. Everyone gets a little confused when they get that old. My aunt, on my wife’s side, she had something… I can’t quite recall the name of it. Something with the brain… She was in a home for a long time. But other than that… not really. My father was sharp as a tack until the day he died. And I always thought I’d be the same. A good memory, a strong mind. It’s just… lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some confusion in your mother in her later years, and an aunt on your wife's side with a brain condition, but not much else that you recall. That’s helpful. Do you drink alcohol, Colt?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a beer with dinner now and then. Nothing excessive, you understand. Just one or two. Sometimes none at all. It helps me relax, after a long day… even in retirement. I don’t go out drinking with the boys anymore, not like I used to. Mostly just at home with Soriya. She doesn’t care for me to drink too much, she says it makes me… talkative. And she’s probably right. But it's not a habit, Doctor. Definitely not a habit. I’m a sensible man.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one or two beers with dinner occasionally. That’s good to know. Do you smoke or use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. Hated the smell, even when I was a boy. My father smoked, and I always told him it was foolishness. He eventually quit, thankfully. And no, I don’t use any other kinds of tobacco. Soriya wouldn’t allow it, and frankly, I have no interest. A healthy lifestyle, that’s what I believe in. Even if my memory isn’t what it used to be, I still take care of myself. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or tobacco use. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure pills you used to take, are you currently taking anything – vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter medications, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my knees, really. Glucosamine, I think it’s called. Soriya buys it for me. Says it helps with the arthritis. And sometimes, if I’m really aching, I take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter stuff, nothing fancy. She reminds me to take the glucosamine every morning. She keeps track of everything, that woman. Honestly, I’d probably forget if it weren’t for her. It’s not a lot, Doctor. Just a couple of things for an old man’s aches and pains. Nothing that would affect my memory, I'm sure of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, glucosamine and ibuprofen as needed. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Go ahead. Though I’m telling you, I’m perfectly healthy. Blood pressure might be a little high, I haven’t been taking those pills, but other than that… I’m a strong man. Always have been. Just don’t poke around too much, alright? I don't like being fussed over. But do what you need to do, Doctor. I suppose. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Colt. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, as you suspected, 152 over 88. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally for me. Okay, your heart sounds are regular, but a little quiet. And your lungs sound good and clear. Now, I'm going to do a few quick tests to check your reflexes and memory. Just follow my instructions as best you can. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Hmm. Let me think… It’s… August… the second, isn’t it? Yes, August 2nd. 20… 2025. Yes, that’s right. August 2nd, 2025. Though… sometimes I get those years mixed up. It all goes by so fast. But yes, that’s the date. I’m fairly certain. Soriya keeps a calendar, you know. She’s very organized. It’s good to have someone like that. But yes, August 2nd, 2025. I believe that’s correct.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s correct. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Alright, go ahead. Just tell me the words and I'll repeat them. I'm pretty good with remembering things, you know. Always have been. But go ahead, just to be sure. Don’t make them too difficult, alright? I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions, and then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words again. Don’t worry about it too much, it’s just a routine test. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Apple, table, penny. Simple enough. Go ahead with your questions, Doctor. I’ll do my best. Just don't expect miracles, alright? It's been a long day. And those years… they do start to blur together, you know? But I’ll try my best to remember those three words. Apple, table, penny. I've got it. For now.
DOCTOR: <stage>I ask a series of simple orientation questions – “What city are we in?
PATIENT: What city…? Hmm. Well, we're… near… the countryside, aren't we? This is… Doctor Condray’s clinic, right? A small town… I can't quite recall the name. Not a big city. A rural area. Soriya likes it here, says it’s peaceful. I suppose it is. Quiet. But the name… escapes me. I’ve been to big cities, you know. Phnom Penh, Bangkok… but this isn’t one of those. It's a small town. That's all I know for sure. Somewhere… rural.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, can you please repeat those three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three words… hmm. Let me think. Apple… table… and… Oh dear. That's difficult. I know I heard them. Apple… and table… and… something round. A coin? No… Was it… plum? No, that’s not right. I can picture the apple, and the table… but the third word… it’s gone. It’s just… vanished. Apple… table… and… I can’t recall. It’s on the tip of my tongue! But it won’t come. I’m sorry, Doctor. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Colt. Don't worry about it. It’s not a test to pass or fail. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, you are experiencing some difficulties with recent memory and recall. Your blood pressure is elevated as well. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing this without further investigation. Several things could be contributing, including normal age-related changes, high blood pressure, or other underlying conditions. I’d like to order some blood work to check your overall health, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work, alright, I suppose. I don’t like the sound of a scan, though. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? Soriya will be very worried. I told her I didn't think it was anything serious… This is just what I feared. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Blood work and… the scan. But explain it to me, Doctor. What are you looking for? I like to know what’s going on. Don't want any surprises, you understand. And what will it cost? Soriya manages the finances, you see. I don't handle those things. But… explain it to me. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Colt. A CT scan is a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s a very safe procedure. We’re looking for any signs of stroke, tumors, or other structural problems that could be affecting your memory and cognitive function. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it’s important to rule out those possibilities. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, check your kidney and liver function, and rule out any vitamin deficiencies or infections that could be contributing to your symptoms. As for the cost, the blood work should be around $150 - $200, and the CT scan could be between $400 - $600, depending on whether or not insurance covers it. I’ll have my staff check your Medicare coverage and give you an estimate. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend keeping track of your symptoms and any triggers that seem to worsen them. And I also recommend having Soriya monitor your blood pressure at home. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Medicare… alright. That’s good to hear. Soriya will be glad to hear that might be covered. Blood pressure monitoring… yes, she already does that, always fussing over me. I suppose it’s a good idea. The scan… I still don’t like the sound of it, but… alright. If you think it's necessary. But explain it to me again, Doctor. What am I supposed to do during the scan? Will it hurt? Will I be exposed to a lot of radiation? I’ve heard stories… And… what if you find something? What happens then? I don’t want to worry Soriya unnecessarily. She gets very anxious. Just tell me… what are the possibilities? I like to be prepared. Even if it’s not good news. It’s better to know, I suppose. But explain it to me, please. And be gentle.
DOCTOR: Okay, Colt. Let’s go through this step by step. During the CT scan, you’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. You’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the machine takes pictures of your brain. It doesn’t hurt at all. It’s similar to getting an X-ray. There is some radiation involved, but it’s a very low dose, and the benefits of finding out what’s going on outweigh the risks. Our technicians are very careful to minimize your exposure. Now, about what if we find something… it’s difficult to say definitively without seeing the results. If we find evidence of a stroke, we can start treatment to prevent further damage. If we find a tumor, we can discuss treatment options with a neurosurgeon. If it's something else, we'll consult with the appropriate specialist. The most important thing is to get a clear diagnosis so we can develop a plan to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I understand you’re worried about Soriya, and I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to keep her informed and involved in your care. We’ll discuss the results with you both, and we'll answer any questions you may have. I’m going to order the blood work and schedule the CT scan for you. My staff will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And I want to reassure you again, this is a process of gathering information. It doesn't automatically mean anything is seriously wrong. We’re just trying to rule things out. Does that help ease your mind a little?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. A process of gathering information. Yes, that’s… a little better. Soriya will be glad to hear that. She worries too much, that woman. But she means well. So, the blood work first, then the scan… and my staff will contact me. Good. That’s good. I suppose. Just… don’t let it drag on too long, alright? I don’t like waiting. And… if you find something… you’ll explain it to me and Soriya. You’ll discuss the options. Yes. That’s all I ask. I suppose there’s nothing else to do but wait, then. And try not to worry. But it’s difficult, you know? It’s difficult. Just… keep me informed, Doctor. And explain it to me in plain language. I don’t understand all the medical terms. Alright. I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not dismissing my concerns. Soriya will be relieved. And… I suppose I’ll see you again soon. After the tests. Yes. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Colt. I'm glad I could help. And you can count on me to keep you informed every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. My staff will be in touch soon to schedule your appointments. And remember, we’re just gathering information. Try not to worry too much. Take care, Colt. I'll see you again soon.
