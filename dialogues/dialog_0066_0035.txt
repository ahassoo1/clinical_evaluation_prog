DOCTOR: Hi Mirriam, good morning. I'm Dr. Condray. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Oh, it's these hiccups, really. Been going on for… well, a good few days now, and they just won’t stop. It’s quite bothersome, to be honest. Not painful, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant hiccups for a few days. That is bothersome. Let's try to figure out what might be going on. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. I was having lunch with Elsie—she’s a friend from church—and I laughed pretty hard at something she said. And then… hic… they just started. At first, I didn’t think much of it, you know? They usually go away on their own. But hic… they haven’t! They come and go, but they’re always there, sort of. Do you understand? It’s not like a few hiccups and then nothing for an hour. It's more… intermittent. And sometimes a glass of water helps, but not always.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Intermittent hiccups that started after laughing, and water doesn’t always help. That gives us a little something to work with. Now, aside from the laughing at lunch, was there anything else unusual happening around the time they started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. I had my usual breakfast, drove to Elsie’s… nothing out of the ordinary. Oh! Wait a minute. I did try a new brand of ginger tea that morning. I thought it might help with my digestion. But it tasted… a little different than usual, actually. A bit stronger, maybe? Could that have something to do with it? I don’t usually change things up, you know. I'm a creature of habit. hic… Sorry about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a new ginger tea the same day. That's helpful. Sometimes even seemingly small changes can cause unexpected reactions. Let's talk about other things. Have you noticed if anything specifically triggers them – certain foods, drinks, position changes, or even stress?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Stress? Not particularly. I've been quite relaxed, actually. Retired life is treating me well. hic Foods… no, not that I’ve noticed. I had a lovely fish curry last night, and they didn’t bother me any more than usual. And I sit a lot, reading mostly, so it’s not like I'm doing a lot of moving around. I do tend to slump a bit when I'm engrossed in a book, though. Could that be it? Maybe it’s something to do with how I’m sitting? It just feels… random. They just happen.
DOCTOR: Random hiccups, even with a slight slump while reading. Okay. Now, let's quickly go over some general health questions. Do you have any other medical problems – like heartburn, acid reflux, or any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of heartburn when I was younger, but that’s long gone. Nothing for years. And no trouble swallowing at all. I enjoy my food too much to have trouble with that! hic I do get a little tired sometimes, but that's just old age creeping in, I suppose. I'm 86, you know. I’ve always been pretty healthy, though. I've been lucky. I take a little medication for my blood pressure, but that’s all. And I always make sure to drink plenty of water.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Blood pressure medication is the only regular medication. Now, what about allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies. Let me think… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a problem with allergies, no. I mean, I might sneeze a little during pollen season, but nothing severe. Certainly nothing that would cause hiccups! hic I’ve lived in Fiji most of my life, you know, and we don’t have a lot of the same allergies as you have here, I think. It’s mostly warm and humid, so things don't grow the same way.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat. Just a quick check to make sure everything looks okay. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. hic Hopefully, you can figure out what's causing this bothersome problem. I’m starting to feel a bit silly, to be honest. It’s just hiccups! But they’re so… persistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart sounds are regular and lungs are clear. Throat looks normal – no redness or swelling. I'm not hearing or seeing anything immediately obvious that would explain the hiccups. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your diaphragm to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, go ahead. I’ll let you know if anything feels… unusual. hic It doesn't hurt, it’s just… annoying. It feels like someone’s tickling me from the inside. hic I do sometimes get a little indigestion, even with a light meal, but nothing major. Just a little bit of discomfort now and then. Is that relevant, do you think? I try to eat small portions, you see. It’s better for my digestion. hic
DOCTOR: Okay, gentle palpation of the diaphragm doesn't reveal any significant tenderness. A little bit of discomfort with digestion, but nothing acute. Given your history and the exam findings, these seem to be benign, persistent hiccups. Sometimes, these can happen for no apparent reason and resolve on their own. However, since they’ve been going on for a few days, and given your age, I think it’s best to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order a basic metabolic panel – just to check your electrolytes and kidney function. And also a chest X-ray, just to make sure there’s nothing going on in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s causing them, I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. hic I’m not keen on X-rays, if I’m honest, but if it’s necessary… I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. hic Will the X-ray be very… unpleasant? And how long will it take to get the results of the blood test and the X-ray? I have Elsie coming over for tea on Wednesday, and I’d like to be myself by then! hic
DOCTOR: The X-ray is very quick and doesn’t involve any discomfort – you’ll just stand in front of the machine for a few seconds. As for the results, the blood test should be back by tomorrow morning, and the X-ray results usually take a little longer – maybe by Wednesday. We can discuss the results then. In the meantime, you can continue to try the usual remedies – sipping water, breathing deeply, and avoiding anything that might trigger them. If they get significantly worse – if you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing – please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I'll try to stay calm and continue with the remedies. hic And I’ll be sure to come back if anything gets worse. hic Shortness of breath… oh dear. I don’t want that! I'll keep a close eye on things. hic So, just to be clear – blood test tomorrow, X-ray results by Wednesday. And I should call if anything changes. Is that right? And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It’s just… frustrating, these hiccups! hic They’re quite relentless.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly right. Blood test tomorrow, X-ray results by Wednesday, and please call if anything changes. You're very welcome, Mirriam. It’s my job to listen, and I understand how frustrating persistent hiccups can be. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now and schedule the X-ray for you. Is there anything else I can do for you at the moment?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your patience. hic I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it. hic It’s good to have a plan. And please, don’t worry about the hiccups too much. hic I'm sure it's nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor Condray. hic I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and try to relax. hic
