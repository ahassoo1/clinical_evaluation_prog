DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome. I’m Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you. Well, it’s this nausea, see. Happens most mornings now. I’ve been feeling a bit…off, and it usually starts right after I wake up. It’s not a violent thing, just…unsettled. And the doctor before you – lovely woman, name of MacLeod – she mentioned somethin’ about my heart not bein’ as strong as it used to be. Heart failure, I think she called it. That was a while back, though.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. Nausea most mornings, and you mentioned Dr. MacLeod spoke with you about some heart concerns previously. I see. It’s good you remember that detail. To clarify, Mr. Benic, when you say ‘unsettled,’ can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Aye, settled. It’s… hard to explain, really. It’s not like I’m gonna be sick, not usually. More like… a queasy feelin’ in my stomach, like after a bad meal, but I haven't had a bad meal. And a wee bit dizzy sometimes when it’s at its worst. It doesn’t last long, usually goes away after an hour or so, but it’s enough to ruin my appetite for breakfast, and I like a good breakfast, I do. Do you understand what I mean? It’s not pain, not exactly. Just…wrong.
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Benic. It sounds quite unpleasant. A queasy feeling, dizziness, and a loss of appetite… and it’s not related to anything you’ve eaten. Now, has this nausea been getting progressively worse, or has it been fairly constant over a period of time?
PATIENT: It's definitely been gettin’ worse, aye. Started maybe three months ago, just now and then, and I could usually ignore it. But the last month or so… it's nearly every morning. And it seems to be stickin' around longer, too. Used to be gone by the time I had my tea, but lately… it'll linger 'til lunchtime, sometimes. I haven't changed anything in my routine, mind you. Same breakfast, same bed time, same walk with the dog. It's just… appeared.
DOCTOR: Okay, progressively worsening over the last three months, with the most noticeable change in the last month. That’s helpful to know. Now, apart from the nausea and dizziness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I get a wee bit more breathless than I used to, especially when I’m walkin’ uphill. It's not terrible, just… notice it more. And my ankles… they swell up a bit at the end of the day, usually. I figured it was just old age, to be honest, but I suppose it could be related. Oh, and I’ve been feelin' tired, a bit run down. Not all the time, but more often than I used to. Does that make sense? I'm tryin' to think of everything...
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Benic. Breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue… those could certainly be related. Now, have you had any chest pain, Mr. Benic?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. Never had any trouble with that. It's the queasiness that's botherin' me the most, to be honest. And the breathlessness is worryin', of course, but it's not sharp or sudden, just…there. It doesn’t come and go, it just... is, like I said. I suppose Dr. MacLeod must have warned me about it with the heart trouble, but my memory isn’t what it used to be, even though I remember the details perfectly when I think about them. Does that make sense? It’s a strange thing.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Benic. It sounds frustrating to have these symptoms and then struggle to recall the specifics of previous conversations. Now, before we proceed, could you tell me a bit about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Let me see… I’m takin’ ramipril, that’s for the blood pressure, Dr. MacLeod prescribed that. And bisoprolol, another heart one, she said it slows the heart down. I think that’s all. Just those two, regularly. And I take a wee bit of paracetamol sometimes, for my knees, but not every day, just when they’re particularly bad. I don't take anything else. I'm quite careful with medication, I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, ramipril and bisoprolol for blood pressure and heart, and paracetamol as needed for your knees. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’, thankfully. I eat most things, and I've never had a problem with pollen or dust or anythin’ like that. I used to be a gardener, you see, spent years out in all sorts of things. Never had an allergic reaction, so I doubt I have any allergies. I'm a pretty sturdy sort, I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, Mr. Benic, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I've nothin’ to hide. And I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen, you know? It's nice to have someone pay attention. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if you need me to do anythin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit back against the chair, that would be perfect. I’m listening to your heart now, and I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm. There’s also a bit of a murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. And as you mentioned, there is some swelling in your ankles. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like your heart failure may be progressing. The nausea, dizziness, breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue are all consistent with that. The irregular rhythm and murmur support that as well. However, we need to run some tests to confirm.
PATIENT: That's… not what I wanted to hear, Doctor. But I suppose I expected as much. I could feel somethin’ wasn’t quite right. Tests, you say? What kind of tests are we talkin’ about? And what happens if it is gettin’ worse, like you said? I'm tryin’ not to panic, but it's difficult, you know? This heart business…it's worryin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Benic. It is concerning, but we're going to get to the bottom of it. We'll start with a blood test to check your kidney function and levels of something called BNP. BNP is a hormone released by the heart, and higher levels can indicate heart failure. We’ll also do an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a more detailed look at your heart rhythm. And finally, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to see the size and shape of your heart and lungs. If the tests confirm that your heart failure is progressing, we may need to adjust your medications. Sometimes we can improve symptoms with diuretics to help remove excess fluid, and potentially other medications to help your heart pump more effectively. It’s also important to monitor your weight closely and follow a heart-healthy diet, low in salt. I know it's a lot to take in, but we'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: That... that sounds manageable, I suppose. Blood tests, X-rays, I can handle that. And I've been tryin' to cut back on the salt, Doctor, ever since Dr. MacLeod mentioned it. I’m not much of a cook, mind you, but I’ve been readin’ the labels, and I’m careful with what I eat. What about the diet, though? What exactly is a heart-healthy diet? And the weight… how closely are we talkin’? I don’t want to become obsessed with it, you know? I just want to feel better, and get back to walkin' the dog without gettin' breathless. It’s a wee bit of a worry. And if the medications change, will I feel any different? Any side effects I should be lookin’ out for? I like bein’ prepared, you see.
DOCTOR: That's excellent you've already been mindful of the salt, Mr. Benic. It makes a real difference. As for a heart-healthy diet, it’s about focusing on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Think things like fish, chicken, beans, and olive oil. We’ll have a nutritionist give you a detailed plan, but basically, it’s about reducing processed foods, sugary drinks, and saturated and trans fats. Regarding your weight, monitoring it daily is ideal, but don’t become obsessive. We’re looking for significant changes, like more than 2-3 pounds in a day, or 5 pounds in a week. If you notice those changes, let us know right away, as it can indicate fluid buildup. If we do need to adjust your medications, it's possible you might experience some side effects. Common ones include dizziness, fatigue, or changes in your kidney function, which is why we’ll monitor your blood tests closely. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms after starting a new medication, don’t hesitate to call us right away. We'll discuss any potential side effects in detail before starting anything new. I'll give you a list of symptoms to watch out for. I'm going to order those tests now. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds… sensible. Tests, nurse, X-ray tomorrow. I can handle that. And the list of symptoms, that’s a good idea. I like bein’ informed, as you know. So, what do I do in the meantime? Just carry on as normal? And is there anythin’ I should avoid doin’ before the tests? Anythin’ special I need to eat or drink? I don't want to mess up the results, you see. It’s just… I like to be prepared. And I'd like to thank you for takin’ the time to explain everythin’ so clearly, Doctor. It's a weight off my mind, knowin' what's happenin'. Honestly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I suppose I should let the nurse get on with it?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. It’s my pleasure. For the time being, just carry on as normal. No special diet or preparations are needed before the tests. Just try to stay hydrated. And if you feel any significantly worse – like increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness – don’t hesitate to call us, even if it’s outside of regular hours. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. She'll explain the process. And I’ll review the results with you as soon as they come in. Thank you for your patience today, Mr. Benic. And remember, we’re here to help every step of the way. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to ask. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have another patient waiting. Feel free to relax, and the nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
