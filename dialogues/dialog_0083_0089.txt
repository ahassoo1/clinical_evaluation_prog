DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is nice to meet you. Oh dear… what brings me in… It’s this pain, you see. Down low. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it’s quite unpleasant. I believe my records mention something about… well, a condition I have? Something with the body attacking itself. It’s all a bit… hazy, truthfully. I apologize. I don’t recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall all the details; that’s what my records are for. And it's good you mentioned that condition – it gives me a starting point. Let’s see… <pause, glances at screen> Ah, yes. It appears you’ve been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Rheumatoid… arthritis? Is that the same thing? The one where… well, the body isn’t friendly to itself? It sounds… familiar, but the name itself doesn’t quite… click. I’ve had doctors explain it before, I’m sure. Several, over the years. But it never seems to stay put in my memory. Perhaps it's just an old lady thing. Is that what causes the pain, then? This… unpleasantness?
DOCTOR: It is a lot to remember, Ms. Glymph, and you're not alone in finding it difficult. Rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune condition – that means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks your joints, causing inflammation and pain. It often affects multiple joints, but it can also cause pain in other parts of the body. To help me understand what's going on with your pain, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Joints… yes, that sounds right. It does ache in my hips sometimes, and my hands… they get stiff. But this pain… it’s lower. In my abdomen, really. It’s not a constant ache, more like… waves. Sharp, and then gone, then back again. It’s been… worse lately, I think. I haven’t been keeping track, truthfully. Everything seems to blend together after a while. And it doesn’t always feel the same. Sometimes it’s just a dull pressure, other times… well, other times it’s quite frightening.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the pain is primarily in your abdomen, with some associated joint pain in your hips and hands. And it’s come and gone in waves, varying in intensity. When you say “frightening,” could you elaborate on what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not just the sharpness, you see. It’s… a feeling of something being wrong. Deeply wrong. Like something is… twisting. And it takes my breath away. I do worry… that it’s something other than the… arthritis. Something more serious. I’ve had… a few scares over the years, with my stomach. I apologize for being so vague. It’s just… difficult to pinpoint, and I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not being a bother at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s important to describe things as accurately as possible, and it’s perfectly alright that it’s difficult. That “twisting” sensation and feeling of something being deeply wrong are important clues. To get a better picture, let’s go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you recall any past surgeries or significant medical illnesses besides the rheumatoid arthritis?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix removed, quite a long time ago. And… I believe I had a gallbladder removed as well. Oh, and a hysterectomy, many years ago. As for other illnesses… I had pneumonia a few times, as I recall. And… there was something with my intestines, once. A blockage, I think? It required a… a procedure. But the details are… hazy. I truly apologize. My memory is simply dreadful. I do hope this isn’t too frustrating for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, not at all frustrating, Ms. Glymph. This is all very helpful. It appears you had a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – and a hysterectomy as you mentioned, and a small bowel obstruction several years ago requiring a resection. Are you currently experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Nausea… not really. Although I do feel a bit… queasy sometimes, but that could be anything, really. Vomiting, no. Not recently. Bowel habits… well, they’ve been… irregular. A bit constipated sometimes, other times… the opposite. It’s very unpredictable, I’m afraid. It doesn't seem to be linked to anything in particular. I just… assume it’s old age. Is that what you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Glymph. And it’s good you’re being so open with me. Given your history of rheumatoid arthritis, previous abdominal surgeries, and the current abdominal pain with changes in bowel habits, I would like to do a physical examination. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and gently feel it to see if I can identify any areas of tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I do get a bit nervous with anything involving my stomach. But I understand it’s necessary. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I’m just listening to your abdomen now. <pause> Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There. Just… there. It’s not excruciating, but… it’s definitely uncomfortable. It’s a… a dull ache, really. And it seems to radiate a little bit. To my back. Is that… is that normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting tenderness in your lower abdomen, radiating to your back. That’s helpful information. There is some mild guarding as well. I’m going to press a little deeper now, please let me know if the pain becomes sharp or unbearable. <pause> Any significant change in the pain level?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s getting sharper. Not unbearable, but… definitely more noticeable. It’s a… a twisting sensation. Like something is… caught. And it’s making me a bit lightheaded, actually. I apologize. I’m probably being dramatic. It’s just… a bit frightening.
DOCTOR: You're not being dramatic at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s important that you tell me exactly what you’re feeling. Given your history, current symptoms, and the tenderness I’m finding, I’m concerned about a possible bowel obstruction or another abdominal issue. I want to be cautious. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and look for signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will give us a detailed image of your abdominal organs and help us identify any blockages or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Very sensible. A CT scan… that will show something, won’t it? I just… I just want to know what’s going on. And if it is… the blockage again… is it serious? I apologize for all the questions. I just… I get anxious.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to ask questions, Ms. Glymph. That’s what I’m here for. A CT scan will provide a very detailed image of your abdominal organs, and yes, it should help us determine if there’s a blockage or another issue. If it is a bowel obstruction, the severity can vary. Small obstructions can sometimes resolve on their own with bowel rest and IV fluids. Larger obstructions may require hospitalization and potentially surgery. However, we won’t know the extent of the problem until we have the results of the CT scan. I’m going to have my nurse draw some blood. Then, we’ll get you scheduled for a CT scan as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding eating or drinking anything until we have a clearer picture. And if the pain becomes severe or you start experiencing nausea, vomiting, or constipation, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… manageable. No eating or drinking… I can do that. And I will go to the emergency room if… if things get worse. You’ve been very kind. I apologize for being such a… a worry. Perhaps this old lady is just falling apart. .
DOCTOR: You’re not falling apart, Ms. Glymph. It’s good that you’re advocating for yourself and letting me know how you’re feeling. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, and I’m here to help every step of the way. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood.
