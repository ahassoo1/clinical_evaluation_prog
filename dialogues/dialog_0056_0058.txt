DOCTOR: Hi Vicent, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s been… difficult lately. I was wondering if there might be something, perhaps a medication, that could help me along.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Losing weight can be tough, and it’s great that you’re taking the initiative to address it. Just to get a clearer picture, how long have you been noticing this difficulty with weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it’s been… a good six months, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It used to be… easier, you know? I’ve always been fairly active, with the model making and all, but now… it just doesn’t seem to make the same difference. I try to eat sensible, but… well, it's a struggle.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months. And you mentioned model making – is that a physically active hobby?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. A lot of carving, sanding… working with the wood. It keeps me on my feet, certainly. Used to be, that was enough to keep the weight off. I build miniature ships, mostly. Chamorro proas, sometimes. It’s… a passion, you see. But these days, even that isn't quite enough. I find myself getting tired quicker, too.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know – it sounds like you’re pretty active then. And the fatigue is good to note. Let's talk about your eating habits a bit. Could you describe a typical day of meals for me?
PATIENT: Well… breakfast is usually just a piece of fruit, maybe some toast. Nothing fancy. Lunch is often leftovers from dinner, or a small sandwich. And dinner… my wife, God rest her soul, she always made sure we had a balanced meal. Fish, rice, vegetables… I still try to keep that up. Though, I confess, I do enjoy a little bit of dessert now and then. A small piece of chocolate, perhaps. Or some fruit. I don’t go overboard, but… it's a comfort, you understand. It's just...doesn’t seem to be enough anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you generally eat a pretty healthy diet. Just to get a full picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not so much a change in appetite, but… I find I’m craving sweets more often, perhaps. And I don’t feel as full after eating as I used to. It’s… strange. I eat the same amount, but… it doesn’t stay with me, you see? And then I feel hungry again sooner. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know – increased cravings and feeling less full after meals. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your body, like increased thirst, frequent urination, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Increased thirst… now that you mention it, perhaps a little. I've been drinking more water lately, but I thought that was just the heat. It has been a warm summer. Frequent urination… no, not particularly. And my vision… no changes that I’ve noticed. I wear glasses, you see, but the prescription hasn't changed recently. Everything seems as clear as it usually is, though a bit blurry without them, naturally. I haven't been feeling unwell, just…tired, and the weight…it bothers me. It's mostly about feeling good again, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, that's good information. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, nothing too serious, thankfully. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but that cleared up with antibiotics. And I have a touch of arthritis in my knees, which acts up sometimes, especially in the cold weather. Other than that… I've been fairly healthy, all things considered. I'm on Medicare, of course, for the arthritis, and I see my regular doctor for check-ups. I lost my wife, Elena, two years ago… it’s been hard. She always took care of my health records… I don't recall everything offhand, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia a few years ago and arthritis in your knees. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife, Elena. It's completely understandable you don't have everything memorized. Let’s see if we can access your records through Medicare. Just one moment… Okay, I see here you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, currently managed with lisinopril. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The high blood pressure. I take the lisinopril every morning, like I'm supposed to. Doctor Alvarez prescribed it. He's a good man. I haven’t had any problems with it, usually. I get my blood pressure checked regularly at his office. It’s been stable, as far as I know. Just… lately, with everything, I've been feeling more… sluggish, you see? Even with the medication.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, not really. Just the lisinopril. Oh! I do take a multivitamin occasionally, but it's not regular. My daughter sends them to me, you know, trying to make sure I'm getting enough nutrients. But I don’t take it every day. And… that’s about it. Nothing else. Just the lisinopril, and the occasional multivitamin. I’m not one for a lot of pills, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no allergies. Never had any problems with that. Elena always made sure to ask when I started a new medication, you see. She was very careful. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. No food allergies, no medication allergies… nothing at all. I'm quite lucky, in that regard, I suppose. Is that… all the questions, Doctor? I feel like I've been talking a lot.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfect, Vicent. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It's very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I suppose it’s a necessary part of things. I’m not a fan of doctors’ visits, to be honest, but… I understand it needs to be done. Just… try to be gentle, if you would? My knees aren't what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I will be as gentle as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is 140/90 today, which is a little elevated. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Anything tender here?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit, yes. Just… right here, on the left side. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. It's been a bit… uncomfortable lately, especially after I eat. Not all the time, but… often enough to bother me. I thought it was just indigestion, to be honest. Perhaps too much rice, you see. Elena always said I ate too much rice.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and your thyroid. Your reflexes are normal, and your thyroid feels normal as well. Finally, I’m going to take a look at your knees. There’s some swelling and crepitus in both knees, consistent with arthritis. Okay, Vicent, everything seems to be within normal limits, although your blood pressure is a bit high and there is some tenderness in your left abdomen and swelling in your knees. Do you have any history of liver problems?
PATIENT: Liver problems? No, Doctor, never. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. Doctor Alvarez never mentioned anything, and Elena… she would have told me, you see. She always kept track of those things. No, I've never had any issues with my liver. But… tenderness in my abdomen… that's new, and worrying. What could that be? Is it serious, Doctor? Is it related to the weight, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Okay. The tenderness in your abdomen, combined with your weight loss, increased appetite and slightly elevated blood pressure, makes me want to investigate further. While it’s unlikely to be a serious issue, we should rule out any underlying causes. I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete metabolic panel to check your liver function, kidney function, and blood sugar levels, as well as a lipid panel to check your cholesterol. I’m also going to order a TSH to rule out any thyroid issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, yes, that’s alright, Doctor. If it will help find out what’s going on, then do what you need to do. I just… I want to feel like myself again. I don’t like feeling sluggish and tired all the time. And the weight… it’s not just about appearances, you see? It's about being able to do things. To enjoy life. So, yes, please, do the blood work. And… thank you, Doctor, for taking the time to listen. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Vicent. I understand. Okay, I'll get the lab orders sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for blood draw. It should take about 15-20 minutes. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet, try to stay as active as you can, and keep track of any symptoms you're experiencing. Also, given your blood pressure is slightly elevated, I'd like you to check it at home if possible. You can find an affordable blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Keeping a log of your readings will be helpful. Would you like me to have the nurse give you some information on how to properly check your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please do. That would be very helpful. I’ve never checked my blood pressure at home before, so I wouldn’t even know where to begin. And thank you again for taking the time to listen to me. It means a lot. I appreciate you not dismissing my concerns. And… if you don't mind, perhaps a little brochure or something on healthy Chamorro foods? Elena always had the best recipes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Vicent. Here you are. This brochure has some great recipes and tips for healthy eating, and this pamphlet will guide you through checking your blood pressure at home. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the blood work requisition with you and answer any questions. We’ll call you as soon as the results are available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
