DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Well, hello Dr. Yoshino, nice to meet you too. It’s this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, maybe a week now? Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come, it’s a real doozy. Feels like a tight band squeezin’ right across the back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache that comes and goes for about a week now, and it feels like a tight band across the back of your head. That sounds uncomfortable. Can you tell me a little more about when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It's hard to say exactly when. Doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, not like after a long day or if I'm stressed. Sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes in the afternoon, sometimes not at all. I’ve been tryin’ to pay attention, but no real pattern jumps out. I do a lot of gardening, though, maybe that has somethin’ to do with it? Bendin’ over and such. Or maybe the sun... I don't know. I'm an old man, things just happen, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be tricky to pinpoint a cause. And gardening could certainly play a role – bending, sun exposure, even just being out in the elements. Let's try to get a bit more detail. When the headache is at its worst, do you have any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Well, nothin' major. Sometimes I feel a little… off. Kind of tired, you know? Not like I need a nap tired, just… not quite myself. And sometimes, my vision gets a little blurry, but only for a few seconds. It’s happened maybe twice in the last week when the headache was bad. Not with every headache, mind you. Just when it's really achin'. I don't get nauseous or anything, and no fever, if that's what you were gonna ask. I still eat like a horse, thankfully!
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the headache, you've noticed some fatigue and brief blurry vision when the headache is severe. No nausea or fever, and your appetite is good – that’s good to hear. Let's talk a bit about your past health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Let me think... Not really. I had high blood pressure years ago, but the doctor said I got it under control with diet and exercise. Been watchin' what I eat ever since. Oh, and my knees ain’t what they used to be, but that’s just old age creepin’ in, I reckon. No serious illnesses, nothin' I've been officially told about, anyway. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. A long while. Mostly just take some ibuprofen when somethin’ hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that you’ve managed with diet and exercise, and some knee pain. And you haven't been to the doctor regularly recently. Ibuprofen as needed. Have you ever had any surgeries, Percell?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Always been lucky that way, knock on wood. My mama always said I was too stubborn to let anyone cut on me! I just tried to tough things out. Not always the smartest idea, I suppose, but that’s how we were raised. I got a good constitution, I think. Or I used to, anyway. This headache’s got me worryin’ a little bit, though. It ain't normal for me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’ve been generally healthy, but it's smart to get things checked out when something is different. Let’s talk about your family. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of headaches or any neurological problems, like strokes or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a tricky one. My family… well, they weren't much for talkin' about health problems. My mama came over from Laos a long time ago, and she didn’t really trust doctors much. My papa, he… he just didn’t pay attention to those things. I know my uncle, on my mama’s side, he used to get terrible migraines, real bad ones that kept him in bed for days. But that was a long time ago, and I don't know if anyone else had anything like that. We didn't really keep records, you know? Mostly just dealt with things as they came. It’s hard to say, really. A lot of unknowns.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families to not have a lot of detailed health history. We’ll do the best we can with what we have. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your daily life?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I live alone in a small house just outside of town. Mostly keep to myself, but I got a few good friends I see now and then. I spend a lot of time in my garden, growin’ vegetables mostly – tomatoes, peppers, beans, the usual. I like to cook, too, and I make a pretty good Hmong-style stir-fry, if I do say so myself. I read the paper every morning, and I listen to some music on the radio. I try to stay active, but my knees slow me down some. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. Just a simple life, really. Not much excitement, but I like it that way. I used to volunteer at the community center, helpin’ folks with their taxes, but I had to stop a few months ago because of this headache. It just got too hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet, active life with gardening, cooking, reading, and community involvement, but the headache has made it difficult to continue volunteering. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when I need it, like I said. And sometimes I take some vitamin D in the winter, 'cause the doctor told me I wasn't gettin' enough sunshine. Other than that, nothin’. I like to get my nutrients from my garden, you know? Fresh vegetables are the best medicine. I don't trust those fancy pills too much. Never really felt like they did much good anyway. I try to keep things natural, if I can. That’s what my mama always taught me. Though, maybe I should’ve listened to her more about seein' a doctor regularly…
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Percell, thanks for sharing all of that with me. It gives me a much better understanding of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and doing a basic neurological exam. It shouldn’t take too long. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Dr. Yoshino. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Anything you need to figure out what’s makin’ my head ache, I’m happy to let you do it. I'm a bit worried, but I figure it's better to know what's goin' on, right? Just let me know if anything hurts or feels strange.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We’ll keep an eye on that. Everything sounds good there. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There you go. Is that alright? I haven't done this in… well, a very long time. I hope I’m not too clumsy. My eyes ain't what they used to be, either. Should I be wearin’ my glasses for this?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, you’re doing great. And yes, please put your glasses on. It will help me get a more accurate reading. Okay, good. Now, I'm going to check your strength and sensation in your arms and legs. I’m going to ask you to squeeze my hand as tight as you can. Good strength. Now, can you close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright, eyes closed. There you go. Tell me if anything feels strange, Dr. Yoshino. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm tryin’ to stay calm. I've always been a bit of a worrier, I reckon. My wife used to say so, rest her soul.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, and do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. A little ticklish, but I feel it. Is everything alright? I'm not feelin' any numbness or pins and needles or anything like that. Just that little tickle. Everything seems… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s been a long time since anyone poked and prodded me like this! I feel a bit like a science experiment.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Percell. No numbness or tingling, that's good. Everything seems normal on the neurological exam so far. Now, I’m just going to quickly listen to your neck. Okay. No abnormal sounds or tenderness. Overall, the physical exam is mostly normal. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, but everything else appears to be within normal limits. The neurological exam is reassuring. However, given your headache and blurry vision, I would like to order a few tests just to be on the safe side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Yoshino. Better to be safe than sorry, right? What kind of tests are you thinkin' about? Blood work? A scan of my head? I don't mind, as long as it helps figure out what's causin’ this headache. I just want to get back to my garden, you know? And maybe get back to volunteerin’ when I can. I’m a bit worried, but I trust your judgement. Do what you think is best. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’m thinking we’ll start with some blood work to check your general health and rule out any underlying infections or inflammation. We'll also order a CT scan of your head to get a better look at your brain and rule out anything serious like a tumor or aneurysm. The CT scan will require you to lie still for a short period of time. It's painless, but you will be exposed to a small amount of radiation. We’ll discuss the risks and benefits before proceeding. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Hmm... I don't think so. Never had any dye before, as far as I know. I haven't had many medical procedures, you see. I've always been pretty healthy, mostly. But, to be on the safe side, I do have a bit of an allergy to penicillin. Makes me break out in a rash. Nothing major, just itchy, but the doctor always warned me to stay away from it. Does that matter with this dye stuff? I don't want to have a bad reaction. It’s been a long time since I’ve been really sick, and I’d like to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know about the penicillin allergy. It’s important we have that information. The contrast dye we use for the CT scan is different than penicillin, but it’s always best to be cautious with any allergy. We will take extra precautions and monitor you closely during the scan. Okay, so we’ll order the blood work and the CT scan. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the CT scan for tomorrow morning. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a medication to help manage your headache. It’s a mild pain reliever, and it should help with the discomfort. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very good, Dr. Yoshino. A mild pain reliever would be a welcome relief, thank you. And scheduling the CT scan for tomorrow is fine with me. I trust your plan. I'm a bit nervous, but I'm glad we're gettin’ things checked out. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? Fastin' or anything like that? I want to make sure I do everything right. And… will you explain the results to me when they come back? I’m not very good with medical jargon, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. For the CT scan, you'll need to avoid eating or drinking anything for four hours before the appointment. You can drink clear liquids like water up to two hours before. You should wear comfortable clothing and remove any metal jewelry or piercings. And yes, of course I will explain the results to you in plain language. I understand medical jargon can be confusing. We will go through everything step-by-step, and I will answer any questions you have. Here’s the prescription for the ibuprofen. The nurse will give you instructions on where to get it filled. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Yoshino. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. The instructions for the scan are helpful, and I feel a bit more at ease now. Thank you again for your kindness. I'll go get the prescription filled and get ready for the scan tomorrow. And… I'll be thinkin’ positive thoughts. Hopefully, it's just somethin’ minor. Thank you, Dr. Yoshino. Truly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. I’m thinking positive thoughts too, and we’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your scan tomorrow. Have a good day, and I’ll see you then. .
