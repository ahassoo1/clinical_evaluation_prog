DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, frankly, it's about this… medical marijuana. My niece, she’s been telling me about it. Says it helps with everything. I don’t hold with all that… newfangled nonsense, but she insists, and my husband, bless his heart, thinks it might help me sleep. So, I suppose I’m here to see if I can get one of those… certifications, if that's the right word.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Though I must say, the very idea… it's just not something I ever envisioned needing. My generation, we dealt with things a different way. A nice cup of chamomile, perhaps. But my sleep… it's been dreadful. Waking up at all hours. And my niece, she's quite insistent this is the answer. She says it’s perfectly legal now, and all sorts of people are using it.
DOCTOR: Legal, yes. Practical… that remains to be seen. Before we even consider such a course of action, Ms. Ranells, we need to determine the cause of your sleep disturbance. It’s rather irresponsible to simply mask a symptom without addressing the underlying issue. Now, tell me, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it hasn’t been sudden, you understand. It's been… creeping up on me, I suppose. Probably… six months now? Maybe longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. It started with just the occasional restless night. Now, it’s nearly every night. I wake up, and my mind just… races. Thoughts going round and round. It's very unsettling. I do try to avoid naps during the day, though. I don’t want to ruin my appetite, you see.
DOCTOR: Six months of insomnia… and you’re concerned about your appetite. Very well. Now, aside from the difficulty sleeping and your… dietary concerns, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, plenty. Though I don’t see how they’re related. My joints ache something fierce, especially in my knees. Makes getting out of bed a trial, it does. And my memory… well, it’s not what it used to be, naturally. Though I wouldn’t say I’m forgetful, exactly. More… selective with my recollections, perhaps. And my husband complains about my mood. Says I’m… particular. He doesn’t understand needing things just so.
DOCTOR: Aches, memory lapses, and… particularity. It seems we have quite a list. Now, Ms. Ranells, have you been evaluated for arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? No, Doctor. Never. I simply thought it was… old age. One’s joints do wear out, you know. No need to bother the doctors with every little ache and pain. My mother always said a good poultice and a strong cup of tea would cure anything. And frankly, I’ve always been… hesitant to run to the doctor for every little thing. Waste of time, mostly. And money. Though my niece… she insists I get everything checked these days. She's very modern, that one.
DOCTOR: A poultice… Very well. We’ll need to ascertain the source of these aches, then. Now, tell me about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Well, nothing serious, Doctor. I had the flu, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And a bout of indigestion last spring that was rather unpleasant. But beyond that… no. My blood pressure’s always been a bit high, the nurse tells me when she takes it at the hairdresser’s, but nothing they can’t manage. I try to watch my salt intake, though my husband is terribly fond of olives. And I had my gallbladder out, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. But that was a simple operation. Nothing to write home about. I’ve always been a sturdy woman, Doctor, very resilient.
DOCTOR: Hypertension and a cholecystectomy thirty years ago. Anything else?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes. I had a rather nasty fall a few years back. Tripped over the cat, can you imagine? Didn't break anything, thankfully, but I bruised my hip something awful. And I was terribly shaken up. My husband insisted I take it easy for weeks. I suppose that’s all. I've never been one for complaints, Doctor. A bit of discomfort is simply part of life, don't you think? Though this sleeping… that’s truly troubling. It’s not like me to be so… restless.
DOCTOR: A fall…and subsequent restlessness. Now, Ms. Ranells, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those pills they push these days. Mess with your system, that’s what they do. My husband takes something for his… well, I don’t quite recall what it is. Something for his heart, I believe. But I’ve always managed perfectly well on my own. A bit of chamomile tea, a warm bath… that’s all I need. I don’t want to be dependent on anything, you understand? It’s a matter of principle. Though I’m starting to wonder if I have a choice in the matter… with this sleeping, that is.
DOCTOR: No medications. Very well. And do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been rather… robust, you understand. I can eat just about anything. Though I don’t care for shellfish, personally. Not an allergy, just a… preference. My niece is terribly sensitive, though. All sorts of things bother her. Dust mites, pollen, cats… the list goes on and on. But me? I’ve always been perfectly fine. Though I did have a slight rash once, years ago, after using a new laundry detergent. But that was ages ago. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Ranells, I think it’s time for a brief physical examination. We need to assess your joints, check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure, you understand. And frankly, before we even consider a medical marijuana certification, we need to rule out any underlying physical causes for your sleep disturbance and other symptoms. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose that’s… reasonable. Though I’m not terribly fond of doctors’ offices. All those cold surfaces and unpleasant smells. And I do hate being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary… very well. Just be gentle, Doctor. And please, no cold instruments.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Ranells. Now, if you could just lie back for me. First, let's check your reflexes. Two plus. Normal. Now, let's assess your joints. A bit of crepitus here, and some tenderness to palpation. Range of motion is… limited. Heart sounds are regular, slightly… muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Soft, non-tender. Overall… there is some evidence of mild osteoarthritis in your knees. And your heart sounds are slightly diminished, which warrants further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That doesn't sound very promising, does it? Osteo… what did you call it? It sounds dreadful. And my heart sounds… diminished? Is that serious, Doctor? I do feel a bit… breathless sometimes, now that you mention it. Not terribly, just a little… winded after climbing the stairs. But I simply put it down to getting older. Are you saying I shouldn’t be climbing the stairs? My husband would be terribly upset if I stopped that. It’s good exercise, you see.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, Ms. Ranells. Quite common in individuals your age. And diminished heart sounds… well, it could be a number of things. It requires further investigation. We'll need to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. As for the stairs… I wouldn't recommend strenuous activity until we have a clearer picture of your condition. Now, before we proceed any further with this… marijuana discussion, we need to address these underlying health concerns. It would be irresponsible of me to simply grant you a certification without first conducting a thorough medical evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. Goodness. An EKG and a… chest X-ray? That sounds terribly complicated. And expensive, no doubt. I suppose you’re right, Doctor. It wouldn’t be sensible to rush into anything. Though my niece… she insists this marijuana will solve all my problems. But I do see your point. One must be cautious, naturally. Very well. Do what you think is best, Doctor. Though I must confess, I’m not terribly optimistic about all this. And my husband… he’ll be terribly disappointed if he can’t continue taking me on our walks. Perhaps this marijuana isn’t such a good idea after all.
DOCTOR: A sensible decision, Ms. Ranells. Now, let's get these tests ordered. The nurse will take your blood pressure and draw some blood for a basic metabolic panel. Then, we’ll schedule you for an EKG and a chest X-ray. I’ll review the results and discuss them with you at your next appointment. For now, I recommend you limit strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. Any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Just… this marijuana. It’s all rather disappointing, isn't it? My niece was so certain… But you’re the doctor. You know best. Thank you for your time, Doctor Blim. And thank you for being… thorough. I suppose I'll see you again soon.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ranells. The nurse will escort you to the scheduling desk. Have a good day.
