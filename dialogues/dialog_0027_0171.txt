DOCTOR: Good morning, Lacreasha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... my nails. They just don't look right, you know? I don't even know why I'm here, really. Just… different. Not good different.
DOCTOR: Different how, Lacreasha?
PATIENT: Ugh. It's hard to say. They're...thick? And kinda yellowish. Not bright yellow, thankfully. Just… not my normal color. I don’t usually look at my nails, to be honest. My sister, she kept going on about it. Said I needed to get it checked. Honestly, I think she just likes sending me places.
DOCTOR: Okay, thick and yellowish. And your sister noticed it. Right. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it something recent?
PATIENT: Recent, I think. Maybe a few months? Everything just… blurs together, you know? I don’t pay attention to dates. It wasn’t like overnight, but definitely not forever. I don’t even know why it matters how long. It just is. Is it something bad? You think it's a fungus? I had a friend once... she had a bad toe. Really bad.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few months. We'll figure it out. It could be a fungus, yes, that’s a possibility. But there are other things it could be too. To get a better idea, let’s take a look at your nails. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But don't make a big deal about it. They're just nails. And I don't like people staring at my feet. Honestly. Is there a special chair for this? My back isn't so good.
DOCTOR: No special chair, I'm afraid, but we can get you a pillow if that helps with your back. I'll be as quick as possible. Just need to get a good look. And don't worry, I'm not judging anyone's feet. Alright, let's have you sit up here and we can take a look.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. A pillow would be nice, thank you. My sister always said I was dramatic, but honestly, this chair… It's not made for people. Just get it over with, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see what you mean. They are thicker than usual, and there is a yellowish discoloration. No signs of any inflammation or redness at the moment. Let me just feel around a bit… Okay, nothing particularly tender. Do you notice any pain or discomfort in your nails or fingers?
PATIENT: No pain. Not really. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes? But I itch a lot of things. Allergies, you know? Dust, cats, my neighbor’s cooking… Honestly, everything makes me itch. I don't think my nails are special. Is this going to take much longer? I really should be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, itchy sometimes. I understand. We're almost done. It's good to rule things out. To be certain, I'd like to send a small scraping of your nail to the lab for a fungal culture. It'll just confirm whether or not a fungus is the cause. It's a quick and painless procedure. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A scraping? Like… taking a piece of my nail? Ugh. Is it going to hurt? I don't like anything poking at me. And honestly, what if it’s something worse than a fungus? My sister will never let me hear the end of it if I have some terrible disease. Is it necessary?
DOCTOR: It’s a very small scraping, Lacreasha. It won’t really hurt, I promise. It's like filing your nail a little bit. And it's the best way to know for sure what we're dealing with. Knowing what’s causing it helps us get you the right treatment. It's not necessarily something terrible, a lot of nail changes are caused by fungal infections. But yes, it's important to rule other things out. We can also check your medical history for any contributing factors. Do you have any known allergies besides the ones you mentioned?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But be quick about it. And gentle. I bruise easily, you know. My sister always said I was too pale. And I've got… Medicare. Is that okay? Everything costs so much these days. And I don’t really remember what I’m allergic to, exactly. Just… things. Dust, cats, perfume, sometimes food. Honestly, it’s easier to list what I am allergic to, and that’s nothing. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Medicare is perfectly fine. And we’ll be as gentle as possible. Just a quick scrape. And don't worry about listing everything you're allergic to, we'll just make a note of the general allergies you mentioned. Okay, all done. That was quick, right?
PATIENT: Ugh. It tickled. And now my nail looks… uneven. Honestly. What am I supposed to do with a lopsided nail? My sister is going to laugh. Now what? Do I have to wait forever for the results? I have a book club meeting on Thursday. And I don't want to go if my nails look awful. .
DOCTOR: It's just a tiny bit uneven, I promise. It won’t be noticeable. The lab results usually take about a week or so, we’ll call you as soon as they’re in. Until then, we can just monitor it and see if there are any changes. If you're concerned, you can apply a clear nail polish if you want. It won't affect the results. .
