DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. I received a recommendation from a colleague to come and speak with you regarding… planning for the future, shall we say? Specifically, I understand you assist with those documents outlining one’s wishes, should… circumstances arise. I believe they are called Advance Directives or POLST forms? I want to have these prepared, properly and efficiently.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Advance Directives and POLST forms… very responsible of you to think ahead, Marija. It's good to get these things sorted. My memory isn’t what it used to be, but we’ll get everything taken care of. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what prompted you to consider these documents now?
PATIENT: Prompted? Well, Doctor, one doesn’t simply wait for a tragedy to consider such important matters. It’s a matter of prudence. I have a comfortable life, a husband, responsibilities… I simply wish to ensure everything is handled with… dignity. And, frankly, I’ve seen too many families make a complete mess of things when faced with difficult decisions. It’s… unsettling. I wouldn't want my husband burdened with choices he isn't prepared to make.
DOCTOR: That’s very understandable, Marija. It is a weight off everyone's shoulders to have these things in place. Dignity is important, absolutely. Let's talk a bit about your overall health, if you don't mind. Just a general overview to help me understand your situation. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything you’re being treated for, or regularly manage?
PATIENT: Manage? No, Doctor, I do not “manage” anything. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise… I consider myself quite robust, for my age. I had a… minor issue with my back a few years ago, but it resolved itself with physiotherapy. Otherwise, I am perfectly healthy. I assure you, I am not one of those patients who requires constant attention. I simply wish to be… prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Marija. Good health is a wonderful thing. And it’s good that the back issue resolved on its own. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. I believe in maintaining the integrity of one’s body, Doctor. I find the idea of… unnecessary interventions… quite barbaric, frankly. One should only resort to such measures when absolutely unavoidable. I pride myself on avoiding such… complications. Are you implying I look as though I've had surgery? Because that is rather insensitive.
DOCTOR: Oh, no, not at all, Marija. I apologize if that came across wrong. It's simply standard procedure to ask about past surgical history. No judgment whatsoever. We just need a complete picture. Alright. And how about your family?
PATIENT: My family? My husband, Jean-Pierre, is… adequate. He manages the household. And my sister, Isabelle, lives in Paris. We speak occasionally. Beyond that… I wouldn’t say I have a particularly close-knit family. They are… not inclined towards the same level of… foresight, shall we say? That is why I am taking the initiative here. It’s rather a lonely endeavor, frankly. They would likely dismiss this as… overly dramatic.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re taking this seriously, regardless. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant? My maternal grandmother suffered from… what was it? A weakening of the bones. Osteoporosis, I believe. And my uncle, on my father's side, had heart problems. But beyond that… no. We are a relatively robust lineage, all things considered. Though, as I said, they don’t prioritize preventative measures. They simply… react when something happens. It’s quite frustrating, really. They wouldn't understand the importance of these… documents.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I assure you, I do not require such things. I maintain my health through discipline and a balanced lifestyle. I might occasionally take a vitamin C tablet during the winter months, but that is hardly… significant. I find the very idea of relying on pharmaceuticals… rather alarming. Are you suggesting I am unwell? Because I assure you, I am in excellent health.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Marija. I'm simply covering all bases. Vitamin C is fine, good even. And you’ve certainly made it clear you're in good health. One last thing before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Thankfully, I am not afflicted with such sensitivities. I can eat anything, take anything… though, as I’ve stated, I have no need to take anything. I find the modern obsession with identifying potential allergens… rather excessive. Are you quite finished with these… interrogations, Doctor? I believe we’ve established that I am perfectly healthy and capable, and simply wish to ensure my affairs are in order.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, you’ve certainly made that clear. I apologize if my questions felt excessive. It's just my habit to be thorough. Now, let’s talk about what you’re hoping to accomplish with these Advance Directives and POLST forms. Do you have any specific wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. I want it unequivocally stated that I do not wish to be kept alive artificially. No machines, no feeding tubes, no prolonged interventions. Should I reach a point where there is no reasonable hope of recovery, I want my wishes respected. I want to be allowed to… pass with dignity. I understand this may be difficult for some to accept, but I have given this considerable thought. I do not wish to be a burden, nor do I wish to linger in a state of… diminished capacity. It is a simple request, really. Respect my autonomy.
DOCTOR: That's very clear, Marija. And a very reasonable request. We’ll certainly document that thoroughly. To be absolutely precise, do you have any preferences regarding resuscitation?
PATIENT: Resuscitation? Doctor, are you suggesting there is a scenario in which my life could be… resuscitated? I find that rather… unsettling. No. Absolutely not. I do not wish to be subjected to CPR, electric shocks, or any other invasive procedures in an attempt to prolong my life beyond a reasonable point. I want to be allowed to… transition peacefully. And I want it clearly stated that no extraordinary measures should be taken. Is that understood? I want to be comfortable, not… tortured in the name of prolonging the inevitable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Marija. No resuscitation. We will document that explicitly. Now, we need to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. Have you already chosen someone?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My husband, Jean-Pierre… he is adequate, as I said. But he lacks… conviction. He is easily swayed by others. I suppose he would be the logical choice, but I have reservations. He wouldn’t necessarily… advocate for my wishes, should they conflict with the opinions of… others. He tends to defer to… authority. It's… frustrating. I haven't formally designated anyone, precisely because of this dilemma. He’s… available, but not necessarily the best choice. Perhaps we can discuss the implications of that further. It’s a… delicate matter. I simply want someone who will uphold my autonomy, without question. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Marija. It’s important to choose someone you truly trust, and who understands and respects your wishes. We can certainly discuss the implications of choosing someone who may be easily swayed. We can also explore the possibility of designating an alternate proxy, or outlining very specific instructions to minimize ambiguity. Perhaps we can take a moment to consider this further. We don’t need to make a decision right away. Let's move on to the physical assessment, and then we can return to the proxy discussion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. A physical assessment. How… undignified. But if it is necessary… proceed. Though I must warn you, I maintain a very strict regimen. I expect a… thorough, yet discreet, examination. And please, no unnecessary probing. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. It’s simply… a formality, as far as I am concerned. But let us get it over with, quickly. I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Of course, Marija. A quick and discreet examination. Just standard procedure to get a baseline understanding of your health. We’ll keep it as brief and comfortable as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I fail to see the relevance. I assure you, my heart and lungs are in perfect working order. I maintain a rigorous exercise schedule. And I’ve never smoked a day in my life. It’s… wasteful, frankly. And quite uncouth. Proceed. But quickly. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Marija, though your rate is a little fast. And your lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Very well. But do be gentle. I have… sensitive skin. And please, do not linger. This is becoming increasingly… tedious. I trust you are a professional, and will not require an extended period to… assess my perfectly healthy arm.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Marija – 140 over 90. It's not dramatically high, but something we should be aware of. Now, let’s just briefly check your reflexes. Could you please relax your legs?
PATIENT: Elevated? That is… unacceptable. I maintain a very strict diet and exercise regimen. I do not understand how my blood pressure could be elevated. Perhaps your equipment is faulty? And I find the notion of… prodding my legs… rather undignified. Are you quite finished? I believe you have gathered sufficient data to confirm my excellent health. This entire process is… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Marija. It’s possible there was a slight elevation due to anxiety from the examination itself. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem. As for your legs, it’s just a quick reflex check, to ensure your nervous system is functioning properly. It’s a standard part of the assessment. If you’re truly uncomfortable, we can skip it. But it would give me a more complete picture of your health. Would you prefer to proceed, or shall we move on?
PATIENT: Very well. Proceed. But quickly, and gently. I assure you, my reflexes are perfectly intact. I maintain an active lifestyle, as I've stated repeatedly. But let us get this over with, quickly. I have a luncheon appointment, and I am already running late. This entire ordeal is… most inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are present, Marija, but a little diminished. Again, not necessarily cause for concern, but something to note. Alright, that completes the physical assessment. Everything appears generally healthy, but your blood pressure and reflexes are slightly off. We’ll need to discuss this further. Before we do that, let’s revisit the healthcare proxy. Do you have any initial thoughts after this discussion?
PATIENT: Frankly, this entire examination has been… unsettling. To discover these… anomalies, after maintaining a rigorous lifestyle for decades… it is… disheartening. It confirms my suspicions that something is amiss. And it reinforces my reluctance to designate Jean-Pierre as my healthcare proxy. If I am exhibiting these… deficiencies, he would be utterly incapable of making informed decisions. He would simply defer to… others. No, this entire situation requires careful consideration. I believe I need time to… reflect on this matter. And perhaps consult with another physician. To confirm these… findings. This is… most concerning. I don’t believe I am prepared to discuss this further today. .
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Marija. It's perfectly reasonable to want a second opinion, and to take the time to consider your options. I can provide you with a referral to another physician, if you’d like. Here’s a summary of what we discussed today. We talked about your wishes for Advance Directives and POLST forms, and the importance of designating a healthcare proxy. We completed a physical assessment, which revealed slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes. And we agreed that you’d like to seek a second opinion before making any decisions about your healthcare proxy. I’ll prepare this summary for your records. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today, Marija. Take care.
