DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… coughing up some blood. It worries me. Not a lot, but enough to make me want to get it checked.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly something we want to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started maybe… a week ago? At first, it was just a tiny bit, like a streak in the… phlegm, I think that’s the word? Now, it’s a little more, but not a lot. It’s… bright red. And it usually happens when I cough first thing in the morning. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Bright red blood, particularly with the first cough of the morning, is helpful information. And it's been occurring for about a week now, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a week. I… I don’t know if it’s getting worse, exactly. Sometimes there’s more, sometimes less. It’s hard to tell. And… I haven’t felt sick, really. No fever, no chills, just… the blood. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you haven’t experienced fever or chills. While any amount of blood in your cough warrants investigation, the absence of systemic symptoms is encouraging. It’s also perfectly understandable that it's hard to gauge whether it's worsening—fluctuations can occur. To get a more complete picture, could you describe any other symptoms you've noticed?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I also… lost my husband last year. So, I thought it was just that. No chest pain, no shortness of breath. And… no weight loss. I eat okay.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Ms. Weichers. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, including fatigue. It’s important we consider all possibilities. So, to clarify, you’ve noticed increased fatigue, but no chest pain, shortness of breath, or unintentional weight loss. Now, have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone with a cough or respiratory illness?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t traveled anywhere. And… no, not that I know of. I mostly stay at home. I work from home as a… physical therapist. So, I don't see many people. My patients come to me. Everyone I’ve seen has been healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Working from home limits your exposure, which is helpful. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I had pneumonia when I was a child, a very long time ago. But… that was many years ago. And I haven’t had any problems since. No asthma, no bronchitis… just the pneumonia when I was little. I don’t take any medications regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Not ever, as far as I can remember. I’ve been very lucky, I think. Maybe that’s why I’m so worried now! It feels… strange to have something wrong.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly natural to be concerned when something new arises, especially with a history of good health. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of lung disease, tuberculosis, or bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he died of a heart attack. I don’t think anyone in my family had lung problems, or tuberculosis… or anything like that. My mother’s side was Japanese, and my father’s was… mostly German. I don’t know much about their families, honestly. They didn’t talk about it much. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and a history of heart attack are good to know. And the lack of known lung disease or bleeding disorders in the family is also relevant. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I have never smoked. And I don’t drink alcohol either, except maybe a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Very rarely. And I don’t do any recreational drugs. I’m very healthy, Doctor, I promise! I just… have this blood. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion, Ms. Weichers. And it’s good to hear about your healthy lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a closer look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your lungs with my stethoscope, both front and back. Take deep, slow breaths for me, please. Okay. I hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs. It’s subtle, but present. No crackles or other abnormal sounds at this time. Heart sounds are regular, normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Your throat appears clear, no obvious signs of infection or inflammation. Mild bilateral wheezing, regular heart sounds, clear throat. Now, given your history of coughing up blood, even with the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms, and the mild wheezing I detected, I would like to order a chest X-ray to further evaluate your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please. A chest X-ray sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on. Will it tell us something?
DOCTOR: Yes, a chest X-ray will give us a much clearer picture of your lungs. It can help us identify any potential causes for the blood you're coughing up, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, or other abnormalities. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure. I'm going to have my nurse draw some blood for a complete blood count as well. This will help rule out any infection or other underlying conditions. I will also order a sputum sample for analysis. Could you please collect a sample of your sputum—that is, the phlegm you cough up—when you cough first thing in the morning tomorrow, and bring it with you when you come back?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. First thing in the morning. I will collect the… sputum. How will I… keep it? Is there a special container? I don’t want to do it wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. The nurse will provide you with a sterile container before you leave today. She’ll also give you instructions on how to collect and store the sample properly. It’s important to collect it as soon as you wake up, before you brush your teeth or eat anything. The container is designed to keep it preserved until we can analyze it. We’ll get the X-ray scheduled for tomorrow as well. After we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good. X-ray tomorrow, collect the sputum… and then a follow-up. Thank you, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we are doing something. I was very worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I understand your worry, and I’m glad we can work together to figure this out. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… thank you again. It’s been very reassuring. I will collect the sputum tomorrow, and I will come for the X-ray.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could ease your mind. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the sputum collection and schedule your X-ray. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns arise before your follow-up appointment. Have a good rest of your day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. Goodbye.
