DOCTOR: Hi Smith, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. I think… my daughter, she wants to have a baby. And she said I should come talk to someone first? She said something about… making sure everything is okay, before… before it happens. I don’t really understand all of it. I just want to… help her, you know? And make sure I'm okay too, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, Smith, that’s perfectly reasonable. It’s great that you’re being proactive about this, and your daughter is smart to suggest a check-up. It sounds like she’s thinking about starting a family, and you’re wanting to make sure you're healthy enough to be a supportive grandparent, if that's what happens. Let's start with you. I want to get a good picture of your overall health. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, a grandparent… that would be nice. Yes, nice. Um… regularly? Not… not really, no. It’s been… a long time. Years, I think. I used to, when I was younger, for work, you know? Sales Engineers… they wanted me to be healthy for traveling. But then… things changed. I mostly just… tried to stay out of trouble. Is that a good answer? I don't remember much about it, honestly. I think I had a check-up maybe ten years ago? But I can’t be sure.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Smith. It's good you’re here now. Ten years ago is a bit of a gap, but we can definitely get you up to speed. Okay, so we'll do a pretty thorough check-up today. To start, can you tell me about any major medical problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Major problems… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a very long time ago. And… oh, I broke my arm once, falling off a bicycle. Does that count? I had… some trouble with my heart, I think. A long time ago, when I was working too hard. The doctors told me to slow down, but… well, Sales Engineers don’t really slow down, do they? I don’t remember much about what they said. It wasn't too bad, I don't think. Nothing serious. I think. It was a long time ago. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine, Smith. You're doing great, just tell me what you remember. So, appendix removed as a child, broken arm… and some heart trouble when you were working. That's helpful to know. Do you remember what kind of heart trouble it was?
PATIENT: No, no, I don't. I really don’t. Just… they said my heart was beating too fast, maybe? And they told me to take it easy. I think they gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them after a while. They made me feel… funny. I don’t remember the doctor’s name, or what they said exactly. It was a different doctor, a long time ago. Everything is… blurry, you know? I just remember being tired a lot. And worried. But it wasn’t… life-threatening, I don't think. I kept working. Sales Engineers have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart palpitations at some point, treated with medication you stopped taking due to side effects. We’ll definitely want to investigate that a bit further today. Now, besides the heart, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. High blood… pressure? Maybe. I think the doctor mentioned something about that, a long time ago. But I don’t remember being told to take any pills for it. And… cholesterol? No, I don’t think so. I eat… mostly normal food, I guess. Not a lot of sweets. My daughter, she always tells me to eat more fruit. I try to, but… it’s hard. I don’t remember ever being told I had any of those problems, but… I could be wrong. Everything is so long ago. I really don’t know. Sorry. It’s like… my head is full of cotton wool.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Smith. We'll sort through everything. So, potential history of high blood pressure, but no specific diagnosis or treatment you recall. We'll check that today. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any major medical problems that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family… hmm. My father, he had… problems with his stomach, I think. He got very sick when he was old. He died when I was young. My mother… she lived a long time, but she got very frail at the end. She had… trouble with her bones, I think. Lots of falls. And… my sister, she had some kind of… trouble with her nerves, maybe? She was always a bit… delicate. I don’t really know much about what they had, to be honest. We didn’t talk about those things much. It was… a different time, you know? They didn’t really explain things like they do now. And I… I didn’t ask. I was young. And busy, with work. Sales Engineers… always busy. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It's all very blurry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Smith. You've given me a good starting point. So, father with stomach problems, mother with frailty and potential bone issues, and sister with nerve problems. That gives us something to consider. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you ever smoked, or used tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoked? Yes… yes, I used to. When I was younger. With my friends. It was… normal, then. Everyone smoked. I stopped… oh, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago? I don't remember exactly. It was… bad for my health, my wife told me. She didn’t like it. I stopped for her. She’s… gone now. But yes, I used to smoke. Not much, but… enough. I don’t really think about it much anymore. It’s a bad habit. Sales Engineers try not to have bad habits. Well, try. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm rambling. Sorry. Everything is just… a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Smith. Twenty years since you stopped smoking is excellent. And you're not rambling at all. It's good you're sharing this with me. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… yes, I used to. A little bit. With dinner, sometimes. A glass of wine. Or a beer. Not much, never too much. My wife liked a glass of wine with dinner too. We… enjoyed it. I don’t really drink much now. Not since… she’s gone. It doesn’t taste very good anymore. It reminds me… of things. So, no, I don't really drink. Not anymore. Just… sometimes, a little sip. When I’m feeling sad. Is that… bad? Sales Engineers aren’t supposed to be sad, I guess. I’m sorry, I’m just… talking too much. Everything is a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're not talking too much at all, Smith. It’s good you’re being so open with me. It sounds like you had a good relationship with your wife. A little bit of alcohol occasionally isn’t a concern. Okay, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Not that I know of. I never really had any problems. I took some pills for my heart, a long time ago, but I don't remember having any reaction to them. I can eat… most things. My daughter, she’s a bit… picky. But I can eat anything. I don't think I’m allergic to anything. Not that I know of. But… I could be wrong. It’s been a long time. My head is… a bit foggy. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm just… repeating myself. Sorry. Everything is just… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: You're not repeating yourself, Smith. And you’re doing great. Okay, so no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No, I’m not taking anything. Not right now. I stopped taking the pills for my heart a long time ago. I don’t really… bother with vitamins or supplements. My daughter, she tries to give me some, but I forget to take them. Or I lose them. I just… don’t really bother. No, nothing. Not a thing. Just… getting older, I guess. Is that… bad? Sales Engineers aren’t supposed to get old, either. I’m sorry, I’m rambling again. Everything is just… a bit overwhelming. I feel like I’m wasting your time.
DOCTOR: You're not wasting my time at all, Smith. You’re providing me with important information, and I appreciate you being so open with me. Okay, so no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. It’s… good to know someone is looking after me. I haven’t really… been looked after in a while. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For my daughter. She’s… very important to me. Whatever you need to do, just… let me know. Sales Engineers… we’re used to taking orders. I’m sorry, I’m just… a bit nervous. Everything is just… a bit overwhelming. But yes, go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Smith. I appreciate that. It sounds like you have a wonderful daughter. We’ll take things slowly. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Okay, blood pressure is 140 over 85. That’s a little elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. We’ll need to investigate that further with an EKG and possibly an echocardiogram. Lungs sound clear. No wheezing or crackles. Ears look normal. Throat is clear, but slightly dry. Abdomen is soft, with no tenderness. I don’t feel any masses. Reflexes are normal. Okay, Smith. That’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems generally okay, but there are a few things we need to investigate further, like the elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur. I will order some blood tests, an EKG, and an echocardiogram to get a better picture of things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, EKG… I trust your judgment. It doesn’t really matter to me. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For my daughter. And… I suppose, for myself too. A heart murmur… that doesn’t sound good, does it? But if it needs looking at, then… let’s look at it. Whatever you need, just… let me know. I just… hope it’s not too serious. Is it serious? I don’t mean to be… difficult. I just… get worried, sometimes. Everything is just… a bit overwhelming. But yes, do whatever you think is best. I trust you.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be worried, Smith. And you’re not difficult at all. A heart murmur doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Many people have innocent heart murmurs that don’t require any treatment. But it’s important to investigate it, just to be sure. The echocardiogram will give us a much clearer picture of your heart’s structure and function. We’ll also check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels with the blood tests. I will get the orders in for the tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. After the tests, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. Blood tests, follow-up appointment… whatever you need. I’ll just… go to the lab, then? Just down the hall? That’s… easy enough. I hope they don’t… poke me too much. I’m not very good with needles. But if it’s necessary, then… I’ll manage. Just… let me know if there’s anything I need to do. Fasting, or… anything like that? I just… want to make sure I do it right. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For my daughter. And… for myself too. Is there anything else I need to know? I just… get worried, sometimes. Everything is just… a bit overwhelming. But yes, I’ll go to the lab. Whatever you need. I trust you.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Smith. And you won't have to worry about fasting. You can eat and drink normally before the blood tests. And they're very skilled at drawing blood; it should be quick and relatively painless. Here's the form for the lab. Just take this to the front desk, and they’ll direct you to the lab. After the tests, they’ll let me know when the results are available. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss everything. Do you have any questions for me right now before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… I think I’m a bit… overwhelmed. I just… want to get this all over with. For my daughter. And… for myself too. I just… hope everything is okay. But I trust you. You seem… very competent. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For my daughter. I just… I think I’ll just go to the lab, then. Get it all over with. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. I just… want to make sure everything is okay. For my daughter. Yes, I think I’ll just go now. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Smith. And please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Take care, and don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
