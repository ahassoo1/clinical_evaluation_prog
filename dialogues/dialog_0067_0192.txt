DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It's August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. I’m here for… the army thing. The exam. Gotta get it done, you know? Don’t have time for messing around.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Hartness. The pre-employment physical for the army. I understand. We want to make sure everything is in order so you can move forward without any issues. To start, can you tell me a little bit more about what specifically the army requires for this exam?
PATIENT: What do you mean, what they require? I just got a list. A long list. Weights, heights, can I see colors, can I hear… normal stuff. They didn’t explain why they need all this, just that they do. Seems like a waste of time, honestly. I’m perfectly healthy. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Hartness. It can be annoying when things aren’t clearly explained. The army has specific standards to ensure recruits are medically fit for duty and to minimize risks during training and service. It’s a comprehensive exam for good reason. Let’s go through the list together. It will be easier if I ask questions directly. First, I see your height is listed as 187 centimeters and your weight as 53 kilograms. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Fifty-three? No. No, that’s… wrong. Terribly wrong. It’s eighty-three. Eighty-three kilos. I’m a thin man, yes, but not that thin. Someone messed up the paperwork. I'd be surprised if I could even stand at fifty-three kilos.
DOCTOR: You are right to question that, Mr. Hartness. That is a significant error. Eighty-three kilograms is much more plausible given your height. I'll make a note to correct that immediately. Thank you for pointing that out. Now, besides the weight discrepancy, are there any other details on the form you believe might be incorrect?
PATIENT: Well… it says “not insured”. That’s… true. Never bothered with it, to be honest. But it doesn’t need to be on here, does it? I’m not asking for a check-up on the national health, just passing a test. Seems a bit personal, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question it, Mr. Hartness. It shouldn’t be necessary for this exam, but sometimes these forms have fields that aren't strictly required. I’ll flag that as well. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? No. Never. I’ve had the odd cold, maybe. A sprained ankle when I was a boy, climbing trees. But nothing a bit of rest didn’t fix. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, I honestly can’t remember. Don’t need ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I keep myself fit. Working with machines, you need to be sharp. Can’t be laid up in a bed, can you? Honestly, Doctor, is this all just routine? I’ve got things to do, you know. This is taking up my whole morning.
DOCTOR: It is largely routine, Mr. Hartness, but it's important to be thorough to ensure everything is as it should be for your service. We need to rule out anything that might be a concern. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history? Good grief. That’s… a long story. My father… he was a strong man. Worked in the shipyard. Bit of a cough towards the end, but shipyard work does that to you. My mother… she always complained about her joints, but old age, you know? Grandparents… long gone. I barely remember them. Is this really important?
DOCTOR: I understand it can feel like a lot of questions, Mr. Hartness. Family history can sometimes give us clues about potential risks, even if you haven’t experienced any problems yourself. It’s not meant to be intrusive, just to gather as much information as possible. Let’s try this: has anyone in your family had any problems with their heart, lungs, or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had something with his lungs. Smoked like a chimney, that one. Couldn't stop. Ended up… not well. Besides that… honestly, I don’t keep up with all that family nonsense. They all live so far away. Can we get on with the actual exam now? I feel perfectly fine, and I'd like to be on my way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. We can move on to the physical exam. I understand your frustration and want to get this done efficiently. First, let’s check your vital signs. I’ll measure your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… don’t take too long. And don’t poke me too much. Get on with it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your lungs sound clear, and your heart sounds regular. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can see it. Perfectly clear. Always have good eyesight. Useful when working with small parts, you know. Are we nearly done?
DOCTOR: Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Your ears appear clear. Your nose and throat look normal. No signs of infection or inflammation. Next, I’ll listen to your abdomen. Please lie flat on your back.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. This is ridiculous. I'm perfectly healthy. You're going to find nothing. Absolutely nothing. Hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, and I hear normal bowel sounds. No tenderness to palpation. I’m going to check your reflexes now. Please relax your legs.
PATIENT: Ow! Hey! What was that for? I told you, I'm perfectly fine! Stop poking me! This is a complete waste of time. Absolutely pointless. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, please. I understand your frustration, but this is a necessary part of the exam. I’m just checking to ensure everything is functioning properly. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. I still need to check your range of motion and assess your musculoskeletal system. It will only take a few minutes. Can you stand up and try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Touch my toes? At my age? Don’t be ridiculous. I haven't been able to touch my toes in years. I’m not a gymnast! This is… this is insulting! There. Happy? Now can I please go? I have things to do, you know. Important things. Not wasting my time in a doctor’s office. This is enough. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I see your limitations. I’m going to stop here with the physical exam. However, given your age and the fact you haven’t seen a doctor in many years, I strongly recommend a follow-up with your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation. I also recommend a chest X-ray, given your uncle’s history of lung problems. Would you be open to discussing those options?
