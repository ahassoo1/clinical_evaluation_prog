DOCTOR: Good morning, Oreste. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor, huh? Yeah… well, I been feelin’… short of breath. Like I can’t get enough air. And my mouth… always dry. Eyes too. Feels like the desert in here, almost. Not good, not good at all. Don't remember when it started, exactly. A while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes… that is uncomfortable. And you said it’s been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: A while… like I said. It’s… it comes and goes. Not always bad, but lately… worse. Even just walkin’ to the mailbox, sometimes. Used to be nothin’ to it. Now… wheeze a little. And feel tired after. It's just… gettin’ old, I reckon. Things just stop workin’ right, you know? Used to be strong, worked on cars all day. Now... Forget it. It’s old age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out, regardless. Even if it is just part of getting older, we want to make sure there isn’t something else going on that we can help with. When you're walking to the mailbox and feeling short of breath, does anything specifically seem to trigger it, like hills, or hot weather?
PATIENT: Hot weather… yeah, maybe. Seems worse when it’s real humid. And hills… don't go up hills much anymore. Too much effort. Used to be nothin', but now… no. No hills. Just walkin’. Sometimes even sittin’ still, I feel like I gotta… take a deep breath. Like somethin’s pressin’ on my chest, almost. Not a pain, just… uncomfortable. This dry mouth ain’t helpin’ none, either. Makes it harder to breathe, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like it happens with exertion, and maybe is worse in humid weather, and you also notice it sometimes even at rest. And you're right, a dry mouth can definitely make breathing feel more difficult. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I don't think so. I wear socks most of the time, you know? Hard to tell. Maybe a little? But I got these old work boots… they're kinda tight. Always have been. It could just be the boots. I ain’t looked at my feet real close lately. Why would my feet swell? Is somethin' bad happenin'?
DOCTOR: It's good you ask. Swelling in the feet can sometimes be a sign of fluid build-up, which can be related to breathing problems. It’s just something I ask about routinely. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor told me somethin’ once. Years ago. Gave me some pills. Don’t think I took ‘em much. Didn't feel sick, you know? Didn't see the point. And diabetes…? No, never heard nothin’ about that. Heart… I used to be strong as an ox, workin’ on those cars. Never had no trouble with my heart. I go to the dentist regular, though. Does that count? Old man needs his teeth fixed.
DOCTOR: That’s good you go to the dentist! And it's okay that you didn’t take the blood pressure pills if you weren’t feeling sick at the time, but it’s good to know about it now. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… once. Long time ago. Broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin’ a mango tree. Silly thing to do, lookin’ back. Had to get it set. That’s about it, though. Never been a sick man. Just bumps and bruises, you know? Workin’ with cars, you get a few scrapes. Nothing serious. Don't remember bein’ in the hospital for nothin’ else. Old age is gonna get me before anythin’ else, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. My mother… she got sick when she was old. Real sick. Bedridden for a long time. I don’t remember exactly what it was, though. Old age, probably. My father… he worked too hard. Always workin’. Never took a day off. He just… stopped one day. Heart, I think. Maybe. Nobody really talked about it much. We weren't a talkin’ family, you know? Just did things. Didn't sit around complainin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some illness with your mother and potentially heart issues with your father. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications…? Let me think. Not much. I take a little somethin’ for my knees, sometimes. Hurts when it rains, you know? Old injury. And… oh, yeah. I take a vitamin D pill. Doctor told me to. Said I wasn't gettin' enough sun. That's about it. Just the vitamin and the knee pills when it hurts. I think. Maybe. It's hard to keep track, you know? Old age… forgetful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a vitamin D supplement and something for your knees when they’re bothering you. We’ll make a list to be sure. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Nah, not that I know of. Never had no trouble with nothin'. Eat pretty much anything. Used to eat mangoes right off the tree as a kid. Never had a reaction. Maybe a little heartburn sometimes, if I eat somethin’ spicy. But that's not an allergy, is it? Just old age, probably. Stomach ain't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn't an allergy. Okay, that's good to know. Now, before we do a quick exam, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Well, I mostly sit around these days. Watchin’ TV, listenin’ to music. Used to be busy, workin’ on cars all day. Now… not so much. I walk to the mailbox sometimes, like I said. And I try to get out in the sun when I can, for that vitamin D. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much anymore. Just a beer now and then, if I’m feelin’ social. Mostly just… quiet. Old age, you know? Not much energy for wild livin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly quiet these days, with some light activity. That’s good information. Alright, Oreste, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, go ahead. Whatever you need to do. Just gettin’ old, you know? Don’t expect nothin’ fancy. Do what you gotta do, Doctor. Just try not to take too long, okay? This chair ain't the most comfortable thing in the world.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ll be quick. Okay, taking a listen to your lungs… I’m noticing they sound a little quieter than usual, but I don’t hear any wheezing right now. Your heart sounds regular, but a little soft. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 145 over 85. Ears look good, and your throat is a little dry, but nothing concerning. And I'm noticing a little bit of swelling in your ankles. Alright, everything seems… within normal limits, but there are a few things I want to investigate further. The diminished breath sounds, elevated blood pressure and mild ankle swelling make me think we should do a chest X-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work…? Oh, boy. Sounds serious. What are you lookin' for? Is somethin' bad happenin'? I ain’t been sick in years. Just gettin' old, right? That's all it is? X-ray sounds… expensive. And I hate needles. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. Do what you gotta do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick about it, okay? This whole thing is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Oreste. It's not necessarily serious, but it's best to be thorough. The X-ray will help us see what's happening in your lungs, and the blood work will give us some information about your overall health and rule out any potential infections or other issues. We're looking to see if there's any congestion in your lungs, and the blood work will tell us about your kidney function, and help us rule out things like anemia or infection. I'll order those tests now, and the nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. It's just a small sample, and it’ll be over quickly. As for the X-ray, we can do that right here in the clinic, it won't take long at all. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a medication to help with the dry mouth, as that’s something we can address right away. It’s a simple mouthwash. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Mouthwash… yeah, that sounds good. Anything to get rid of this dryness. It's awful. Blood work… X-ray… alright. Do what you gotta do. I guess it's better to know, right? Even if it ain't good news. Just… try to be quick, okay? And don't charge me too much. Old man on a fixed income, you know? I just want to feel normal again. That's all.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Oreste. We’ll keep the costs as low as possible, and we’ll discuss all the options with you before moving forward with any further testing or treatment. I'll make a note of your fixed income. Okay, the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once we have the results of the blood work and X-ray, we can discuss them in detail and create a plan to get you feeling better. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and get some rest. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be right here, and we’ll figure this out together. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's it. Just… gettin' old, you know? It's a slow process. Thank you, Doctor. For listenin’ to me, and for not laughin’ at an old man complainin’. Just… try to be quick with the blood work, okay? And tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins ain’t what they used to be. That's all. Just… thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Oreste. I’m glad you came in. And don't worry, I'll make sure the nurse is very gentle with the blood draw. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll let her know you’re ready, and I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Thank you for trusting me with your health.
