DOCTOR: Good morning, Maribeth. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you as well. I’m here because I have trouble breathing when I lie down flat. It started… well, a few weeks ago, I suppose. It’s rather inconvenient, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Maribeth. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Trouble breathing can be concerning. A few weeks ago… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn’t sudden, you understand. It just… gradually became harder to get a good breath when I’m trying to sleep. I used to sleep on my back, perfectly fine. Now? I have to pile up pillows, quite a few, to be comfortable. And even then, sometimes it doesn’t help. It wakes me up, too. It's very disruptive.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s progressively gotten worse, requiring more and more pillows to lie comfortably, and it’s even waking you up at night. Do you experience any shortness of breath when you aren't lying down, like when you're walking or doing everyday activities?
PATIENT: No, not really. Walking is fine. Cleaning, fine. Even a bit of gardening, though I don’t do as much of that these days… it doesn’t bother me. It’s only when I’m lying flat. That’s what’s so peculiar about it, don't you think? It doesn't make any sense to me why it would be just then.
DOCTOR: It is specific, which is helpful to know. And you're right, it's good we're pinpointing that. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the trouble breathing when you lie down?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Sometimes my ankles feel a little swollen at the end of the day, but I always thought that was just from being on my feet too long. And perhaps a bit of… fatigue, but I’m seventy-one years old, Doctor. A bit of tiredness is to be expected, wouldn’t you agree? I don’t know if that's related.
DOCTOR: You’re right, fatigue can certainly be common at any age. And ankle swelling… that’s good information to have as well. Now, let's get a bit more background. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some medicine, and it’s been controlled for years. And… oh. My gallbladder, many years ago. They took it out. Other than that, not much. I’ve been generally quite healthy, if I may say so. I try to eat well and stay active.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal years ago. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. I take Lisinopril, twenty milligrams, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I’ll take Ibuprofen. Just when I need it, you understand. Not regularly. I have a list here, if you’d like to see it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Maribeth. That’s helpful. Lisinopril 20mg daily, Ibuprofen as needed… and any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with penicillin, or any of that. I’ve eaten shellfish my whole life, and I’m fine. My daughter always worried I would have a reaction, but I never have. I don’t believe in allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had heart trouble, towards the end of her life. She needed a pacemaker. And my father… he had diabetes. He wasn't very good about taking care of himself, unfortunately. Other than that, not much that I can recall. My siblings were both quite healthy, until… well, they’re both gone now, so it doesn’t much matter, does it?
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your siblings. It does matter, Maribeth, to have that information. Heart trouble in your mother and diabetes in your father are important to note. And finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, for a long time, but I always made him go outside. I didn’t approve. And… I don’t drink either. A sip of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a special occasion, but that's it. I’ve always been a very… temperate person.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No smoking or regular alcohol use. Okay, Maribeth, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed. I just want to get this sorted out, if you understand. It’s rather disruptive to my sleep, you know. I need my rest.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get started. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. This might feel a little cool. Please take slow, deep breaths for me. Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise regular. Lungs sound reasonably clear, though I do hear some mild diminished breath sounds at the bases. Now, let me check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 150/90, which is a little elevated. And finally, let me take a look at your ankles. There’s a little bit of swelling in your ankles, and I can see some mild pitting edema when I press on them. Okay, Maribeth. Everything seems to be pointing towards possible heart failure. The shortness of breath when lying flat, the ankle swelling, the elevated blood pressure, and the diminished breath sounds all suggest that your heart may not be pumping as efficiently as it should. However, we'll need some further testing to confirm this.
PATIENT: Heart… failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I thought it might just be… my age. What sort of testing? And what does this mean? I’ve always been so careful… I eat well, I don’t smoke…
DOCTOR: It is serious, but it doesn't necessarily mean things are dire. It simply means your heart isn't pumping blood as efficiently as it could be. It's often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. And you're right, you have been very careful about your health, and that's a good starting point. We need to run a few tests to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart, a chest X-ray to see the size and shape of your heart and lungs, and a blood test called a BNP, which can help us determine if heart failure is present. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An EKG… a chest X-ray… and a blood test. Yes, alright. If you think it’s necessary. Though I must admit, I don’t like the sound of it. Is it painful? And how long will it take? I have a luncheon with the garden club next Tuesday, and… well, I promised to bring my famous zucchini bread.
DOCTOR: No, none of them are painful at all. The EKG is completely non-invasive; we just place some small stickers on your chest and arms to measure the electrical activity of your heart. The chest X-ray is quick—you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. And the blood test is just a small sample taken from your arm. We can get the results back fairly quickly—usually within a few days. We should have everything back by next Tuesday, so it shouldn’t interfere with your luncheon. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. Then, we'll schedule the EKG and chest X-ray for later this week. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. Later this week is fine. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the luncheon. And the nurse can draw the blood now, I suppose. Though I do hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I’ve always been a bit faint at the sight of needles. And please, don't tell the garden club anything yet. I wouldn’t want to worry them.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll make sure the nurse is aware you're a little anxious about needles, and she’ll be as gentle as possible. And of course, I won't mention anything to the garden club. I'll step out now while the nurse comes in to draw your blood. I’ll be right back after that, and we can discuss the next steps. Just let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
