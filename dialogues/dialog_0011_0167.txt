DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Emiliano. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… my foot, see? It’s been… bothering me. A sore, it is. A bad sore that won’t get better. It hurts to walk, even a little.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. A sore on your foot that's not healing, and causing you pain with walking. I understand. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this sore?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. It's on the bottom of my foot, near my toes. It started… maybe a month ago? Small, it was. I didn’t think much of it at first. But it got bigger, and now… it’s red and… kinda deep. Hurts when I put weight on it. I try to wear slippers all the time now. Is that alright? I don’t know what else to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. Slippers are a good idea to protect it. A month ago, starting small and now red and deep, causing pain with weight-bearing… that gives me some initial information. Could you describe the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… it’s not a sharp pain, not like stepping on glass. More of a… dull ache, most of the time. But when I try to walk too much, it gets worse. Like a throbbing, you know? And sometimes, at night, it feels… warm. Not fever warm, but… warmer than the rest of my foot. Does that make sense? I don’t know if I’m explaining it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Emiliano. A dull ache that worsens with walking, throbbing, and a sensation of warmth – that's helpful. Now, have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Hmm… let me think. … Sometimes, after I shower, I see a little bit of… wetness. Not a lot. And it’s… kinda clear, I think. Not like… yellow pus, like you see on the TV. Just a little bit of clear fluid. It doesn't smell, if that matters. I wipe it up right away, so I don't really look at it too closely. Sorry, I don't know much about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emiliano, no need to apologize. A little bit of clear fluid, no odor – that's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or problems with your circulation?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The doctor told me… many years ago, about my sugar. Diabetes, he called it. I try to eat right, not too much sweets. And I take pills, every day. I forget sometimes, but mostly I remember. And my feet… they sometimes feel cold. Like you said, circulation. Not always, but often. Is that… bad? I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time, other than for a checkup now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes and some circulation issues, that's important information. And you take medication for the diabetes, but sometimes forget – I appreciate you telling me that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious injuries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. … I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a mango tree. But that was a long time ago. And I had my appendix taken out, when I was young. Other than that… nothing, I think. No serious injuries. Just… little bumps and bruises here and there. Nothing major. I've been pretty lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a child and an appendectomy. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the ones for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think… … There's the diabetes pills, of course. And… ah, yes. The doctor gave me something for my blood pressure, a few years ago. I take those sometimes, when I remember. And… that’s it, I think. Just those two. I don't take anything for pain, usually. I just try to rest my foot when it hurts too much. Is it alright if I show you the bottles?
DOCTOR: Yes, please do, Emiliano. That would be very helpful.
PATIENT: These are the ones for my sugar. And these… the little white ones… are for my blood pressure. The doctor said to take them if I feel dizzy, or if my head hurts. He didn't say how many, exactly. Just… when I need them. I don't always remember everything he says. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Emiliano. I appreciate you bringing those in. I see you're taking Metformin for your diabetes, and Amlodipine for your blood pressure, as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Nothing that I know of. I eat all kinds of food. Sometimes my stomach gets upset, but that’s just because I eat too much, I think. And… no, I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to any medicine. I've never had to go to the hospital for allergies. I think I’m pretty lucky that way too. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Emiliano. No known allergies is good to know. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on with your foot, I'd like to take a look at it. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That’s what I came here for. Please, have a look. It hurts a little, but I can handle it. Just be gentle, okay? It’s been bothering me for a long time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. I will be as gentle as possible. I see a sore on the bottom of your foot, near your toes. It is approximately 1.5 centimeters in diameter, red, and appears slightly deeper than the surrounding skin. There’s a small amount of clear fluid present. When I press on it, you flinch, indicating some tenderness. Your pulses are present, but slightly diminished in your foot. Your skin feels warm to the touch. Based on my examination, it appears you may have a developing ulcer, likely exacerbated by your diabetes and potentially some circulation issues. It’s important we address this promptly to prevent it from worsening. Now, do you have any numbness or tingling in your foot?
PATIENT: Oh dear. An ulcer… that doesn’t sound good. No, not really numbness… but sometimes it feels… prickly. Like little needles. Not all the time, just… when I walk a lot. And sometimes, at night, when I can't sleep, it feels… cold, even with socks on. It's hard to explain. Is that the prickly feeling you mean? It doesn't hurt all the time, but it's… unpleasant. Like my foot is… asleep, but not really. It's been getting worse, I think. Is it serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: The prickly sensation and coldness you’re describing is consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which is nerve damage often caused by diabetes. The fact that it's worsening is concerning, and it’s good you brought this to my attention. We need to take a few steps to properly evaluate this and ensure we address it effectively. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar control and assess your kidney function. I'd also recommend a nerve conduction study to determine the extent of the nerve damage and a vascular study to evaluate the blood flow to your foot. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: Oh my. So many tests… Blood tests… I understand. They take blood, right? I don't like needles, but I can handle it. Nerve conduction… and vascular… what do those do exactly? Are they painful? I just want to make sure this doesn't get worse, like you said. My wife… she passed away last year. I don’t want to end up… unable to walk. Is that… likely? I'm sorry, I'm just a little scared. It's all so much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Emiliano. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly natural to be scared. Let me explain the tests a little more clearly. The blood tests are straightforward – we’ll just take a small sample of blood to assess your overall health and diabetes control. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your nerves. It can be a little uncomfortable, a bit like a mild electric shock, but it’s generally not painful. The vascular study will assess the blood flow to your foot, using either an ultrasound or an angiogram. The ultrasound is non-invasive, meaning it doesn’t require any needles. An angiogram involves injecting a dye into your blood vessels, which can have some risks, but we’d only recommend it if the ultrasound isn’t sufficient. The goal of these tests is to determine the severity of the nerve damage and assess the blood flow to your foot. This will help us develop a treatment plan to prevent the ulcer from worsening and hopefully avoid any complications. While there's a risk of complications if left untreated, with proper care and monitoring, we can manage this effectively. I want to reassure you that we will do everything we can to help you maintain your ability to walk and live a full life. Do you have any further questions about the tests or the potential treatment options?
PATIENT: That… that sounds a little better, knowing what they do. The ultrasound sounds alright. I don’t like the idea of needles, but I guess I can handle it if I have to. And the angiogram… I really don’t want that one, if possible. What kind of treatment are we talking about? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I live alone, you see. And I don’t have anyone to take care of me. Will there be… medicine? Or… something else? I just want to know what I’m getting into. And… how long will this take? I have a doctor’s appointment next month for my heart, and I don’t want to miss that. I’m sorry for all the questions. I just… I don’t want to lose my foot. That’s my biggest fear.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Emiliano. It's important you understand everything. Your fears are completely valid, and I'll do my best to address them. The treatment will depend on the results of the tests. Initially, we'll focus on offloading pressure from the ulcer, which means reducing the amount of weight you put on your foot. This might involve special shoes, orthotics, or a walking boot. We’ll also need to keep the ulcer clean and protected to prevent infection. If the ulcer is infected, we may need to prescribe antibiotics. We'll also closely monitor your blood sugar levels to ensure they're well-controlled. In most cases, you won't need to stay in the hospital. We can manage this on an outpatient basis, with regular check-ups at the clinic. However, if the infection is severe, hospitalization may be necessary. We'll also discuss strategies for improving your circulation, such as regular exercise and smoking cessation if applicable. Regarding your heart appointment, we’ll do our best to coordinate the treatment plan so it doesn’t interfere. We can schedule the tests and check-ups around your existing appointments. And to reassure you, losing your foot is not inevitable. With proper care and monitoring, we can significantly reduce the risk of complications and hopefully heal the ulcer. We’ll work together to achieve the best possible outcome. Now, let’s schedule those tests. Would tomorrow morning work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that should be alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have to pick up groceries afterwards. And… will I be able to drive myself home? I don’t want to bother anyone. And… about the cost. I’m on Medicare, but I worry about co-pays and things like that. Is it going to be expensive? I don't have much money saved up. I’m sorry to ask about these things, but… I just need to know what to expect. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the time, transportation, and cost. Tomorrow morning we'll start with blood work, which usually takes about an hour. Then we’ll do the nerve conduction study, which should take around 30-45 minutes. I'll review the results with you as soon as they're available. You should be able to drive yourself home afterwards, but please let the staff know if you're feeling unwell or dizzy. Regarding the cost, Medicare typically covers most of the costs for these tests, but you may be responsible for a co-pay. Our billing department will be happy to provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. They can also discuss payment options if needed. I'll have them reach out to you after the appointment to answer any questions you may have. Now, let me get you scheduled for those tests. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s alright. Tomorrow morning it is. Please, just… take good care of my foot, Doctor. That's all I ask. And thank you… for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel… a little better. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Emiliano. I will do everything I can to take good care of your foot. That’s my job. Alright, then. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Please arrive a little early to complete any necessary paperwork. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good rest of your day, and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. .
