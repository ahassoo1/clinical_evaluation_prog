DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Yeah. I… need some things for travel, I think? My wife… she wanted me to come. She made the appointment. I don’t really remember where I’m going, exactly. Just… away. For a little bit. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. No need to worry about specifics right now. It sounds like you're preparing for a trip. And your wife thought it would be a good idea to get a check-up beforehand – that’s very thoughtful of her. Let's just try to figure out what might be helpful for you while you're away. To start, are you experiencing any current symptoms – anything at all that's bothering you?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? Not really. I mean, I get tired, but… everyone gets tired, right? My back hurts a little when I bend over, from work, but that’s just… work. Building planes is hard. It's not a problem problem. I don't know about… other symptoms. What kind of symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, everyone gets tired. And back pain from work is very common. I just want to make sure we’re covering all bases. When you say "tired," is it just feeling generally run down, or is it more like you’re struggling to stay awake during the day?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Like, at the end of the day, I just want to sit. And sleep. Sometimes I fall asleep watching TV, my wife says. She gets annoyed. It's not… a big deal. I work long hours, okay? It’s normal. I don’t need… medicine for being tired.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a normal part of a busy life, but falling asleep easily, even when you're trying to stay awake, can sometimes be a sign of something else going on. We just want to rule things out. Let's move on to other areas, then. Have you had any recent changes in your weight, either gaining or losing?
PATIENT: Weight? Uh… I don’t know. I think… maybe a little less? The food at work is not very good. I just eat what I can. My wife tries to make me eat more, but… I’m not very hungry. Not like I used to be. She worries too much, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And approximately how much weight would you say you've lost, if you had to guess?
PATIENT: Guess? I don't know... maybe… five kilos? Ten? It's hard to say. My pants feel… looser, I guess. Not a good thing, maybe. But I don't really care about my weight, okay? It's not like I'm trying to get skinny.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Weight loss, even if unintentional, is something we should investigate further. Just to get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? My wife said my hair is getting thinner. That’s about it, I think. And… I’m always a little cold now. Even when it’s warm. She says I need a sweater. Always a sweater. She’s very… particular. Is this important? Because I don’t have a lot of time. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, these things are important to know, thank you for sharing. It sounds like there are a few changes happening. I apologize if this is taking some time; I just want to make sure we address everything. Let's talk about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I mean, I get a cold sometimes, like everyone. But nothing… serious. I had some problems with my back a few years ago, from lifting something heavy at work, but they gave me some pills and it went away. My wife handles all the doctor stuff, usually. She remembers everything. I’m… not good with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’m too strong to need surgery. I build airplanes, remember? You don’t get surgery when you build airplanes. You fix other people’s problems.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Alright. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family - things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family history… uh. My father… he had some problems with his lungs, I think. He smoked a lot. He died when I was young. And my mother… she worried a lot. She didn’t have any… special problems. Just… worries. That’s all I really remember. My wife knows more about this, probably. She talks to my aunt.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And what about social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What’s that even mean? Like, what do I like to do for fun? I work. I come home. I sleep. Is that a social history? Look, I really need to get back to work. Can we just give me some pills for travel? My wife said something about… malaria? Or yellow fever? Just whatever I need so I can go.
DOCTOR: Yes, your wife is right, travel vaccinations might be important. Let me quickly access your electronic health record. Perhaps it will give me a better understanding of your medical background and what vaccinations you may need. Just one moment… Ah, here we are. It looks like you have been seen by Dr. Sharma previously. I see notes about fatigue, some weight loss, and a recent increase in reported cold sensitivity. It also mentions a family history of respiratory issues, which is good information. It appears Dr. Sharma ordered some blood work a few months ago, but the results are not fully available here.
PATIENT: Blood work? I didn’t know about any blood work. My wife… she probably took me. I just… show up. She tells me what to do. Is everything okay? Are you finding something bad? I don’t like this.
DOCTOR: No, nothing is immediately concerning. However, the notes indicate some tests were ordered to investigate the fatigue and weight loss. It’s important that we follow up on those results. Before we discuss potential vaccinations, I think it would be best to understand what those tests were looking for and what the results show. Do you remember anything about why Dr. Sharma ordered them?
PATIENT: I… no. Not really. Something about… my tiredness? And being cold? She just said I needed tests. I didn’t ask questions. She gets… upset if I ask too many questions. She says I worry too much, and she handles everything. Look, can we just skip the tests? I need to go. Is there a shot I can take for… whatever I need for travel? Please? I have work.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand you’re anxious and want to get back to work. But we can't responsibly recommend travel vaccinations without knowing what's causing your fatigue and weight loss. It's possible these symptoms could affect your ability to safely receive certain vaccines, or even require specific precautions during your trip. Let me explain: fatigue and weight loss can be caused by many things, some of which are serious. The blood work Dr. Sharma ordered would help us rule those out. It's also important to understand what’s causing you to feel cold. I can call Dr. Sharma to get the results expedited, and we can discuss them together. Or, if you prefer, I can refer you to a specialist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It might be a good idea to see a hematologist, given the weight loss and fatigue. Would you be open to either of those options?
PATIENT: Hematologist? What's that? Is that… a bad doctor? Look, I really don't want to see another doctor. She already makes all the appointments, I just show up. I just need a shot, okay? Yellow fever or malaria, whatever I need to go. I'll be careful. I’ll wear long sleeves. I don't want to see another doctor, or wait for results, or… anything. I just want to go to work and then go away. Is there… a shot I can take now, just in case? I'll sign a waiver. I don't care. Just let me go.
DOCTOR: Odell, I understand you’re very stressed and want to avoid further appointments. And I appreciate your willingness to sign a waiver. However, as a physician, I have a responsibility to ensure any treatment I provide is safe and appropriate for your individual health needs. Giving you a vaccination without knowing what's causing your symptoms could potentially be harmful. I’m concerned about your fatigue and weight loss, and I strongly advise against traveling until we have a better understanding of what's happening. I can offer you a compromise. I will write you a referral to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – but I will not administer any vaccinations until you have been evaluated and we have the results. You can schedule the appointment at your convenience, and we can discuss the results when you’re ready. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: …Okay. Fine. A hematologist. Just… don't make me wait too long. And tell them I have work. I can't be gone for long. Can I get a note for work? To explain why I was gone? And… is there anything I can take for the tiredness right now? Even if it doesn't work, just… something.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. I can write a note for your work explaining your appointment with the hematologist. It will state that you are undergoing evaluation for fatigue and weight loss. And I will also provide you with a list of local hematologists. Regarding the tiredness, I can prescribe a low-dose multivitamin. It won’t address the underlying cause of your fatigue, but it may provide a small energy boost while we await your appointment. It’s important to understand this is not a long-term solution, and it won’t replace a thorough medical evaluation. Here’s the referral and the prescription. Please schedule an appointment with a hematologist as soon as possible. And remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop any new concerns, please contact me or seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me today, Odell?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you. I… need to go now. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Safe travels, Odell. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
