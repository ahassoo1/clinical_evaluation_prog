DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. I am here regarding a matter at my place of work. It concerns the wearing of masks, or… protective gear, I suppose you’d call it. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re looking for a medical exemption related to mask wearing at work. That’s perfectly reasonable to discuss. To help me understand your situation better, could you tell me a little more about why you're seeking an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly. It isn’t a matter of disagreement with the practice, understand. My work involves providing assistance to others, and I fully support measures to keep everyone safe. However, I’ve found the masks… they cause me some difficulty. A tightness in my chest, a bit of dizziness, and… well, it’s hard to explain, but it feels like it affects my breathing, even if just a little. It’s concerning, as clear thinking is important in my line of work. I’ve never had these issues before the masks were required.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. So, these symptoms – the chest tightness, dizziness, and feeling of shortness of breath – started after the mask requirement at work, and they seem to be directly related to wearing a mask. Just to be clear, have you experienced anything like this before, even during strenuous activity or times of stress?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, never. I’ve always been quite healthy, and I keep myself active. I spend a lot of time outdoors, walking and… well, assisting others, as I mentioned. Even when exerting myself, I’ve never felt this way. It is truly only when I have a mask on. It’s… unsettling, to be honest, to experience something new like this at my age. I’ve always prided myself on being able to handle difficult situations.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good that you're paying attention to this new development. Let's go through a bit more detail to get a clearer picture. When you say "chest tightness," can you describe the sensation?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a sharp pain, not at all. More like… a squeezing feeling, right across my chest. It isn’t constant, it comes and goes, and it’s definitely worse the longer I have the mask on. It feels like my lungs are… constricted, perhaps. And it makes it harder to take a full, deep breath. It doesn’t last long after I remove the mask, thankfully, but it is worrisome nonetheless. It feels… like something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Okay, squeezing, across the chest, worse with prolonged mask use, and a feeling of constriction making it harder to breathe deeply. That's helpful. And you said dizziness – is that a spinning sensation, lightheadedness, or something else?
PATIENT: It’s more of a lightheadedness, Doctor. Not a spinning sensation at all. More like… a floating feeling, if that makes sense. Like my head isn’t quite… grounded. It isn’t severe enough to make me stumble, but it’s definitely noticeable. It usually happens alongside the chest tightness, but not always. Sometimes it's just the tightness. And, as I said, it all started when the masks became mandatory at work.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness, feeling ungrounded, often accompanying the chest tightness. We've established a clear timeline with the mask use. Now, let's quickly go through some other things to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of asthma, allergies, or any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I've never been diagnosed with asthma, or any lung issues. I do not have any known allergies, and my heart has always been strong. My family has a history of longevity, thankfully. I’ve always been a very… robust individual, health-wise. That’s why this is so concerning. It’s unlike anything I’ve experienced before.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No personal or family history of asthma, allergies, or heart conditions. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and just do a general assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed as you see fit. I want to understand what is causing this, and I trust your expertise. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.
DOCTOR: Okay, Rayshun, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Your oxygen saturation is 98%, also good. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally – no wheezing, crackles, or diminished breath sounds. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. I'm not detecting anything immediately concerning on this exam, but that doesn’t rule anything out. Do you notice any difference in your symptoms depending on the type of mask you wear – for example, a cloth mask versus an N95?
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, Doctor. I appreciate the thoroughness. As for the type of mask… yes, actually. The cloth masks are… less problematic, but they still cause some tightness and lightheadedness after a while. The N95 masks are much worse. The feeling of constriction is more pronounced, and the lightheadedness comes on much quicker. It’s almost as if the tighter the mask, the more severe the symptoms become. I've tried adjusting the fit, but it doesn't seem to make a significant difference. It’s the mask itself, I believe, that is the issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very important information – the symptoms are exacerbated by tighter-fitting masks like N95s. Given your history, the physical exam findings, and the correlation with mask use, it sounds like you may be experiencing some degree of mask-induced anxiety or a physiological response to restricted breathing, potentially triggering a mild form of air hunger. It's not uncommon, especially in individuals who aren't accustomed to wearing masks for prolonged periods. However, to rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order a simple EKG to check your heart rhythm and a basic blood panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… quite sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to undergo those tests, if it will help determine the cause of this issue. I understand the need to rule out other possibilities. I’m not opposed to masks, as I said, but I do need to be able to perform my duties effectively, and these symptoms are… concerning. An EKG and blood panel seem like a good next step. When can we schedule those?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can get those ordered right away, and the lab is just down the hall. We'll draw the blood first, and then do the EKG. It should take about 30-45 minutes total. While we're waiting for the results, I'm going to recommend temporarily limiting your mask use as much as possible, while still adhering to your workplace's safety guidelines. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness that doesn't resolve quickly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I appreciate you taking my concerns seriously, and I am grateful for your recommendations. Limiting my mask use temporarily while adhering to safety guidelines is a reasonable approach. And I will certainly seek immediate medical attention if I experience any worsening of symptoms. Thank you for your thoroughness and your compassionate care. I feel much better knowing we are taking steps to determine the cause of this issue.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. We'll get the lab results back within 24-48 hours, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here's a lab requisition form and instructions. Do you have any questions before we proceed with the testing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe I have all the information I need. Thank you once again for your time and your kindness. I will proceed with the testing as instructed. I appreciate your attention to this matter, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. May I ask where I should go within the lab?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Just go through those double doors over there, and the phlebotomist’s station is the first window on your left. Let them know you're here for an order from Dr. Condray, and they'll take care of you. After the blood draw, they'll direct you to the EKG room. Do you have any other questions before you head over?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is perfectly clear. I understand where to go and what to do. I truly appreciate your clear instructions and your compassionate care. I will proceed to the lab now. Thank you for everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Rayshun. I hope everything goes smoothly. Please feel free to reach out if you need anything at all. Have a good day, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well. .
