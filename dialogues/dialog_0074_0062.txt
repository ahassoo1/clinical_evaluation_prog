DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you, too. I’m here today regarding a matter with my work. It concerns the masks they’re wanting us to wear. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, or perhaps another solution. It’s causing me some trouble, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. So, this is regarding a work requirement to wear a mask, and you’re experiencing some difficulties with that. Could you tell me more about those difficulties?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I work as a Protective Service Worker – mostly checking on folks, ensuring their safety. And these masks… they make it difficult to breathe properly when I’m having to be active, going up stairs, or even just talking for a long period. It feels like I’m suffocating sometimes. It also makes it harder for the people I visit to understand me clearly. Communication is very important in my line of work, and I worry they won’t hear my instructions if I’m muffled. I’ve tried different types, but they all seem to cause the same problems. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're finding the masks interfere with your ability to breathe comfortably during the physical demands of your job as a Protective Service Worker, and they also hinder clear communication with the individuals you assist. That sounds very challenging, especially given the importance of both those aspects of your role. To get a better understanding of the situation, could you tell me if you have any underlying health conditions, such as asthma, COPD, or other respiratory issues?
PATIENT: That’s a very good question, Doctor. No, I don’t have asthma, COPD, or any diagnosed lung problems. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I do get winded easier now than I used to, just with age I suppose. But it’s not a medical condition that’s been identified. It’s just… harder to catch my breath, and the mask makes that much worse. I do have slightly high blood pressure, and take medication for that, but that’s well-controlled. Does that information help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. So, no pre-existing respiratory conditions, just some increased breathlessness with activity, and well-controlled hypertension. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about the type of masks your workplace provides or allows?
PATIENT: Certainly. They’ve given us mostly the standard surgical masks – the blue pleated ones. They say we can request an N95, but those are much harder to breathe through, and make my glasses fog up constantly. It’s nearly impossible to see, which is… not ideal when I’m assessing a situation or checking on someone’s well-being. They've also offered the cloth masks, but those don't seem to provide much protection at all, and feel like they aren’t even doing anything. We're required to wear one at all times when inside a home, or even near anyone outside. It’s quite strict.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you've tried surgical masks, N95s, and cloth masks, each presenting its own challenges – difficulty breathing with N95s, fogging glasses, and perceived lack of protection with cloth masks. And the requirement to wear a mask at all times, even during activities that increase your respiratory rate, is adding to the difficulty. Mr. Knabenshue, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your respiratory function and overall health. Specifically, I’ll listen to your lungs, check your oxygen saturation, and measure your blood pressure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way that helps. I want to find a solution that allows me to do my job safely, while also being able to breathe comfortably. Listening to my lungs and checking those levels seems like a good start. Please proceed. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you for your trust, Mr. Knabenshue. First, I’ll listen to your lungs, both front and back, to check for any wheezing, crackles, or other abnormal sounds. Please take slow, deep breaths in and out through your mouth. Okay, your lung sounds are clear bilaterally – no wheezing or crackles detected at this time. Now, I'm going to place this small clip on your finger to measure your oxygen saturation. This doesn’t hurt at all. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within the normal range. And your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but consistent with your usual readings. Based on these initial findings, there's no immediate indication of a respiratory issue causing your difficulties. However, we should consider other factors and potential solutions. Do you have any known allergies, especially to latex or any mask materials?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. Not to latex, not to anything in masks, not to anything at all, as far as I know. I’ve never had a reaction to anything like that. I’ve used latex gloves at work for years without issue. And I’ve tried masks made of different materials – polypropylene, cotton, you name it. It's not an allergy, I’m fairly certain of that. It’s purely a breathing issue. It feels like the masks are restricting my airflow, plain and simple. It makes me feel quite anxious, truthfully, worrying about not getting enough air.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. So, we've ruled out allergies as a primary cause, and you're experiencing a breathing restriction and associated anxiety specifically when wearing a mask. Given your role as a Protective Service Worker, where clear communication and physical exertion are important, and the fact that your oxygen saturation is normal, it’s possible the masks are triggering a sensation of dyspnea, or shortness of breath, even without a significant physiological compromise. To explore further, would you be comfortable with a referral to a pulmonologist?
PATIENT: A pulmonologist? Yes, I suppose I would be comfortable with that, Doctor. If it would help determine the cause of this issue, and potentially find a solution, then yes, please. I want to be able to continue doing my job, and I want to ensure I’m not putting myself, or the people I assist, at risk. I trust your professional opinion. What would that involve? Would I need to do any special testing? I’m a bit worried about all the… machinery and procedures sometimes.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly valid concern, Mr. Knabenshue. A pulmonologist specializes in lung health, and they can conduct more comprehensive tests to assess your breathing function and identify any underlying issues. Typically, they would start with a detailed medical history and physical exam, similar to what we’ve done today. They may then recommend a spirometry test, which involves breathing into a device to measure how much air you can inhale and exhale, and how quickly you can do so. It's a simple, non-invasive test. They may also consider a chest X-ray, but that's usually only if there's a specific concern based on your symptoms and exam findings. The goal isn't to subject you to unnecessary testing, but rather to gather the information needed to determine the cause of your difficulties and explore potential solutions, such as alternative mask types, breathing exercises, or, if necessary, medication. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a pulmonologist in the area?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A referral would be greatly appreciated. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Alternative mask types would be wonderful, if possible. I've tried a few on my own, but haven't found anything that's comfortable and provides adequate protection. Perhaps they have some options I haven't considered. I also wouldn’t mind learning some breathing exercises, if that’s something they recommend. I’m willing to try anything that might help. Thank you for your time and patience. I truly appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I’m glad we could discuss this and explore some options. Here is the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a pulmonologist located about 20 minutes from here. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ve also noted your interest in alternative mask options and breathing exercises, so she will be aware of that. I’ll also provide you with a printed handout outlining some simple diaphragmatic breathing techniques you can try in the meantime. These exercises can sometimes help improve breathing efficiency and reduce feelings of anxiety. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve addressed all of my concerns. The handout is greatly appreciated. I’ll be sure to practice those breathing exercises. Thank you again for your time and kindness. It’s reassuring to know that there are professionals like you who are willing to listen and help. I will reach out to Dr. Sharma’s office tomorrow. Have a good day, Doctor Reisig.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. I wish you all the best with your appointment with Dr. Sharma. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day as well, and please take care.
PATIENT: .
