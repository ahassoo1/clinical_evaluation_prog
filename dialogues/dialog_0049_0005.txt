DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Nestingen. It is a pleasure to meet you. My niece, she arranged this visit. I am hoping to be cleared to move into one of those…senior living places. She worries about me living alone still, you see. I bake a lot, but sometimes… well, she thinks it would be better if I had folks nearby.
DOCTOR: I see. A move to assisted living, pre-placement evaluation. Right. And are you experiencing any health concerns that are prompting this evaluation, or is it primarily for peace of mind, as you said, for your niece?
PATIENT: Primarily for my niece’s peace of mind, I believe. Though, my knees do bother me some days. And I forget where I put my reading glasses, even when they’re on my head! <chuckles lightly> Nothing serious, though. I still manage the bakery just fine. Mostly breads, you know. Sourdough is my specialty.
DOCTOR: Knees…and some forgetfulness. Okay. When did you first start noticing the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It wasn't a sudden thing, Doctor. Years, I suppose. Probably… ten years ago, maybe more? It comes and goes. Not every day. Mostly when the weather turns cold and damp. I used to be able to kneel right down to fix the oven, but now... well, it's a bit more of a slow process, with cushions and such.
DOCTOR: And how would you rate the pain, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: One to ten, you say? Hmm. On a good day, it’s barely a two. On a bad day… maybe a six, seven if I’ve been on my feet a lot. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It doesn’t keep me from working, but it makes me move a bit slower, that’s for sure. And sometimes, when I rise from a chair, it takes a bit to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned some forgetfulness. Could you give me an example of what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, the glasses. That's a common one. But it's more than that sometimes. I might start to tell a story, and then… the thread of it escapes me. Or I’ll go into the kitchen for flour, and come out with sugar. Small things, really. Nothing that stops me, but enough to make my niece worry. I still remember recipes perfectly, mind you. I’ve been baking those sourdough loaves for sixty years!
DOCTOR: Sixty years is quite a commitment. Do these memory lapses feel more frequent recently, or have they been consistent for a while?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I think… perhaps a little more frequent lately. Though it's hard to say for certain. I've always been a bit… absent-minded. But yes, I’d say over the past year, maybe two, they’ve been happening a bit more often. It doesn’t frighten me, but it is… noticeable. And I don't want to be a burden to anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to some other questions, just to get a broader picture. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve been fortunate, I suppose. I’ve always been a fairly active man. I used to go hunting with my father when I was younger. I had a touch of the flu a few winters back, but nothing serious. The local doctor, old man Hemlock, he checked me over then, and said I was as strong as an ox, for my age. I still see him for a yearly checkup, you know. He's retired now, but he told me who to see.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, actually. When I was a young man, I broke my arm falling off a horse. They set it, put it in a cast. That was… oh, sixty years ago, maybe more. Apart from that, no. Nothing else. It healed up just fine. Never bothered me a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a small pill for my arthritis, Doctor. The doctor, old man Hemlock, prescribed it. Something to help with the aches and pains in my joints. I take one every morning. Nothing else. I don’t hold with taking a lot of pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much. Never had a reaction to anything. My niece is always asking me if I’m sure, especially about nuts, but I eat nut breads all the time. Walnuts, pecans… never a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Tkac. Before we proceed, I’m going to quickly review your EHR information. <pauses, typing> Alright. I see your last physical was about a year ago with Dr. Hemlock. Blood pressure was a little elevated, cholesterol slightly high, but generally stable. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you stand up for me, if you are able?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. A little slow getting up, if you don't mind. <slowly stands, with a slight grunt> Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know. But I can stand alright. <steadying himself> Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. <takes blood pressure and pulse, verbalizing findings> Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, as noted in your records. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. <listens to heart and lungs, verbalizing findings> Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, normal breath sounds bilaterally. Now, can you tell me if you have any pain in your knees as you stand?
PATIENT: A little ache, Doctor, but nothing unbearable. It’s more of a stiffness, really. Feels like they need a bit of oiling. <shifts weight slightly> It’s worse in the mornings, or after I've been sitting for a while. Standing doesn't cause pain, but it reminds me it's there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. <takes a few slow, deliberate steps> Not as spry as I used to be, I’ll admit. <continues walking a short distance, then stops> A little wobbly sometimes, but I get by. My balance isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: I notice a slight hesitation with each step, and a wider gait than usual. Do you use any assistive devices – cane, walker – regularly?
PATIENT: No, I don’t use anything regularly. Sometimes, on particularly bad days, I’ll lean on my niece a bit when we're walking, but that’s about it. I've always been reluctant to use a cane or walker. Feels like giving in, you know? I try to stay as active as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. <tests patient’s reflexes> Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. I also want to quickly assess your cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today's date… <pauses, thinking> It is August 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd. My niece reminds me often, you see.
DOCTOR: And can you spell "world" backwards for me?
PATIENT: <pauses, concentrating> Let me see… d-l-r-o-w. Yes, d-l-r-o-w. Is that correct? It’s a little harder than it sounds, trying to go backwards.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Alright, Mr. Tkac. Based on my examination and your history, it appears you have some mild age-related changes – some joint stiffness and aches, slightly elevated blood pressure, and mild forgetfulness. Your cognitive function seems largely intact, though there’s some minor difficulty with recall. I don't believe your condition is an immediate contraindication to assisted living, but I'd like to order some blood work to rule out other possible causes for your symptoms, like Vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood work is a good idea. I’ve always believed in getting a thorough checkup. And if it puts my niece’s mind at ease, all the better. Yes, let’s go ahead with the blood work. And thank you for your time and patience. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. I'll write the order for the lab work now. It should just be a standard panel. You can go to the lab here at the clinic. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, continue with your current medication, and try to stay as active as you’re able. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. I appreciate your careful examination and clear explanation. My niece will likely have questions, but I’ll let her contact you if needed. Thank you again for your help. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go and make a loaf of sourdough bread. It always helps clear my head.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a wonderful idea, Mr. Tkac. Enjoy your baking. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if any concerns arise. Have a good day.
PATIENT: And you have a good day as well, Doctor Nestingen. <offers a small smile> Goodbye.
