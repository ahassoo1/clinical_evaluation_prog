DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um... it's my waterworks, you see? Not working so good. Hard to... push it out, if you know what I mean. It's been... a little while now. Not sure how long, exactly. My husband, he notices more than me, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. “Not working so good.” Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific... oh dear. Let me think. It just… takes a long time to start. And then it’s not a strong stream, you know? Like a little dribble sometimes. And I have to… push. It shouldn’t be that hard, should it? I used to just go, no problem. It’s just… changed. Is that specific enough? Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen. You're doing fine. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination – both starting and maintaining a good stream. Has this been getting worse gradually, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Very gradually. Maybe... over the last year? Hard to say. Things just... fade, you know? I don’t remember things like that very well. My memory isn't what it used to be. It’s just been... getting a little harder, little by little. I didn't really notice until it was... well, until it was bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really pain. A little uncomfortable, maybe, from pushing. But not burning. No burning at all. Sometimes… sometimes I feel like I didn't get everything out, you know? Like there’s still a little bit left in there. Does that make sense? I have to go back again pretty soon after I just went. It's… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty starting your stream, even when you feel the urge to go?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That’s the worst part! It just… won’t go at first. I have to… concentrate. And push a little. It takes a few tries sometimes, just to get it started. It’s… embarrassing, really. I never used to have to do this. My daughter says I worry too much, but it’s just… different now. Does that explain it? I feel like I’m talking in circles.
DOCTOR: You’re not talking in circles, Ms. Stoffregen. It's helpful to get a clear picture of what's going on. We'll figure this out. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits...? Oh, goodness. Let me think... I go, you know, when I need to. Maybe a little more often than I used to? But I eat a lot of fruit, so… I thought that was normal. Not much else... No trouble going, if you understand. Just... more frequently, perhaps. And sometimes… a little softer than it used to be. But nothing terrible. Why do you ask? Is that important?
DOCTOR: It can be, Ms. Stoffregen. Sometimes bowel and bladder function are connected. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or lower back pain at all?
PATIENT: Fever...? No, I haven't been hot. No chills either. My husband would have noticed, he’s very good at checking. And no back pain, no. My back aches sometimes, but that's just my age, I think. Old bones, you know? It’s not a pain, just… a dull ache. Not related to my waterworks, I don’t think. I get aches all over when it's cold. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Right. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness gracious. Let me see... My blood pressure pill, that's one. My husband gets it filled for me. And sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. It’s a little white pill. I think. And sometimes, just a little bit of a vitamin… D, maybe? I can't remember exactly. My daughter helps with all that. I just take what she gives me. It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. Is it important to know exactly what I take? It feels like a million little pills sometimes.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Stoffregen. We need to know everything you’re taking to rule out any interactions. Do you have a list at home, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A list...? I don't think so. My daughter keeps it, I believe. She’s very organized. She has a whole folder with all my medical things. I’m not very good at keeping track of things, you know? It's all in her folder… with the papers and everything. Would she mind bringing it in? I’m sure she wouldn't mind at all. She's a good girl, my daughter. Very helpful. It's probably the easiest thing to do, really. Do you have her number? I can call her right now, if you like. She lives close by.
DOCTOR: That would be very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. Yes, if you could give me her number, I can have someone from the office contact her to arrange that. While we wait for that, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Anything you need, just ask. My daughter's number is… … 555-123-4567. That's right, I think. Yes, 555-123-4567. She'll be happy to help. A physical exam... alright. Whatever you need. Just be gentle, my bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, if you could just lie down on the exam table, we'll start with listening to your abdomen. And then I’ll just do a quick neurological check, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. . A neurological check...? Oh dear. I hope it doesn’t involve anything too… complicated. I haven’t been very good at puzzles lately, if you know what I mean. But I’ll do my best. Here I go... . Is this alright? I hope I'm not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Just relax. I’m just listening to your abdomen now. Take deep breaths… in and out. Alright. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes. This will just involve tapping a small hammer on your knees and ankles. It won’t hurt, but let me know if it’s uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright… deep breaths. . Reflexes... oh dear. I always felt a bit silly when they did that. But alright, whatever you need. Just be gentle, please. And… and hurry, if you don’t mind. I don't like lying still for too long. It makes my back ache. . Here I go… tap, tap, tap… I hope I don't jump.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a little tap… on this side… and on this side. Okay. And now, I'm just going to quickly assess your lower back. Can you bend forward slightly, if you can, and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… that tickles a bit. And… and makes my legs feel wobbly. Oh dear, I can't really reach my toes anymore. My back… it's a bit stiff, you see? It’s been like this for years. It’s just old age, I think. I can’t bend like I used to. Maybe I should have worn different pants… These are a bit tight. Is that alright? I hope I’m not making a mess of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to perform a quick pelvic exam. I will need you to lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll use a speculum to examine your vagina and cervix. It may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain. I will explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: A... a pelvic exam? Oh dear. I... I haven't had one of those in a long, long time. . Is it… is it really necessary? I mean, I’m very old, you know. It’s probably nothing. And… and I don’t really like people touching down there. Is there anything else we can do? It’s just… a bit embarrassing. And… and uncomfortable. But… but alright. If you say it’s necessary. Just… just be gentle, please. And hurry.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, it's important to rule out any underlying causes for your urinary difficulties. A pelvic exam will allow me to assess the health of your pelvic organs. It's a standard procedure, and I will be as gentle as possible. It won't take long. Now, if you could just relax and take a deep breath... I’ll explain everything as I go.
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Just… just hurry. And… and don't say anything, please. I don't want to know what you're doing. Just… just get it over with. Just… just hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s all. You can get dressed now. I’ll be back in a moment to discuss the results.
