DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. I'm Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. I’ve been looking rather… yellow, lately. My niece, bless her heart, insisted I come. She said it wasn't normal. I don't recall exactly when it started, but it's been a little while now. It's a bit disconcerting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yellowing… alright. And it’s been going on for “a little while,” you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Not weeks, certainly. Perhaps… months? It’s difficult to say. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand. And I… I have some trouble with my liver, I believe. Or had trouble. Something along those lines. It was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the specifics. It wasn't anything dramatic, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Months… and a history of liver issues. Okay. Just to clarify, when you say “trouble with your liver,” do you recall what that trouble was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's the frustrating part, isn’t it? No, I really don’t. Something about… inflammation, perhaps? Or… hepatitis? My sister had hepatitis once, a very bad case. Maybe I had something similar. I honestly can't be certain. It was treated, I know that much. A long time ago, with pills. I just… don’t remember the details. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know, yes. We'll figure it out. Let's move on to your current symptoms. Besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me see. Well, I've been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And my stomach… it's been a bit uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… bloated. And a little bit queasy. I haven't been able to eat much. It’s all rather unpleasant. But these things happen at my age, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, bloating, nausea… and reduced appetite. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a rather… personal question, isn't it? Well, my stool has been… lighter in color, I think. Perhaps paler than usual. And my urine… I haven't really paid much attention, to be honest. I suppose it looks normal. But I’m not a very observant person, you understand. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Annelle, thank you for sharing. Lighter stools and… we’ll note the normal urine. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or any itching recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills. No itching either. I haven’t felt particularly warm or cold, just… tired. And a little bit uncomfortable, as I said. I really can’t think of anything else. This is all rather worrisome, isn’t it? I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: We'll get to the bottom of it, Annelle. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Aside from the liver issue you mentioned, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking me things I really can't remember. I've been to doctors, of course, over the years. I had my gallbladder removed, a long time ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure once, but it was treated with pills, and I don’t recall the details. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is a terrible thing. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I've never been one for remembering dates and details. Is it alright if we just skip that part?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. We’ll take things at your pace. Gallbladder removal and a history of high blood pressure. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago, after the doctor said I didn't need them anymore. And I haven't taken anything else regularly in… well, I can't remember how long. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, perhaps. Nothing serious. I’m not a very complicated patient, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to have a bit of a sniffle when I was around cats, but that wasn't an allergy, just… sensitivity, I suppose. Nothing serious. I’m fairly sturdy, Doctor. At least, I used to be. Is this taking a long time? I have a bridge club meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Annelle. We’re nearly finished with the questions. No known allergies. And yes, we are almost done. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that's a difficult one. My family… we were Kurds, you see. From the mountains. We didn’t really have doctors, not in the way you think of them. There was a lot of… hardship. Illness, certainly. But I don't recall specific diseases. My sister, she had a weak heart, but she died young. And my father… he had trouble breathing. But beyond that, I'm afraid I can't tell you much. It wasn’t something we discussed. It was a long time ago. A very long time ago. Are you finished now, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Annelle, we’re finished with the questions. Thank you for your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your skin. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh. An examination… Very well. If you think it’s necessary. But please be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. And… I don't like being touched. It reminds me of… things. But go ahead. Just… please be quick. And explain what you're doing, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I will be as gentle as possible, and I will explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds a little rapid, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Is this tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a little uncomfortable. Just… around here. It’s not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. Like a dull ache. And… I feel a bit bloated. It’s hard to explain. Like something is pressing on me. Please don't press too hard, Doctor. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. I apologize. Just a little sensitivity there. And I notice some mild tenderness here as well. I also observe some yellowing of the skin, which is what brought you in today. It’s called jaundice. Now, I will listen to your bowel sounds. Bowel sounds are present, but a little quiet. Alright, Annelle. That completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation. Based on your symptoms and the exam, I’m concerned about possible liver issues. The jaundice, the tenderness in your upper right side, and the history you mentioned all point in that direction. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this. I'd like to order some blood tests, including a liver function panel and a complete blood count. I would also like to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an ultrasound… Oh dear. More tests. It sounds… serious, doesn’t it? Very well. If you think it’s necessary. But please explain everything clearly. I don’t understand medical jargon, you see. And… will it hurt? I have that bridge club meeting this afternoon… will these tests take long? Perhaps we could schedule them for tomorrow?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Annelle. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious, but we need to investigate. The blood tests will involve a simple blood draw, and the ultrasound is non-invasive – it uses sound waves to create images, so it won’t hurt at all. It might be a little uncomfortable lying on the table, but it's painless. The blood tests will take about 15-20 minutes, and the ultrasound will take about 30 minutes. We can schedule them for tomorrow morning. Would 9 am work for you?
PATIENT: 9 am… hmm. Tomorrow… yes, I suppose that would be alright. But please, be quick. I have a lot on my plate, you see. And… will I need to fast before the blood tests? My niece makes a lovely breakfast… And who will explain the results to me? I don’t want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. And I will personally explain the results to you, Annelle. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss them in detail. I'll make a note of that now. So, that's blood tests tomorrow at 9 am, fasting beforehand, and a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. Blood tests tomorrow, fasting… and a follow-up appointment. I suppose it’s the best we can do. But please, make sure someone explains everything clearly. I don't want to be confused. And… will I be able to drive myself to the bridge club meeting after the tests? I don't want to be a burden to anyone. I think that's all my questions for now. Are we finished? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Annelle, we're finished. And yes, you should be able to drive yourself to your bridge club meeting after the tests, as long as you feel alright. The blood draw shouldn't make you feel unwell, but if you feel tired or dizzy, please ask someone for a ride. I'll also provide you with a note explaining the tests and the fasting instructions. I'll see you tomorrow at 9 am. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, Annelle, and try not to worry too much.
