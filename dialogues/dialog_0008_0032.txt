DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it's… a delicate matter, really. Something I wouldn't normally discuss with just anyone, you understand. It’s been… draining. A bit of a bother, frankly. I suppose you've read the chart? It’s rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I have, sir. It indicates some recent changes in your bowel habits. You mentioned it was draining and a bother. Can you tell me more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Now, hold on just a moment. I distinctly recall indicating a… discharge. A different sort of discharge, entirely. Are you quite certain you’ve read the correct chart? This is rather… unprofessional, if I may say so. A man doesn’t simply discuss his… digestive issues with a doctor when the problem lies… elsewhere.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question me, Mr. Krok. My apologies. It appears I was looking at the wrong record. Let me pull up yours now... Ah, yes. I see. Recent penile discharge, as noted. Again, I apologize for the error. That is a delicate matter, as you said. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Honestly. A complete waste of time, this. Very well. It's… well, it's not supposed to be there, is it? A bit cloudy, I suppose. And occasionally… a yellowish tinge. It's been going on for… oh, I haven't the faintest idea how long. A week? Perhaps two? Time does rather slip away at my age, you know. It’s… bothersome, mostly. And my wife is quite displeased.
DOCTOR: Alright. Cloudy discharge with a yellowish tinge, for approximately one to two weeks. And it's causing you discomfort and concern, as well as upsetting your wife. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm. Well, there’s a slight… burning sensation, sometimes. Not terribly painful, just… noticeable. And a bit of… urgency, if you understand what I mean. I find myself needing to… attend to it… more frequently than I used to. And perhaps a little… fatigue, now that you mention it. But that could just be my age, couldn’t it? I’m not getting any younger, you know. It’s a great inconvenience, all of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, burning sensation, increased frequency, and some fatigue. Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your lower abdomen or testicles?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. I assure you, I’d know if I had a fever. And chills… goodness, no. It’s August, Doctor, not December! And pain… well, a slight ache, perhaps. Very mild. Not enough to warrant any… fuss. I’m not one to complain, you see. But this… this is simply unacceptable. I expect a solution, Doctor. A prompt one, if possible. My wife is beginning to… well, let’s just say she’s losing patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. No fever, chills, or significant pain, just a mild ache. Given your symptoms – the penile discharge, burning sensation, increased frequency, and mild ache – this could be a number of things. The most likely possibility is a sexually transmitted infection, such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. However, it could also be a non-gonococcal urethritis or another type of infection. To determine the cause, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam and collect a sample for testing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infection? Doctor, with all due respect, that’s… preposterous! I’ve been married for fifty-two years! Fifty-two years! My wife would never… I assure you, that is simply out of the question. I trust you have other possibilities in mind? This is rather… upsetting, to say the least. And frankly, I find your suggestion… insulting. I would prefer to explore other avenues before… jumping to such conclusions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please allow me to explain. I understand your reaction completely, and I apologize if I’ve offended you. It’s simply a matter of ruling out all possibilities to get to the correct diagnosis. While a long-term monogamous relationship significantly lowers the risk, it doesn't eliminate it entirely. Testing is the only way to be certain. Alternatively, we could consider other possibilities, such as a non-infectious urethritis or even irritation from soaps or detergents. However, those are less likely given your symptoms. Before proceeding, would you like me to explain the testing process in detail?
PATIENT: Very well. Explain the… process. But make it quick, Doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, no unnecessary… details. I’m a man of a certain age, not a medical student. And I still maintain that your initial suggestion was… rather far-fetched. But I suppose I must be… thorough, as you say.
DOCTOR: Of course. The process is quite simple. I will need to collect a urine sample – a midstream clean-catch sample, if possible. This means you’ll start urinating into the toilet, then collect a sample midstream into a sterile cup. It's important to avoid touching the inside of the cup. I will also need to perform a quick physical exam of the area. This involves a visual inspection and gently palpating the area to check for any tenderness or swelling. It will be a brief and discreet examination, and I will explain everything as I go. The sample will be sent to the lab for analysis, and the results should be back within a few days. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A urine sample, I suppose, I can manage. But this… "palpating"… is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I assure you, there is nothing amiss. I simply… have a bit of a… drainage issue. It's hardly a matter for physical probing, is it? Perhaps we could skip that part? I'm a private man, you see. And I find the whole thing… rather undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Krok, and I want to assure you that my goal is to provide you with the best possible care while respecting your privacy. However, a physical exam is an important part of a thorough evaluation. It helps me to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms and to ensure an accurate diagnosis. While it's possible we could proceed without it, I would strongly advise against it. Without a physical exam, we may miss something important, which could delay the appropriate treatment. I can assure you that the exam will be brief, discreet, and performed with the utmost respect for your dignity. I will explain everything before I do it, and you are free to stop at any time. If you are still uncomfortable, we could consult with another physician. However, they will likely recommend the same course of action. Would you be willing to proceed with the physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But make it quick, Doctor. And be gentle. I haven't the stamina for any… rough handling. And please, no unnecessary conversation. I simply want this over with. But I still maintain that this is all rather… unnecessary. A waste of time, that's what it is. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. And I will refrain from unnecessary conversation. Please, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I'll prepare the necessary materials. The restroom is just down the hall, and I’ll provide you with a sterile cup and instructions for collecting the sample. After that, we can proceed with the exam here in the room.
