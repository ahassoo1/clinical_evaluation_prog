DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, it’s… my stomach. It’s been, like, really bothering me. Just… a lot of diarrhea, for a while now. It's been on and off, but mostly on lately, if that makes sense? I… I think it's been going on for a few weeks, maybe more? It’s hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks of diarrhea, on and off but mostly on recently. That’s certainly not comfortable. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Um… okay. It's… watery, mostly. Not… not bloody or anything. And it happens… a lot. Like, several times a day. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes not. I don't… I don't really see a pattern. It just… comes on suddenly, usually. And it’s… uncomfortable, obviously. I’ve been trying to stay hydrated, but… it’s tiring. I don’t know if that helps?
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, thank you. Several times a day, watery, no blood, and seems to come on suddenly. You're right to focus on hydration – that's very important. It sounds exhausting. Now, besides the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I've been feeling a bit tired, yeah, really tired. More than usual. And… sometimes my stomach hurts, like cramping. Not all the time, but when the diarrhea is bad, definitely. Oh! And I haven’t been… as hungry as I normally am. I just don't feel like eating much. I don’t know if that's because of the stomach stuff, or… something else? I’m not sure. I guess… that’s about it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, cramping with the diarrhea, and a decreased appetite. That gives us a little more to work with. Now, thinking a bit broader, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting along with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever, not that I've noticed. And… no vomiting either, thankfully. I’ve just… been feeling generally unwell, you know? Just… off. But no, no actual sickness, like throwing up. Does that… help? I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear. It’s just… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: You’re being perfectly clear, Jase. It's good to know there’s been no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like irritable bowel syndrome or anything else affecting your digestive system?
PATIENT: Um… Oh, gosh. That’s a good question. I… I think so? My husband, he’s the one who usually handles all the doctor stuff. I think I was told something about… IBD? Or maybe celiac? Something like that. Years ago. They did a bunch of tests, and I had to change my diet for a while. But it was a long time ago, and… honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It wasn’t… super serious, as far as I know. I just… tried to eat what they told me to, and it got better. But it feels… different now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of potential IBD or celiac disease, diagnosed some time ago with dietary changes. That’s very important information, thank you. It does sound like this is different from what you've experienced before. Do you currently follow any specific diet, or have any food sensitivities that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Not at the moment. I mean, I try to eat healthy, but… I don’t have any specific restrictions, or anything. I eat pretty much everything. I used to be really careful about gluten, but that was years ago, when they first told me about the celiac thing. After a while, I started… easing up on it. And nothing happened, so I just… stopped being so strict. I probably shouldn’t have done that, should I?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're reflecting on that. Sometimes things can change over time, and revisiting past precautions is a good idea. Let's quickly go over your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, if I need it. But that’s it. And… I don't have any allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Nothing that I remember, anyway. I take Medicare, if that matters?
DOCTOR: That's good to know – no regular medications and no known allergies. And thank you for letting me know about your Medicare coverage. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s okay. I guess… whatever you need to do. I just… hope it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon, so… I don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Of course, I’ll be as quick as possible. Okay, I'm listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are… a little hyperactive, which isn't surprising with the diarrhea. I'm feeling your abdomen, and there's some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, but no significant guarding or rigidity. Overall, it doesn’t seem acutely concerning, but we'll need to investigate further to figure out the cause. To help us determine what's going on, I'd like to order a stool sample test. This will check for any infections or parasites that might be causing your symptoms. I’ll also order some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out any other potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. A stool sample? Okay. And blood work too. That's… fine. Whatever you think is best. Will it take long to get the results? I just… I'd like to know what's going on, you know? It's just… tiring, constantly worrying about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting answers quickly. The stool sample and blood work usually take 3-5 business days to come back. We’ll call you as soon as we have the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, it's important to stay hydrated, as you've been doing. I also recommend a bland diet – things like rice, toast, and bananas. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine, as these can worsen your symptoms. Given your history of potential IBD or celiac disease, and the fact that your symptoms have persisted despite a bland diet, I also think it might be helpful to consult with a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health. Would you be open to a referral?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? That sounds… serious. Is it that bad? I mean, I just thought it was a bit of a stomach bug, or something. I guess… if you think it's necessary. I just… I don't want to go through a lot of tests, if it’s not really needed. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a sign that things are bad, Jase. It's more about getting a thorough evaluation, given your history and the persistence of your symptoms. Sometimes, these things can be tricky to diagnose, and a specialist has more experience in those cases. The gastroenterologist can perform further testing, such as a colonoscopy or endoscopy, to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your digestive system. But we don’t need to jump to those immediately. We’ll start with the stool sample and blood work, and if those aren’t conclusive, then we can discuss the possibility of a referral. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, that sounds… better. Start with the tests, and then… then we'll see. If it's needed, I guess I can talk to the specialist. Okay. That sounds like a plan. So… what do I need to do about the stool sample? Do I need a special container? And where do I go for the blood work?
DOCTOR: Great. That’s a very reasonable approach. I’ll have the nurse provide you with a stool sample collection kit and instructions before you leave. It’s a fairly straightforward process, but make sure to follow the instructions carefully. You’ll need to collect a small sample in the provided container and bring it to the lab within a certain timeframe. For the blood work, you can go to the lab at [Name of Lab], located at [Address of Lab]. The nurse will also give you a lab requisition form with the tests that need to be done. You don’t need an appointment, but it’s best to go during regular business hours. Here’s a list of resources with more information about diarrhea and potential causes: [Provides links to reputable medical websites]. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. That’s a lot of information, but… thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I guess I'll go talk to the nurse, and get the kits and forms. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on soon. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. It sounds like you have a good plan, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. The nurse is just outside, and she'll be happy to assist you with everything. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
