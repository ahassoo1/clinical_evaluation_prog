DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. VODZAK. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s not really a thing, you know? Just needin’ to get some forms filled out for somethin’. Medicare sent ‘em, and figured it was easier to do it here with someone who could answer if I get stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Medicare forms can definitely be… extensive. Please, have a seat. We can absolutely work through them together. Is there a specific form you’d like to start with, or would you like me to pull them up on the computer?
PATIENT: Pullin' ‘em up on the computer sounds good. My eyes ain't what they used to be, small print and all. I don't really know where to start, honestly. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Alright, it looks like this first section is a general health questionnaire – just asking about any current medical conditions, past surgeries, medications you’re taking, and allergies. Perhaps we can start there?
PATIENT: Sounds good. Let's see… Current medical conditions… I got a little bit of arthritis in my knees, mostly just aches when the weather changes. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Other than that, I'm pretty lucky, I guess. No surgeries before that, nothin' major.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, and gallbladder removal ten years ago. Good to know. Do you mind if I ask a little more about the arthritis?
PATIENT: Not at all. It mostly bothers me in the winter, and when it’s gonna rain. Gets stiff and achy, you know? I try to stay active, walkin' when I can, but sometimes it's just too much. I don't take anythin' for it regularly, just some over-the-counter pain reliever if it gets really bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's weather-related, and you manage it with over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. That’s helpful information. Have you ever been officially diagnosed with arthritis by a doctor, or is this something you've just assumed based on the symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm, you know, I don’t think I officially went to a doctor for it. My mom had arthritis bad, and it felt the same, so I just figured that’s what it was. I just started takin' care of it like she did. I guess I should probably get it checked out, huh? I just haven't gotten around to it, to be honest. Life gets busy.
DOCTOR: It’s very common to self-diagnose based on family history, and completely understandable with a busy life. While it’s good you’ve been managing it, it might be worthwhile to get a proper diagnosis just to rule out anything else and explore other treatment options. We can discuss a referral to a rheumatologist if you’d like. Now, back to the forms… you mentioned your gallbladder removal ten years ago. Was there any complications with that surgery?
PATIENT: No complications at all, thankfully. Went in, they took it out, I healed up pretty quick. Everything went smoothly, knock on wood. I was in the hospital for a couple of days, just standard recovery stuff. They said it was gettin' inflamed, so better to take it out than risk it burstin'.
DOCTOR: Good, good. That's reassuring to hear. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let's see… just the occasional ibuprofen for my knees, like I said. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I'm pretty bad about rememberin' to do that regularly. It sits on the kitchen counter and judges me, mostly. That's about it, really. Nothin' long-term, nothin’ a doctor prescribed.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed, and an occasional multivitamin. Okay. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, like latex or pollen?
PATIENT: Nope, thankfully. I've never really had an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat whatever, take most medicines, don't get too bothered by pollen. I'm pretty lucky that way too, I guess. My sister's allergic to everything under the sun, so I feel extra grateful.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to know. It makes things much simpler! Before we move on with the rest of these forms, is there anything you wanted to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for right now. Just needin’ to get these filled out, like I said. You’re doin’ a good job askin’ the right questions, though. It’s good to know someone’s payin’ attention!
DOCTOR: Well, I'm glad to hear that! My goal is always to get a complete picture of your health. Okay, let's move on to the next section of the form. It asks about your family medical history… do you know much about your parents’ and grandparents’ health conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a little tougher. My mom, she had arthritis really bad, like I said. And high blood pressure, I think. She was always gettin’ it checked. My dad… he died pretty young, heart attack when I was a teenager. Didn't really talk about health stuff much in my family, to be honest. Mostly just toughed things out. Grandparents… I don’t remember a whole lot about their health, they passed when I was little. I know my grandma on my mom's side had diabetes, I think. But that’s about all I can recall, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had arthritis and high blood pressure, your father passed away from a heart attack at a young age, and your maternal grandmother had diabetes. That's helpful to know. We can just put “unknown” for the rest, if you're not sure. Now, this section asks about your social history… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked a day in my life. My mom smoked, and it wasn't pretty, so that kinda scared me off. I'll have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested, never needed 'em. Healthy livin’ as much as I can, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! Very sensible choices. Now, just a few more questions to finish up this section… What is your current occupation?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm a control and valve installer and repairer. Mostly workin' with pipes and stuff, makin' sure things are runnin' smooth. It's a good job, keeps me busy and movin’. Not always easy, but I like it. Been doin’ it for a while now.
DOCTOR: That sounds physically demanding! And finally, do you have any significant stressors in your life currently?
PATIENT: Well...my oldest grandson's gettin' married next spring, so plannin’ that’s a bit of a stress, but a good stress, you know? And my husband's been havin' some trouble with his back, so helpin' him with that's sometimes stressful. Other than that, not too bad. Life's pretty good. Just the normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that completes the questionnaire. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you’re generally healthy, with a history of arthritis and a family history of heart disease and diabetes. I'm a little concerned about the heart disease history, given your father’s early death. We should definitely get a baseline EKG and some blood work to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Better safe than sorry, right? I’m glad you asked about my dad’s heart trouble. I always meant to get that checked out, but life just gets in the way, you know? So yeah, EKG and blood work sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Dr. VODZAK.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. We can easily get those ordered for you today. The nurse will come in shortly and draw your blood, and we can schedule an EKG for you later this week. Now, while we’re waiting for the results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think you covered everything pretty good. You asked all the right questions. I'm just glad I came in and got this done. It’s a weight off my mind, honestly. Thank you, Dr. VODZAK.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm glad I could help. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and we can discuss the results when they come back. If anything does come up in the meantime, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day, and congratulations on your grandson’s upcoming wedding!
