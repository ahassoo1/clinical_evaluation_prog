DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor... Panjoj, is it? Yes. Look, I ain’t got all day. I need a paper signed. Something about... getting some work done. Cosmetic, they called it. My nephew, he said I gotta get you to say it’s alright before they do it. Don’t rightly recall the details, to be honest. Just need the okay.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand. A form for cosmetic work, needing my approval. Let’s try to clarify a few details, if you don’t mind. It’ll help me ensure this is appropriate for you. Could you tell me what kind of work they are proposing?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don’t recall! It’s… on my face. Something about smoothing things out. Wrinkles, maybe? My skin ain't what it used to be, that’s for certain. I work outside, you see. Towers, antennas… sun. It’s a lot of sun. But I don't need you to tell me about wrinkles, Doctor. Just… can you sign the paper or not? I got appointments. Real ones.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. I’m not trying to delay things unnecessarily. However, even for cosmetic procedures, I have a responsibility to ensure you understand the potential risks and benefits. It’s also important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that might affect the procedure or your healing. Could you tell me who the provider is who will be performing this procedure?
PATIENT: Provider? Now you're talking funny. It’s… Reginald. Reginald Something-or-other. He’s got a shop in town. New business, I think. My nephew, Jamal, he set it all up. Said Reginald was… affordable. Look, I just need the form signed. I ain’t got time for a history lesson or… provider names. Is that what you need? A name? It's Reginald! Now, can we get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. Reginald. I'm going to need a little more than just the name, I’m afraid. Do you happen to know the name of the shop, or the address?
PATIENT: Address? Doctor, really! It’s a small town! You just… drive around, you’ll find it. It's new, I told you. Bright signs. Lots of flashing lights. It’s on… Main Street, I think? Maybe Elm? One of those streets. Honestly, I don't pay attention to street names. I’m a tower man, not a map reader. Look, are you going to sign this or not? I’m wasting valuable time. I got things to do. Real important tower things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I cannot simply sign a form without knowing exactly what procedure is being proposed and who will be performing it. It’s a matter of your safety and my professional responsibility. I need to be able to verify their credentials and ensure this is appropriate for you. Before I can proceed, I need a specific name for the shop, or at least a phone number so I can verify the information. Otherwise, I’m afraid I cannot sign this form. Perhaps we can contact your nephew, Jamal, who arranged this?
PATIENT: Now listen here, Doctor! You're makin' a big fuss over nothin'! My nephew knows what he's doin'! He's a smart boy, Jamal is. And I don’t appreciate bein' questioned like this. I’m a grown man, and I can decide what I do with my face! I’m askin' you politely, one last time: sign the paper! I ain't got time for this. You want a number? Fine. It’s… 555-1212. But if this causes me to lose money, you’ll be hearin’ from my lawyer! Now, sign the paper! .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Honcoop. Please allow me a moment to check this information. Mr. Honcoop, I've found some concerning information regarding Reginald Finch. He does not appear to be a licensed medical professional, and there are reports of… substandard care. I cannot, in good conscience, sign this form, as it could put your health at serious risk. I strongly advise you to reconsider proceeding with this procedure. Would you be open to discussing alternative, qualified providers?
