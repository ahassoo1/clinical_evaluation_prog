DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me over, said I needed to do this to keep things current. Nothing specific bothering me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, of course. Medicare…always with the paperwork. Very well. While we are addressing the required documentation, it would be prudent – and frankly, a better use of my time – to at least conduct a brief review of your medical history. It’s been some time since your last comprehensive exam, according to the record. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really. I had a bit of trouble with high blood pressure a few years back, but it went down with diet and exercise, and the doctor said it wasn’t anything to worry about too much. Other than that…no, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise. I try to stay active, you know? Lots of walking and helping out on the reservation.
DOCTOR: “Not too much,” is…a rather imprecise metric, Ms. Fabing. We require specifics. Do you recall when this blood pressure elevation was diagnosed, and what the readings were at the time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics…right. It was…probably about five years ago, maybe six? I saw Doctor Red Elk back then – he's retired now. And the readings…I honestly don’t remember the numbers. It was high enough that he wanted me to watch my salt intake and get more exercise. He didn’t put me on any medicine or anything, just said to check it regularly and come back if it didn’t come down. I did, and it did, so I didn’t really write it down. I’m sorry I don’t have better information for you.
DOCTOR: A rather…lax approach from Dr. Red Elk, I must say. Regardless. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. Thankfully. Just the usual…broken bones when I was a kid, being a bit of a tomboy, but nothing serious. Nothing that needed a hospital stay, anyway. Mostly just bumps and bruises.
DOCTOR: And what about surgical history?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries either. Never had a need for any, knock on wood. I’ve been pretty fortunate, as I said. My grandmother always said good living and strong spirit keep you healthy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Family history then. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years back…about ten years ago now. She had a bit of trouble with her heart, but she lived a good long life. My dad’s still around, though! He’s… eighty-five, I think. Pretty spry for his age, still working on his ranch.
DOCTOR: And did your mother’s heart condition present any specific issues?
PATIENT: It was…mostly just a weakening of the heart muscle, I think. She got tired easily, and her legs would swell up sometimes. Eventually, she had to take it easy and couldn't do much around the house. It wasn't sudden, it was just…slowly getting worse over time. I don’t remember the exact name of what she had, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: “Slowly getting worse” is…not a diagnosis, Ms. Fabing. But we shall proceed. Does your father have any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, my dad…He's pretty healthy for his age, honestly. He’s got a little arthritis in his hands, makes it hard for him to do some things, but otherwise he’s doing okay. He had a scare a few years back with his cholesterol being high, but he changed his diet and got it under control. He’s a tough old bird, my dad.
DOCTOR: And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… You mean like…do I smoke or drink? No, I don’t smoke, never have. And I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing excessive. I work, mostly. And spend time with my family. Is there something specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: Do you engage in any regular strenuous physical activity beyond what you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Well… I help my husband with some work on the ranch sometimes, mending fences, things like that. That can be pretty physical. And I go for long walks pretty regularly, like I said. It’s not like I’m running marathons or anything, but I try to stay active. Does that count as strenuous? It depends on the day, I guess.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if my joints are acting up, but that's about it. Nothing regular, just when I need it. That’s everything, I think. A multivitamin and ibuprofen when needed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s conduct a brief physical examination. I need to auscultate your lungs and heart, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. I will begin with your lungs. Take a deep breath…and exhale slowly.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Taking a deep breath… There. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear bilaterally. No adventitious sounds noted. Heart rate is regular, approximately 72 beats per minute. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Physical exam unremarkable. Blood pressure is 130/80. Weight is 70 kilograms. Height is 171 centimeters, resulting in a BMI of 23.9. Given your reported history and unremarkable physical exam, it appears you are in generally good health. However, your blood pressure reading is slightly elevated. I recommend you monitor it at home for one week. If it remains consistently above 140/90, we should investigate further.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, mostly! I was worried it might be something more. Okay, I can definitely do that, monitor it at home. Is there a specific kind of monitor you recommend? And what numbers should I be writing down exactly? And… about those forms? Are we done with those now?
DOCTOR: A digital blood pressure cuff is preferable for accuracy, but a manual one is acceptable, provided it is properly calibrated. Record both systolic and diastolic readings, as well as the time of day. Aim for at least two readings per day – morning and evening – preferably before meals and after a period of rest. As for the forms…yes. The required documentation is now complete. I will submit this to Medicare now. It may take several business days for processing. I will have my assistant contact you should any further information be required. Do you have any further questions for me, Ms. Fabing?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything, and for not making a big deal out of the blood pressure. And thank you for getting those forms done! It’s a relief to have that over with. I guess I’ll be seeing you if my blood pressure gets too high, then?
DOCTOR: Precisely. Should your blood pressure remain elevated after one week of home monitoring, schedule an appointment with my office. We will discuss further evaluation and potential management options. Very well, Ms. Fabing. Have a pleasant day.
