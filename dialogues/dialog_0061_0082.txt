DOCTOR: Bula! And hello to you. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's nice to meet you, Odell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh… hi. Yeah, nice meet you too. Something about… travel? My wife, she… she booked this. I don't really remember all the details. We are going somewhere. Hot place, I think. She said I need… shots? For travel.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright! It’s common to leave the planning to someone else. So, you're here for travel vaccinations, that's great. To make sure I get you the right ones, can you tell me a little more about where you and your wife are traveling to?
PATIENT: Ugh, details… She had all the papers. Somewhere… far. Lots of trees, I think. And… bugs. Definitely bugs. Not… America. Not Nepal. Somewhere else. She liked… old things, you know? Ruins? We were going to see ruins. Is that helpful? I'm sorry, I really don't remember much. She always did the planning.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Odell. It's okay. We can figure this out. "Lots of trees, bugs, and ruins" gives us something to work with! Let’s try this. Roughly how long is the trip going to be?
PATIENT: Hmm… long. A few weeks, maybe? She said it was important to have time. Time for… pictures. She liked taking pictures of everything. Not a quick trip, definitely. Longer than two weeks, I think. Maybe a month? It was… important to her. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks to a month. And you mentioned it was important to her. I understand this might be a sensitive time for you. Just to clarify, do you have any idea what continent you’re traveling to?
PATIENT: Continent?… What's a continent? Is that… like, a country? I know countries. America, Nepal, Fiji… Is it one of those? She said it was… different. Very different from Nepal. Dusty, she said. Hot and dusty. And… old. Very, very old. Not like… Europe. She didn't like Europe. Too many… people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. A continent is a really big area of land. Bigger than a country. Think of it like… a super-big country. So, not Europe… hot and dusty… not Nepal. Let me ask a different question. Has she mentioned anything about animals you might see there?
PATIENT: Animals… She liked monkeys. She had pictures of monkeys. And… snakes, maybe? Not big snakes, she said. Small ones. Colorful ones. And… camels? I think she said something about camels. She liked looking at camels in pictures. She always showed me pictures before we went somewhere. She said it was good to be prepared. But I… I don't remember where we were going. It's all a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Monkeys, colorful snakes, and camels… that definitely narrows things down. Based on what you've told me, it sounds like you might be traveling to a country in Africa, or possibly the Middle East. Would either of those sound right to you?
PATIENT: Africa… maybe? I think she said something about Egypt? Pyramids… and… the desert. Yes, I remember pyramids! Big, pointy things. And sand. Lots and lots of sand. Is Egypt in Africa? She liked old things. Very, very old things. That sounds right… Egypt. Yes, I think it's Egypt. But… I still feel like I’m forgetting something important. She was so excited about it.
DOCTOR: Egypt sounds very likely, Odell. That fits everything you’ve described. And it's perfectly normal to feel a little overwhelmed or forgetful, especially with everything you're going through. Don’t worry about it. Okay, so Egypt. Great. To make sure I can give you the right vaccinations, are you planning on staying in cities and hotels, or will you be going into more rural areas?
PATIENT: Rural… what does that mean? Cities, yes. We stayed in cities. Nice hotels. She liked nice hotels. Air conditioning, she said. And… clean bathrooms. Not… camping. Definitely not camping. She didn’t like bugs in the hotel. Just… outside. Lots of outside bugs. So… cities. And hotels. Good hotels. Is that helpful? I think she also wanted to see… the river? The big river.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Odell. So, staying in cities, good hotels, and visiting the Nile River. That gives me a much clearer picture. Now, before we talk about vaccinations, I want to quickly check a few things. Have you had any vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: Vaccinations…? I don't think so. In Nepal, we didn’t… get many shots. Maybe for… children things? When I was little. But not… travel shots. She was supposed to check. She had all the papers… I think she did check. But I don’t remember. It was… a long time ago. I think I just got the normal things. Whatever everyone gets. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, no documented vaccinations on file. That’s alright, we can get you up to date. To be safe, we’ll assume you haven’t had any travel-specific shots. Now, I need to ask a few questions about your health history. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or medical conditions?
PATIENT: Serious…? Hmm. I had… a fever, once. When I was young. But everyone gets fevers, right? And… I broke my arm, when I was a boy. Climbing a tree. But that's it. Nothing… serious. She took care of everything. She always took me to the doctor when I was sick. She worried a lot. About everything. Is… is this important? I'm starting to feel a little… dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fever as a child and a broken arm. That’s good to know. And yes, feeling a little dizzy is important to mention. We can check your blood pressure in a moment. Just one more question for now, and then we can take things slowly. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don't think so. I eat everything. My wife cooked everything. I never had… a reaction. Nothing. She asked me once, but I told her no. No allergies. Just… the usual things. Dust, maybe? Everyone sneezes in the dust, right? But not… a serious allergy. Nothing that makes me… sick. I think she wrote it down, though. She always wrote things down.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s take a quick look at your blood pressure and temperature, just to be on the safe side. Then we can talk about the vaccinations you'll need for Egypt, and I can answer any questions you might have. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… okay. A little tired, maybe. But okay. Egypt sounds nice. My wife… she really wanted to see the pyramids. I hope I can… remember everything. She would have liked that. Is it… safe in Egypt? I heard things on the news… bad things. She said it was okay, though. She always knew what was safe.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable to be concerned about safety, Odell. It’s always good to be informed. Egypt has certain areas that are safer for tourists than others, and we can discuss precautions to take. Your wife was right to research it beforehand. We’ll focus on keeping you healthy and safe, and making sure you can enjoy the trip. First, let's just check your blood pressure… Can you extend your arm for me?
PATIENT: Okay… I just… I keep forgetting things. She would have remembered everything. She always did. I hope I don't mess everything up. This trip… it was important to her. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel a little overwhelmed right now, Odell. It sounds like your wife was very organized and took care of a lot of things, and it’s okay to feel a little lost without her. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll make sure you have all the information you need. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. We can keep an eye on it. Your temperature is normal. Now, about the vaccinations. For travel to Egypt, I recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. Depending on where you’re going, we might also consider Yellow Fever, but we can discuss that further. We’ll also want to make sure your routine vaccinations are up to date. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… Typhoid… Yellow Fever…? That’s a lot. She probably already knew about all this. I don’t… I don’t understand. Are these… shots? Do they hurt? She said it was important to get them, but I don’t remember why. And… what does “routine” mean? Is this… expensive? I don't want to spend too much money. She would have known what to do. She always took care of everything.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Odell. It is a lot of information, and it’s perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed. Let’s slow down. Hepatitis A and Typhoid are vaccinations that protect you from infections you can get through contaminated food and water, which can be more common in certain parts of Egypt. They are given as shots, and they can cause a little soreness for a day or two, but usually not too bad. "Routine" vaccinations are the ones most people get as children, like tetanus and measles, just to make sure your immunity is up to date. We can definitely talk about the cost, and I can help you with insurance information. We don't want to add any extra stress. It sounds like your wife did a lot of research, which is great. We'll honor her efforts and make sure you’re prepared. How about we focus on the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations for now?
PATIENT: Okay… Hepatitis A and Typhoid. Those sound… scary. What happens if I don't get them? Will I get sick? Very sick? She said it was important to be careful. She always worried about germs. She used hand sanitizer all the time. And… what if I forget something? What if I get lost? She always knew the way. I… I'm starting to feel a little… panicked. I don’t think I can do this alone.
DOCTOR: It's okay to feel panicked, Odell. It's completely understandable, and you’re not alone. You've been through a lot, and planning a trip without your wife is incredibly difficult. Let's take a deep breath. Hepatitis A and Typhoid are preventable illnesses. If you don't get the vaccinations, you are at a higher risk of getting sick if you are exposed to the viruses. The illnesses can cause fever, nausea, and stomach problems, and in some cases, can be serious, but they are treatable. The vaccinations significantly reduce your risk. We'll do everything we can to make this as easy and stress-free as possible. I can provide you with a list of resources for safe travel in Egypt, including recommended restaurants and transportation options. I can also help you with a packing list and other helpful information. We can even discuss having someone travel with you, if you think that would make you feel more comfortable. Right now, let's just focus on getting these vaccinations scheduled. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Scheduling… okay. Yes. That sounds… manageable. If I get the shots, maybe I won't get sick. Maybe I can… do this. But what if I forget everything I need to bring? She always made a list. A very detailed list. And… what if I get lost? She knew all the streets. I'm… I'm really scared. This trip… it was supposed to be special. For her. But now… I don't know if I can do it without her.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be scared, Odell. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed, and it's brave of you to even consider going on this trip in her memory. She would be so proud of you. We’ll create a very detailed packing list together, just like she would have. We can also map out the routes you'll be taking, and I can provide you with contact information for local guides who can help you navigate the area. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. I can even connect you with a travel companion if you'd like. Let’s focus on getting the vaccinations scheduled for today. We can work on the other details later, at your own pace. How about we just book the appointments now, and then we can take a break and I can get you a glass of water?
PATIENT: Okay… appointments. Just the appointments for now. That… that sounds okay. Water would be nice. Yes, water. And… thank you. For being patient. She… she would have liked you. She always knew the right people. She always knew what to do. Just… the appointments. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Odell. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll just focus on the appointments for now. Okay, let me see… We have an opening next Tuesday at 10:00 AM for the Hepatitis A vaccination, and then we can schedule the Typhoid vaccination for the following week. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday… at ten. Yes. That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn't take too long. I… I get nervous at the doctor's office. She always held my hand. She said it would be okay. And… is it expensive? I don't have much money. She always took care of the bills. Please… don't let it be too expensive.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just double-check… Your insurance covers both vaccinations with a small co-pay of $25 each. So, a total of $50. I can also connect you with our financial assistance program if you're concerned about the cost. And don't worry, the vaccinations don't take long at all – just a few minutes each. I’ll explain everything beforehand, and I’ll be right there with you the whole time. I can also have a nurse hold your hand if you'd like. How does that sound?
PATIENT: $50… okay. I can… manage that. A nurse holding my hand… that would be… nice. Yes, that would be very nice. Tuesday at ten… with the nurse. And… thank you. For being so patient. And… for everything. I think… I think I can do this. Maybe. Just… maybe.
DOCTOR: You absolutely can do this, Odell. And you’re very welcome. That’s what I’m here for. Okay, I’ve scheduled your Hepatitis A vaccination for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. We’ll schedule the Typhoid vaccination during that appointment. Now, let's take a moment to catch our breath. I'll get you that glass of water, and then we can talk about what to expect during the vaccinations, and I can provide you with some helpful resources for safe travel in Egypt. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Water… yes. That sounds… perfect. And… thank you. Again. For being so kind. She would have… she would have liked you very much. I think… I think I’m starting to feel a little better. Maybe. Just a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Odell. I’m glad to hear you’re starting to feel a little better. And I'm honored to meet you as well. Here you go. Take your time. We can take things at your own pace. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Now, let's talk about what to expect during the vaccinations…
