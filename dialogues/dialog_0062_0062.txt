DOCTOR: Hi Rayshun, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor DeCosta. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here today regarding a matter with my work. I need to discuss the possibility of an exemption from the requirement to wear masks and certain other protective equipment. It's…causing some difficulties at my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're hoping to get some medical documentation to support a request for an exemption at work. That's perfectly reasonable. To help me with that, can you tell me a bit more about what difficulties you're experiencing with the masks and equipment?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. The masks…they make it very hard to breathe, particularly during physical exertion. My work requires me to be… quite active at times, and it feels like I am not getting enough air. It’s causing dizziness and a feeling of being…overwhelmed. It's not a comfort, I assure you. And some of the other equipment...it feels restrictive and causes a fair amount of discomfort. It interferes with my ability to do my job safely, for everyone involved.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds very concerning, Rayshun. Dizziness with exertion is definitely something we need to take seriously. Just to get a clearer picture, how long have you been experiencing these symptoms – the dizziness and feeling overwhelmed – when wearing the masks and equipment?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It began roughly three months ago, when the mask requirement was first put in place at my workplace. At first, it was just mild discomfort. But it has steadily worsened over time, particularly in the last six weeks or so. The dizziness…that’s become much more frequent and noticeable during even moderate physical activity. It’s… unsettling. I’ve tried different types of masks, hoping one might be better, but none have truly resolved the issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, worsening over the last six weeks, and you've tried different mask types without relief. And it's happening with exertion. That’s helpful to know. Before we go further, do you have any history of lung problems, like asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no history of any lung issues. I have always been… reasonably healthy, despite the demands of my profession. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, nor have I ever experienced breathing difficulties prior to this situation with the masks. I have a good strong constitution, and I take pride in my physical abilities, but this… this is something new and concerning. I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about any heart conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No heart conditions that I am aware of. I’ve had a yearly physical for as long as I can remember, and nothing of that nature has ever been indicated. My doctor always said I had a strong heart…a necessary quality for my line of work. It is… unsettling to experience these difficulties without an obvious cause. It makes me worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No history of lung or heart issues. Now, have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, or even COVID-19 – in the past few months?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I did have a rather mild cold about a month and a half ago. It lasted only a few days, and I recovered completely. No fever, no significant cough…just a stuffy nose and a sore throat. But no flu, and I have not been diagnosed with COVID-19. I did receive all of the recommended vaccinations, however. I believe it was last fall when I had the latest booster. I try to be responsible about my health, and the health of those around me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold about a month and a half ago, and you're up-to-date on your vaccinations. That's helpful. Now, just to get a broader picture, are you experiencing any other symptoms at all – things like chest pain, palpitations, excessive fatigue, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain, nor have I noticed any palpitations. I do experience fatigue at times, but that is…to be expected given the strenuous nature of my work. It’s a normal tiredness, not an unusual exhaustion. And I have not experienced any unexplained weight loss. I maintain a fairly consistent weight, though admittedly, it fluctuates slightly depending on the demands of my job. But nothing concerning in that regard, I assure you. It is just this breathing difficulty…that is the primary concern.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, primarily the breathing difficulty with exertion, starting about three months ago, worsening over the last six weeks, no prior lung or heart issues, a mild cold a month and a half ago, and no other significant symptoms. To get a better sense of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and do a brief assessment of your overall respiratory effort. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. I am happy to cooperate in any way that may help determine the cause of this issue. Please proceed with the examination. I trust your expertise and am hopeful that we can find a solution to this problem. It is… disconcerting to feel limited in my abilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart sounds strong, and your lungs are clear bilaterally, though I do note a slightly increased respiratory rate at rest – it's 20 breaths per minute, which is a little elevated. I also notice you're using some accessory muscles – muscles in your neck – to breathe, which suggests you are working a little harder than you should be at rest. Your oxygen saturation is 97% on room air, which is good. Do you feel any tenderness in your neck?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. There is a slight tenderness… right about there. Not severe, but noticeable. It feels…tight, and a little sore to the touch. It's been present for several weeks, roughly coinciding with the onset of the breathing difficulties. It's not a constant pain, but it’s exacerbated by… physical exertion and… prolonged use of the masks. I hadn’t mentioned it previously, as I assumed it was simply muscle strain, but now that you ask… it is indeed a discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay, that tenderness is good to know. It could be related to the increased effort you're putting into breathing, or it could be a separate issue. I'd like to check your range of motion in your neck, just to rule out any structural problems. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… somewhat restricted, Doctor. Not painful, but there is a definite stiffness, particularly when turning my head to the left. And when looking upwards, I experience a slight…tightness in the muscles at the base of my neck. It’s not excruciating, but it’s noticeable. It feels… as if the muscles are not moving as freely as they should be. I have not experienced this level of stiffness before. It’s possible that I strained it at work, but I cannot recall any specific incident that would have caused this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that restriction in range of motion and the tenderness are concerning. It sounds like you may have some muscle tension and possibly some inflammation in your neck muscles. To rule out anything more serious, and to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some basic blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, and thyroid function. Additionally, I recommend a chest X-ray to ensure there's nothing going on in your lungs that we need to address. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have no known allergies to medications, nor have I ever had a reaction to contrast dye. I have received vaccinations and occasional medications throughout my life without incident. I am generally… quite tolerant of medical interventions. I understand the importance of these tests and am happy to proceed. I trust your judgment and appreciate your thoroughness. I want to resolve this issue as quickly as possible, and I am willing to cooperate in any way that may help.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. I'll get the lab orders and X-ray requisition sent to the lab and radiology department. They’ll contact you to schedule the tests. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. We can also try some conservative measures to alleviate the muscle tension in your neck. I can prescribe a muscle relaxant and suggest over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with any discomfort. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… reasonable. I am willing to try those measures. I have utilized over-the-counter pain relievers in the past without issue, and a muscle relaxant may indeed provide some relief. I am mindful of the potential side effects, of course, but I trust your expertise and believe the benefits outweigh the risks in this situation. I am eager to find some relief from this discomfort, and I am willing to cooperate in any way that may help. Thank you for your thoroughness and your willingness to assist me.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write you a prescription for cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant, and recommend you take it as directed. I'll also provide a handout with instructions on proper neck stretching and range-of-motion exercises. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the lab and X-ray results and assess your progress. If your symptoms worsen before then, or if you develop any new symptoms – such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have addressed all of my concerns. I understand the instructions regarding the medication, the exercises, and the follow-up appointment. I appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to assist me. I am hopeful that we can find a solution to this problem and that I will be able to return to my work duties soon. Thank you again for your assistance. I believe that will be all for today.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I'll have the nurse come in to provide you with the prescriptions and handouts. Have a good day, Rayshun. And thank you for coming in.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor DeCosta. You have a good day as well. I appreciate your kindness and expertise. .
