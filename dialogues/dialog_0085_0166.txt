DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s become… persistent enough that I thought I should have it checked out. It’s mostly in my left leg, though it occasionally drifts to my right.
DOCTOR: Okay, numbness in your left leg, sometimes drifting to the right. That's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a rather peculiar sensation. Not exactly pain, more like… the leg isn’t quite there, if that makes sense. Like when it falls asleep, but it doesn’t always go away when I move it. It’s been happening consistently for about two weeks now, though it started as an occasional tingling that I initially dismissed. It seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or if I’ve been particularly focused on my work. I do a lot of animation, which requires long periods of sitting, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like a ‘falling asleep’ sensation, not quite pain, and it doesn’t always resolve with movement. It’s been consistent for two weeks, started as tingling, and seems worse with prolonged standing or sitting – especially related to your animation work. That's helpful. Could you tell me where exactly on your left leg you're feeling this numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It's… it’s not localized to one specific spot, unfortunately. It often begins in my foot, specifically along the outside edge, and then travels up through my calf. Sometimes it extends all the way up to my thigh, though less frequently. It’s rarely in my upper leg. And occasionally, like this morning, I feel it in the back of my leg, near the hamstring. It shifts, really. It’s not a consistent pattern as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it starts in the foot – along the outside edge – and travels up the calf, sometimes to the thigh and occasionally the hamstring. It shifts and isn’t consistently in one place. Alright. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Movement does help, surprisingly. Not vigorous exercise, mind you, but gentle stretching and walking around. Just getting up and shifting my weight seems to alleviate it somewhat. And… warm baths. Soaking in warm water seems to temporarily ease the sensation. It doesn't remove it entirely, but it makes it more tolerable. I find that cold doesn't do much at all, though. If anything, it seems to aggravate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, movement and warm baths help, while cold makes it worse. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, and I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. I do wear glasses, as you can see, but that’s it. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing significant. I try to maintain a reasonably healthy diet and get adequate sleep, although the long hours working can sometimes interfere with that. I have private insurance, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No diagnosed conditions, just glasses. You try to stay healthy, but work hours can get in the way. And yes, the insurance information is helpful. Have you ever had any injuries to your back, hips, or legs?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Not that I recall, at least. I was quite active as a child – a lot of hiking and fishing with my family – but I never sustained any serious injuries. I might have twisted an ankle once or twice, but nothing that required medical attention. I’ve been reasonably careful to avoid falls and strains, and I always warm up properly before any physical activity. I haven't had any accidents involving those areas of my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no injuries to your back, hips, or legs. That’s good. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a bit of a tricky question. My mother’s side of the family… they weren’t particularly forthcoming about medical history. It wasn't something openly discussed. My father, though, he had some issues with arthritis in his knees later in life, but I don’t believe it was a hereditary condition. His mother also had some heart problems, but again, it wasn't a strongly established pattern. I have an older sister, and she seems to be in good health, as far as I know. We don't have a great deal of contact, so I’m not entirely sure. I believe my paternal grandfather had diabetes, but I'm not certain. It’s a rather fragmented picture, I’m afraid. I can try to gather more information if you think it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fragmented family history – arthritis, potential heart problems, and possible diabetes. That’s alright, it’s not uncommon. We can work with what you have. Now, just a few more questions. Do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. I avoid taking medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal naturally, within reason, of course. I occasionally take a multivitamin, just to ensure I'm getting all the necessary nutrients, but that’s the extent of it. And I stopped taking that a few months ago, to be perfectly honest. I wanted to see if it was affecting anything, and it doesn't seem to have made any difference. I don't use any herbal supplements or anything of that nature either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Good. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten a wide variety of foods throughout my life, and I’ve never experienced any adverse effects. I’ve also never had any allergic reactions to insect bites or pollen, or anything of that nature. I’m not particularly sensitive to anything, as far as I know. I occasionally get a bit of a runny nose during allergy season, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Excellent. Alright, Tarin, I've reviewed your basic information. It looks like your height is 189cm and weight is 87kg. Now, let's do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand a physical examination is necessary to properly assess the situation. Please proceed at your own pace, and let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical on both sides. Good. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you resist me as I try to move your legs?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’ll do my best. Just let me know what you’d like me to do. I understand that resistance is important for gauging strength. I’ll try to maintain a consistent effort throughout the test. I'm ready when you are, Doctor. Please be gentle, if you wouldn't mind. I tend to be rather… wiry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, your muscle strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in both legs. That's good. Now, let's check your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch your legs with this cotton ball. Just tell me when you feel it. Your sensation is intact in both legs. Now, I’m going to palpate your spine and legs, feeling for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or abnormalities. Finally, I'm going to check your gait, just to see how you walk. Would you mind walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m happy to oblige. I understand the importance of assessing my gait. I’ll try to walk normally, as I usually do. I believe that’s a fairly representative sample of my usual walk. Is there anything else you’d like me to do? I’ll follow your instructions as precisely as I can. I’m feeling a little stiff now, but that’s probably just from being still for so long.
DOCTOR: Okay, your gait appears normal overall, though I did notice a slight asymmetry in your stride length on your left leg. It's very subtle, but it's something to note. Alright, Tarin. Based on the physical exam, your reflexes and muscle strength are normal and symmetrical. Sensation is intact, and there are no significant tendernesses or abnormalities. I did observe a slight asymmetry in your stride length on your left leg. Given your symptoms – numbness in your leg, worse with prolonged standing or sitting, relieved by movement and warm baths – and the physical exam findings, it's possible this is related to nerve compression. The slight asymmetry in your gait further supports that possibility. However, to rule out other potential causes, I’d like to order some imaging. I recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to visualize the nerves and rule out any spinal stenosis or disc herniation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI sounds… reasonable, Doctor. If it will help determine the cause of the numbness and rule out more serious issues, then I’m certainly in agreement. I understand that imaging is a necessary step in the diagnostic process. I’m happy to proceed with the MRI. Are there any preparations I need to make beforehand? And do you have any idea about the cost, or where I might find information regarding that?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. An MRI is the next step. As for preparation, you shouldn’t eat or drink anything for about two hours before the scan, and you’ll need to remove any metal jewelry or accessories. If you have any metal implants, please let the MRI technician know beforehand. Regarding cost, it can vary depending on your insurance coverage. I can write you a referral for the MRI, and the imaging center will handle the insurance pre-authorization and billing process. They can give you a more accurate estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I can provide you with the contact information for a few reputable imaging centers in the area if you'd like. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend continuing the gentle stretching and warm baths. You could also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you're comfortable with that. Would you like me to write that referral for the MRI now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A referral would be greatly appreciated. And thank you for the suggestions regarding symptom management. I'll continue with the stretching and warm baths, and I may consider the over-the-counter pain relievers if the discomfort becomes more significant. I trust your judgment, and I’m grateful for your thoroughness. If you could provide me with the contact information for those imaging centers, that would be fantastic. It allows me to compare options and find one that’s convenient and affordable. Thank you again for your assistance, Doctor. I feel much more reassured knowing we have a plan in place.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the referral for the MRI, and this list contains contact information for a few imaging centers in the area. You can call them to schedule an appointment and inquire about their pricing. I’ve also documented our conversation and findings in your EHR. Once you've had the MRI, please schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can discuss the results and determine the best course of treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you've covered everything quite comprehensively. I appreciate your patience and thoroughness. I'm feeling much more confident about addressing this issue now, and I'll be sure to schedule a follow-up appointment once I've had the MRI. Thank you again for your assistance. I think that will be all for today.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Tarin. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: .
