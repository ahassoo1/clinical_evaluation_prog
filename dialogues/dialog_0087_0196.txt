DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Soodeen, right? It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t have the energy for much anymore, and it’s been going on for… a while now, I guess. Honestly, I can’t really pinpoint when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Licano. “Always tired” is a common complaint, so we’ll definitely get to the bottom of this. When you say you don’t have the energy for much anymore, can you give me some examples?
PATIENT: Examples… hmm. Well, I used to keep a garden, a nice big one. Tomatoes, peppers, everything. Now… just looking at it makes me tired. And the house… it needs cleaning, of course, but I just… don’t. Even walking to the mailbox feels like a big effort sometimes. I used to walk everywhere! It’s just… everything feels harder than it used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a noticeable decrease in your usual activity level, both physically with things like gardening and walking, and perhaps even with household tasks. Has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it's pretty constant, I think. There aren’t really days where I don’t feel tired. Some days are worse than others, maybe. But it’s always… there. Like a weight, you know? I don't really have bursts of energy anymore. It’s just… low-level tired, all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, “low-level tired, all the time.” And has anything changed around the time you noticed this starting?
PATIENT: Changed… oh, goodness. Let me think. My husband, George… he passed away about two years ago. That was… a big change. Everything changed then, really. But I don’t know if this tiredness is from that, or just… happened at the same time. It’s hard to say. Everything feels so long ago now, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That absolutely makes sense, Ms. Licano. Losing George would be a profoundly significant change. It's very common for grief to manifest in many ways, including fatigue. We'll certainly consider that. Aside from the grief, have there been any other changes in your life – new medications, changes in your diet, stress at work or with family – anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, work… I’m a pharmacy tech, down at Miller’s. Same job for… oh, goodness, twenty years now. Nothing’s changed there. Diet… I try to eat okay. Not fancy, but… you know, sensible things. I take Medicare, so I’m careful with what I spend. No new medications, I don’t think… except what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure, a couple years back. That’s about it. I don’t really… have a lot of family nearby, either. It’s mostly just me.
DOCTOR: Alright, so consistent work, sensible diet, blood pressure medication... and limited family support. Just to clarify, Ms. Licano, you said a couple of years ago for the blood pressure medication. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I really don't. I just take the little pills every morning. The doctor sends it to the pharmacy, and I pick it up. I’m not very good with names, never have been. It’s a white one, I think… or maybe a light yellow? Honestly, I just take what they give me. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Licano. We can easily verify the medication list with Miller’s Pharmacy. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any other changes besides the tiredness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get headaches sometimes, not terrible, just… nagging ones. And I’ve been feeling… a little shaky lately, I guess. Like my hands tremble a bit when I’m trying to do something. It’s not constant, but it’s there. And I think… maybe I’ve been forgetting things more easily. Not important things, but… little things. Where I put my glasses, what I was going to say… things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, shakiness, and some forgetfulness. Are these symptoms new, or have they been present for a while alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, they all started around the same time, I think. It's all just… blended together, really. The tiredness was the first thing I noticed, but then the headaches started, and the shakiness, and the forgetting… it all just sort of crept up on me. It’s hard to say exactly when each one started, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Licano. It sounds like these symptoms developed gradually. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you need. Just… try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll keep it as brief as possible. Okay, blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 78, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Is that alright? I used to have very good eyesight, but it’s not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything seems to be within normal limits so far. Reflexes are normal, strength is good in all extremities. Now, I’m going to listen to your thyroid. Thyroid feels normal. Now, I’d like to order some basic blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, thyroid stimulating hormone, Vitamin D level, and a B12 level. That will give us a good starting point to see if we can identify any underlying causes for your fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work… alright. Will I need to fast for it? I don't really like being hungry.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. So, no food or drinks except water. We can schedule it for first thing in the morning if that works for you. That way, you won't have to fast for too long. We'll also send a prescription to the pharmacy for a B12 supplement, just in case your levels are low. And I’m going to refer you to a specialist in… internal medicine, Dr. Ramirez. He's excellent at investigating complex cases like yours. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. First thing in the morning… that sounds… manageable. And the specialist… yes, that’s fine. I just want to figure out what’s wrong, you know? I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Licano. We'll do everything we can to help you feel better. Here's a lab requisition form for the blood work, and this is the referral information for Dr. Ramirez. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. I’ve also written down some instructions regarding fasting for the blood work, and a list of potential symptoms to watch for in the meantime. If you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe weakness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Oh. Thank you, Doctor. That’s… a lot of information. No, I don’t think so. Not right now, anyway. I just want to get this done, you know? I’m sure I’ll think of something later. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Licano. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you do have any questions. We’re here to help. Get some rest, and we’ll see you soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you. You too.
