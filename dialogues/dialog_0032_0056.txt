DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… work, naturally. Though I doubt you would understand the pressures of maintaining a proper library these days. Young people… no respect for Dewey, none at all. It’s quite stressful, really. I suppose that’s what my daughter suggested I come about. Burnout, she said. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Stress from your profession, you say?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though it’s not merely the… disorganization of the students. It’s the administration, always wanting… “innovative” programs. As if rearranging the card catalog is somehow not sufficient. It’s a proper library, not a circus! And the funding… don’t even get me started. I’ve been at the university for… well, a very long time. Things were simply better before.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this… stress been accompanied by any specific physical symptoms, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Goodness. Well… I suppose I tire more easily. And my stomach… it isn't what it once was. Though that could be the cafeteria food. Truly dreadful. And I’ve been… rather short-tempered with my colleagues. But that’s more their fault than mine, naturally. They simply don’t understand the importance of proper cataloging.
DOCTOR: “Tire more easily” and “short-tempered,” you say. And is this fatigue constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Mostly goes, when I am left to my own devices, properly organizing the collection. It flares up when I have to… explain things to the others. Honestly, they treat the library like a social club. Constant chatter, rearranging books just to… display them. It's barbaric. It certainly doesn't help my… condition. I haven’t slept properly in weeks, I suspect. Though I can’t be certain. Time… rather blurs together these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not particularly. I eat… reasonably. Though the cafeteria food is hardly inspiring. Weight… well, I wouldn’t know. I haven't stepped on a scale in… a very long time. Honestly, it’s rather vulgar to discuss such things. I maintain a certain… dignity. My suits still fit, if that’s any indication. Though Mrs. Petrov, my tailor, retired last year. A dreadful loss. She understood proper fit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Mr. Schlatterer, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. It will help me to get a clearer picture of your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to feel your abdomen. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: An examination? Really? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly… functional. I’ve been in excellent health for… well, for as long as I can remember. But… I suppose if you insist. Though I warn you, I don’t tolerate cold stethoscopes. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily, you know. A proper gentleman must maintain appearances.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. We will be as thorough and gentle as possible. Please sit back and relax. 148 over 92… not ideal. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds… slightly diminished. And now, if you wouldn’t mind, I’m going to listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this poking and prodding. It’s quite unnecessary. I’ve never needed a doctor in my life, until my daughter insisted. And diminished heart sounds? Well, I suppose I haven’t been as active lately. All the… innovative programs, you understand. Taking up valuable time that should be spent organizing. And please, do be quick about it. I have a rather important cataloging project to attend to.
DOCTOR: Your lungs sound clear, though a bit shallow. Now, I’m just going to feel your abdomen. Hmm. Your abdomen is… somewhat tender in the upper right quadrant. Not acutely painful, but definitely sensitive. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Tender? Well, yes, a little. Though I suspect it’s just… indigestion. That dreadful cafeteria food, you understand. Everything is so… processed. And the coffee! Absolutely appalling. It’s enough to give anyone indigestion. Really, Doctor, I assure you, it’s nothing. Just a bit of… discomfort. Though my daughter always worries about everything. Perhaps she thinks I’m on my deathbed. Honestly, the dramatics.
DOCTOR: While indigestion is a possibility, Mr. Schlatterer, tenderness in the upper right quadrant can indicate a number of things. Given your age and the fact that this is a new symptom, I'd like to order some blood work and a quick ultrasound of your abdomen just to rule out anything serious. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? An ultrasound? Absolutely preposterous! I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy. It’s just… stress. And the cafeteria food. Really, all this poking and prodding and testing… it’s a waste of time and money. I have a library to run, you know. And I highly doubt an ultrasound will reveal anything useful. Honestly. But… very well. If it will appease my daughter… do what you must. Just… please, be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll order the necessary tests. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take a blood sample, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. Here are the requisitions and the appointment information for the ultrasound. Please take these to the lab and schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. Once the results are back, we can discuss them further. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity and trying to manage your stress levels. And perhaps… reconsidering the cafeteria food. Do you have any questions, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Questions? No, Doctor. Absolutely none. I fail to see how any of this will be beneficial, but… very well. I’ll take these papers and… endure whatever tests you deem necessary. Though I assure you, the results will be perfectly normal. It’s just stress. And the cafeteria food. Honestly. I believe that is all. Thank you for… your time. Though I doubt I’ll be returning. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. Have a… productive day. .
