DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you, Doctor. Bartok is the name. Yes, well… it’s about this tryout. For the… team. A baseball team. They want me to, uh, get checked out first. Some kind of… paper, they need. For the insurance, maybe? It’s all a bit of a fuss, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. A pre-participation physical examination. Yes, those are quite common, and certainly important for ensuring your health and safety. The paperwork is typically for insurance purposes, as you mentioned, and to establish a baseline of your current health status. To start, could you tell me a little more about the team?
PATIENT: Team? Oh. Right. It’s… local. Around here, you know? Not one of those fancy ones. More… for older fellas. Keeps us active. I think they call themselves the… uh… the Eagles? Or maybe the Hawks. Something with wings, anyway. Doesn't really matter, does it? I just want to make sure I’m still able to… play. It's important to stay moving, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does matter that it's important to you, Mr. Bartok. And knowing the level of activity is helpful. So, a local team for older, active individuals – that gives me a good starting point. To get a better understanding of your overall health and ensure you’re cleared for participation, I’d like to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s… a lot. I don’t really have a medical history, not one I remember, anyway. Been mostly healthy, I think. A few aches and pains, what do you expect at my age? Nothing serious. I had a… something when I was a kid, maybe? The doctor gave me a shot. That's about it. I don't recall much else. Is there a… form I can fill out? I’m not good with remembering things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. Many patients find it easier to review a questionnaire. I’ll pull up a form for you now. It covers the basics and will help jog your memory if anything comes to mind. While you’re completing that, could you tell me if you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think. No, not really. I eat everything. Always have. Sometimes things just… don't sit right, you know? But I wouldn’t call it an allergy. Dust bothers me sometimes, makes me sneeze, but everyone sneezes. I don't think I'm allergic to any medicine, no. Never had a bad reaction. I don't take much, though. Just… whatever the pharmacy gives me for the aches. I think. It's all a bit blurry, honestly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you may have some mild sensitivities, but nothing severe. We can explore that further if needed. And no, this won’t take long, as long as we can get through the basic questions. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even vitamins and supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins… supplements… hmm. My wife used to give me something. A little pill, orange color, for my… joints. Said it would help. I haven’t taken it in a while, not since… well. Since the divorce. Don't even remember what it was called. And no, no pills from the doctor right now, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever when my back acts up. Nothing regular, I promise. I don’t like taking pills, makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bartok. That’s good information to have. Discontinued supplements are still helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your past medical history, if you don't mind. You mentioned having a shot as a child. Do you recall what that was for?
PATIENT: A shot… hmm. That was… a long time ago. I think it was… at school? They lined us all up. Maybe for… polio? Or measles? Something like that. I just remember the needle. And the nurse. She was… stern. Honestly, it all feels like a dream. I don't remember being sick with anything, not really. A few colds, maybe? But nothing that needed a doctor. I was a pretty healthy kid, always running around. Now, my back… that's a different story. Gets worse every year.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bartok. It sounds like you received routine childhood vaccinations. That’s good to know. And we can certainly focus on your back pain. To get a better understanding of that, could you describe the pain to me?
PATIENT: The back… oh, it’s a bother. It’s… dull, mostly. A constant ache. But then, sometimes, I move wrong… or lift something… and it sharpens. Like a knife, almost. Goes right down my leg, sometimes. Makes it hard to… bend over. Or walk for too long. It gets worse at night, too. Hard to get comfortable. I try to ignore it, but it’s… always there. Like an old friend, a grumpy one. It's just...getting old, I suppose. Is that what happens when you get to my age? Everything starts to ache?
DOCTOR: That sounds quite uncomfortable, Mr. Bartok. The dull ache with sharp exacerbations radiating down your leg is important information. And you're right – back pain is common with age, but that doesn’t mean you have to live with it. To help me determine the cause of your pain and the best course of treatment, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical… hmm. I suppose so. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And no poking and prodding, if you don't mind. I don’t like being touched. Just… a quick look, that’s all. I need to get back to… things. I have a lawn to mow. And the team… I need to practice. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Just make it quick. And gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll start by checking your range of motion and looking for any areas of tenderness. We can adjust as we go. If you could please lie down on your back, we'll begin. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Easy does it… This table is cold. Relax, you say? Hard to relax when you're aching all over. But alright, alright. Let's get this over with. Just… be careful. I bruise easily these days. And don’t pull anything. I need my back, you know. For the team. And the lawn. It’s important work, keeping the yard tidy. Now, what do you want me to do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I'm just going to gently feel along your spine to check for any tenderness or muscle spasms. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oof! There! Right there! That’s the spot. Hurts like… well, it hurts. Not all the time, but when you press like that… definitely hurts. Feels… tight. Like a knot. It’s always been like that, I think. Maybe it’s just old age. I don't know. Be careful! You're digging in there! Gently, please. It’s not a rock. It's my back, you know. A fragile thing.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Bartok. I didn't mean to cause you any discomfort. I’m being very careful now. It sounds like you have a point of tenderness in your lower back, likely a muscle spasm. Now, could you slowly bend forward and touch your toes, if you are able?
PATIENT: Oof! Not so easy anymore. Can't reach my toes, not even close. It feels… tight. Like something is blocking me. And it hurts, a dull ache. Everything hurts. And I can’t bend over very far. Not like I used to. Maybe I’m just getting old. That’s enough, I think. Don't want to pull something. What does this mean? Am I broken?
DOCTOR: You’re not broken, Mr. Bartok. It appears you have limited range of motion in your lower back and some discomfort with forward flexion. Now, could you lie on your side, with your knees bent, please?
PATIENT: Easy does it… Everything creaks. You'd think I was a rusty gate. There. On my side. Knees bent, just like you said. Feel… a little better on my side, actually. Less pressure on the back. What are you looking for now? Is this going to take much longer? I have things to do, you know. Lawns to mow. A team to practice with. I'm a busy man. An important man. Even if I am getting old.
DOCTOR: I'm just checking for any tenderness or muscle tightness in your hip and buttock muscles. These muscles often contribute to lower back pain. Now, could you straighten your leg, keeping it straight, as I lift it up?
PATIENT: Oof! Stop! That hurts! Down my leg! Right there! Like a… a shooting pain. Stop lifting it! It’s not good! What are you doing? I told you, I have a bad back! You’re going to make it worse! Put it down! Gently! Gently! Now!
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Bartok. I stopped as soon as you indicated pain. That test can sometimes reproduce pain if you have nerve irritation. Based on the examination, it appears you have some muscle spasm in your lower back, limited range of motion, and potentially some nerve irritation. It's likely a combination of muscle strain and possible sciatica, which is pain radiating down your leg due to compression of a nerve. I’m going to order some imaging, an MRI, to get a better look at your spine and rule out any serious problems. We can also discuss some conservative treatments like physical therapy, pain medication, and stretching exercises. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Imaging? MRI? That sounds… expensive. And scary. I don’t like being stuck in those machines. And medication… makes me feel strange. Physical therapy… I don’t have time for that! I have a lawn to mow! And a team to practice with! I just want to be able to play baseball, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? Can’t you just give me something for the pain? Something to get me through the season? Maybe a shot? Like I used to get? I don't want all these tests and machines and… things. I just want to feel better. Is there anything simple you can do? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bartok. It’s not ideal to rush into tests, and I certainly wouldn’t want to subject you to anything unnecessary. We can discuss the pros and cons of the MRI further. It will help us rule out any serious structural issues that could be causing your pain. While I typically don’t recommend relying solely on pain medication, we can certainly discuss a short course to manage your symptoms. However, long-term use can have side effects, and it won't address the underlying cause of your pain. A cortisone shot could provide temporary relief, but it’s not a long-term solution and doesn’t address the underlying issue. It also carries some risks. Before resorting to those options, let’s start with some conservative measures. I’d like to recommend a course of physical therapy, even if it's just a few sessions, to learn some stretches and exercises to strengthen your back and core. I can also prescribe a muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory medication for a short period to help manage your pain and inflammation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… a few sessions… alright. Maybe. If it doesn’t take too long. And doesn't cost a fortune. And the pills… just for a little while, right? Just to get me through a few games? I don't want to be hooked on anything. And the lawn… I need to be able to mow the lawn. That’s important. My neighbors… they expect it. So, a few therapy sessions, some pills, and I can still play baseball? And mow the lawn? Is that possible, Doctor? Can you help me do that? Please? I’m not getting any younger, you know. And I want to enjoy what little time I have left.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Bartok. That is absolutely possible. We can work towards getting you back to doing the things you enjoy – playing baseball and maintaining your lawn. I’m going to write a prescription for a short course of muscle relaxants and anti-inflammatory medication. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a physical therapist in the area. They will assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. I recommend starting with two sessions per week for four weeks. It’s important to follow the physical therapist’s instructions carefully and to listen to your body. If you experience any worsening of your pain, stop the exercises and contact the therapist immediately. We'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Here are your prescriptions and the referral to the physical therapist. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. That sounds… manageable. The physical therapist… is he… gentle? I don't want anyone poking and prodding. And the pills… what are they for, exactly? And what are the side effects? I don’t want to feel strange. And what about the MRI? Do I have to get that? Can’t we just try the therapy and pills first? Maybe that will be enough. I just want to be able to play baseball, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Bartok. Let's address them one by one. I will ensure the physical therapist you are referred to is known for a gentle approach. I'll make a note of your preference on the referral form. They will start with a thorough assessment and explain each exercise carefully before you begin. The muscle relaxant will help to relieve the muscle spasms in your back, and the anti-inflammatory medication will reduce the pain and inflammation. Common side effects can include drowsiness and dizziness. It's important to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while taking these medications. If you experience any other side effects, please contact me immediately. The MRI is not absolutely necessary at this time. We can certainly try the physical therapy and medication first. However, it's important to understand that without an MRI, we won't have a clear picture of what's causing your pain. If your symptoms don't improve with conservative treatment, we may need to consider the MRI later. For now, let's focus on getting you started with the physical therapy and medication. We'll reassess your condition in two weeks and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Physical therapy and pills first. No MRI, for now. Gentle therapist, no poking. No strange side effects. And no driving. I can't drive anyway, my wife used to do all the driving. Two weeks… I’ll try my best. I’ll do the exercises. I’ll take the pills. And I’ll try not to pull anything. But if it doesn't work… if I'm still in pain… what then? I just want to be able to play baseball, Doctor. Is that too much to ask? A few games before… well, before it’s too late.
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Bartok. And we’re going to do everything we can to help you get back on the field. If the physical therapy and medication don’t provide sufficient relief, we’ll discuss other options, such as an MRI or referral to a specialist. Remember, it's important to be patient and consistent with your treatment plan. It may take time to see results. Here’s a copy of your treatment plan and the referral information. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for trying to help. I better get going. Gotta get home. And start those exercises. Maybe I’ll mow the lawn later, if my back feels up to it. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. And if I see you on the field… don’t tell anyone I told you.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Bartok. I'm glad I could help. Remember to listen to your body, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And I wish you all the best on the field. I won’t say a word. Have a good day, Mr. Bartok. And please, take it easy.
