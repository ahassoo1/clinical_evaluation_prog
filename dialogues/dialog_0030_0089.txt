DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is lovely to meet you. Oh dear… what does bring me in? It’s… the pain, I suppose. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, you see, and it's been… troubling. I do believe it’s related to… well, the condition the other doctors spoke of. SLE, was it? Systemic… something. It’s all a bit fuzzy, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It sounds like you’re experiencing abdominal pain, and you suspect it may be related to a diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, or SLE, that other physicians have discussed with you. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me more about this pain?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. SLE… it just doesn’t stick in my memory, does it? As for the pain… hmm. It’s… a cramping sort of ache, mostly. And it feels… deep inside. Sometimes it’s quite sharp, other times just a dull throbbing. It’s hard to say when it comes. It doesn't seem to be related to eating, or… anything specific, really. It just… is. I do find myself worrying about it, of course. It feels rather… unsettling. Would you like me to describe where, exactly, it hurts?
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you could point to where you’re feeling the pain, that would be very helpful. And could you rate the pain on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain you’ve ever experienced?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. It’s… right about here. Sometimes it radiates outwards a bit, but mostly it’s concentrated in this area. As for the scale… hmm. It rarely gets above a six, I’d say. Most of the time, it's a three or four. But when it does flare up… that six feels quite significant. It doesn’t leave me incapacitated, but it’s certainly unpleasant. It makes me quite anxious, if I'm being honest. I do worry about what it means.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That’s very helpful. So, the pain is located in the lower abdomen, rated a three to six on a scale of ten, and it's a cramping, aching sensation that occasionally flares up. You mentioned it's causing you anxiety as well. Now, to get a broader picture, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I do get rather tired, more so than I used to. And my joints ache, particularly in my hands and wrists. It’s not constant, but it’s definitely there. Sometimes I feel a bit… feverish, though I haven't actually taken my temperature to confirm it. And… oh dear, this is all a bit muddled, isn’t it? I suppose I also feel a bit… generally unwell sometimes. Just… not myself. Does that make any sense? It’s all so vague.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Glymph. It’s not unusual for symptoms to be vague, especially with conditions like SLE. Fatigue, joint pain, and feeling generally unwell are all common. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – any diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's… a rather direct question, Doctor! Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. My bowel habits have been… fairly normal, all things considered. Perhaps a little…irregular at times, but nothing alarming. Definitely no blood in my stool, thank goodness. No, those symptoms haven’t been present. I do hope I'm not being too…difficult with all this vagueness. It’s just… remembering details is so challenging these days.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. You're not being difficult in the slightest. It's perfectly normal to have difficulty remembering details, and I appreciate you sharing everything you can. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides SLE?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, the doctors did mention something about… Raynaud’s phenomenon, I believe? My fingers get rather cold and turn white sometimes. And… I had a bout of pleurisy several years ago, though that seems to have cleared up. Apart from that… not that I recall. I’ve always been fairly healthy, all things considered. Though, as you know, this SLE is rather throwing a wrench into things. It's all so…convoluted. Do you want to know about medications? I’m taking something for my blood pressure, I believe, but I honestly can’t recall the name.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. Raynaud’s phenomenon and a history of pleurisy are helpful information. And it’s good to know you’re on medication for high blood pressure. We'll get the name of that medication shortly. Now, are there any allergies we need to be aware of – any medications, foods, or environmental factors that cause a reaction?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions, thank goodness. I’m not allergic to any medications that I’m aware of. I do get a bit of a runny nose during pollen season, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? No, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I’m rather fortunate in that regard. Though, one never knows, do they? It's all rather… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Glymph. No known allergies are helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… Well, my mother had…arthritis, I believe. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? It was quite debilitating towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart problems. High blood pressure, I think, and… a stroke, eventually. And… let me see. My sister is…relatively healthy, as far as I know. No major health issues. It's all a bit…muddled, isn’t it? I’m not very good at remembering these things, I’m afraid. Do you need specifics? I don't have much detail to offer, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. Knowing about your mother’s arthritis and your father’s heart problems and high blood pressure is helpful. We don't need specifics if you don't have them. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… It’s rather…sedentary, I’m afraid. I live alone, you see, and I don’t get out as much as I used to. I enjoy reading, and watching television. I used to garden, but my joints aren’t what they used to be, so that’s become…difficult. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. My diet… well, it’s not terrible. I try to eat healthy, but I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. It's rather…routine, all things considered. Nothing terribly exciting, I’m afraid. And… I believe that covers it. Do you need to know about…exercise? I do a bit of walking, when the weather permits, but nothing strenuous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, to get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. A physical exam would be… helpful, I imagine. Please, go right ahead. I do hope I’m not too… difficult. My joints are a bit stiff, you see, and I’m not always very… cooperative. But I’ll do my best. Just let me know if there’s anything you need. Is there a gown I should put on?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. We’ll take things at your pace. And yes, there is a gown in the changing room just down the hall. Feel free to change, and I'll meet you back here when you’re ready. We’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs, checking your joints, and then we’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A gentle examination would be… preferable, certainly. I’ll just go and change, then. And I’ll be right back. It’s… kind of you to be so understanding. My joints do protest sometimes, you see. I hope they don’t cause too much… trouble.
DOCTOR:
