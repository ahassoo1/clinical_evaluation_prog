DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, you're Courtnye, right?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Courtnye Hainley. Look, I don't have a lot of time today, so if we could just get right to it, that'd be great. It's about my bruising, it’s been getting worse.
DOCTOR: Bruising, huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. I'm on… a blood thinner. Warfarin, I think? Something like that. The doctor put me on it a while back. Anyway, I’ve been noticing more bruises lately, even from little bumps. It’s kinda worrying me. I hit my arm on the doorframe yesterday and, well, it’s already turning purple. Normally it wouldn’t be this bad.
DOCTOR: Warfarin… right. And you say more bruising than usual?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Like, I always bruise easily, even before the medication, but this is… different. It seems like any little thing now leaves a mark. And they're bigger, darker, and they stick around longer. It’s just… concerning. I haven't changed anything about how I do things, so I don't get what's going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. So, you've been on Warfarin for… how long now?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s gotta be… close to two years, maybe a little over? I started right after my diagnosis, so… February of '23, I think. Everything was fine for a long time, and now suddenly this. I really don't keep track of dates well, sorry.
DOCTOR: Two years, alright. And are you… consistent with taking it?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah. Absolutely. I set an alarm on my phone and everything. Same time every day. I don't mess with my medication. It’s really important, you know? I have to take it. I wouldn’t risk it. I just… wanna know why I’m bruising like a peach now all of a sudden.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes these things happen. Let's just take a look at you, alright?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Whatever gets this over with quicker. Where do you want me to… you know?
DOCTOR: Just… up there. Let's start with your arms, I suppose. And please, try not to move. It makes things harder.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here. Just… let me know when you’re ready. I’ve got places to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yeah, that’s… substantial. And you said this was from hitting your arm on a doorframe?
PATIENT: Yes! Yesterday morning. It didn’t feel that hard, honestly. Usually it’s just a little redness, maybe a tiny spot. This… this feels different. And it's huge. It’s creeping down my forearm now, too. See? It’s not just the spot where I hit it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other areas you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Ugh, yeah. My legs, actually. I bumped into the coffee table last week and got a bruise there, and… I think I saw one on my thigh yesterday, but I can't really remember how I got it. I'm starting to feel like a walking bruise, honestly. It’s kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. And you’re not taking any other medications?
PATIENT: No, just the Warfarin. And a daily multivitamin, but that’s it. Nothing new, nothing different. I swear. I haven't even changed what soap I use! I keep thinking maybe something is interacting with the blood thinner, but I haven't added anything to my routine. It just came on so suddenly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some blood work done. I want to check your INR, just to make sure the dosage is still appropriate. Also, a complete blood count. Rule out anything else going on.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Whatever you think is best. Just… how long is this gonna take? I really don't have a lot of time to sit around.
DOCTOR: The lab’s right down the hall. Should be… twenty minutes, give or take. And frankly, if your INR is off, you may need a dosage adjustment. Don't start changing things on your own. It's dangerous.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Twenty minutes. Fine. I'll just… sit here and wait, I guess. Just let me know when I can go. And try to be quick, okay? I've got a meeting later.
