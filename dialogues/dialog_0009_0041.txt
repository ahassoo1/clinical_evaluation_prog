DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I’ve been…feeling weaker. It’s been happening slowly, over time. It makes things harder to do, you know? Like walking, mostly. And my hands…they aren’t as strong as they used to be. I think my wife, Leilani, told me to come see you. She worries.
DOCTOR: It’s good that Leilani encouraged you to come in, Dorman. It’s always helpful to have a support system. Feeling weaker over time, especially with difficulty walking and hand strength… that's definitely something we should look into. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about how slowly this weakness has been developing?
PATIENT: Hmm… slowly. It’s hard to say exactly, you know? Maybe… six months ago, I noticed I was getting tired a little easier after working in the garden. I like to keep busy. But it wasn’t anything big. Then, maybe three months ago, I started tripping over things more often. Leilani says I’m shuffling my feet when I walk, but I don't really notice. It’s just…little things. It hasn’t been sudden, like I woke up one day and couldn’t walk. It just…got harder and harder. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Dorman. A gradual onset is important information. So, about six months of increasing fatigue with activities, and then tripping becoming more noticeable around three months ago, along with some changes in your walking. You mentioned shuffling your feet – that’s good Leilani has observed that. Now, beyond the garden work, what other activities do you typically do, and have you noticed any difficulty with those?
PATIENT: Well, I used to help my grandson with his football sometimes. Throwing the ball, you know? But I’ve been…hesitating to do that lately. I worry I’ll drop it, or not throw it far enough. And I used to go fishing with my friends, but it’s harder to get the line tangled and untangled now. My hands…they just don't work like they used to. I also used to carve little things out of wood, but I haven’t done that in a while either. It needs a steady hand, and…well. It’s just harder. I mostly just sit now, which isn’t good, I know.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this is impacting a lot of things you enjoy, Dorman, and it’s understandable that you’re frustrated. It's good you're recognizing that sitting more isn’t ideal. Let’s move on to some other things that might give me a better picture. Have you noticed any pain anywhere – in your legs, arms, back, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no pain really. Just…tired. Like my muscles are always heavy. Sometimes my legs feel…numb, like pins and needles, but it goes away. It doesn’t happen all the time. Mostly just when I’ve been sitting for a long time. It's hard to explain. It’s not a pain, exactly. It's just…uncomfortable. And sometimes I feel a little off-balance, but I haven’t fallen yet, thank goodness. Leilani keeps a close eye on me. She’s a good woman.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Dorman. No pain, but heaviness in the muscles, intermittent numbness or tingling in your legs, especially after sitting, and some feelings of unsteadiness. It's good Leilani is looking out for you. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you are aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me a few years back I have something with my nerves. Something about the coating around them being… damaged. Leilani remembers the name better than me. Multiple…something. She said it's something I'll have for the rest of my life. It's why I see a specialist sometimes. But it hasn’t been…bad. Just…there. I take some pills for it, but I don't really pay attention to what they are. I just take what the doctor tells me. I also have a little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from getting old, I think. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you have a diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed approximately seven years ago. And you're currently being managed by Dr. Yamamoto. That's very helpful information. You're right, it sounds like the symptoms are relatively stable. And you mentioned some arthritis in your knees?
PATIENT: Yes, just a little. Mostly when the weather is cold or after I’ve been on my feet too long. It doesn’t bother me too much. I just try to take it easy. I’ve been noticing though, lately, that the weakness in my legs feels…different than the stiffness from the arthritis. That’s why I wanted to come see you. I thought maybe it was getting worse, or something new. Leilani thought so too. She said it wasn’t just the old aches and pains. She’s a good judge.
DOCTOR: It’s good you and Leilani are paying attention to these changes, and that you're able to differentiate it from your usual arthritis. That's a valuable observation. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any other medical conditions that run in your family – things like MS, Parkinson's disease, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a hard one, Doctor. My family is…big. And we don’t really talk about those things much. I know my auntie, on my mother’s side, she had something with her legs when she got old. She walked funny. But I don't know what it was. And I think my cousin, on my father's side, he had something with his hands. He couldn’t hold things very well. But that was a long time ago, and I wasn't very close to him. Mostly, we just took care of each other. We didn’t really talk about what was wrong with people. We just helped. Does that make sense? It's hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Dorman. It’s common for families to focus on support rather than detailed medical history. Any information you do recall is helpful, and it sounds like there may have been some similar issues in the family. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My mother always said it was bad for you, and I listened to her. Leilani doesn't smoke either. We both try to stay healthy. We eat a lot of fish, and fresh fruit. And I drink water. Not much soda. I do like a little bit of coconut cream now and then, but that’s mostly on special occasions.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Dorman. A healthy diet and avoiding tobacco are very important. And now, let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing that I know of. I haven't had any problems with allergies. I can eat anything, and I haven't had a bad reaction to any medicine. Leilani always asks when the doctor prescribes something new, but they haven’t ever said I was allergic to anything. I think I'd know if I was, wouldn't I? I haven’t ever had a rash or trouble breathing or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good to know, Dorman. No known allergies. And finally, can you tell me all the medications you're currently taking, including any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. There’s the pills for the Multiple Sclerosis. I don’t know the name, but they're little white ones. I take one in the morning and one at night. And I take a pill for my blood pressure, it’s a little blue one. Leilani gets it for me. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis when my knees are sore, but not every day. It's…ibuprofen, I think? And I take a multivitamin, just to make sure I’m getting enough, you know? Leilani says it’s good for me. She keeps track of everything. She’s much better at remembering things than I am. I really depend on her. Does that help? I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Dorman. And don’t apologize, it’s perfectly alright. Knowing the colors is a good start, and it sounds like Leilani has things well-managed. Okay, now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s happening, and hopefully get back to doing the things I enjoy. Leilani is worried, and I don’t want to worry her anymore. So, yes, please do whatever you need. I'll just sit here, and try not to fidget. I sometimes feel a little clumsy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dorman. We’ll take things slowly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 76 and regular. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Could you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm trying, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it used to be. Sometimes my hands just…don’t want to cooperate. I have to concentrate to make them squeeze. It’s tiring, you know? Especially if I do it for a long time. I hope I’m squeezing hard enough. I don't want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: You're doing fine, Dorman. It's helpful for me to see what feels comfortable for you. I'm noting a mild weakness in both hands, approximately 4/5 strength bilaterally. Now, can you try to push against my hands like you’re trying to stand up from a chair?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I'm trying my best. It feels… difficult. It’s harder than it used to be to push. My legs just feel… heavy, you know? Like they're filled with sand. And it's tiring. I hope I’m pushing hard enough. Leilani says I should try to be stronger, but it's just…not as easy as it used to be. It's hard to explain. I'm sorry if I'm not doing a good job. I don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Dorman. It's very helpful for me to see how you're feeling, and you're not wasting my time at all. I’m noting some mild weakness in both legs as well, approximately 4/5 strength bilaterally. Now, I'd like to check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s…harder than it looks. My hand feels… shaky. And I didn’t quite get my nose. I used to be able to do this easily. I’m sorry. I’m getting tired, you know? It's just…concentrating is harder than it used to be. I hope you can still get some information from this. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Dorman. And this is very helpful. I'm noting some mild difficulty with coordination and a slight tremor in both hands. Okay, I think that's enough for the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the exam – the gradual weakness, mild tremor, difficulty with coordination, and decreased strength in both hands and legs – the most likely explanation is a progression of your Multiple Sclerosis. However, to rule out other possibilities, and to get a better understanding of the extent of the changes, I'd like to order some blood work and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI…yes, I've had those before. Not my favorite, but if you think it's necessary, then yes. Blood work is fine too. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening, and hopefully find a way to slow it down. It's just…frightening, you know? Not knowing. Leilani is worried too. So, yes, please do the tests. Whatever will help. I trust your judgment. I just want to get back to normal. Or as close to normal as I can. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dorman, and it’s good we’re taking these steps. The MRI will help us visualize any changes in your brain and spinal cord, and the blood work will rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. I’ll also contact Dr. Yamamoto to discuss the findings with him. I'm going to write you a referral for the MRI, and give you a lab requisition for the blood work. The lab is located at… . The MRI center is at… In the meantime, I'm going to recommend continuing your current medications, and focusing on gentle exercise to maintain your strength and flexibility. I will also give you a handout with some exercises you can try at home. We will schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very good. Two weeks is fine. Gentle exercise…I can do that. Leilani will help me. She’s very good at keeping me motivated. And the handout is a good idea. I sometimes forget things, you know. So, yes, thank you. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. I feel…a little bit better now, knowing what’s happening. Even if it’s not good news, it’s good to know. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dorman. It’s my pleasure to help. Remember, we’re in this together, and we’ll work through this as a team. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here are the referrals and the handout. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you in two weeks. .
