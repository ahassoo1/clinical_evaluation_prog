DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Micucci. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It's just... well, I was hoping you could write me a little card. You know, a “Get Well” card. Or, if that sounds silly, maybe just one with some encouragement on it. It’s for a friend, you see. A very particular friend. Needs a little... uplifting, she does.
DOCTOR: A card?
PATIENT: Yes, a card! Is that… unusual? People get cards, don’t they? When they’re feeling down? It's just... she's going through a rough patch and a nice note from a doctor would really mean something. Show a bit of… respect, you know? It's not every day someone knows a doctor, is it? Honestly, some people just don't appreciate good things when they have them.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, with all due respect, this isn’t quite… standard practice. I’m a physician, here to address medical concerns. Writing personal notes for friends isn't within the scope of my professional responsibilities. I’m afraid I can’t accommodate that request. Now, is there anything medically I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Standard practice? Well, I think a little kindness should be standard practice. It’s all about being a good person, isn’t it? But alright, alright. If you must be difficult. No, nothing medically. Just thought you might be willing to do a nice thing. Seems like everyone's so busy these days they forget how to be… decent. It’s just a card, Doctor. Really. A small gesture. It’s not like I'm asking you to perform surgery.
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I understand you’re frustrated, but my time is limited, and I have other patients waiting. I assure you, I am a decent person, but my professional obligations come first. Perhaps a friend or family member could write the card?
PATIENT: Limited time? Well, that's just convenient. Honestly, it's always something with people these days. Too busy, not enough time... It's just… she doesn’t have many friends, you see. And family… well, let’s just say they aren't the supportive type. That’s why I thought of you! You’re a doctor. People listen to doctors. It would carry some weight. It's not about me, Doctor. It's about her. Do you even care about people anymore?
DOCTOR: Ms. Micucci, I am concerned about my patients’ well-being, but that concern extends to their medical needs. I'm afraid I can't fulfill your request. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Well, fine. Be that way. Honestly, it just shows a lack of… compassion. A complete lack. I suppose I should have known. Doctors these days… all about the money, aren't they? Never mind. I wasted my time coming here anyway. I’ll just… find someone else. Someone with a little bit of… humanity. .
