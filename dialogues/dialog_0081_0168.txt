DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… a situation. I’m dating someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things…progress. You understand, of course. One must be careful these days. It’s simply responsible.
DOCTOR: Of course. A sensible approach. Prudence is… admirable. So, to clarify, you’re concerned about sexually transmitted infections, or are there other health concerns prompting this visit?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not just that. Though, yes, that is…part of it. But I also want to ensure I’m…optimal, shall we say? He’s… quite a bit younger, you see. And active. I need to be certain I’m up to the task, so to speak. It wouldn't do to…disappoint. It’s more a matter of…maintaining standards.
DOCTOR: Maintaining standards. Right. So, you're concerned about both potential infections and your overall physical condition, particularly regarding stamina and…activity level. Let's start with a general overview then. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Well, that depends on your definition of “recent.” I had one…oh, let me see…probably five years ago? With my previous physician, Dr. Abernathy. He retired, you see. A lovely man, but getting on in years. He did a thorough job, but I doubt he specialized in…the needs of a woman in my position now.
DOCTOR: Five years is…a considerable time. And yes, specializations are important. Alright. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. My mother always said it was the fresh air and a good diet. Though, I did have a bout of shingles a few years back. Dreadful pain, truly. But it cleared up, of course. And honestly, it was more stressful than physically debilitating. I keep a very clean house; I imagine that helps.
DOCTOR: Shingles. Noted. And no other significant medical issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing that would be…relevant, I should think. I mean, I get the occasional headache, who doesn’t? And my knees sometimes ache in cold weather, but I attribute that to the dampness. Really, I've always been exceptionally robust. I simply want to confirm that everything is as it should be before…committing to anything long-term.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just the usual things. Appendectomy when I was a child, naturally. And a hysterectomy… oh, goodness, it must be twenty years ago now? A woman’s business, really. It was…necessary at the time. But beyond that, no. Perfectly intact, otherwise. One prefers to maintain a certain…completeness, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, my mother lived to be ninety-two, bless her heart. She had… arthritis, mostly. And a touch of high blood pressure towards the end. My father… he passed away rather suddenly from a heart attack when I was quite young. A shock, truly. Not much to report otherwise. They weren’t…complicated people, shall we say? Certainly no history of…anything untoward. Good, solid stock, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I can eat anything, take anything. I've always been remarkably…unfussy. Though I do prefer a good herbal tea to anything artificial, naturally. Keeps the system balanced, you see. But no actual allergies. A blessing, truly. It simplifies things enormously, don’t you think? One doesn’t want to be worrying about a reaction during…activities.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my joints. Glucosamine, I believe it’s called. Helps with the dampness, you see. And occasionally, a small dose of melatonin if I’m having trouble sleeping. But that's infrequent. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. Though I did try one of those energy boosters my…friend recommended, but it gave me a terrible headache. A waste of money, really. I’ll stick to my tea, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Pandolfi, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. I wouldn’t expect anything less. A thorough examination is precisely what I’m paying for, after all. Though, perhaps we could…dim the lights a bit? And I do prefer a soft paper on the examination table. One likes to be comfortable, naturally. It's all about creating the right atmosphere, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can adjust the lighting and ensure a comfortable examination table. If you’ll follow me. We'll start with your vital signs, then proceed with a general assessment. Please undress from the waist up, and I'll return shortly.
PATIENT: Very good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your attention to detail. One mustn't rush these things, you see. It's all about proper preparation. And, if you wouldn't mind, a cooler room would be preferable. I tend to get a bit flushed easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. Let’s start with your blood pressure. 130 over 85. Not bad. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Are you experiencing any abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Perfectly regular, thank you. I maintain a very…disciplined diet, you see. And I drink plenty of water. It’s important to keep everything…flowing smoothly. Though, I did have a slight bout of indigestion after trying that new spicy salsa my friend made, but that was an isolated incident. Really, I’m quite fastidious about what I put into my body. One mustn’t upset the delicate balance, don’t you think? It impacts everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, maintaining balance is important. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Do you experience any weakness, numbness, or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Perfectly strong, thank you. I do a bit of gardening, you see, and it requires a certain…stamina. And I've always had quite a firm grip. It's important to be self-sufficient, you see. One mustn't rely on others for simple tasks. Though, my hands do get a bit dry in the winter, but that’s just the weather, naturally. A bit of hand cream sorts that right out. Really, everything is quite…functional.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear, nose is unremarkable. Throat is clear, no lesions or redness detected. Do you have any concerns about your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Perfectly adequate, thank you. I do have a rather stylish pair of reading glasses, naturally, but that’s just for close work. And I always keep them polished. One must maintain appearances, you see. And my hearing is quite sharp. I can always tell when someone is being…disingenuous. A valuable trait, wouldn't you agree? Really, everything is functioning precisely as it should be. It’s reassuring, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, reassuring. Given your history and the results of the physical exam, there are no immediate red flags. However, given your concerns about…optimal health, and your desire for a thorough assessment, I recommend some baseline laboratory work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel will give us a better understanding of your overall health status. We should also check your thyroid function, and a urine analysis to rule out any underlying infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, perfectly acceptable, Doctor. In fact, I was hoping you'd suggest something of the sort. One can never be too careful, you see. It’s prudent to have a complete picture, wouldn’t you agree? The more information, the better. And, if you wouldn't mind, could we also check my vitamin levels? I've heard that many people are deficient, and it can impact…energy levels. Really, a comprehensive assessment is precisely what I’m looking for. It’s an investment in…well, everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will include a vitamin D level and a B12 level in your lab work. I’ll have the lab technician draw blood now. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulties with blood draws?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Perfectly amenable, thank you. I’ve always been quite…cooperative. And I don’t faint easily. A bit of a firm grip and a deep breath usually does the trick. Really, I’m quite…resilient. Though, I do prefer a smaller needle if possible. It’s just…more civilized, wouldn’t you agree? And, if the technician could be gentle, that would be greatly appreciated. One doesn’t want to be…unduly distressed.
DOCTOR: I will make a note to request a smaller gauge needle and to ensure the technician is gentle during the blood draw. The lab technician will be with you shortly. After the blood draw, you can get dressed, and we can schedule your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment, Doctor. You've been very thorough, and I appreciate your attention to detail. I suppose I’m just…anxious to get everything sorted out. It’s a matter of…peace of mind, you see. And, truthfully, I have a rather busy social calendar. I need to be at my…optimal self, wouldn’t you agree? I’ll simply wait for the technician, then. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll leave you to prepare. The technician will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: .
