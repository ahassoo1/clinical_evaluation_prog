DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s Courtnye, by the way. Um, well, it’s my bruising. It’s just… been getting worse, and I’m on blood thinners, so I figured I should get it checked out. It's a little concerning, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood thinners complicate things, certainly. Let’s have a look at your chart… I see you’re on warfarin. And you said it’s been getting worse – can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Yep, warfarin. It’s… been a while, honestly, since anyone really looked at it. And yeah, worse… like, I bumped my arm on the doorframe a couple of weeks ago, just a little thing, and it turned black and blue almost immediately. Normally, it wouldn’t be this bad. And then yesterday, I just… grazed my leg getting out of the car, and it’s already the size of my hand. It's worrying me, because I don't remember bruising this easily before.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Size of your hand,” you say. And you’re certain this is a recent change?
PATIENT: Definitely recent. Like, the last month or so. Before that, it was just… normal bruising, you know? A little bump, a little color, gone in a week. This is different. It feels… quicker, and it covers way more area. I don’t want to end up in the hospital because of a bump, you know? I don't have insurance, so that's a worry, too.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve been consistently taking the warfarin as prescribed?
PATIENT: Yep, religiously. Every night, same time. I set an alarm on my phone, everything. I even have the little pill organizer, you know? I’m really careful with it, because I know it’s important. I haven’t missed a dose in… I don't even remember how long. Months, definitely.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s… reassuring, at least. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think. I had pneumonia a couple of years ago, but that was just a one-time thing. And… oh, my blood pressure’s a little high, but I don’t take anything for it. The doctor said to just watch my salt intake. Nothing major, really. I’m pretty healthy otherwise, I think. Why do you ask? Is this about the bruising?
DOCTOR: Pneumonia, hypertension… alright. And you said you're on warfarin – do you recall why you were prescribed it in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, yeah, of course. It was… atrial fibrillation. That’s what the doctor called it. My heart was… fluttering, you know? It was scary. They said I needed something to prevent clots. It was about five years ago, maybe six. I had to go to a special clinic for a while to get the dosage right, but now I just come in for checkups every six months.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation. Right. And those checkups… have your INR levels been stable?
PATIENT: Yep, mostly. There was one time, a couple of years ago, when they had to adjust the dose, but other than that, they've been pretty consistent. I always ask the doctor at the other clinic, and they say everything looks good. I don't always remember the exact numbers, though. I just know they haven't told me to worry. Is that important? Should I be keeping better track of those numbers?
DOCTOR: It’s always important to know your numbers when you’re on warfarin, Ms. Hainley. Frankly, relying on someone telling you everything is good isn’t sufficient. Now, do you have any family history of bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Umm… that's a good point, I guess. I should probably write those down. My mom… she bruised easily, but she always said it was just because she was old. And my grandpa… he had something with his blood, but I don't remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. Was it like… hemophilia or something? I don't know. It's not something we ever discussed. Sorry, I'm not much help on that one.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Oh, just the warfarin. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once a month, if that. And a multivitamin, just a regular one. That’s it. I try to avoid taking anything else if I can. I don’t like mixing a lot of pills, you know? It feels… risky.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and look at these bruises. And I'll need to gently palpate your abdomen. It's just routine, Ms. Hainley. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds good. I'm a little worried about the abdominal thing, though. Is that going to hurt? I get a little sensitive there sometimes.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t, Ms. Hainley, but please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. Blood pressure is… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, let’s look at these bruises. They are quite extensive, even for someone on warfarin. And they feel… somewhat firm. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… no masses palpable. But there is some mild discoloration in the lower quadrants.
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little tender there, on the left side. Not painful, exactly, but… sensitive. Like, I notice it more when you press. Is that normal? And firm bruises… is that bad? I'm getting a little scared now. Is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll stop there. Mild tenderness and firmness is concerning, Ms. Hainley, especially given your recent bruising. It could be due to a number of things, but we need to rule out some more serious possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a coagulation panel, and a liver function test. And I want you to get an ultrasound of your abdomen to check for internal bleeding. Given your uninsurance, I can arrange for these tests to be done at the rural clinic at a reduced cost, but it may take a few days to schedule.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. That sounds… a lot. Ultrasound… internal bleeding? Reduced cost is good, because I really can’t afford a big hospital bill. A few days is fine, I guess. What are we looking for exactly? Is this… is this something really bad? And the liver function test… is my liver okay? I don’t drink or anything, so I don’t understand why that would be needed.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hainley, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. The tests are to rule things out. The ultrasound will check for any internal bleeding or hematomas. The coagulation panel will give us a more accurate picture of how your blood is clotting – your INR level at the clinic may not be entirely reliable. And the liver function test is to ensure your liver is metabolizing the warfarin correctly. It’s a standard precaution. Given your history of easy bruising and the tenderness, we need to investigate potential causes – liver dysfunction, underlying bleeding disorders, or even medication interactions. I’m going to write you a referral for the ultrasound and blood work. Please schedule these appointments as soon as possible. And if you experience any severe pain, dizziness, or blood in your stool, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I understand. Severe pain, dizziness, blood in stool… emergency room. Ultrasound, blood work… as soon as possible. I'll… I'll try to get it scheduled right away. It’s just… a lot to take in. Is there anything else I should be doing? Should I stop taking the warfarin?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Hainley, do not stop taking the warfarin without my explicit instruction. Stopping it abruptly could be dangerous. Here is the referral. The lab and imaging center are located at the rural clinic. I've also included a list of symptoms to watch for. I want to see you back here in one week, or sooner if your symptoms worsen, to review the results. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I’ll get the appointments scheduled as soon as I can. One week… okay.
