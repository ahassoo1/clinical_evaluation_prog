DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Yoshino. It nice to meet you too. Well, lately I does be feelin’ very thirsty, all the time. And hungry, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling thirsty all the time and still hungry even after eating – that definitely warrants looking into. Can you tell me a little more about that thirst?
PATIENT: Well, I does be drinkin’ plenty water, more than usual. Like, I have a big jug I does try to finish two times a day. But it still feel like I need more. And my mouth feel dry all the time, even after drinkin’. It not a pain, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bianca. That sounds really frustrating. And you’re right to pay attention to it. Two big jugs of water a day is a lot. Has this been happening gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: It start kinda slow, maybe a month or so ago. I thought it was just the heat, you know? We been havin’ some real hot days. But it just gettin’ worse, and the hunger come on same time. I start notice I losin’ weight too, but I don't know if that have anything to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month or so, gradually worsening, with the hunger starting around the same time and some unintentional weight loss… that's helpful information. About how much weight would you say you've lost, if you have an estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… difficult to say exactly. I don’t weigh myself often. But my clothes feel a little looser, you know? Maybe… five, six pounds? Not much, but enough to notice. My husband say he notice it too. He worryin’ a little.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even a few pounds can be significant when it's unintentional. And it’s good your husband has noticed, too. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your urination – how often you go, or the amount you're passing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I does be goin’ to the bathroom more often, especially at night. I have to get up sometimes two, three times. It not painful, but it… botherin’ me. And it seem like a lot of water when I go, you know? More than usual. I thought maybe I drinkin’ too much, but… now I not so sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca. Increased frequency, especially at night, and a larger volume each time… That’s definitely something we need to investigate. Have you experienced any blurred vision, fatigue, or any skin changes like increased dryness or itching recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… the vision, yes. It gettin’ a little blurry sometimes, especially when I read. I thought it was just my eyes gettin’ old! And I does feel tired, more tired than usual. I put it down to workin’ too hard in the garden. My skin… not so much itchy, but it feel kinda dry, yes. I always use lotion, but I feel like I have to use more now. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, all of that is important, Bianca. Thank you for sharing all of this with me. The thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision, fatigue, and dry skin are all things that can point to a few possibilities. Before we go further, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don't have much of a medical history, thankfully. I had the flu a few times, and a bad fall last year, broke my wrist. But nothin' serious, nothin' long-term. I don't take any regular medicine, just some pain reliever for my joints when they botherin' me. My husband, he has high blood pressure, but I don't. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Bianca. No major medical history is helpful. And it’s good to know about your husband’s high blood pressure. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't think so. Nobody in my family have it either, not that I know of. We don't talk about these things much, you know? It not a common conversation. Is that what you thinkin' it could be?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It's good to know there's no family history of diabetes that you're aware of. Based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision, fatigue, dry skin, and the fact that you're not experiencing any pain – diabetes is one possibility we need to rule out. To do that, I’d like to do a quick blood sugar test here in the office. It's just a finger prick, and it will give us a preliminary idea of what's going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A blood test? Yes, that sound alright. If it help find out what wrong, then I want to do it. A finger prick, you say? Not too bad. I have had worse. You think it could be something serious, Doctor? I gettin’ a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re letting me know you're worried, Bianca. It's always best to be informed. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to take these symptoms seriously. A high blood sugar can lead to complications if left untreated, but it's also very manageable with proper care. This test will give us a starting point, and we’ll take things one step at a time. I’m just going to clean your fingertip with an alcohol swab, and then use this lancet to get a small drop of blood. It will sting for a moment, but it shouldn’t hurt for long. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Ready. I just hope it not too bad. I not a fan of needles. But if it help, then I do it. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a tiny pinch… there we go. All done. Let’s see what the reading is… Hmm… okay. Your blood sugar is currently 210 mg/dL. A normal fasting blood sugar is typically between 70 and 100 mg/dL. This result is elevated. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a comprehensive metabolic panel and a Hemoglobin A1c test. The CMP will give us a broader look at your kidney function, electrolytes, and other important markers, and the A1c will tell us your average blood sugar level over the past two to three months. Would you be able to get to a lab for those tests?
PATIENT: 210? That sound high, Doctor. I don't understand all these numbers. So, you think it is diabetes? Oh dear. A lab? Yes, I can get to a lab. There’s one near my house. I'll need a paper or somethin’ to take with me, right? And… what does this mean? What do I need to do now? I'm gettin’ a little scared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Bianca, let’s take a deep breath. It's understandable to be scared, but we're going to figure this out together. A result of 210 mg/dL does suggest diabetes, but we need the additional tests to confirm it and understand how well your body is currently managing your blood sugar. Here’s a lab order for the tests. You can go to any lab, but if you’d like, I can give you a list of labs that are close to your house. The A1c test doesn’t require fasting, but for the CMP, you’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. While we wait for the results, it’s important to start making some small changes. We don’t want to drastically alter your diet before we have the full picture, but I recommend drinking plenty of water, and avoiding sugary drinks like soda and juice. We can talk more about diet and lifestyle changes once we have the results back. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Water, I can do that. And no soda, that not so bad. I don’t drink much of that anyway. Doctor, what does this mean for me? Will I need… shots? Will I be sick all the time? My husband, he worryin’ about me already. And… can I still garden? I love my garden. It the only thing that keep me goin’ sometimes. Is this somethin’ I can manage?
DOCTOR: Those are all very important questions, Bianca, and it's good you're asking them. It's completely normal to feel overwhelmed and worried. First, let’s address the shots. Not everyone with diabetes needs insulin injections. Many people can manage their diabetes with diet, exercise, and oral medication. We’ll know more about what you need once we have the lab results. As for being sick all the time, that’s also not necessarily true. If diabetes is well-managed, you can live a long and healthy life. However, if left uncontrolled, it can lead to complications like kidney problems, nerve damage, and vision loss. That’s why it’s so important to get it diagnosed and treated. And yes, you can absolutely still garden! In fact, gardening is a wonderful form of exercise. Just be mindful of your blood sugar levels and stay hydrated. We might need to make some adjustments to your routine, but it shouldn’t prevent you from enjoying your garden. Diabetes is manageable. It requires effort and commitment, but it doesn’t have to control your life. I'm here to support you every step of the way. We’ll work together to create a plan that works for you and helps you stay healthy. For now, let’s focus on getting those lab tests done. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and create a personalized treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. That sound… better. Thank you. You make me feel a little less scared. I’ll get those tests done first thing tomorrow. And… I’ll try not to worry too much. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. Is there anything else I need to know right now? Anything I should be lookin’ out for? Before I go?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Bianca. And it's okay to be worried – it's a natural reaction. For now, while we're waiting for the results, keep an eye out for these symptoms: Increased thirst: You’ve already noticed this, but continue to monitor it. Frequent urination: Especially at night. Unexplained weight loss: Even if it's gradual. Blurred vision: Fatigue: Slow-healing sores or cuts: Increased hunger: Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet: If you experience any of these symptoms, or if you feel unwell in any way, don’t hesitate to call the office. Also, I'll give you a list of reliable resources for diabetes information. It’s helpful to be informed, but be careful about where you get your information from. Finally, remember that you’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you, and there are many other people who understand what you’re going through. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. You answer everything I ask, and you make me feel a little bit better. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. I appreciate your time and your patience. I’ll see you after I get those tests done.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Bianca. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. We’ll get through this together. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
