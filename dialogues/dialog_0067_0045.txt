DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, it’s… the flushing. I get really red, you know? Happens sometimes. Not always. It’s… hard to explain when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, the flushing. That’s a good place to start. And you say it happens “sometimes,” not always. Can you tell me more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When… let me think. Not when I’m working, never at work. Mostly… when I’m home. Relaxing, maybe watching TV. Or… sometimes after I eat. But not every time I eat. Spicy food… no, doesn't seem to be that. It just… comes and goes. It’s a bit strange. I don't feel hot, just look it.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it happens mostly at home when you're relaxing, and sometimes after eating, but not consistently. And it doesn’t seem linked to spicy foods. You don't feel hot when it happens, just visibly red. That’s helpful. Can you describe what the flushing feels like before it starts?
PATIENT: Before… hmm. That’s a good question. Usually… nothing. I don’t feel anything different. Sometimes… maybe a little bit shaky, inside. Not like a tremble, just… a feeling. Hard to say. It happens so fast. One minute I’m okay, next minute… red. It doesn’t hurt, though. Never hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so often there's no warning, but sometimes a slight shaky feeling beforehand. And it comes on quickly, and doesn’t cause any pain. Now, besides the redness and occasional shaky feeling, are there any other symptoms that happen with the flushing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. Sometimes… my heart beats a little fast. Not racing, just… noticeable. And… maybe a little bit dizzy. But not like I’m going to fall, just… lightheaded. It doesn't last long, though. Everything goes away pretty quick. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? Being so red.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds unsettling, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel embarrassed. So, to recap, you experience flushing – redness – that can be accompanied by a slightly faster heartbeat and brief lightheadedness. It comes on quickly and resolves relatively quickly as well. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, even if it's not consistent?
PATIENT: Trigger… that’s a hard one. Nothing I can really put my finger on. I thought maybe the TV? Watching something sad, or exciting. But it’s not always. Sometimes it happens with a nice, quiet show. I… I really don’t know. I haven’t changed anything in my life, really. Same food, same routine. It just… started a few months ago. Maybe three months? Four?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about three or four months ago, and you haven’t identified any clear triggers, despite trying to think about it. And there haven’t been any major changes in your lifestyle recently. Now, I'm going to ask some broader questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a long time ago, maybe ten years? But the doctor said it was fine after a few months of medicine. Haven’t had any problems since. And… I lost my wife a few years back. But… that’s not a medical condition, is it? Just… sad. I don’t really see a doctor much, if I can help it. Everything usually goes away on its own.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your wife is incredibly difficult, and certainly impacts your health and wellbeing. It's good you were able to get your blood pressure managed a decade ago. And it’s perfectly understandable to only see a doctor when necessary. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not even vitamins. I tried some fish oil for a while, but it didn't seem to do anything, so I stopped. Just… nothing. I prefer to avoid medicine if I can. My wife… she always said too much medicine is worse than not enough. I tend to agree.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements currently. And no allergies to any medications that you are aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any problems with that. I can eat anything, take anything, usually. I don't think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything, to be honest. Just… normal. I’m pretty lucky, usually. Except for this flushing thing, of course. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, this doesn’t sound like an allergic reaction. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had similar problems – flushing, or perhaps issues with blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had some heart trouble when she got older. But I don’t know much about it. She didn’t really talk about her health. And… my father, he was pretty healthy, as far as I know. Never got sick. My wife’s side… I don’t know them very well. She didn’t keep in touch with her family much either. So… no, not that I’m aware of. Nothing like this, anyway. Everyone just… got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known family history of similar conditions. Now, I'm going to ask about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never. Not even a little bit. My wife didn't like it, so I didn't either. And I never really saw the point, to be honest. Just… never liked it. I drink tea, though. Lots of tea. Black tea, mostly. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That counts! Thank you for letting me know. And do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she hated smoking. Said it was bad for your health. And I agreed. I try to stay healthy, you know? Even if I’m just getting red for no reason. It's just… frustrating. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that. It’s admirable that you prioritize your health. Alright, one last question about your lifestyle. Can you tell me about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. Lots of vegetables, rice, chicken. Fish sometimes. I cook at home most nights. I like Indian food, of course! But not too spicy. I like… simple things. I don't eat a lot of processed food, or junk food. I used to bake with my wife, but… I don’t do that much anymore. I eat enough to stay healthy, you know? Nothing special. Just normal food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It's just… worrying. I don’t like being sick, even if it’s just a little bit red. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m not seeing any visible rash or other skin abnormalities at this moment. Your skin appears normal in color. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s happening, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us rule out some potential causes of flushing. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think will help, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Blood tests are fine. I just want to know what's going on. It’s just… strange. And worrying. I don't want it to be anything serious. I'm not insured, though. Will that be a problem?
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern. I understand not being insured can make things difficult. Let me check the costs for these tests and see what we can do. Some labs offer assistance programs, and we can explore those options. The tests I’m thinking of include a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and some basic metabolic panels. These will help us look for underlying issues. I will also order a cortisol level. The total cost will be approximately $200-$300. We can discuss payment options, and I can also see if there are any community resources that might be able to help. In the meantime, I’m going to tentatively rule out thyroid issues, but we need those tests to be certain. I also want to rule out any underlying infection. While waiting on results, it’s probably best not to worry too much. But if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Would you be okay with scheduling the blood tests today?
PATIENT: Yes, scheduling them today is fine. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I’ll pay whatever I can. $200-$300 is… a lot. But I guess I have to know what’s going on. I don’t want it to be anything serious. Chest pain… no, I haven’t had any of that. Just the redness, and a little bit of dizziness sometimes. Okay, let’s schedule the tests. Whatever is easiest for you. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab order sent over to the lab across the street. They take walk-ins, so you can go over anytime today. They'll draw your blood, and the results should be back in about 3-5 business days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results then. Here’s the order. Make sure to bring your identification with you. In the meantime, try to monitor your symptoms. Keep track of when the flushing occurs, and if anything seems to trigger it. And again, if you experience any chest pain, severe dizziness, shortness of breath, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I’ll go to the lab today, and I’ll keep track of when the flushing happens. And I'll remember about the emergency room. Thank you very much, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a little bit. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
