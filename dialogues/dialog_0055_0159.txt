DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Elijiah. Uh… well, it's kinda weird, honestly. I’ve been having trouble… getting out of chairs. Like, I sit down, and then… it just takes a lot to stand back up. It’s not pain, exactly, just… effort. More effort than it should, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. A difficulty rising from a seated position. Yes, I understand. And how long has this been occurring, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three, four months ago? At first it was just after a long shift, feeling tired. But now it happens even when I haven’t been doing much. It’s getting worse, slowly. I didn't think much of it at first, figured it was just getting older, you know? But it’s… persistent.
DOCTOR: “Getting older” at your age is… unlikely to be the sole cause, Elijiah. Three to four months, progressively worsening… and it’s not associated with any specific injury or event?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. No falls, no twistin' my back… just… started happenin'. I work oil and gas, so I'm always movin', liftin' stuff, but nothin' different than usual, honestly. It’s just… when I go to stand, it feels like I gotta… push. And sometimes my legs feel kinda shaky when I do get up. It doesn't happen every time, but it's happenin' more and more.
DOCTOR: Oil and gas… a physically demanding profession, certainly. Shaky legs, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, shaky. Not like I can't stand, it’s just… wobbly for a second or two. Enough that I gotta hold onto somethin' sometimes. It’s kinda embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be able to jump outta bed, you know? Now I gotta… plan my stands. It sounds dumb, I know.
DOCTOR: Not dumb at all, Elijiah. It’s prudent to acknowledge a change in physical capability. Now, aside from this difficulty rising and the shakiness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Uh… not really. I get tired easy, but I always figured that was the job. I ain’t been sick, no fever, no aches… nothin’ else really. Oh! Wait. Sometimes my knees feel… creaky. Like an old door, you know? But that’s only when I’ve been on my feet all day. And it goes away when I sit down.
DOCTOR: "Creaky" knees… and only with prolonged standing. I see. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Not really. I broke my arm when I was a kid, climbin' a tree, but that healed up fine. And… well, my wife… she passed away a couple years ago. But that was… not a medical thing. Just… sad. No surgeries, no major illnesses, nothin' like that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Gotta to keep workin'.
DOCTOR: I understand. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… uh, my folks are both gone. Passed away when I was pretty young, actually. I had a sister, but we kinda lost touch years ago. Haven’t seen her in… well, a long time. So, no family history to really worry about, if that’s what you mean. I mostly keep to myself, work and… try to remember the good times.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Elijiah?
PATIENT: Nope. Don't take nothin'. Never really needed to, knock on wood. I try to avoid pills if I can, you know? Always figured if I can tough it out, I will. I drink coffee, lots of it, to stay awake at work, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, nothin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination to assess your strength and range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you gotta do, Doctor. Sounds good. I just… hope you can figure out what’s goin' on with me. It's kinda scary, not knowin', you know? I gotta be able to work.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, if you would, have a seat on the table. We will begin with a simple assessment of your lower extremities. First, could you please extend your legs straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It feels kinda weird, stretchin' 'em out like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is fine. Now, I will test your strength. Please, resist as I push down on your legs, one at a time. Push back against my hand. Do not strain yourself.
PATIENT: It’s… a little hard, actually. Not weak, exactly, but… feels like somethin’s tight. Is that normal? I’m tryin’ to push, honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the left leg. Push back against my hand, please.
PATIENT: Okay, there we go. This one feels… better. Still not as strong as it should, maybe? I dunno. It’s hard to tell. I haven’t been pushin’ nothin’ lately, just workin'.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I would like to assess your reflexes. Your right reflex is… diminished. And now the left.
PATIENT: That… didn't feel like much. I felt a little somethin', but not a big kick or anything. That one was a little better, I guess. Still not like when I was a kid. Feels kinda… slow. Is somethin' wrong, Doctor? I'm gettin' worried now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Elijiah. Based on these preliminary findings—diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and the difficulty you described—there are several possibilities. It’s too early to reach a definitive diagnosis, but we need to investigate further. I suspect this may be related to nerve compression or a possible issue with your spinal column, though further imaging will be needed to confirm this. I am going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. And I would like to schedule you for an MRI of your lower back to visualize your spinal cord and nerves. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious. Is it gonna hurt? And what kinda cost are we talkin' about? I don't have insurance, you know? I can pay somethin', but… I ain't got a lot of money. And what if it is somethin' bad? Can I still work? I need to work.
DOCTOR: Mr. Fratoni, an MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure—it does not involve any pain. It simply uses magnetic fields to create detailed images of your anatomy. Regarding cost, I understand your concerns. The price can vary, but I will have my staff contact you with a cost estimate and explore potential financial assistance programs available at the clinic. As for your ability to work, that is difficult to say at this stage. The severity of any potential issue will determine that. We need the results of the MRI to understand the full extent of the problem before we can discuss that. It is premature to speculate. I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist. They are specialists in nerve and spinal cord disorders and can provide a more definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… okay. If you think it’s best. I guess I gotta do whatever it takes to figure this out. Yeah, contact my staff… yeah. And please, try to find out about the cost. I really need to know. I got bills to pay, you know? I just… I don’t want to lose my job over this. What kind of timeline are we lookin' at? How long 'til I can get the MRI?
DOCTOR: Alright. My staff will contact you to schedule the MRI within the next 24-48 hours. It typically takes a few days to get an appointment, depending on availability. Once the images are acquired, the radiologist will need to interpret them, which can take another 24-48 hours. I will have my staff reach out to you as soon as we have the results. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. Lifting heavy objects, prolonged standing, anything that makes it more difficult to rise from a seated position. I will also provide you with a referral to a neurologist, and a written summary of our consultation, including the blood work order and the MRI requisition. Does that sound satisfactory, Mr. Fratoni?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that sounds alright. Just… keep me updated, please. And let me know about the cost as soon as you can. I really appreciate it, Doctor. I just… I'm scared, you know? This job is all I got. Thank you. I think that’s all for now, right? I should probably get goin’. I got a shift startin’ soon.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Fratoni. That will be all for now. My staff will be in touch shortly. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any immediate concerns. Here is the summary of our consultation and the requisitions you will need. Have a good day. And try to rest. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
