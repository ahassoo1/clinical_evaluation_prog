DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Heidenthal, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks. It’s… well, it’s my memory. It’s been a bit off lately, and it’s starting to worry me. I just… forget things. Little things, mostly, but more often now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “A bit off,” you say. Okay. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh, that's a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months? It started slowly, just misplacing keys or forgetting why I walked into a room. But the last couple of months, it feels like it’s getting worse. Like, I had to ask a neighbor yesterday what day it was. That's not like me.
DOCTOR: Right. Six months, progressively worsening. And you said forgetting what day it was… are there other examples?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I sometimes have trouble remembering appointments, even ones I’ve written down. And I've repeated myself a few times during conversations with friends, which is embarrassing. It's not like big things, you know? I haven't gotten lost or anything. It's just… frustrating little gaps. I also keep finding things in odd places – my glasses in the fridge last week!
DOCTOR: Odd places, repeating yourself… Alright. And has anyone else noticed this?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. My sister, Greta, she mentioned it a couple of times. She said I ask the same questions over and over, and that I sometimes get confused about recent events when we talk on the phone. She was the one who really suggested I come see someone. She worries. I didn’t think much of it at first, but… now I'm starting to worry too.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, it’s good someone else has noticed. And it's always better to get these things checked out. Now, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not really, not that I know of. I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that’s it. I'm pretty healthy, I think. I try to eat well, and I walk my dog every day. I have Medicare, so I get my regular check-ups, but nothing’s ever come up. No major illnesses or anything. Are you thinking this could be something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Heidenthal, it's too early to say. It could be a number of things, and we need to rule some things out. Gallbladder removal ten years ago… good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. Just over-the-counter stuff when I have a headache, like ibuprofen. Nothing prescribed. I don’t really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to. And I’m not really into supplements or anything like that either. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And no allergies to anything that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Nope, no known allergies. I can eat anything, thankfully! Dust bothers me a little sometimes, but that's just a sneeze or two. Not a proper allergy. Is this all normal? So many questions! I feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Heidenthal. We need to get a complete picture. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of memory problems or dementia in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had Alzheimer's. It was a long process, and very sad. And I think… I think my great-uncle also had some sort of memory issues later in life, but I wasn’t very close to him. I don’t know much about it, honestly. My mother never really talked about it much. It was a difficult subject, I think.
DOCTOR: Alzheimer's in the family… alright, that's important information. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Um, sure. I live alone in a small house in town. I’m a dentist, as you know – I have my own practice. It keeps me busy, pretty much six days a week. I don't have a lot of free time, but I enjoy my job. I walk my German Shepherd, Gunther, every morning and evening. I read a bit, mostly mysteries, and I sometimes meet friends for coffee. Nothing too exciting. I’ve been single for a long time, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay. Single, busy dentist, active lifestyle… It all sounds… fairly normal, but given your family history and the progression of your symptoms, we need to do a few tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to start with a brief cognitive assessment, right here in the office. It's just a few simple questions and tasks, to see how your memory and thinking skills are functioning. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I mean, I’m a little nervous, but I understand. If it helps figure things out, I’m happy to do it. Just tell me what I need to do. I guess I should warn you, I’m not very good with puzzles.
DOCTOR: It's not a puzzle, Ms. Heidenthal. It’s a series of questions. We’ll start with some simple recall tasks. First, I’m going to say three unrelated words. I want you to try and remember them. Ready?
PATIENT: Okay, ready. Yes. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Good. The words are: apple, table, penny. Repeat them back to me, if you can.
PATIENT: Uh… apple… table… and… penny. Is that right? I think those were the words. It feels… strange, trying to hold them in my head like that.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, I’m going to ask you a series of questions about your current date and location. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Um… today is… August… the second? August second, 2025? I think. Is that right? I’m terrible with dates normally.
DOCTOR: It is August second, 2025. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Oh! Uh, this is… Doctor Donate’s office? In… in town. I think it’s a rural clinic, right? I remember seeing the sign on the way in. I feel like I’m being tested in school again! Is this going badly?
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, we are simply gathering information. It is not a "test". Now, let's move on to a slightly different task. I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards.
PATIENT: Uh… d… l… r… o… w? Is that right? Oh gosh, this is hard! I always struggle with spelling, even forwards. Am I doing terribly? I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: It’s… passable. Now, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing 10 minutes past 11. Please include all the numbers on the clock face. Here’s a piece of paper and a pen.
PATIENT: I’m really not very good at this. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for now. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, based on this brief assessment, and given your family history, I'm concerned enough to recommend some further testing. Specifically, I’d like you to get an MRI of your brain, and a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation. This will give us a better understanding of what’s going on with your memory and thinking skills. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Uh… an MRI? Is that… is that going to show something bad? And a neuropsychological evaluation… what does that even involve? Will it be… painful? I… I’m not sure I like the sound of this at all. It's just… I was hoping it would be something simple. Is it possible it's just… stress? I have a busy practice, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, I understand your concern. However, dismissing this as “just stress” would be irresponsible. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging procedure – you'll lie in a scanner, and it will take detailed pictures of your brain. There is no pain involved, though some people find it claustrophobic. As for the neuropsychological evaluation, it's a series of tests administered by a specialist, to assess your cognitive abilities. It’s not painful, but it will take several hours, and it’s quite demanding. We need to rule out other possibilities, such as a tumor, stroke, or early-onset dementia. Given your grandmother's history, it would be negligent not to investigate further. I’ll provide you with referrals to a radiology center and a neuropsychologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… I understand. It just… it sounds like a lot. And… scary. Will I… will I know when the results are ready? And… what if it is something bad? What do I do then? I don’t… I don’t know if I’m ready for all this.
DOCTOR: The radiology center will contact you to schedule the MRI. The neuropsychologist will arrange an initial consultation. As for the results, yes, you will be informed. We will discuss the findings and explore treatment options, if necessary. Look, Ms. Heidenthal, worrying about it won’t change anything. Getting these tests done is the responsible course of action. I’m providing you with these referrals. It’s up to you to schedule them. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Um… no. I… I don't think so. Thank you, Doctor. I… I’ll schedule the appointments.
DOCTOR: Very well. .
