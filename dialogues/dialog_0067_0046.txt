DOCTOR: Good morning, Marialena. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pfennig. It’s very nice to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… well, pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… a consistent feeling, not really sharp pain, but just a fullness, like I need to go to the bathroom even when I’ve just gone. It happens throughout the day, and sometimes it wakes me up at night, too. Perhaps once or twice a week.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s a consistent fullness, not sharp pain, and you’re feeling the need to urinate frequently, even after you've just gone. And it’s waking you up about once or twice a week. Is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's right. And no, not that I've noticed, truly. I've tried to think about it, and whether it’s after drinking coffee, or a lot of water, or… nothing seems to change it consistently. It’s just… there. It doesn’t feel related to what I eat or drink.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific in terms of diet or fluids. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. The color seems normal, and I haven’t noticed any blood or anything unusual like that. It flows normally, too – no difficulty starting or stopping, and the stream is… regular, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. No changes in color, no blood, and a regular stream. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No fever, no chills, and absolutely no back or side pain. I've been feeling generally well, otherwise. Just this… persistent pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you had any previous medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension a few years ago, but it’s well-controlled with medication. Otherwise, nothing major. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing lasting. And I’m currently taking a low dose of lisinopril for the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have well-controlled hypertension, managed with lisinopril. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t had any surgeries. Never needed them, thankfully. Just the usual check-ups and things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had diabetes, type 2, and my grandmother on her side also had high blood pressure. My father was generally healthy, though. Nothing else really significant that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe once a month. And I definitely do not use any recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol use, no recreational drugs. Now, last question for this part: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any known allergies. No food allergies, and I haven’t had any adverse reactions to any medications in the past, to my knowledge. I'm very careful about taking new things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. Thank you for that thorough information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd also like to do a quick neurological check. Then, I'll do a quick pelvic exam. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Dr. Pfennig. I trust your judgment. Please proceed. I would appreciate any explanation you can offer as you go along, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I’m listening for any unusual sounds and to assess for any tenderness. Okay, your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds or tenderness. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological check, just to assess your reflexes and sensation. Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Now, I'd like to proceed with a quick pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step before I do it. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point. I’m just going to use a speculum to visualize your cervix. This might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Cervix appears normal. Now, I’ll do a bimanual exam, feeling your uterus and ovaries. Uterus feels normal in size and position. Ovaries are normal to palpation. No adnexal masses or tenderness. Okay, the exam is complete. Everything appears normal on initial examination.
PATIENT: That all sounds… reassuring, thank you, Dr. Pfennig. Everything feeling normal is a good start. What are your thoughts at this point? Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this pressure?
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities. Given the consistent pressure without any fever, chills, or changes in your urine, a urinary tract infection is less likely. The normal pelvic exam makes other structural issues less probable, but not impossible. It's possible this could be related to something called interstitial cystitis, which is chronic bladder inflammation causing similar symptoms, or possibly pelvic floor dysfunction. Another possibility, given your hypertension, is that you might have some mild bladder overactivity due to nerve sensitivity. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine analysis to rule out infection definitively, and a post-void residual urine test to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Pfennig. Ordering those tests to rule things out and get more information is exactly what I would expect. Yes, please go ahead with the urine analysis and the post-void residual test. What does the post-void residual test involve, exactly?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. The post-void residual test is pretty simple. After your urine sample is collected, you will urinate as you normally would. Then, immediately after you finish, a small catheter will be inserted into your bladder for just a few seconds to measure how much urine remains inside. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. The whole process takes only a few minutes. The results will tell us if you're completely emptying your bladder. While we are waiting for the results of the tests, I would like to recommend a bladder diary for a few days. This can help me to get more information about your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, a bladder diary sounds perfectly reasonable. Tracking my intake and output might offer some useful insight. And yes, I understand the post-void residual test; it sounds manageable. I agree, let’s proceed with both. How long should I keep the diary? And will the results of the tests be sent to my primary care physician as well?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Keep the bladder diary for three days – just note the time and amount of each fluid you drink, and the time and amount of each time you urinate. Try to be as accurate as possible. And yes, I will send the results of the tests to your primary care physician. They’ll be included in your chart, so they'll have all the information as well. In the meantime, you can try to avoid caffeinated beverages and alcohol, as these can sometimes irritate the bladder. If you're able to collect the urine samples and keep the diary, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results and plan the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a very good plan, Dr. Pfennig. I will be sure to collect the urine samples and keep the diary diligently. And I will cut back on caffeine and alcohol. A follow-up appointment in a week sounds perfect. Thank you for your thoroughness and for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to give you instructions for collecting the urine samples and schedule your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Pfennig. You as well. .
