DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my leg. It's been swelling up. After the… you know… the cancer stuff. It’s just… puffy. And a little uncomfortable. I hope it's not too bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Swelling after cancer treatment is certainly something we need to investigate. "The cancer stuff," as you put it, can have lasting effects, and it's good you're bringing this to our attention. When you say it's been swelling, about how long has it been puffy?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh... let me think. It started, I think, maybe… a month ago? At first, it wasn't much. I thought it was just from sitting too long. But it’s gotten worse the last week or so. It’s mostly my right leg. The left one is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started about a month ago, gradually worsening, and is primarily affecting your right leg. That’s helpful to know. Is the swelling constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly there. All the time. But it gets worse at the end of the day, you know? If I’ve been on my feet. Or even just sitting for a long time. It feels… tighter then. Like a band around my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s consistently present, but exacerbated by prolonged sitting or standing, feeling tighter at the end of the day. That gives me a better picture. Aside from the tightness and swelling, have you noticed any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain. It's more like… achy. A dull ache. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it's there if I pay attention. And sometimes, my leg feels… heavy. Like I’m dragging it around. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so an achiness, not sharp pain, and a feeling of heaviness. It’s good you're describing everything to me, Ms. Queener. That heaviness is something we should definitely explore. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my history? Well… the cancer, of course. Breast cancer. They did… surgery, and then radiation. That was… a few years ago now. Maybe… four? Five? I’m not so good with dates. And I have… high blood pressure, the doctor tells me. I take pills for that. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of breast cancer treated with surgery and radiation about four or five years ago, and currently managed hypertension. That’s important information. Do you remember what medications you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s a little white pill… I think it starts with an ‘A’? Amlodipine? Is that right? And… maybe another one. I have so many pills! I’ll have to ask my daughter, she keeps track of it better than I do.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is a good start. It’s very common for patients to have multiple medications, and it's perfectly fine to check with your daughter for a complete list. We can also verify everything through your pharmacy records if that's alright with you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I eat everything! And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any pills before. I've taken so many in my life, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And have you had any surgeries other than the breast cancer surgery?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Oh! I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… I think I had a bunion removed. But that was… ages ago too. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and bunion removal, both in the distant past. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... my mother had high blood pressure too, and my sister had… something with her heart, I think. Not sure exactly what. And my father… he was healthy as a horse, really. Never sick a day in his life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and a sister with some sort of heart condition. That's helpful. Now, Ms. Queener, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh no, never! I never smoked a day in my life. My husband… he used to, but he quit years ago. It's terrible for you, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing much. A glass or two, maybe three if it's a special occasion. It helps me relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, light alcohol consumption. And finally, could you tell me a little about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I used to walk more. Before my leg started swelling. Now, I mostly sit. I like to read, and watch TV. I try to do a little bit of gardening, but it’s hard when my leg feels heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a decrease in activity due to the leg swelling. Thank you for sharing all of this information, Ms. Queener. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination of your leg to assess the swelling and look for any other clues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling both legs now. Your right leg is noticeably warmer and larger in circumference than your left, particularly around the calf. There’s some mild tenderness when I press here , but no severe pain. I’m also checking your pulses… Your pulses feel normal in both legs. I’m going to listen to your lungs now, just to rule out any other potential causes. Your lungs sound clear. Alright, Ms. Queener, based on the examination, the swelling, warmth, and tenderness in your right leg raise suspicion for a few possibilities, including deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, or lymphedema. Because of your history of cancer, DVT needs to be ruled out quickly. We'll need to get some further testing. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg to check for any blood clots. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh my. A blood clot? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? I mean, is it dangerous? Ultrasound… yes, okay. Whatever you need to do. Just tell me what it means.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking. Yes, a blood clot can be serious, but it’s also very treatable, especially when caught early. That's why we're doing this testing. A DVT happens when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg. If the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs, it can cause a pulmonary embolism, which is why it's important to rule this out. We'll get the ultrasound done as quickly as possible. I’m going to order it now, and the technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid prolonged sitting or standing, and elevate your right leg whenever possible. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Elevate… yes, I can do that. Put my feet up. Okay. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will the test take? And when will I get the results? I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound itself should take about 30-45 minutes. The results usually take about an hour or two to come back, and I will call you as soon as I have them. I'll explain everything very thoroughly at that time. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or if the swelling or pain in your leg worsens significantly, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Chest pain... okay, I understand. Sudden. And shortness of breath. Alright. Yes, I’ll remember that. Okay. Well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Queener. We’ll get to the bottom of this. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try to rest your leg. .
