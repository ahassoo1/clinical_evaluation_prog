DOCTOR: Right. Yamir Shanor, 31 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, that's me. I need… evaluation for referee. For fitness. For the games. I want to make sure I'm okay to do it. You know, run around, not get too tired. It's important.
DOCTOR: Referee fitness evaluation. Right. And you're concerned about… general stamina, then?
PATIENT: Yeah, stamina. And… not getting hurt. I’m not… young anymore. And… things happened. My wife… she… never mind. Just want to be sure I can keep up. It’s a lot of running. And sometimes people… fall. I gotta be ready.
DOCTOR: “Concerns about stamina and potential for injury.” Alright. And has anything specific happened that makes you concerned?
PATIENT: No, not… recently. Just… I want to be careful. It’s for basketball mostly. High school games. It’s… fast. I used to be faster, I think. Before… everything. I don’t know. I just want to be checked, okay? Make sure my heart is good, my legs are good, I don't fall over. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly alright. We'll do a thorough check. To get a better picture, can you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Uh… I don’t really… go to the doctor much. Before… well, never mind. I had the flu once, I think. And a broken arm when I was little. My wife… she took care of everything. I don’t… remember much else. I have insurance, if that helps. Private one.
DOCTOR: Insurance is good. Alright. Since you don’t recall much, let’s start with this. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I eat everything. My wife… she always made sure I ate enough. I… Sorry. I don’t… I just want to get this over with, okay? It’s… hard to talk about all this. Can we just… do the test? See if I’m okay?
DOCTOR: We will do the test, Mr. Shanor. But it’s important for me to get a complete picture. Are you currently taking any medications at all – even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not vitamins, not pills, nothing. Just… water. And sometimes coffee. But that’s not a medicine, right? Look, I just want to be sure I can do this job. I need to know if I’m strong enough. I don’t want to… collapse on the court. Is that so much to ask? Can we please just start? I have games next week.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll proceed with the physical exam then. I need to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and assess your range of motion. It’s standard procedure. After that, we'll discuss if any further testing is needed. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. Scale. Just… hurry, please. I don't like being in hospitals. Or… doctor's offices. It reminds me… never mind. Just tell me if I’m okay.
DOCTOR: 174 centimeters. Now, if you could just face me, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is it… good? Is everything okay so far? I feel a little nervous. It’s… it’s been a long time since someone listened to my chest.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are… normal, but a little fast. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Please extend your arm.
PATIENT: Okay. Is it… bad that it’s fast? Should I be worried? My wife… she always said I worried too much. Just… tell me if I can still referee. That’s all I need to know.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little high, but it could be due to nerves. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please sit back and let your arms relax. I’ll tap on your tendons.
PATIENT: Ow! That’s… cold. Is that normal? They feel… jumpy. Like they want to… move. Are you sure everything is okay? My wife… she always said I have sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit brisk. Now, if you wouldn’t mind, please stand up and I’ll check your gait and balance. Walk normally for me, please.
PATIENT: Like this? Is it… bad? I haven’t walked much lately. Just… around the house. My wife… she used to walk with me. Just tell me if I can still do this. Please. That’s all I want to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Shanor. Thank you. Based on this brief examination, I recommend a few further tests. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your reflexes are hyperactive, and your gait is a little unsteady. I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. It's best to be thorough. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: EKG… blood work…? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Am I… sick? My wife… she always knew what to do. Can I still referee… if I do those tests? Or… is it over? Just tell me the truth. Please.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, it’s not necessarily serious. These tests are just precautionary. We're gathering more information to ensure your safety. It's possible everything is perfectly fine, but we need to rule out any potential problems before you exert yourself physically. As for refereeing, we won’t know until we have the results. It’s best to wait and see what the tests reveal. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: No. No, I don’t want to know. Just… tell me when they’re done. Tell me if I can… keep going. That’s all I need. My wife… she used to handle all this. She always knew what to ask. I… I don’t do well with hospitals. Or tests. Or… things. Just… when will I know?
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab should be able to get the blood work done quickly, and the EKG can be done here in the clinic. I'd estimate we'll have results within 24-48 hours. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. In the meantime, I advise against any strenuous physical activity. Is there anyone you would like us to contact with the results?
PATIENT: No. No one. Just… me. I’ll… I’ll be fine. Thank you. Can I… go now? I just want to go home. .
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. My nurse will escort you to the lab and schedule your follow-up. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Mr. Shanor.
