DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm... what brought me in? Let me think... It's my waterworks, I think. Not working so good, you see. It's hard to… push it out, when I need to go. Does that make sense? It’s been… a little while now, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Waterworks,” alright. Difficulty with… urination, then?
PATIENT: Yes, urination. That’s the fancy word, isn't it? My husband, he always knows the fancy words. But yes, hard to go. Not much comes out sometimes, even when I feel like I need to. It's a bit… worrying, to be honest. It just feels… weak, I suppose.
DOCTOR: And how long has this been going on, Ms. Stoffregen?
PATIENT: Oh dear... how long? That's a tricky one. A while, like I said. Not just started, no. Maybe… a few months? Could be longer, even. Time just… slips away, you know? I haven’t really kept track. It wasn’t bad at first, just a little slow. Now it's… more noticeable, I suppose. It's hard to say exactly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A few months, alright. And has anything changed recently that might have made it worse?
PATIENT: Changed…? Hmm… not that I can recall. Everything's pretty much the same, really. Same husband, same house, same… everything. We haven’t traveled nowhere, that's for sure. Maybe the weather? It's been awfully hot, hasn't it? But I don’t know if that would… affect my waterworks. I really can’t say. Everything feels a little slow these days, if that makes sense. Not just… that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, not really pain. Not a sharp pain, no. Sometimes a little… discomfort, maybe? A little ache afterwards, but nothing terrible. No burning, definitely no burning. Just… feels like it doesn’t all come out, you know? Like something's… holding it back. It's more frustrating than painful, really. It's just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: And do you notice any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question. I haven't been looking at my… you know. Not closely, anyway. My husband usually handles all of that. He'd notice if something was… off, I reckon. I don't know. It looks… yellow, I think? Like it usually does. I really couldn't say if the smell is different. Sorry, I’m not much help with that part.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Stoffregen. We can work with what you do know. Do you have any history of urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Urinary tract infections… Oh, goodness. I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I've had my share of little aches and pains over the years, but I don’t recall anything specifically… urinary. My husband would know, if I had. He always takes me to the doctor when I'm feeling poorly. He's a good man. But no, I don’t think I’ve had one of those. It just feels… different than anything I’ve ever had before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a few. Let me see… I have something for my blood pressure, a little pill every morning. And something for my arthritis, keeps my joints from getting too… grumpy. And a little vitamin D, the doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s it, I think. Just those three. My husband makes sure I take them all, on time. He's very organized, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmmm. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get a little itchy from some of the flowers in the garden, but that wasn’t a medication, was it? No, I don’t think I have any allergies. My husband always asks when they give me something new, and he'd remember if I'd had a bad reaction before. He has a very good memory, that man.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. It’ll just involve listening to your abdomen and checking your reflexes. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Yes, alright. That sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it's going to be… uncomfortable. My old bones aren't as nimble as they used to be. But yes, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table, please. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Hmm… bowel sounds are present, normal activity. And your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Noted mild discomfort in the lower abdomen, but no significant tenderness. Bladder feels slightly full. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing urinary retention. It means your bladder isn't emptying completely. It could be due to a number of things. I’d like to order a urine sample to rule out an infection. And I also think it would be helpful to get a post-void residual volume measurement, to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Retention, you say? That sounds… complicated. And a measurement? Well, if it helps, yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just tell me what I need to do. I'm not very good with all the medical… stuff. A sample and a measurement, you say? Yes, I can manage that, I think. My husband will help, if I need him. Just… explain it slowly, please. My old brain gets a bit muddled sometimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take it one step at a time. First, we’ll collect a urine sample. I'll give you a sterile cup, and I’d like you to collect a midstream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect a sample about halfway through. There are instructions on the cup. Then, after you’ve finished urinating, we’ll use a small ultrasound device to measure how much urine is left in your bladder. It’s painless, completely non-invasive. It just uses sound waves, like when you have a baby scan. A technician will assist you with that part. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a cup! Yes, I can manage a cup. A midstream, you say? Start, then… collect. I think I remember that from years ago. And sound waves, like a baby scan. That sounds… less scary than needles, anyway. Yes, alright. I can do that. A technician will help with the waves, you say? Good. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. Yes, alright. Let’s get this done, then. Just… point me towards the ladies’ room, and I’ll try my best with the cup. Thank you, Doctor. You're very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. The ladies' room is just down the hall to your left. Take your time. And I'll have the technician meet you back here when you're finished. Please let me know if you have any trouble at all.
PATIENT: Oh, excellent. Down the hall, to the left. Alright, thank you, Doctor. I will try my best. And I will let you know if I get stuck with the… cup. Yes. Thank you again.
