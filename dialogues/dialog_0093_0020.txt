DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I am here for… the talk on the phone, yes? The doctor’s office called, for a check-up. My husband… he would always make the appointments. It is… different now.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I see here you were scheduled for a general check-up. And I understand this is your first visit since your husband typically managed your appointments. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll take things at your pace. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall… I think good. I work. I fix cars. It keep me busy. I have some… aches, you know? Old age. But nothing… serious, I think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, the red one. And sometimes, for my knees. But mostly, I just work.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you’re staying active, Ms. Benites. Fixing cars certainly keeps one occupied. And it’s helpful to know about the medications you're taking – the red pill for blood pressure and something for your knees. Could you tell me the names of those medications, if you recall them?
PATIENT: Oh… the names. That is… difficult. My husband, he remember everything. The red pill… I think it start with an “A”? Am… Amlodipine? Is that right? And the knee pill… little white one. I get it from the pharmacy. They know me there. I… do not know the name.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that’s a common medication for blood pressure. And don’t worry about the name of the knee pill, Ms. Benites. We can certainly look that up through the pharmacy records. Now, regarding those aches you mentioned… Where are you feeling them specifically, and how long have you been experiencing them?
PATIENT: Mostly in my back. And my knees, of course. They always hurt a little. But the back… it started maybe six months ago? When I lift something heavy at the shop. I think I pulled a muscle. It go better, then worse, then better again. It is… annoying. Not so much pain, just… stiff.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the back pain comes and goes, and it seems to be related to lifting. And you describe it more as stiffness rather than sharp pain. Does anything specifically make it worse – bending, twisting, sitting for long periods?
PATIENT: Yes, bending is bad. And twisting! At the shop, sometimes I have to get into small spaces. That make it very bad. Sitting is okay, mostly. But if I sit too long, then it get stiff. Standing is… better. I think. It is hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright, so bending and twisting aggravate it, and prolonged sitting can cause stiffness. That gives us a good starting point. Now, let’s talk a little bit more broadly about your health. Have you experienced any other symptoms recently – anything like fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no fever. No chills. I… I have lost a little weight, maybe. But I think it is good. I was… bigger before. My husband, he liked me big. But I feel better now. Not tired, not really. I eat okay. Sometimes I forget to eat lunch at the shop. It get busy. But no big changes, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. A little weight loss is not necessarily a concern if you feel better overall. And forgetting to eat lunch when busy is understandable. Now, have you had any problems with your heart, lungs, kidneys, or any other major organs in the past?
PATIENT: No. No problems. I go to the doctor every year, for check-up. He always say I am strong. My husband, he always say I am strong too.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It’s good to hear you've been consistently healthy and that your previous doctor found you to be in good condition. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No surgeries. No hospital. Once, when I was little girl, I break my arm. But that was long time ago. They put it in a cast. That is all.
DOCTOR: Good. No major surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure. Like me. And my father… he had… problems with his heart, I think. He died when I was young. My brother is healthy. He live in Prague. We do not see each other much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and heart problems on both sides of your family. That’s good information. Now, I'm going to ask about some habits. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No. Never. My husband… he smoke a little, but I always tell him no. Bad for your health. He stop many years ago.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little wine with dinner. Maybe two glasses. Not every day. Mostly on weekends.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wine occasionally. That's fine. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I eat everything. I try everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Benites, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you would please have a seat on the table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Then I'd like to check your reflexes and strength. First, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles.
PATIENT: Okay. That is good to hear. No murmurs… is that bad? My husband, he always told me about his heart…
DOCTOR: No, a lack of murmurs is good. A murmur would be an extra sound, and could indicate a problem with the valves in your heart. But your heart sounds perfectly normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. And I'll just check your strength... Strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities. That's good. And finally, I'll take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears are clear, nose is unremarkable, and throat looks normal. Alright, Ms. Benites, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears to be within normal limits, aside from your slightly elevated blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Good. So, what do we do about the blood pressure? Is that from… stress? My husband… it was always his blood pressure.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned about your blood pressure, especially given your husband’s history. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. While stress can certainly play a role, it’s often multifactorial. We’ll want to investigate further to get a better understanding. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I recommend we start with a few simple lifestyle modifications. These include a low-sodium diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I'd also like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and other important markers. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Low salt… I can do that. And walk… I walk at the shop. Is good exercise. Stress… that is harder. But I try. And blood work… okay. Whatever you think.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll start with those simple changes and see how you respond. I'll write an order for the blood work, and the lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. The results should be back in a few days. I also want to emphasize the importance of monitoring your blood pressure at home. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No. I do not. My husband… he had one, but… after… I do not know where it is.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can get you set up with one. I’ll write a prescription for a home blood pressure monitor. You can pick it up at your local pharmacy. It's important to take your blood pressure at the same time each day, and to keep a log of the readings to bring with you to your next appointment. I also want you to know that I'm here to support you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. We can also discuss stress management techniques at your next visit, or I can refer you to a therapist if you'd like. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind. My husband… he would like you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Benites. I’m glad I could help. And thank you for sharing that – that means a lot to me. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to review your blood work results and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle modifications. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule that for you. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if anything comes up. Take care, Ms. Benites.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
