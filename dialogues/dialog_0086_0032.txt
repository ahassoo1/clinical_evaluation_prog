DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Ahem. Well, it’s… rather unpleasant, to be frank. An issue, down there. A most bothersome issue. I haven’t… well, it’s been a while since I’ve had to discuss such things with a… professional. I suppose it’s a discharge. Not a… a pleasant one.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. I understand it's…sensitive, Mr. Krok. We all have those issues eventually. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? Goodness. Where to begin… It’s… watery, mostly. Sometimes a bit… yellow-ish, I believe. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s not… pus-like, if that makes any sense. And it… smells. Not a good smell, naturally. It's been going on for… oh, dear. Perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. I really can’t be certain. My wife, bless her soul, noticed it first. She has a… sharper nose than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Watery, occasionally yellowish, with an odor… and it’s been approximately a week. Any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Not sharp pain, no. A bit of… discomfort, perhaps. A slight burning sensation when… when I urinate. But nothing… debilitating. It's more of an annoyance, really. Though, it is rather distracting. And, frankly, a bit embarrassing. My wife keeps giving me… looks. A most disapproving look, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Discomfort and burning with urination… Okay. And has there been any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, Doctor, I haven't felt feverish. I took my temperature yesterday, just to be certain, and it was perfectly normal. As for chills… well, it has been a bit cool lately, hasn’t it? But that’s just the summer evenings. And abdominal pain… no, nothing like that. Everything down there feels… normal, except for this bothersome discharge, of course. Honestly, I’m not one to complain, but this is rather… inconvenient. And, as I said, my wife is quite concerned.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krok. Let's move on to a quick physical exam. It's important to rule out anything serious. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll just take a look, and I'll ask you some questions during the exam. It's routine, but it will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other materials?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t believe so. I’ve never had any trouble with… rubber bands or anything of that sort. But my wife does the grocery shopping, she’s the one who keeps track of those things. Perhaps you should ask her. She has a very good memory, unlike myself. But no, I haven’t knowingly had any allergies. As long as it's a quick examination, Doctor. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Right. No known allergies. Very good. Let's proceed, then. If you'll just lie down on your back, please. I'm going to start with an abdominal exam, then we'll take a look at the… affected area. This will only take a few minutes. Just relax.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must say, I’ve never been comfortable with doctors… poking and prodding. Still, if it’s necessary… Do be gentle, if you would. And please, try not to take too long. My back isn't what it used to be either, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation… no masses detected. Now, if you'll excuse me for just a moment… Okay… Slight redness of the glans… No lesions or obvious ulcerations. There is some discharge present, as you mentioned – watery, yellowish, with a distinct odor. No palpable lymph node enlargement in the inguinal region. Okay, Mr. Krok. That's all for the physical exam. It seems we're dealing with some inflammation and discharge. It's likely a case of non-gonococcal urethritis, but we need to confirm with a urine sample. I’ll order a urinalysis and a urine culture to identify any potential bacteria. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Non-gon… what now? Doctor, are you saying I have some sort of… disease? My wife will be furious! A urine sample, you say? Yes, yes, that sounds… reasonable. Though I must warn you, I had a rather large glass of water before coming here. It might take some time. And I do hope this doesn’t involve any… unpleasantness. Honestly, this whole experience has been rather… distressing. Do you think it’s… serious?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, please don’t jump to conclusions. "Non-gonococcal urethritis" simply means inflammation of the urethra that isn't caused by gonorrhea. It's a common infection, often sexually transmitted, but it's usually treatable with antibiotics. We need to confirm the diagnosis with the urine sample, and then we can discuss treatment options. It’s not necessarily “serious” in the sense of life-threatening, but left untreated, it can lead to complications. We’re catching it early, which is good. Please try to collect a mid-stream urine sample. I’ll give you a few moments of privacy. Just clean yourself thoroughly first, and then collect a sample in the cup. I'll send it to the lab right away. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Mid-stream? Goodness, Doctor, you use such… clinical terms! Is it simply a matter of… relieving oneself in a cup? My wife will never let me live this down. Very well. I suppose I haven’t much choice. Just… give me a moment. And please, try not to rush me. It’s… rather difficult at my age.
