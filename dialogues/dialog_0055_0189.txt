DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you please tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Hmph. Pleasure’s all yours, I suppose. Look, it’s not exactly a picnic, alright? I saw… well, let’s just say there was red in the bowl. Not a good sign, is it? A man my age doesn't need that sort of thing upsetting him. I've been flying for… well, a long time, and you don't get rattled easily, but this… this is concerning.
DOCTOR: "Red in the bowl," you say. Yes, well, that certainly warrants investigation. To clarify, Mr. Rowbottom, are you referring to blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood. Yes, blood. What else would it be, young lady? Beet juice? Honestly. Don’t need to spell everything out, you know. I’m not senile… yet. It was definitely blood. Darker red, not bright. Does that make a difference? You doctors always want to know everything.
DOCTOR: It does make a difference, Mr. Rowbottom. Darker red blood typically indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, while brighter red suggests a source higher up in the digestive tract. Now, has this happened before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not in all my years. I’ve had… well, a few stomach troubles here and there, but nothing like this. And I eat reasonably well, for an old man. Not one of those folks living on pills and soup, I assure you. More steak, less… whatever it is young people eat these days. Greens, is it? Ugh. Point is, this is new. A rather unpleasant surprise, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Very well. And when you say "a few stomach troubles," could you describe those for me?
PATIENT: Just… indigestion, mostly. A bit of heartburn after a spicy meal. Nothing a glass of milk couldn't fix. Happens when you've lived a long life and enjoyed a good curry now and then. It wasn't anything to write home about. It certainly wasn't… this. And it hasn't bothered me for years, truthfully. That's what's got me worried, see? A change. Always the changes you need to watch out for.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms currently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, I’ve been a bit tired lately, now that you mention it. But I’m 88 years old! Being tired is practically my default setting. And… my stomach feels a little… gassy, maybe? But again, that’s hardly news. I’m not running marathons here. What exactly are you looking for? It's not like I have a fever or anything.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and increased gas can be associated with a number of things, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits – anything different in terms of frequency, consistency, or color besides the blood?
PATIENT: Color? Besides the… distressing red, you mean? No, not really. It’s usually… solid enough. Not loose, not watery. Goes in, comes out, as it should. Frequency's about the same as always. Maybe a bit less lately, but I chalked that up to… well, being 88. Things slow down, you know? I'm not exactly rushing to the facilities first thing in the morning like I used to. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t see what all the questions are for. It’s blood in my stool, what more do you need to know?
DOCTOR: It's important to gather a complete picture, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or nausea?
PATIENT: Pain? A little discomfort, maybe. A sort of… ache, low down. Not sharp, not stabbing. Just… a dull ache. Comes and goes. And… no, no nausea. I haven't been sick, if that's what you’re asking. Look, I've flown through turbulence that would make a younger man throw up, alright? A little stomach ache isn’t going to bother me. Honestly, are we getting anywhere with this? It’s blood. I need to know what's causing the blood. Is it serious? That's what I want to know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, it is difficult to determine the cause without a proper examination. Given your age and this new symptom, we need to investigate. I would like to perform a digital rectal exam and take a stool sample for testing. This will help us rule out some of the more common causes of bleeding. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: A… what now? A digital… you mean poking around down there? At my age? Honestly, young lady, that sounds… undignified. And what good will poking around accomplish? It's blood! I need a proper test, not… that. And stool sample? I’m perfectly capable of knowing what comes out of my own body, thank you very much. I don't need you collecting… evidence. Is there no other way? Perhaps a blood test? Something less… invasive? I've had enough poking and prodding in my life, thank you.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, a digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating rectal bleeding. It allows me to feel for any abnormalities, such as polyps or masses. A stool sample will check for the presence of blood and other indicators of inflammation or infection. While a blood test can provide some information, it isn’t sufficient to determine the source of the bleeding. I understand your concerns, but this is necessary to ensure an accurate diagnosis. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a basic examination, I can refer you to another physician. However, I must advise you that delaying diagnosis could have serious consequences. Do you wish to proceed with the examination, or would you prefer a referral?
PATIENT: Serious consequences? You’re trying to scare an old man now? Look, I’ve faced worse than a little poking around, alright? I flew supply runs over the Himalayas in a blizzard. But… it's just… humiliating, is all. Fine. Fine! Do your… poking. Get it over with. But I want it done quickly. And I expect a clear explanation of what you find. No medical jargon, understand? Speak plainly. And then, I want a proper test. Something that doesn’t involve… that. Do we have an understanding? And for goodness sake, tell me how long this is going to take. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. It will be a brief examination, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll need you to lie on your side with your knees bent. I will then perform a gloved, lubricated digital rectal exam. It may be uncomfortable, but it should not be painful. After that, I will provide you with a container and instructions for collecting a stool sample. We will send both samples to the lab for analysis, which typically takes a few days. Once the results are in, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Now, if you'll follow me…
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's get this over with. Though I still think it's undignified. And hurry up, alright? My time is valuable, even at 88. .
