DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Press. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this… feeling sick to my stomach, first thing in the mornin'. It’s been goin’ on for a few weeks now, and it’s not gettin’ any better. It’s not a bad pain, just… queasy, ye ken? Especially when I first wake up. I was told to come in about it, seein' as me heart's not the strongest these days.
DOCTOR: Right, a few weeks of morning queasiness… and you mentioned some heart concerns. Let's start with the stomach issues. Can you describe the feeling a bit more precisely?
PATIENT: Aye, sure can. It’s not like food poisoning, nothin’ dramatic like that. More… like when ye’ve been on a boat all night, ye ken? That sort o’ unsettled feelin’. It doesn't usually last long, maybe half an hour or so, but it's enough to put me off me breakfast, which is a shame. It’s just… there. And it always seems to be when I first get up. No real pain, just… a churnin’. And I haven’t been sick, if that makes any difference. Not thrown up at all.
DOCTOR: No vomiting, that’s good. And it's consistently upon waking. Have you noticed anything with it?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right, no chuckin' it up. Hmm… with it… well, sometimes I feel a wee bit breathless, but I put that down to the heart, to be honest. And I’ve been more tired than usual, mind you. But I'm an old man, so that could be anythin'. Oh, and me ankles have been a bit swollen, especially at the end o’ the day. I didn’t think much of it, just figured it was the heat, but now that ye mention it… they’ve been a bit puffier than usual, even for a warm day.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, fatigue, and ankle swelling… right. And you said this all started around the same time as the queasiness?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. It was all pretty gradual, mind ye. First the tiredness, then the puffiness in me ankles, and then the mornin' sick feelin' started a few weeks ago. It's not all at once, mind ye, it’s been buildin' up slowly. I’m not one to complain, ye ken, but it’s gettin’ to the point where I'm worried somethin's not quite right. It's just… a lot of little things all at once, and I thought best to get it checked out. I’m a bit worried it might be somethin’ to do with me heart, seein’ as how it’s not the strongest.
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a number of things. Given your heart history, we should certainly rule out anything cardiac-related. Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible enough, Doctor. I’m happy to get checked over. I’m no’ a fan o’ bein’ poked and prodded, but if it’ll put me mind at ease, I'm game. What'll ye be lookin' for, if ye don't mind me askin’? Just so I know what's happenin', ye ken? And what does “cardiac-related” mean exactly? I get a bit flustered with the medical terms, seein’ as I’m no’ a doctor meself.
DOCTOR: It means we'll check for signs your heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles for swelling. I'll also feel your abdomen. It's a basic exam, really. We're just looking for clues. Now, if you could just lie back on the examination table, please. We’ll start with your heart and lungs. And don't worry, it won't be unpleasant.
PATIENT: Aye, alright then, Doctor. Sounds straightforward enough. I'm no’ the most flexible these days, so forgive me if I creak a bit! Go ahead, I’ll try to stay as still as I can. Just let me know if ye need me to breathe a certain way or anything. I’m ready when ye are. I always get a wee bit nervous at the doctor's, ye ken. It's just… worryin', that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I can hear a slight murmur. Not particularly alarming, but worth noting. Lungs sound clear, thankfully. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And yes, there is definite pitting edema in both ankles. Alright, Mr. Benic. We'll need to do some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. We’ll check your kidney function, your electrolytes, and a few other things. It’ll also be wise to get an ECG, just to look at your heart rhythm. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an ECG… I'm happy enough to do that. I’d rather know what's goin' on than just sit and worry, ye ken? Pitting edema, ye say? What exactly is that? Is it bad? I’m no’ one for fancy medical words, if ye don’t mind me askin’. Is it somethin’ I should be worried about? I’ve noticed them swellin’, but I just thought it was the heat, like I said. I appreciate ye takin’ the time to check me over, Doctor. It’s a relief just knowin’ someone’s lookin’ into it.
DOCTOR: Pitting edema simply means there’s fluid buildup in your ankles, causing the swelling. It can be caused by a number of things, including heart failure, kidney problems, or even just prolonged standing. It's not necessarily bad, but it’s a sign something isn’t quite right, which is why we’re investigating. I’ll get the lab order for the blood work and an ECG requisition for you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. The ECG can be done right here in the clinic. Take these to the nurse, and she’ll get everything sorted for you. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and formulate a plan. And please, try to limit your salt intake in the meantime. It can help reduce fluid retention.
PATIENT: Aye, right then. Limit the salt… I can manage that. I’ve always been fond o’ a wee bit o’ salt on me potatoes, but I can cut back. Right. Blood work and an ECG… and no salt. I’ll remember that. Thank ye, Doctor. I appreciate ye explainin’ it all so clearly. How long do ye think it’ll be before we get the results? I’m a bit anxious just waitin’, ye ken.
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets the results back within a few hours. The ECG technician is quite efficient, so that shouldn't take long either. The nurse will let you know as soon as everything is available. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
