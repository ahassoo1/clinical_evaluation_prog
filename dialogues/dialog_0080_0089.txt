DOCTOR: Hi Alese, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is lovely to meet you as well. My goodness, the clinic is… quite nice. Let me see… what brings me in. It’s these pains, you see. Down low. In my abdomen. They’ve been… troublesome. I believe that’s the right word. It’s difficult to recall exactly when they started, but they’ve been… more frequent lately. And quite severe, at times. I was told it has something to do with… SLE? Is that right? I have a bit of trouble remembering these things, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, troublesome pains in your abdomen, more frequent lately, and sometimes severe. And you were told it might be related to SLE – Systemic Lupus Erythematosus?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus… that is a mouthful, isn’t it? I’ve had… treatments for it, over the years. Or, well, I think it was for that. It all becomes a bit hazy, you see. I just know the pains… they don’t feel quite right. Different from anything I’ve experienced before, though I suppose everything feels different when it’s happening, doesn’t it? I apologize for being so… vague.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Alese. It's perfectly understandable to be vague when you’re dealing with something chronic and long-term. It’s helpful you mention they feel different this time. Let's try to pinpoint what's different. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I'm glad I'm not being… too difficult. Hmm. How to describe it… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… deep ache. Like a heavy pressure, almost. And it comes in waves, you see? It builds up, gets quite uncomfortable, and then… eases off a bit. But it never quite goes away completely. And sometimes, it radiates… down into my thighs, I think. Or maybe that’s just my imagination. It’s hard to tell. It's not constant, thankfully. It comes and goes, but it's the intensity when it’s here that worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a deep, aching pressure that comes in waves, radiating to your thighs sometimes, and it's the intensity that's concerning. That’s very helpful. Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, my. A scale… I suppose I can try. Hmm… the worst… well, it’s not unbearable, you understand. But it certainly takes my breath away. I’d say… a 7, perhaps? Maybe an 8 on a really bad day. It makes it difficult to… concentrate. And I find myself just wanting to lie down. It hasn't been a 10, thankfully. I’m rather… stoic, I suppose. I don’t like to complain. But it’s definitely interfering with… everything, really. Is that a good number? I worry I'm exaggerating.
DOCTOR: A 7 or 8 is definitely significant, Alese, and you're not exaggerating at all. It’s good you're able to describe the impact it’s having on your daily life. Now, can you tell me if anything specifically makes the pain worse?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. Let me think… It’s difficult to pinpoint, you see. It doesn’t seem to be related to… food, specifically. Or activity, either. Though, bending over… that sometimes aggravates it. And… stress, perhaps? When I’m feeling particularly anxious, it seems to flare up. But that could just be… my imagination again. It’s hard to separate the two, isn’t it? I do find it’s worse… when I’m tired, certainly. Yes, fatigue definitely seems to be a trigger. A long day… and the pain is much more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending over, stress, and especially fatigue seem to worsen the pain. That's useful information. Now, I’d like to ask about some other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Changes in… bowel habits? Goodness. That's… a rather personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… Well, I suppose… things haven't been quite regular, lately. A bit… constipated, if I'm being honest. And… occasionally, I experience some… bloating. Just a general feeling of fullness, really. Nothing terribly alarming, but… noticeable. It hasn’t been… dramatic, you understand. Just a slight change. Is that… relevant? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly relevant, Alese, and you're not being vague at all. Constipation and bloating are good to know. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood… no, thankfully, I haven’t noticed any blood. That would be… alarming, wouldn’t it? And weight loss… hmm. That’s a bit harder to say. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, you see. I tend to… avoid the scale. But I suppose… my clothes feel a little looser, perhaps? Though that could just be the… fatigue, again. Losing my appetite when the pain is bad. It's difficult to say for certain. I truly haven't been paying close attention. I'm sorry. I wish I were more… observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in your stool, and potentially some unintentional weight loss. Now, let's talk about your medical history a bit. You mentioned being treated for SLE in the past. Do you remember what treatments you received?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. It was so long ago, you see. My memory… isn’t what it used to be. I recall… pills. Lots of pills. And… injections, perhaps? Steroids, I think? Yes, I believe I was on steroids for a while. And… something to suppress my immune system? But the names… they escape me. I saw a rheumatologist for many years. A lovely man, Doctor… Billings, I believe. But I haven’t seen him in… well, I couldn't tell you how long. It was before… everything. It’s all a bit hazy, you understand. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Is there a record somewhere? Perhaps you could… check?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. It's common to forget details over time, especially with a chronic condition. Let me quickly check your electronic health record for any information on your past treatments and specialist visits. Just one moment… Ah, here we are. It looks like you were diagnosed with SLE in 2008 and treated with methotrexate, Plaquenil, and corticosteroids intermittently. You also saw Dr. Billings until 2015. The records indicate some improvement with treatment, but also flares. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes… those names… methotrexate… Plaquenil… They are starting to ring a bell. And Dr. Billings! You remembered him! Yes, flares… I remember those. Quite unpleasant. And the side effects… I recall feeling rather tired all the time. And… some stomach upset. Yes, that sounds… accurate. It's good to know someone else remembers. My own memory is so… unreliable. So, those medications… they helped, for a while, did they? The records don't say, really. Just… appointments and dosages. It's good to have it confirmed, at least. Thank you, Doctor. You've… alleviated a great deal of anxiety.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alese. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Is there anyone in your family with autoimmune diseases, like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, or other similar conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me see… My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. Not rheumatoid arthritis, specifically. Just… general aches and pains. And my aunt… on my father’s side… she had something… an illness, anyway. Something with her joints, I think. But I don’t recall the specifics. We weren’t terribly close, you see. And my grandparents… they were… quite stoic. They didn’t talk much about their health. So, I’m afraid I don’t have a great deal of information. No one specifically diagnosed with lupus, that I’m aware of. It’s possible there was something… lurking in the family history, but it wasn't… discussed. Is that helpful at all? I apologize for being so vague once more.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Alese. Any information is helpful. Now, could you tell me a bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Social history… Hmm. Well, I’m… single. Always have been, really. No children. I used to… travel, quite a bit. Before my health… deteriorated. I enjoy reading. And… gardening, when I have the energy. I live alone. I have a few… acquaintances. Not terribly close friends, I’m afraid. I keep to myself, mostly. It’s easier that way, you see. Less… complicated. Is that what you’re looking for? I apologize for being so… uninteresting. I haven't been very social in recent years. It’s difficult to… maintain connections when you're not feeling well.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alese. I just ask to get a full picture. Now, lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. No, I don't think so. No known drug allergies. I can eat… most things. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to shellfish, but nothing serious. I’ve never had a… severe reaction to anything, that I’m aware of. No allergies to pollen, or animals, or anything like that. I’m… fairly resilient, I suppose. Although, I do get a bit… stuffy when the air is dry. But that’s just… general discomfort. Nothing life-threatening. Is that all? I do hope I haven’t… forgotten anything. I truly apologize for being so… vague. I wish I were more… organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you, Alese. That was very helpful. Now, given your history of SLE, the recent increase in abdominal pain, constipation, and bloating, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your abdomen, palpate it to check for tenderness, and also check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam… that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to… cooperate in any way I can. I do hope it’s not… too unpleasant. My abdomen… can be a bit sensitive, you see. But I’ll try to… remain still. Whatever you need me to do, just let me know. I’m happy to… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alese. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little… diminished, a bit quieter than usual. I'm feeling your abdomen now. It's a bit tender in the lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. No obvious masses. It doesn’t seem to be excessively painful with deep pressure, but there is definitely some discomfort. Your vital signs are within normal limits – blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6. Okay, I’ve completed the exam. It seems there is some tenderness in your lower abdomen, and your bowel sounds are a bit diminished. This, combined with your symptoms and history, suggests a few possibilities. We need to rule out a flare of your lupus, but we also need to consider other causes of abdominal pain, such as diverticulitis or even constipation. I think it would be best to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen to get a clearer picture. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? Blood work… that's… less concerning, I suppose. But a CT scan… is that… necessary? Diverticulitis… I don't believe I've ever… heard of that. And a lupus flare… I suppose that’s… not unexpected. Yes, that sounds… plausible. But a CT scan… could you tell me a bit more about that? What exactly… are you looking for? And is it… painful? I apologize for being so… inquisitive. I just… don't like surprises. I worry it’s something terribly serious, you understand. Perhaps we could… try something less invasive first?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Alese. A CT scan is a more detailed imaging test that allows us to visualize your abdominal organs and identify any abnormalities. It’s not necessarily an indication of something terribly serious – it’s simply a precaution to rule out other potential causes of your pain and get an accurate diagnosis. We're looking for things like inflammation, infection, or any blockages in your intestines. As for pain, the CT scan itself is generally painless. You will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You may need to drink a contrast dye before the scan to help visualize your organs better. Some people experience a slight warming sensation or a metallic taste with the dye, but it's usually mild. The scan typically takes about 15-20 minutes. I understand your preference for less invasive options, and I agree that we should start with blood work. The blood work will help us assess your inflammation levels, kidney function, and rule out any infection. If the blood work is inconclusive, the CT scan will provide more information and help us narrow down the diagnosis. Would you be comfortable proceeding with blood work first?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… yes, that sounds… much more reasonable. A CT scan… I think I’d prefer to… hold off on that, if possible. At least until we’ve… seen the results of the blood work. Yes, that sounds… sensible. Inflammation levels… that's a good idea. And kidney function… I suppose that's important, isn't it? I’ve had… some issues with my kidneys in the past, I believe. Yes, let’s start with the blood work. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. And… how long will it take to get the results? And will you… call me if anything is… concerning? I apologize for being so… anxious. It’s just… I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: You’re not being anxious at all, Alese. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have. We'll order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel , an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to assess your inflammation levels, and a urinalysis to check your kidney function. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and call you directly if anything is concerning. If the results are normal, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in more detail. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating a healthy diet. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen if you’re experiencing pain, but please follow the dosage instructions carefully. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh. Ibuprofen… yes, I’ve taken that before. And acetaminophen… that’s the… Tylenol, isn’t it? Yes, I believe I have some of that at home. 24-48 hours… that seems… reasonable. I suppose I can… wait. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. You’ve… been very thorough, Doctor. And… patient. I apologize for being so… vague at times. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be. Yes, I think that’s all. Thank you… very much. I suppose… I’ll just wait for the call. Is there anything else I need to do… before I leave? Like… sign a form, or… schedule an appointment?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alese. Don't worry about being vague at all – it’s perfectly understandable. Yes, my nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and schedule a follow-up appointment for you. She’ll also give you a copy of your lab orders. In the meantime, if your pain worsens significantly, or if you experience any fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Otherwise, just relax and take care of yourself. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any difficulties ambulating, or need assistance getting dressed?
PATIENT: Oh. No, thank you. I can… manage. I may be a bit… slow, but I can get dressed on my own. I appreciate your… concern, though. Yes, I think I’m… all set. Thank you… again, Doctor. You’ve been… very kind. I'll just… wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Don’t hesitate to ring the call button if you need anything at all. Have a good day, Alese.
