DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome. I'm Dr. Polczynski. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… feeling full awful quick when I eat. It’s been botherin’ me for a little bit now. Don’t seem right, gettin’ full after just a few bites.
DOCTOR: Hmm, okay. Feeling full quickly when you eat… that’s good information to start with. When you say "a little bit now," about how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez… a couple months, I reckon. Maybe three? Hard to say exactly, you know how it is when you get to be my age. Things kinda blend together. It wasn’t sudden, just slowly started happenin’. I used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and bannock, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's common for things to feel a little less distinct over time. Three months, gradually getting worse… That helps. And is it with everything you eat, or just certain foods?
PATIENT: Mostly everything, to be honest. Doesn't seem to matter what it is. Salmon, soup, even just a little bit of toast… I get that full feeling. It's a bit frustrating, 'cause I like to eat! And my wife makes a mean blueberry pie, but I can barely manage a slice these days.
DOCTOR: I can appreciate that – a good pie is worth enjoying! Okay, so it's pretty consistent across different foods. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Hmm… sometimes I get a bit of a stomach ache after eatin’, just a little discomfort. And I’ve been… well, I ain’t been as regular as I used to be, if you know what I mean. Not a big problem, but noticeable. No nausea or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach discomfort and some changes in your bowel habits… good to know. When you say "changes," are we talking constipation, diarrhea, or something else?
PATIENT: Mostly… constipated, I guess you’d say. It takes a bit longer, and it's… well, harder to go, if you get my drift. Not terrible, like I said, but definitely not how it used to be. Used to be like clockwork, now it's… unpredictable. And sometimes a little bit of gas, but I’ve always had a bit of that. Old age, eh?
DOCTOR: Right, unpredictable and harder to pass… I understand. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss lately?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… I reckon I have lost a little bit. My wife keeps sayin' my pants are a bit loose. I hadn’t really thought much of it, just figured it was the summer heat. But yeah, probably a few pounds. Not a lot, but noticeable if you look closely.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few pounds of unintentional weight loss along with the early fullness, stomach discomfort, changes in bowel habits, and constipation… That’s a good amount of information. Have you noticed any blood in your stool or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No, thankfully, no blood. And my stool's been… normal color, I suppose. Not dark or tarry like you said. Just… you know… difficult to get out. No, no blood at all. That would be worryin’, wouldn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that would be concerning. Good. Okay. And just a few more questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or heartburn?
PATIENT: No nausea or vomiting, no. And heartburn… not really. I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, especially if I eat somethin' rich, but not proper heartburn, you know? The burnin’ kind. No, thankfully, none of that. I'm gettin' old, not sick, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Right, no nausea, vomiting, or significant heartburn. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think... Just a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, helps with the achin’. It's called… uh… Naproxen, I think? And sometimes I take a little bit of Tylenol if the pain's real bad. That's about it. No fancy pills or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen and Tylenol as needed for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks, and I always say no. Lucky that way, I suppose. Never had to worry 'bout carryin' an EpiPen or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Mr. Obarr, thank you for all that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and just feel around a bit. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, but please let me know if anything feels painful. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if somethin’ feels off. I ain’t as spry as I used to be, but I can handle a bit of pokin’ and proddin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Please lie flat on your back. Okay. Sounds are… a little quiet, but no obvious abnormalities. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ there. Just feels… normal, I suppose. A bit soft, maybe. I ain't had much cause for doctors to poke around in my belly before, so it's hard to say what's normal and what ain't. A little pressure, but no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay. A little bit of tenderness here, in your upper abdomen. Not anything major, but I’m noting it. No masses that I can feel. And just a little tap here… any discomfort with that?
PATIENT: Nope, that didn't bother me none. A little bit of a hollow sound, maybe? Like… tappin’ on a drum? I don't know. Still just feels a bit… soft, if that makes sense. Not hard or bloated or anything. My belly's always been a bit sensitive, to be honest. I used to get stomach aches when I was a kid, easy upset.
DOCTOR: Alright. Softness and some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen… I’m noting that. Heart sounds are good, lungs sound clear. Okay, Mr. Obarr. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, the early fullness, stomach discomfort, changes in bowel habits, unintentional weight loss and mild tenderness could be related to a few things. It could be something as simple as a change in your diet, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. I think the most prudent course of action is to order some blood work to check for things like anemia and inflammation. I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any hidden blood and rule out infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work and a stool test… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Better to be safe than sorry, right? My wife always says I should get things checked out right away, and I reckon she’s right. So yes, go ahead and order those tests. What do I have to do?
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad you agree. For the blood work, we'll just need a simple blood draw here at the clinic. The nurse will get that set up for you right after this. As for the stool test, I'll give you a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a sample at home. It's pretty straightforward. We'll send the samples to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. Once we have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – like severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, fever, or significant weight loss – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that all makes perfect sense, Doctor. Blood draw here, stool sample at home, wait for results, call if things get worse. Got it. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, knowin' we're gettin' things checked out. Now, where do I go for the blood draw? And will the nurse explain about the… collection kit? It sounds… delicate.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I'm glad I could reassure you. The nurse, Sarah, is right through that door. She'll take you back for the blood draw and explain everything about the stool collection kit. Don't worry, she's very good at explaining things and will make sure you feel comfortable. It is a bit… delicate, as you say, but the instructions are pretty clear, and she'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Let me just print out a requisition for the blood work and a separate form for the stool test. I'll give those to Sarah. She'll get you set up. It shouldn’t take too long. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been very thorough and helpful. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to my worries and explain everything so clearly. Just gettin' it checked out is a relief in itself. Thank you again. I'll go find Sarah now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns after you’ve seen Sarah. Take care, and I’ll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, I will. You take care too. Bye now. .
