DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Dr. Korrell, is it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter just thought I should get… checked out. She worries too much, that one. It's just… curiosity, I suppose. I feel fine, mostly. Just old, you know?
DOCTOR: "Old," you say. Well, that’s not a medical complaint, exactly. But I appreciate you coming in nonetheless. Your daughter sounds very attentive. Perhaps we can just go through a general check-up, then?
PATIENT: A general check-up… hmm. Is that going to take long? I have my book club this afternoon, and Beatrice makes the best lemon bars. I wouldn’t want to miss those. Though, honestly, I can't remember what we're even reading right now. It's all a bit of a blur, you see.
DOCTOR: We can be reasonably efficient. It shouldn’t interfere with your book club. Let’s start with a brief history of present illness – that just means what’s been bothering you, if anything, recently. Even if it's just a general feeling of being unwell. And don’t worry about remembering specifics, we can take our time. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… well, my knees ache sometimes. Getting up and down is a bit of a struggle. And my back… oh, don’t even get me started on my back. It’s been… troublesome for years, I suppose. But it’s just old age, isn’t it? Everyone my age has something creaking somewhere. I doubt it’s anything serious. Honestly, I just wish it didn’t bother me when I’m gardening. I have the prettiest roses, you know.
DOCTOR: Roses, you say?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Hybrid teas, mostly. And a few floribundas. I’ve been tending them for… oh, goodness, decades now. My husband, bless his soul, he helped me get started. He always said I had a green thumb. Though, I can't recall exactly which varieties we planted first… it's all a bit hazy now. But they're lovely. Very fragrant. Do you like roses, dear?
DOCTOR: They sound beautiful. We’ll get back to the roses later, Ms. Calvery. Right now, let’s focus on your knees and back. You mentioned they’ve been troublesome for years. Has the pain been getting worse recently?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. It comes and goes, you know? Some days it's barely noticeable, and others… well, others I need a little help getting out of the chair. My daughter gets quite upset about it. She's always saying I should be more careful, but honestly, what's the fun in being careful? I like pottering around in the garden, even if it does ache a bit afterwards. It’s just… a general stiffness, I suppose. Nothing I can’t manage… usually. Though I did stumble a bit last week. Nothing serious, mind you. Just a little wobble.
DOCTOR: "A little wobble," you say. And the pain… is it a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s not really sharp, no. More… a heavy feeling? Like someone’s got weights tied to my legs. And sometimes it just… burns, a little. Especially after I’ve been on my feet for a while. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a bad pain, you understand. Just… inconvenient. And annoying. Mostly annoying. It stops me from doing things, you see. Things I enjoy. Like deadheading the roses. Though Beatrice brings me lemon bars, so it's not all bad.
DOCTOR: Right. A heavy, burning sensation… and it interferes with your gardening. Ms. Calvery, I’m going to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. This is to get a better picture of what’s going on. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees or back?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now that you mention it… I think my ankles were a little puffy last week. But I thought it was just the heat. It’s been awfully warm, hasn't it? And I might have had a bit too much salt with my dinner. I do enjoy a good snack, you see. But swelling… I don’t usually notice it. My daughter would probably notice it first. She's very observant. Always fussing over me. I’m not sure I’ve ever consciously looked for swelling, to be honest. Too busy enjoying the roses.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on. Have you had any trouble with your balance, apart from the “little wobble” you mentioned?
PATIENT: Balance… hmm. Well, sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet, especially when I turn quickly. But I just put that down to getting older, you know? It happens to everyone, doesn’t it? I haven’t actually fallen, not properly fallen, just a few near misses. My daughter keeps telling me I should use a walking stick, but I refuse. I'm not that old, you see. Though I did nearly trip over the cat this morning. Silly thing, always underfoot. But no, generally my balance is… adequate. I think. It's hard to say, really. I don't spend much time thinking about my balance. Too busy deadheading the roses. Or eating Beatrice's lemon bars.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. Just so we can get a better idea of what’s going on. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, all right, dear. Though I must warn you, I'm not as nimble as I used to be. There. A bit creaky, but I’m upright. Though I do feel rather wobbly. Are you sure this is necessary? I'm perfectly fine, mostly. And Beatrice's lemon bars are calling my name…
DOCTOR: Just routine, Ms. Calvery. Alright, can you bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Like this? It's a bit stiff, you see. Not as easy as it used to be. They pop a bit, too. I don't think they like being bent. There. Better straight. Though I might need a little help getting back into the chair afterwards. And I really must remember to tell Beatrice how delicious her lemon bars are… they’re simply divine. It’s a good thing she bakes them, honestly. A good thing indeed.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about your back?
PATIENT: Oh, my back… Ooh, there. That’s a bit tender, yes. Always has been, really. It flares up sometimes, especially after I’ve been gardening. Or lifting something heavy. Or just… existing, really. It's just an old ache, you see. Nothing to worry about. My daughter always wants me to see a specialist, but I refuse. I've lived with it for years, and it's not that bad. Though it does make bending over to deadhead the roses a bit tricky. And I really should remember to thank Beatrice… she’s such a thoughtful girl. Bringing me lemon bars and worrying over me…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing some degree of osteoarthritis in both your knees and lower back. The swelling, tenderness, and stiffness are consistent with that diagnosis. Your “little wobble” and occasional balance issues could be related, or simply a result of getting older. However, given your history of intermittent balance problems, I’d like to rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? Arthritis? Oh, dear. Is that… serious? My mother had something like that, I think. She had to use a walking stick, eventually. I refuse to use a walking stick. Absolutely refuse. And what did you say about ruling something out? Is there something wrong with me? My daughter is going to be terribly worried. Though she does worry too much, that one. And I really should ask Beatrice for the recipe for those lemon bars… they’re simply heavenly.
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a common condition, Ms. Calvery, especially as we get older. It simply means the cartilage in your joints is wearing down, causing pain and stiffness. It’s not necessarily serious, but it can be uncomfortable, and it’s important to manage it properly. And the “ruling something out” simply means I'd like to order a few blood tests and possibly an X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. It's standard procedure, and doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything seriously wrong. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an X-ray? Oh, dear. All that poking and prodding. And waiting for results… it sounds terribly stressful. My daughter will insist, I suppose. She always does. Very well. If you think it’s necessary. But I’m not promising to be happy about it. And I do hope it doesn’t interfere with my book club. Or my gardening. Or Beatrice’s lemon bars. Can we at least schedule it for Tuesday? I have my hair appointment on Wednesday. It’s very important, you see. One must maintain appearances.
DOCTOR: Tuesday will work. We’ll schedule the blood tests and X-ray for Tuesday morning. Then we can review the results next week. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with your usual activities, but avoid any strenuous exercise that causes significant pain. And perhaps consider a mild over-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, if you’re experiencing discomfort. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I used to be allergic to something, I believe. When I was a little girl, I broke out in hives after eating strawberries. But that was ages ago. I haven’t had strawberries in decades. And I don’t think I’m allergic to anything else. Though my daughter is always telling me to be careful about what I eat. She worries too much, that one. And I really must remember to thank Beatrice… her lemon bars are simply divine. Do you think it's rude to ask someone for the recipe on the first visit? It's just… they're so good.
DOCTOR: No, it's not necessarily rude to ask for a recipe, Ms. Calvery. But perhaps save that for your next book club meeting. Alright, let’s finish up. I’ll have the lab order sent over, and the receptionist will schedule your appointment for Tuesday. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden or severe pain, or any changes in your balance, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough. Though I’m still not entirely sure what “osteoarthritis” is. And I do hope this doesn’t interfere with my gardening. Or my book club. Or Beatrice’s lemon bars. Thank you, Dr. Korrell. You’ve been very patient with an old woman. And tell me, do you enjoy gardening? Perhaps you have a recipe for a particularly good lemon bar? Just asking, of course.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Calvery. I do enjoy a bit of gardening, when I have the time. And I’m afraid I don’t have a lemon bar recipe. Perhaps Beatrice would be willing to share. Have a good day, Ms. Calvery. And please, try not to worry too much. .
