DOCTOR: Good morning, Antoine. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about… a bit of an annoyance, really. It’s in my mouth. It’s…white. And it’s not pleasant. I haven’t much time, if you don’t mind a quick assessment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. We'll try to be as efficient as we can. "White in the mouth," you say. Is this a new issue, or has it been ongoing for a while?
PATIENT: It’s…relatively new. Perhaps a week? Maybe less. I didn’t think much of it at first, honestly. It just…appeared. I assumed it would go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It’s… bothersome when I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or less. And it's bothering you when you eat... is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not precisely painful. It's…irritating. Like a roughness. And unsightly, frankly. I’m a professional man, Doctor. I don’t need this. Is it…serious? Because I have a very important meeting next week.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Antoine. “Irritating roughness,” and it’s affecting your confidence. Let's take a look, and we can try to figure out what’s going on. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: There. But please be quick, Doctor. I really must be going soon. Is it…visible enough for you to see? It's mostly on my tongue, I think.
DOCTOR: Hmm… yes, I see some white patches on your tongue. They appear somewhat irregular. It looks like you may have what's called oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection. Now, it can be caused by a number of things... Have you been using any new mouthwashes or inhalers recently?
PATIENT: Inhalers? No. Mouthwash… I use a standard brand. Colgate, I believe. Nothing fancy. I assure you, Doctor, I maintain very good hygiene. This is… rather embarrassing. Are you certain it’s not something else? Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? My wife is always telling me I don't eat enough greens.
DOCTOR: It's certainly possible, Antoine, and we’ll explore all options. While good hygiene is important, thrush isn't always due to poor oral care. It can occur with a weakened immune system, certain medications, or even just stress. It's more common than you might think. To be certain, and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to take a quick swab of the affected area. It’s a simple test, and it will help us determine the exact cause. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I have a rather sensitive gag reflex, Doctor. And I truly do not have a great deal of time. Couldn't you just… prescribe something? An antifungal, perhaps? I'm sure it's that. I've read things online.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Antoine, and I appreciate your bringing up your concerns about the gag reflex and your time constraints. While I'm happy to consider your self-diagnosis, it's important to be sure before we start any treatment. There are other conditions that can look like thrush, and we want to ensure we are addressing the correct issue. The swab is a quick procedure, and it will give us a definitive answer. However, if you're absolutely opposed to the swab, we can proceed with a presumptive diagnosis of oral thrush and start you on an antifungal medication. But I need to explain the risks. It’s possible it’s not thrush, and the medication won’t help, and it could delay proper treatment if it is something else. And it's important to note, without a proper diagnosis, I am unable to provide definitive medical advice. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Very well. Fine. Do the swab. But be quick about it. And gentle, please. I’m trusting you not to make a scene. Honestly, this is… inconvenient. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax, open your mouth for me, and I'll take a quick sample from the affected area. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. There. All done. It really didn’t take long, did it?
PATIENT: No. No, it didn't. Now what? Do I need to do anything? Can I just go? I have that meeting, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Antoine. We'll send this off to the lab. It usually takes about 2-3 business days to get the results. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you an antifungal mouthwash, nystatin. Rinse with it twice a day after meals for about a week. It's important to follow the instructions carefully. I'll also recommend staying well hydrated, avoiding sugary foods and drinks, and practicing good oral hygiene. Once we have the lab results, we'll discuss them and adjust the treatment plan if necessary. Here's your prescription. I'll also give you a handout with more information about oral thrush and how to manage it. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… efficiency. I really must be going now. Let’s hope this works. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Antoine. You're very welcome. I hope it brings you relief. Feel free to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms don’t improve. Have a good day, and good luck with your meeting. .
