DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, precisely. I am Venus Alvara. I have been… noticing things. Little things, mostly. Forgetfulness. And my blood pressure is… not good. The other doctor said so. I want to… understand what is happening. Quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Alvara. Forgetfulness and high blood pressure… I understand. It's good you're getting this checked out. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, regarding the forgetfulness, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… recent. Perhaps three months, maybe four? Not big things. I leave my keys… somewhere. Or I go to the kitchen, and… forget why. Small tasks. I remember dates, names of people I know… details, actually. But the… everyday things. It is frustrating. And worrying. I do not like this. It was not like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s relatively new – about three or four months – and seems to be with more routine, everyday tasks, not long-term memory. Dates and names are still good. That’s helpful to know. And has anything changed in your life around the same time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? Let me think. My husband… passed away one year ago, nearly to the day. It was… a shock. A very big shock. I have tried to… continue, of course. To be strong. But… it has been difficult. Perhaps… perhaps that is it? The stress? The… emptiness? I do not know. Nothing else… majorly different. I still do the same things, mostly. The community association meetings, the properties… it keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Losing your husband a year ago… that’s incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly normal to experience stress and changes in your routine and memory after such a loss. It certainly could be contributing to what you're experiencing. Now, you mentioned the other doctor told you your blood pressure was high. Do you know what the reading was, or do you have any records of it with you?
PATIENT: Yes. I have it here. It was… 160 over 95, I believe. The doctor said it was… too high. He wanted me to… monitor it. And… see if it came down. It has not, really. Sometimes a little lower, sometimes a little higher. But mostly… like this. And he said something about… memory problems being connected. That is why I am here. I do not want… things to get worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, 160 over 95… that is elevated. And you're right to be concerned. It’s good you’re taking this seriously. Now, besides the forgetfulness and high blood pressure, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms. Sometimes… a little dizziness. Not often, but… when I stand up quickly. And… headaches. Not terrible headaches, but… a dull ache, mostly in the back of my head. And… I have been… very tired. More tired than usual. Even after sleeping. Is this… normal? I do not understand all of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness when standing, headaches, and fatigue… Those are all things we need to look into. It’s good you’re telling me everything. Do you have any problems with your vision?
PATIENT: Vision… Not really. A little blurry sometimes, but I have had glasses for many years. It has not… changed much recently. I see the doctor for my eyes… every year. He says it is normal aging. Nothing… dramatic. I can read, I can see the television… I do not have double vision or… spots, or anything like that. Just… a little blurry sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your vision is stable. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think. I take a small pill for… heartburn. Something the doctor gave me. And… sometimes, I take ibuprofen for my joints. They ache, you see. And… a vitamin D supplement. The other doctor said I was low on that. That is all. Nothing… regularly, except the heartburn pill. Perhaps two or three times a week. And the ibuprofen when it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, heartburn medication, ibuprofen as needed, and vitamin D. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I have eaten… everything, really. I have never had a reaction to anything. No allergies to penicillin, no allergies to… bees, or anything like that. I have never had a problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Alvara, have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm... No. Nothing like that. The doctors always tell me I am… healthy. A little high blood pressure now, but… before this, always healthy. I had chickenpox as a child, and… the usual things. But no serious illnesses. No heart problems, no diabetes, nothing. Is this… necessary? I do not understand why you ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Alvara. I apologize if it feels like a lot of questions. It's just important for me to get a complete picture of your health history so I can understand what might be going on. We're trying to rule things out and figure out the best course of action. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Yes. One. Many years ago. I had my gallbladder removed. Perhaps twenty years ago. It was… a problem. But… everything was fine after that. No other surgeries. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Alvara, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant… medical conditions. My mother… she had heart problems. Later in life. And… my father, he had high blood pressure. Like me. But… that is all, really. No cancer, no… diabetes, nothing else that I know of. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. We do not… see each other very often. It is… a small family. Not many to worry about.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I live alone, in my house. I have a gardener who comes once a week. I try to… eat healthy. Mostly vegetables, fish. I do not eat much meat. I do not drink alcohol. I do not smoke. I walk… sometimes. Not as much as I should, perhaps. I spend time with my community association. It keeps me busy. And I watch television. Is that… enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological check. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That is… fine. If you think it is necessary. I do not like… being examined, but… if it will help. Please be… quick, if possible. I have appointments later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as quick and thorough as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 158 over 92 on your right arm and 162 over 90 on your left. Still elevated. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance seems good, and coordination is fine. No obvious neurological deficits. Everything seems within normal limits so far, but the high blood pressure is concerning. Given your recent loss, forgetfulness, and these findings, I would like to order some blood tests and an EKG to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests and… an EKG. Whatever is necessary. I just want to… understand what is happening. And… to feel better. When can I expect the results? And… how long will it take? I have a trip planned in November, and I would like to… know if I will be able to go.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Alvara. I'll get the orders for the blood tests and EKG sent to the lab right away. It usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I have them, so we can discuss them in detail. Given your symptoms and family history, I also want to consider the possibility of mild cognitive impairment, but we need the test results to rule out other causes first. I'll also write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to start tonight. This should help bring your blood pressure down and reduce your risk of complications. The medication is called Lisinopril, 5mg, to be taken once daily. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… 5mg. Once daily. No, I do not… think so. But… are there any side effects? I do not want to… feel worse. And… will this affect my trip in November?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. Lisinopril is generally well-tolerated, but like all medications, it can have side effects. The most common ones are dizziness, fatigue, and a dry cough. Some people also experience lightheadedness when standing up quickly, which is why it’s important to start with a low dose and increase it gradually if needed. As for your trip in November, it’s too early to say for sure. Once we have the test results, we can assess your overall health and determine whether it’s safe for you to travel. If your blood pressure is well-controlled and you're feeling well, there shouldn't be any problems. I’ll give you a sheet with detailed instructions on how to take the medication and what to watch out for. It’s important to monitor your blood pressure at home if you can, and let me know if you experience any significant side effects. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to check your progress. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. A follow-up appointment in one week. I will monitor my blood pressure. And… I will let you know if I feel… unwell. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… thoroughness. I just want to… feel like myself again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Alvara, that's not too much to ask at all. And we will do everything we can to help you feel like yourself again. It's a process, but we'll take it one step at a time. Here are the prescriptions and the patient instructions sheet. The lab results will be sent directly to my office. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and I'll see you next week.
PATIENT: It was… a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. I will… take care. And I will… see you next week. Thank you again.
