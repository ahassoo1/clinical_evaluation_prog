DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Um... well, to be quite honest, I'm not entirely sure what brings me in. My husband insisted I come. He says my speech hasn't been clear lately. I... I haven't really noticed, but he's quite worried. It's just... a bit slurred, he says.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good of him to be attentive, and good of you to come in to get it checked out. Slurred speech can have a lot of different causes, some more serious than others, so it's always best to figure out what’s going on. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me when you first started noticing – or rather, when your husband first started noticing – this change in your speech?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's…difficult. It wasn’t a sudden thing, you see. I really don’t recall a specific date. Perhaps… a few weeks ago? Maybe a month? It’s all a bit hazy, truthfully. I'm terribly sorry. I don’t have a good memory for things like that. Was it before or after the holiday? Oh, goodness. I'm making this harder, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, you’re not making it harder! It’s perfectly alright. It is difficult to pinpoint these things. "A few weeks to a month ago" is helpful. And knowing it wasn’t sudden is good too. Okay. Has this been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It... comes and goes, I think. Some days I don’t even think about it, and other days… well, my husband points it out, of course. I don’t usually feel different, if that makes sense. I don't feel like I'm struggling to speak, but he says it sounds different. It's more noticeable when I'm tired, I believe. Or maybe when I've been talking for a long time? It's hard to say for certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse with fatigue or extended talking, and not constant. That’s useful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Um… not that I’ve noticed, no. I haven’t been feeling unwell, no fever or headaches. No dizziness, no weakness. I’ve been a bit more tired than usual, perhaps, but I just assumed that was from work. Being on my feet all day is quite exhausting, you know. Construction work is… demanding. No trouble swallowing, no blurry vision... I can't think of anything else, truly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, headaches, dizziness, weakness, vision changes, or swallowing difficulties. Just the fatigue, which you attribute to work. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... I believe I had high blood pressure a few years back, but it was managed with some medication. I stopped taking it a while ago, as the doctor said it was under control. Other than that… nothing major, I don't think. Just the usual aches and pains from work, really. My husband handles most of the doctor’s appointments and remembers those details, I’m afraid. He'll likely know more than me. I have Medicare, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of managed hypertension, now off medication. I appreciate you mentioning that. And that’s perfectly alright that your husband often handles appointments; we can always check your records. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see... No surgeries, not that I recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, but that was ages ago. And… I was in the hospital once, many years ago, with a bad bout of the flu. It was quite nasty, but it was a long time ago. Nothing serious, just needed some rest and fluids. I believe that was when I turned…oh, I can't quite remember the year. Honestly, my memory is just…foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, and a hospitalization for the flu a long time ago. Good to know. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh dear. My mother passed away a few years back, from…well, I believe it was something to do with her heart. And my father… he's still alive, but he's quite old and frail. He lives in Jamaica, and I don't see him often. I don't recall any specific illnesses that run in the family, truthfully. I'm afraid I don't know much about their medical history. My husband would have more information on that, too, I suspect. He’s very good with those details.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother passed away due to a heart condition, father is alive but frail. You're not aware of any other significant family medical history. Let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Not at all. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. Just a small glass of wine on special occasions, perhaps. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a working woman, and I need to keep my wits about me. My husband doesn’t drink either, so we don't have any of that in the house. I eat fairly healthy, too, although it can be difficult with the work schedule. Lots of quick meals, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very rare alcohol use, no recreational drugs, and a fairly healthy diet despite a busy work schedule. Good. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I don’t believe so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken some over-the-counter pain relievers for work aches and pains, but nothing has ever bothered me. No known food allergies either. I’m pretty good with most things, thankfully. I’ll have to ask my husband just to be sure, though, just in case I’ve forgotten something. He has a better memory than me, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Right. Thank you for all that information, Adyn. It's helpful. Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Okay, I see a history of hypertension managed with lisinopril, which was discontinued a few years ago, and everything seems to be consistent with what you've told me. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. That’s quite alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement entirely. I do hope it won’t be too long, though. I have a bit of a schedule to keep, you see. But I'm happy to cooperate. What exactly does the exam involve?
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand wanting to be mindful of your time. The exam will be fairly quick. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment – which involves testing your strength, coordination, and balance. I'll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and check your blood pressure. Mostly just to get a baseline and see if there are any obvious signs of what might be going on. It shouldn’t take more than 10-15 minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Ten to fifteen minutes is no trouble at all. Please proceed. I'm quite trusting, you know. Just let me know if anything feels…unusual. I do appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90…a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you're a bit anxious and we just discussed your history of hypertension. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Just look at my finger and don't move your head. Good. Now I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that sufficient? I do hope I'm doing this correctly. I’m not very good with medical things, you see. Just let me know if I need to adjust my strength.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, good grip strength. Now, can you try to push your palms together as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that sufficient force? It's a bit difficult, truthfully. I'm not particularly strong, you see. Mostly just good at keeping busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now I’m going to check your balance. Could you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Standing up now. Is this alright? I do hope I don't wobble too much. My balance isn't always the best, particularly when I'm tired. Just let me know if I need to hold onto something.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, could you try standing with your feet together, and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Standing with my feet together, and eyes closed now. It's a bit unsteady, I must admit. I do feel a little…wobbly. Just let me know if I'm about to fall, please. I do hope this isn't too dangerous.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a slight sway, nothing concerning. Now, please open your eyes. Now, let’s just quickly check your ears and throat. Ears look normal, throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Okay, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems normal, but the slight sway when balancing and the elevated blood pressure warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn’t too unpleasant, Doctor. Thank you for being so gentle. I do appreciate you checking everything so thoroughly. So, what do you think is going on? Is it something serious? I do hope it’s nothing too concerning. I have a bit of a busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, Adyn, everything appears normal on the exam, but the slight instability when balancing and the elevated blood pressure are enough to warrant some further investigation. Your symptoms – the slurred speech coming and going, fatigue, and the blood pressure – could be related to a few different things. It’s possible it could be related to stress, dehydration, or even a side effect of medication, although you haven’t mentioned taking anything currently. However, given the speech changes, we need to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infections or deficiencies, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural issues. It’s a precautionary measure, but important to get a clear picture. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan? That sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? I do hope it won't take too long. And is it expensive? I have Medicare, of course, but I do worry about the costs. I’m not very good with medical things, as you know, and all this talk of scans and panels is quite overwhelming. What exactly will the tests involve? And how long will it take to get the results? I do have a bit of a busy schedule, as you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Adyn. It does sound serious, but it’s important to remember that we're being thorough, and most likely, it will be something minor. The CT scan is the most concerning sounding of the tests, but it’s the best way to rule out anything serious happening in your brain. It's non-invasive – you'll just lie on a table while a machine takes images. It should only take about 20-30 minutes. The blood tests are very simple. We'll just take a small sample of blood from your arm. That will take a few minutes. As for costs, with Medicare, most of it should be covered. There might be a small co-pay or deductible, but our billing department can help you understand those costs. I can also write a referral explaining the medical necessity of these tests, which can sometimes help with coverage. The results usually take 24-48 hours. Once we have them, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated and getting plenty of rest. And if you notice any new or worsening symptoms – like severe headache, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty swallowing – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that… that sounds like a plan. Staying hydrated and getting rest, I can manage that. And I will be sure to go to the emergency room if anything worsens. A CT scan does sound frightening, but I trust your judgement. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I do appreciate your patience. I am not very good with medical things, as you know, and all this talk of panels and scans is quite overwhelming. Could you please write the referral for the tests? And perhaps give me a list of instructions for the CT scan, just so I know what to expect? And I suppose I should schedule another appointment now, just to be prepared?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m happy to help in any way I can. I’m writing the referral for the CT scan and blood tests now. Here are the instructions for the CT scan. It explains what to expect, including whether you can eat or drink before the test, and what to wear. It also has the phone number for the radiology department, so you can schedule the appointment. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, just to discuss the results. Does next Tuesday at 2 PM work for you?
PATIENT: Next Tuesday at 2 PM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you for being so accommodating. I do appreciate your patience and kindness. You've put my mind at ease, even though I'm still a little worried about the scan. Is there anything else I need to do before the appointment? Or anything I should avoid? Perhaps I should limit my caffeine intake? I do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning, but I'm happy to adjust my schedule if necessary.
DOCTOR: No, there’s no need to limit your caffeine intake or adjust your schedule. Just try to relax and get plenty of rest before the scan. And if you have any questions or concerns before the appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a contact number for the radiology department, and for our office as well. I think that covers everything for now. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease. Please take care, and I’ll see you next Tuesday. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. Thank you for being so patient and understanding. You've been very kind, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I do feel a little less anxious now, knowing what to expect. I'll be sure to schedule the scan and call the office if I have any questions. Thank you again for your help. Have a good day, Doctor. And thank you once again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. I’m glad I could help. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Have a good day as well.
