DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Auelua. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen, actually. And I have been told I have a funny heartbeat, something called… atrial fib-rill-ation? Is that right? It’s been happening for a bit now, and the leg just keeps getting bigger.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Swelling in one leg and some mention of a funny heartbeat – atrial fibrillation, yes, that's right. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. Just to clarify, when you say “a bit now,” roughly how long has the leg been swelling, and how long have you been aware of this… irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: Right. Well, the leg started swelling, I’d say… maybe two weeks ago? It was just a little at first, but it’s gotten worse each day, I think. And the heartbeat… that’s harder to say. I found out about that maybe a month ago, when I was at the hospital for something else entirely. They mentioned it then, and said I should see a doctor about it, which… well, here I am. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. So, about a month ago you were in hospital for something else and they picked up the atrial fibrillation, and for the past two weeks you’ve noticed increasing swelling in your left leg. Okay. And is there anything that makes the swelling worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. I teach all day, so I’m on my feet a lot, but it doesn't seem to be worse after teaching. And I try to put my feet up when I get home, but that doesn't seem to help much either. It’s just… consistently getting bigger. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Nixon. Consistent swelling is something we need to investigate. Alright. Before we do a physical exam, let's just run through a few things. Do you have any pain in your leg with the swelling?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More… a heavy feeling. Like it’s full of water, if that makes sense? It’s not sharp or anything, just… uncomfortable. And a bit achy sometimes, but not a bad ache. It's hard to explain, really. It's not like a broken bone ache, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, achy feeling – I understand. No sharp pain, which is good. And you said you teach all day, on your feet a lot. Any history of blood clots in your legs or family history of blood clots, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, not that I'm aware of. And I don't think so for my family either… My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather had something with his heart, but not clots, as far as I know. It was a long time ago, and my mother didn’t talk about it much. She passed when I was quite young. I'm not sure if that's helpful information, though?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Knowing about family history, even if it's incomplete, is always good. High blood pressure can be relevant too. Alright, Nixon, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a look at your leg and listen to your heart. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are. It is a bit embarrassing, having to show my leg, but I understand it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Nixon, it’s all part of the process. I'll do my best to be quick and gentle. Okay, I’m just going to measure the circumference of both legs now, just to get a precise idea of the difference in size. Alright, the left leg is approximately 5 centimeters larger in circumference than the right. There’s no significant redness or warmth that I can see. Now, I’m going to feel for any tenderness or pulses. Pulses are present, but slightly diminished on the left leg. No significant tenderness. Okay, listening to your heart… I can definitely hear an irregular rhythm, consistent with atrial fibrillation. I’m also going to listen to your lungs quickly. Lungs are clear. Okay, Nixon. I’ve completed the exam. It appears you have significant swelling in your left leg, and I confirm an irregular heartbeat. Given your age and the fact that the swelling is relatively recent, we need to investigate the cause of the swelling further. It could be a number of things, including a blood clot, which we need to rule out. We'll also need to monitor your atrial fibrillation.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A blood clot… that sounds worrying. What does that involve? And what about the heartbeat? Is it… dangerous? I understand you need to investigate, but what happens next? I’m a bit frightened now, to be honest. What kind of tests will I need?
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Nixon, it's perfectly reasonable to be frightened when you hear about the possibility of a blood clot. It's good we're investigating now. Let's take things one step at a time. The first thing we need to do is rule out a blood clot in your leg. We'll do this with an ultrasound. It’s a painless test where we use sound waves to create an image of the veins in your leg. If we find a clot, we'll discuss treatment options right away. As for your atrial fibrillation, it can be dangerous if left untreated. It increases your risk of stroke, but thankfully, there are medications that can help manage it and reduce that risk. We'll need to get an EKG – that’s a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart – to get a better understanding of the irregular rhythm. Depending on the results, we might also recommend a blood test to check your thyroid levels. So, to summarize: ultrasound of your leg, EKG, and potentially a blood test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… ultrasound, EKG, blood test. Yes, that sounds… okay. As long as it helps find out what's wrong. Will the ultrasound be done here, at the clinic? And the EKG… is that painful? I’m not very good with needles, if I’m being honest. And will I need a referral for these tests? I don’t want to be running around all over the countryside trying to find somewhere that can do them.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable. Let’s get everything sorted for you. The ultrasound can be done here at the clinic, thankfully. I've already put in a request for it, and we should be able to get you scheduled for it this afternoon. As for the EKG, it’s not painful at all. Small stickers – electrodes – are placed on your chest, arms, and legs, and they record the electrical activity of your heart. There are no needles involved, thankfully. I’m arranging a referral to the radiology department for the ultrasound, and I’ll also provide you with a lab requisition for the blood test. Both facilities are in town, a short bus ride from here. I'll print out all the paperwork for you now, with the addresses and phone numbers. I'll also include a note to the radiology technician explaining your anxiety, just so they can be extra gentle and explain everything clearly. Here you are. The radiology department is at 12 Oak Street, and the lab is at 4 Willow Avenue. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That… that sounds much better, thank you. Having it all written down helps. And knowing they’ll be extra gentle at the radiology department is a relief. 12 Oak Street and 4 Willow Avenue… I can manage that, yes. It's just… a lot to take in, all at once. What should I expect after the tests? Will I hear back right away? And what if they do find a blood clot? What happens then? I apologise for all the questions, I’m just very worried.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no apology needed, Nixon. It’s perfectly natural to be worried, and it’s my job to answer all your questions. After the tests, the radiology technician will send the results directly to me. I’ll review them as soon as I receive them, and I’ll call you, ideally within 24 hours, to discuss the findings. If they do find a blood clot, the treatment usually involves medication to thin the blood and prevent it from getting bigger. In some cases, you might need to be admitted to the hospital for closer monitoring. However, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, it’s important to focus on getting the tests done so we can have a clear understanding of what’s going on. Do you have any questions about the blood-thinning medication, just so you have some preliminary information?
PATIENT: Preliminary information would be good, yes. I know nothing about it. Does it have… side effects? And will I need to stop taking anything I’m currently taking? I only take a multivitamin, if that’s relevant. I’m rather sensitive to medication, so I worry about reactions. And… will I need to be careful about bumping into things, or cutting myself? I teach children, so I'm around a lot of… potential accidents.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Nixon, and it’s good you’re thinking ahead. Blood-thinning medication, often called anticoagulants, does have potential side effects, but they are generally manageable. The most common side effect is an increased risk of bleeding – that’s why it’s important to be careful about cuts and bumps, as you mentioned. You might also notice easier bruising. Because you’re a teacher and around children, we would definitely discuss safety precautions in detail if you do need to start taking this medication. We’ll talk about avoiding contact sports, being careful with sharp objects, and informing the school about your medication. Your multivitamin is unlikely to interact with blood thinners, but we'll confirm that with a pharmacist just to be sure. If you do need to start taking anticoagulants, it's essential to let me know of any new medications you're considering, even over-the-counter ones. Does that address your concerns, for now?
PATIENT: That… that is helpful, yes. Knowing there are safety precautions I can take is a relief. And that you'll double-check everything with a pharmacist is reassuring. I think… I think I'm ready for the tests now, if that’s alright. I just hope they don’t find anything too serious. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. I'm glad I could ease some of your worries. And I completely understand your hope for good news. Alright, let's get you scheduled for the ultrasound. I'll have my assistant, Sarah, come in and arrange that for you right away. She'll also give you the lab requisition and answer any further questions you might have. Remember, I'm here for you, and we'll take things one step at a time. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your tests. And please, try to relax. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
DOCTOR: You take care, Nixon. I'll be in touch soon. .
