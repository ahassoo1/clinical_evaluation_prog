DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for having me. Well, it's this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now and it’s… well, it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not painful exactly, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Started, I think, around the 18th of July. It started on my arms, I remember distinctly because I was pruning the roses – always get a few scratches then, but this didn’t go away like it usually does. Then it spread to my back, and legs… now it’s pretty much all over. I haven’t changed anything, no new soaps or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Nothing really makes it better, to be honest. Cool showers help for a little while, maybe ten, fifteen minutes. But it always comes back. And… I don’t know if anything makes it worse specifically, it just… is. Except maybe when I get stressed. I noticed it feels extra bad when I’m feeling anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there any bumps, blisters, or redness associated with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the strange thing. It’s just… red patches, sometimes. Very faint. And if I look really closely, the skin looks a little… bumpy, maybe? But it’s hard to tell, and it doesn’t feel like actual bumps, you know? More like… the skin texture is a little off. No blisters or anything like that. It’s just… itchy, red, and a bit uneven looking if you examine it closely.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any fever, fatigue, or other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. And I’m… well, I’m tired sometimes, but I’m 53! I figure that comes with the territory. No, seriously, nothing else. No changes in appetite, no weird aches or anything like that. Just the itching. It’s been… unsettling, because it came on so gradually and without anything else happening. It’s not like I’m sick with a cold or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any changes in your diet or any new medications recently?
PATIENT: No changes to my diet, Doctor. I eat pretty much the same things I always have - lots of soups, some fish, salads… nothing fancy. And no new medications either. I’m on a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but I’ve been on that for years now and it hasn’t changed. Oh… wait. I did start taking a Vitamin D supplement a few months ago, but that was before the itching started. I read an article about how a lot of people are low on Vitamin D, so I figured it couldn't hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything, not as far as I can remember. My wife… bless her soul… she always kept track of that sort of thing. I’ve never had any problems with penicillin or anything like that. She used to say I was remarkably allergy-free, which I always found amusing. But no, nothing at all. I'm pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. And could you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let's see… I had pneumonia when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. And I had my appendix out when I was in my twenties. Otherwise… not much, really. I had high blood pressure for a while, which is why I take that medication, but it’s been well-controlled for years now. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing major. I used to be quite active, but… well, after my wife passed away, I haven't been keeping up with it as much. But generally, I've been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries, other than the appendectomy you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the appendix. I had a bit of a bad knee for a while when I was younger, played a lot of soccer, but never needed surgery for it. Physical therapy helped a lot. That’s it, really. No other surgeries, no major illnesses. My wife always said I was a tough old bird. It's just… this itching is so unusual for me. That’s what worries me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, if you don’t mind me asking, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis, pretty severe towards the end. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. Other than that… not much that I can think of. No history of skin problems, allergies, or anything like that on either side of the family. They were both pretty healthy people, all things considered. My mother’s sister had some issues with her thyroid, but that was a long time ago, and I don’t know the specifics. But generally, no major family history of anything relevant, as far as I’m aware.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she hated it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe a couple of times a week, but nothing excessive. And no, absolutely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in that sort of thing. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening, to be honest. I’m a bit of a homebody these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. Well, it sounds like this itching is quite bothersome and a bit of a mystery. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to do whatever I need to do. I just want to get this figured out, if we can. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with your back. Please face away from me and I'll take a look. I see some mild redness and dryness, but no obvious blisters or hives. The skin texture does feel slightly uneven in some areas. Now, let's look at your arms… The redness seems to be more pronounced here. It's not raised, but I can definitely feel the difference in texture. And now, your legs… It looks similar to the back and arms – mild redness, dryness, and slightly uneven skin texture. Overall, it doesn’t seem like a typical allergic reaction. Now, let me check your lymph nodes. They feel normal, no swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… about right, I think. The redness is definitely worse on my arms, I’ve noticed that. And it’s been… hard to describe, but there’s a… roughness to the skin, even when it doesn't look very red. It’s just… different. It’s good that you don’t think it’s an allergy, though. I was worried about that. It just came on so gradually.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brendan. Based on the physical exam and what you’ve told me, it doesn’t seem like a typical allergic reaction or infection. There are a few possibilities we should consider. One is eczema, which can cause dryness, redness, and itching. Another is a skin reaction to something you've been exposed to, even if it's not a traditional allergen. And sometimes, itching can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, although you haven’t mentioned any other symptoms that would suggest that’s the case. To rule out some of these possibilities, I’d like to order a few blood tests. I want to check your complete blood count, your thyroid function, and your liver function. I also think it would be helpful to do a skin scraping to look for any microscopic organisms or fungi. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, absolutely. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and a skin scraping sound perfectly reasonable. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and if that’s what it takes, then I’m happy to do it. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and try to figure out what’s going on. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll get the lab order sent over to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for the blood tests and skin scraping. It should only take a few minutes. We’ll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day to help soothe the itching. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to avoid scratching as much as possible. I also recommend avoiding any known irritants. And while we wait for the results, if the itching gets significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or skin infections, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, sir, that all sounds very reasonable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for the prescription – that’s very kind of you. I think I understand everything, but… one quick question. You mentioned skin infections. What would I be looking for? Just want to be prepared, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question. Look out for any signs of infection, like increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus-filled blisters. If you notice any fever or chills along with these symptoms, that’s a sign to seek medical attention right away. It's rare, but it’s always best to be prepared. We want to catch anything like that early. Otherwise, if the itching just continues without any of those additional symptoms, we’ll revisit the results when they come in. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that makes perfect sense. Redness, swelling, pain, pus… fever. I’ll keep a close eye on it. Thank you again for everything. I appreciate your time and patience. I hope we can figure this out soon. I’ll go get the blood work done now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brendan. We’ll do our best. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And hopefully, we’ll have some answers for you soon. Have a good day, and please let the front desk know if you need anything at all. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate your help. .
