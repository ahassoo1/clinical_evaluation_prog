DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, to be honest. Waste of time, most of it. But this heat… it’s getting ridiculous. I just can't handle it like I used to. Feel like I’m melting just walking to the bus stop. Never used to be this bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s good you came in when you felt a change. Heat sensitivity can be concerning, and it’s smart to get it checked out. When you say "not handling it like you used to," can you describe what that feels like specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not just sweating more, though I am doing that. It's... a weakness, you know? Like all my energy just gets sucked out. And I get dizzy. Really dizzy. Not like I’m going to faint, but enough to make me have to sit down. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building stuff, no problem. Now, ten minutes and I'm beat. And my head feels… fuzzy. It’s very unpleasant. Honestly, it’s making me feel old, and that's saying something.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, dizziness, and a fuzzy head – all with increased heat exposure. And you’re noticing this is a recent change from being able to tolerate heat well in the past. Do you notice any other symptoms along with these – like nausea, muscle cramps, or a headache?
PATIENT: No nausea, thankfully. And my muscles haven't been cramping. Though, I get a bit of a headache sometimes, yeah. Not a bad headache, more like a dull ache in the back of my head. It comes and goes. It’s really just this feeling of being completely drained. Like someone unplugged me. And it happens so fast now. Used to be able to pace myself. Now, boom. Gone. It’s frustrating, to be honest. I like being productive.
DOCTOR: Alright, so dizziness, weakness, a fuzzy head, and a mild headache that comes and goes, triggered by heat exposure and happening more quickly than before. Now, let’s go through some other things to get a better picture. Do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Doctor told me to lose weight, which, frankly, is easier said than done. But other than that, nothing serious. I’ve never been one for pills, if you know what I mean. I prefer to just get on with it. Medicare keeps sending me pamphlets about all sorts of things, but I usually just toss them.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, just some knee trouble. And you prefer to avoid medications when possible, I understand. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. I’ve broken a bone or two when I was a kid – climbing trees, being foolish – but they healed up just fine. Nothing major. I've always been careful with my work, you know? Safety first. Though, these younger workers these days… they don't seem to care much for safety. But that's another story. So, no, no surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital for anything serious, either. Just the usual check-ups when I was younger, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No surgeries or significant hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family a bit. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings – who have had similar issues with heat sensitivity, or any heart problems, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Well, my father… he wasn’t much for talking about his health. Nepali people aren't, generally. Kept to himself. He lived to be a good age, though. Worked hard his whole life, farming. My mother, she had… well, she had a lot of aches and pains when she got older, but nothing specific that I can recall. Just old age, again. No one really talked about things like heart problems or kidney issues. We didn’t have doctors back home like we do here. It was more just… you rest and try to feel better. No one went around talking about thyroids, either. Honestly, I don't think anyone knew what a thyroid was. It wasn't a topic of conversation. I'm an only child, so no siblings to ask. Not much help, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Limited family medical history. Now, what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle, eh? What do you want to know? I live alone, in a small apartment. Work as a painter and handyman – mostly construction and maintenance, small jobs. I eat… well, I eat what’s easy. Not much cooking, to be honest. Lots of rice, some vegetables. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner occasionally. And I definitely don't smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I walk a lot, getting to and from jobs, but other than that… not much exercise. Just the regular stuff. I don't spend much time in air conditioning, if I can help it. Prefer the windows open, even when it’s hot. Though lately, that’s been… problematic. It’s a bit of a simple life, if you ask me. But it’s always kept me busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Simple lifestyle, mostly active work, limited air conditioning exposure. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. I used to take something for my knees a few years back, but it didn't really help, so I stopped. I just try to manage on my own. I've got some liniment for aches and pains, that's about it. Rub it on when I need to. But no regular medication, nothing prescribed, nothing over the counter. I'd rather just tough it out, honestly. Doctors always want to give you something for everything, and I don’t trust it. Too many side effects, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. And finally, do you have any allergies to anything – foods, medications, pollen, anything like that?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I eat most things. Never had a reaction to anything. Pollen bothers me a bit in the spring, makes me sneeze, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? Nothing serious. I've never been to a hospital for an allergic reaction, never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I suppose. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to eat things that’ll make me sick, but I don't spend much time worrying about it. Honestly, I think people worry too much these days. A bit of a sniffle never hurt anyone. So, no allergies. Just a bit of spring pollen, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Coby. That gives me a good overview. So, no medications, no allergies, and you've described a significant change in your heat tolerance. Let's do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I've got work to do later. And I’m not fond of being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind my saying so. But if you think it’s necessary… go ahead. Just be quick about it, eh? I don't want to spend the whole day here.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I'll be as quick and efficient as possible. Okay, blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76, regular. Temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. And your skin looks normal, no rashes or unusual dryness. You’re not particularly sweaty right now, but it’s also not particularly hot in here. Overall, your physical exam is relatively normal. However, your blood pressure is a little high, and your description of the heat intolerance is concerning. I’d like to order some blood tests just to rule out any underlying causes. Specifically, I want to check your electrolytes, kidney function, thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. Also, we'll want to check a basic metabolic panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, now you’re talking. Honestly, I was hoping to avoid all this. I knew coming here would be a waste of time. What's the point of all these tests? What are you even looking for? I feel fine, apart from the heat, and you're going to stick needles in me? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not convinced this is necessary. Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong based on what I’ve told you? Perhaps I just need to rest more? I don't see the need for all this… poking and prodding. And expensive tests, I imagine. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration. You’re right, you’re feeling perfectly capable aside from the heat intolerance. However, that's precisely why we need to investigate further. There are several potential reasons for this sudden change in your heat tolerance, and many of them require blood tests to rule out. It could be something as simple as dehydration or a mild electrolyte imbalance, but it could also be something more serious, such as a thyroid problem, kidney issue, or even the early stages of a heart condition. We need to gather more information before we can make a diagnosis. The tests aren't just about looking for problems, they're about ruling things out to give us peace of mind and ensure you’re getting the right care. We'll cover all the costs through your Medicare, so there won’t be any out-of-pocket expense for you. Would you be willing to consider the blood tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And I want the results quickly. I haven’t got all day to wait around for tests to come back. And explain everything to me in plain English, understand? No medical jargon. I don't want to hear about “panels” and “counts.” Just tell me what it means, simply. And make sure it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got things to do. Honestly. Alright, let’s get it over with. But I’m still not convinced this is necessary.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Coby. I completely understand. We'll get the blood tests done as quickly as possible, and I promise to explain the results in plain English, no medical jargon. We'll get you in and out of here efficiently. The lab is just down the hall. They'll take a small sample of blood, and it usually takes about 10-15 minutes. After the lab, please come back to the waiting room, and I will review the results with you as soon as they are available. While we are waiting, I will write up a referral to a cardiologist as a precaution, in case anything shows up on the blood tests that requires further investigation. Sound good?
PATIENT: Fine. A cardiologist? Now you’re really overdoing it. But whatever. Just get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to work. Lead the way, or just tell me where to go. And make sure they're gentle with the needle. I don't like needles. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. The lab is right through that door. The phlebotomist – the person who draws the blood – is very experienced and gentle. Just let them know you’re a little nervous, and they’ll take extra care. I’ll be here in my office reviewing your case, and I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back. It should only take about an hour or so. Please, go ahead. And try not to worry, we’re just being thorough. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: .
