DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A lump in the lower abdomen warrants investigation. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Of course. It’s… hard to describe. It’s not painful, really. Just… there. I first noticed it maybe a month or so ago. It doesn’t seem to be getting bigger quickly, but I haven’t been actively measuring it, if that makes sense. It feels…firm, I suppose. Not squishy.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. "Firm, not squishy," is good information. And you haven't noticed any changes in size, or any associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or fever?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No nausea, no vomiting. Bowel habits are… normal, I’d say. And no fever. Honestly, that's why I waited a bit before coming in. It’s just been… a lump. A bit worrying, but not causing any other problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, even without other symptoms. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I don’t have any major medical issues, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I do have Medicare, as I’m retired now. I had a bout of high blood pressure a few years back, but that’s been managed with medication, and it's stable now. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I’m married, by the way. My wife is… well, she worries a bit. That’s partly why I’m here.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it’s always wise to address concerns, especially when loved ones are involved. So, high blood pressure, currently managed. Any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospitalizations. Nothing like that. I've been lucky, I suppose. Mostly just regular check-ups and the occasional cold. My wife keeps me well-fed and reasonably active. She’s a wonderful woman.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. It sounds like you have a good support system. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any instances of cancer, or any other significant medical conditions, in your immediate family – parents, siblings, grandparents?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My father had some heart trouble, eventually needed a bypass. My mother… she had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And… my grandmother on my mother’s side, she had something… I don't recall exactly what, but it was something with her stomach, I think. It was a long time ago, and my Arabic isn't strong enough to recall all the details my aunt would share. I’m sorry I can’t be more specific. It wasn’t something discussed often.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Raghunathan. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your mother, and a possible stomach issue in your grandmother… that’s helpful information. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat pretty much anything. And I haven't had any reactions to medications in the past. I take a small dose of medication for the blood pressure, but that’s it. No problems there either. I do sometimes get a bit of… discomfort after eating dairy, but it’s not a true allergy, just a little… upset stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Just a sensitivity, not a full allergy. And you’re currently taking medication for your blood pressure – can you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s Lisinopril, 10 milligrams, once a day. I take it every morning with breakfast. It’s been very effective, thankfully. My doctor – Dr. El-Masri – has been monitoring it regularly. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 10mg daily. And Dr. El-Masri is keeping an eye on things, which is reassuring. Now, before we move on to the physical examination, are you a smoker or do you use any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, I’ve never smoked. Never been tempted, actually. And no other tobacco products either. My wife wouldn’t allow it! She’s very health-conscious. And I suppose I’ve inherited some of that from her.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A healthy lifestyle is always beneficial. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, let’s proceed with a physical examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen to get a better feel for the lump you’ve described. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement. I just want to know what we’re dealing with. And hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, if you could lie back on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, starting away from the lump, and then work my way towards it. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. The lump is located in the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. It’s approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, firm, and slightly mobile. There is no tenderness to palpation. It doesn't appear to be associated with any superficial masses or changes in the skin. It's difficult to determine the deeper extent of the mass with palpation alone.
PATIENT: Okay. Two centimeters… that doesn’t sound too big, does it? But you can’t tell much just by feeling it, I understand. What does this mean, Doctor? Do we need to do any further tests? I’m a bit worried, if I’m honest. It’s silly, I know, but… it’s just a lump, and you never know.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to be worried, Mr. Raghunathan. Any new mass deserves investigation. Two centimeters is relatively small, but size isn’t always the most important factor. The fact that it's firm and mobile is somewhat reassuring, but it doesn’t give us a definitive answer. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some imaging – specifically, a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will allow us to visualize the mass in more detail, assess its location and relationship to other structures, and help us determine the most appropriate course of action. We can also draw some blood work to get a baseline and rule out any obvious infectious processes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A CT scan and blood work. Please, go ahead. I'd rather know what we're dealing with than just worry about it. What will the CT scan involve? Will I need to… drink anything beforehand? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The CT scan is a relatively quick and painless procedure. You will lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You may be asked to drink a contrast solution beforehand – this helps to highlight the structures in your abdomen and pelvis, making them easier to visualize. The scan itself usually takes about 15-20 minutes. It does involve a small amount of radiation exposure, but it's within acceptable limits and the benefits of diagnosis outweigh the risks in this case. The results usually take about 24-48 hours to be reported by the radiologist. Once I have the results, I will review them with you in detail and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to write the orders for the CT scan and blood work. I’ll also have the nurse draw the blood before you leave today. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies to contrast dye. I’ve had a few scans in the past, nothing serious, but I recall them mentioning contrast. So, no problems there. 24-48 hours… that seems like a long time, but I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. I’m glad I could alleviate some of your concerns. It’s important to remember that many abdominal masses are benign, and we’re simply taking these steps to rule out anything serious. I will have the nurse draw your blood now, and then she can also provide you with instructions regarding the CT scan appointment. We'll schedule that for as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as pain, fever, nausea, or changes in bowel habits – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with my… worrying. I’ll wait to hear from the nurse about the blood work and the CT scan. Thank you again for everything. I suppose there's nothing more to do for now but wait. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, we’re here to support you through this process. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please let the nurse know if you have any questions before you leave. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
