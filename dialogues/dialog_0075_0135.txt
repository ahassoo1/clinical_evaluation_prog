DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Panjoj. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Panjoj. Thank you for seeing me. I have… a problem with my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, I think you say? It started maybe three days ago. Not much at first, but now… more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear that started about three days ago and has been increasing. I understand. To help me figure out what’s going on, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… not blood. More… yellowish. And a little… thick. Not water, you understand? Like… honey, but not sweet. I try to keep it clean with a cloth, but it keeps coming back. It does not hurt, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like pressure, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish, thick discharge – not bloody, like honey but not sweet – and you've noticed it for three days. You’re also experiencing some pressure, but no real pain. That's helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the discharge?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes. My hearing… it is a little quiet in that ear. Not completely gone, but… muffled. Like when you are underwater, a little bit. And… maybe a little dizzy, but not falling down dizzy. Just… off balance sometimes. I do not have fever, I check.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing in the same ear as the discharge, and some dizziness, but no fever. That's good to know. Now, have you had any ear problems before, like infections or pain?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was a young man, in Somalia, I had many earaches. The doctor… not a good doctor, I think. He put something… a cotton in my ear, and it hurt more. This is different, though. This is… leaking. Not pain like before. I have not had problems for many, many years, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of earaches in your youth, treated with cotton which didn't help, but you haven't had issues for many years until now. Have you had any surgeries, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. Never. Just… the cotton in my ear when I was young. Nothing else. I am a simple man. I work… I teach at the college. History. That is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you teach history at the college. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. I do not like to take pills if I can help it. And allergies… no. I eat everything. I am Somali, we eat many things. Maybe a little sensitive to the cold sometimes, but not an allergy. Just… I feel it more.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications and no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to take a look at your ear, if that’s alright with you. We'll use an otoscope – it's a little light I use to look inside. It won't hurt, but please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. A light, you say? No problem. I trust you. Please, be gentle. I am an old man, things break easily now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Radillo. I will be very gentle. Okay. I see some inflammation in your ear canal, and there is fluid present, as you described. The eardrum itself appears slightly bulging and… there’s a small perforation – a small hole. It’s not large, but it's there. It looks like you have an acute otitis media with perforation – a middle ear infection with a ruptured eardrum. That explains the discharge and the muffled hearing. The perforation is likely why the pressure hasn’t been as severe.
PATIENT: A… a hole? In my ear? That sounds… bad. Is it serious, Doctor? Will I lose my hearing? I need my hearing for my teaching. And… will it heal? I do not want a hole in my ear forever. Please explain, slowly. I am not a doctor, you understand.
DOCTOR: It sounds concerning, I understand, but it's not necessarily serious, Mr. Radillo. Many people experience a perforated eardrum at some point in their lives, often with an ear infection. And, thankfully, most perforations do heal on their own over weeks to months. The hole allows the fluid to drain, which is why you haven't been in significant pain. Losing your hearing completely is unlikely, but there is a small risk of some lasting hearing loss, which is why we need to monitor it. We’ll treat the infection with a course of antibiotics to prevent it from worsening. We'll also want to keep the ear dry to promote healing. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… is better than I thought. Antibiotics… I can take pills if I must. And keep it dry… that I can do. No swimming, I guess. No showers… careful, you mean? So, the hole… it might close by itself? You think? And you will check my hearing to make sure it does not get worse? Thank you, Doctor. You explain very well.
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Antibiotics when needed, and keeping the ear dry. And yes, the hole may close on its own. It's common for small perforations like yours to heal naturally over several weeks to months. We will definitely check your hearing to monitor it. I’ll write you a prescription for a 7-day course of Amoxicillin, and I’d like to see you back in two weeks for a follow-up appointment to assess your hearing and check the ear again. In the meantime, avoid getting water in your ear. Use earplugs when showering or bathing, and definitely avoid swimming. If you experience any increased pain, fever, or significant changes in your hearing, please contact the clinic immediately. Here is the prescription and a summary of the instructions. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, I can come back in two weeks. Amoxicillin… I will remember that. No water… earplugs… I understand. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. No… I think that is all. You explained everything very well. Just… I hope the hole closes. I need my ears for my students. Thank you again, Doctor Panjoj. I will see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I understand how important your hearing is for your teaching. We’ll do our best to ensure a good recovery. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please take care. .
