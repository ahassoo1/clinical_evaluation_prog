DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's this… tingling. In my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? I’m Teretha, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right. Annoying is… a good way to put it, I suppose. A little while now – can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… probably… three, maybe four months? It comes and goes, but it’s been more often lately. Not constant, thankfully. It feels like… pins and needles, like when your foot falls asleep, but… not as bad. And it's in both hands and both feet. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a relative term, Ms. Uzarski. Bilateral symptoms are more concerning than unilateral, so it’s good you mentioned that. Four months… and has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I’ve noticed, really. I walk a lot for my job – mail carrier, you know? – but it doesn’t seem to be worse after a long day. And I haven't changed anything about my diet, not really. Oh! Except… maybe when it gets really cold? It feels a little worse then. Does that count? I just figured it was the cold.
DOCTOR: Walking for your job is… pertinent. And cold sensitivity can be a factor. Alright. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this tingling?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the tingling. No pain, no weakness… nothing else that I’ve noticed. I’m a pretty active woman, so I usually notice things if something’s not right. It's just... bothersome, honestly. I hope it's not something serious, Doctor. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said no pain, but is there any numbness associated with the tingling?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes. Not all the time. It’s… hard to explain. It’s more like… a dull feeling. Like my hands aren’t quite as sensitive as they used to be. Especially my fingertips. It doesn't happen every time I feel the tingling, but it's there sometimes. It's not a sharp numbness, you understand? Just… less feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, less feeling, intermittent numbness… And have you noticed any changes to your nails, skin, or muscle size in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, goodness. I don't really… look at my hands and feet that closely. No, I don't think so. Maybe my skin is a little drier this winter, but that’s about it. I use lotion, so… I honestly haven’t paid much attention. Is that bad? Should I be looking at them more carefully?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. Uzarski, but it’s good information to have. Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I watch what I eat, try to stay active… never had any of those problems. My husband… well, he had high blood pressure, but I didn't. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. No surgeries or anything like that. Is that… a long list of things you need to know? I feel a little silly listing things I don't have.
DOCTOR: No, it’s helpful to know. It narrows things down. Your family – any history of neuropathy, nerve problems, or similar symptoms in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had some arthritis in her hands when she got older, but I don't think it was nerve problems. My father… he died young, heart attack. And I only had one sister, and she passed away a few years ago… I don’t recall her ever mentioning anything like this, honestly. We weren't very close, if I’m being truthful. So… probably not, but I couldn’t say for sure. I never really talked to her about health things.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes ibuprofen for a headache. And a multivitamin now and then, when I remember. Nothing consistent, though. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. My husband was always on medication, and I just… I don't like relying on them. Is that a problem? I'm probably not a very good patient, am I?
DOCTOR: It's not about being a “good” or “bad” patient, Ms. Uzarski. It's about providing accurate information. No regular medications. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little sniffly in the spring, but that's just hay fever, I think. Nothing serious. I haven't been stung by a bee in years, and I haven’t had any skin rashes or anything like that. Honestly, I'm pretty lucky. Usually. Except for this tingling, of course. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. It’ll just take a few minutes. Could you please sit on the examination table and extend your arms?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. Just let me know if anything feels… off. I'm a little worried about falling, my balance isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, let's check muscle strength. Squeeze your hand as tightly as you can… good. Now resist me as I try to pull your fingers open… good strength. Repeat on the other side… alright. Now, feet… push against my hand like you’re pressing on a gas pedal… good. Repeat on the other side… Okay. Now, sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your hands and feet with this cotton ball, and tell me when you feel it. Starting with your fingertips… Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. It's… a little faint, though. Like not as strong as it should be, maybe? Especially on this hand… It feels… muted. Like there's something in between. Not painful, just… not as clear. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Diminished sensation in the left hand, noted. Now, right hand… And how about this side?
PATIENT: Hmm… that feels… better. Still a little faint, but not as bad as the other hand. Like it's a little… sharper, maybe? Hard to explain. It's not completely normal, but definitely better than my left hand. This is all very worrying, Doctor. Is it something serious? I've got a lot of walking to do still, you know? For my route. I need my hands and feet to work.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Based on your history and this brief examination, several possibilities come to mind. Peripheral neuropathy is a concern, given the tingling, numbness, and diminished sensation. Several things can cause neuropathy – diabetes is one, but you said you don’t have that. Vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, and even repetitive stress could play a role. However, it’s too early to say definitively what’s causing this. We need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and kidney function. We will also do some nerve conduction studies to assess the function of your nerves. This will involve a referral to a neurologist. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Oh, dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests are fine, I suppose. I don’t like needles, but… I understand. But nerve conduction studies? What does that mean? Is it painful? I really don't want to go through anything painful. And how long is all of this going to take? I have a schedule to keep, you know. My route… It’s a big route. I don’t want to fall behind. Honestly, Doctor, I'm just a little scared. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Uzarski. It’s natural to be worried when you don’t know what’s going on. Nerve conduction studies measure how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves. It does involve small electrical impulses, but it shouldn't be painful, although some people experience a mild stinging sensation. It's similar to a static shock. It’s a crucial test to help pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. As for how long it will take, the blood tests should be back within a few days. Getting an appointment with a neurologist might take a week or two, depending on their availability. I'll do my best to expedite the process. Regarding your concern about something serious... it’s difficult to say at this point. Neuropathy can range from mild and manageable to more severe, requiring treatment. We need to get these tests done to determine the exact cause and the best course of action. Until we have those results, it's best not to jump to conclusions. I will give you a referral to Dr. Elena Petrova, a very well-respected neurologist in the area. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Dr. Petrova… I'll write that down. A week or two… I can maybe manage that. But if it takes longer… I really need to know. My supervisor isn't very understanding. And no, I don’t want to think about the worst possible things right now. Just… the tests, then. And hopefully, they can figure out what's going on. Do you think it could be… from all the walking? Just wear and tear? Is that possible? I really hope it's just that. I don't want to have to retire.
DOCTOR: Repetitive stress is a possibility, Ms. Uzarski. Walking a significant route regularly certainly puts strain on your hands and feet. However, we need to rule out other causes first before attributing it solely to that. That’s why the tests are so important. Alright, I’m writing you a referral to Dr. Petrova, and I'm also ordering the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll take care of you there. I will also send a copy of your medical history to Dr. Petrova’s office. Do you have any other questions for me today before you go?
