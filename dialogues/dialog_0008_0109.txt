DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the back of my head. It hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but… a bad ache. Feels deep inside, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, coming and going. And you describe it as a deep ache at the back of your head. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It's… hard to say. It's not like a pounding, you understand? More… heavy. Like someone is sitting on the back of my head. Sometimes it goes down my neck a little, but mostly… back of the head. It hurts when I… when I try to turn my head too fast. Or if I bend over. But when I'm sitting still… it’s just a dull ache. Not so bad then.
DOCTOR: Alright, a heavy, dull ache, primarily at the back of your head, sometimes radiating into your neck. It’s aggravated by turning your head or bending over, and lessened when you’re still. Any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no fever. I haven’t felt hot. And no… no blurry vision. I can see just fine. Sometimes… sometimes I feel a little… tired. But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I am tired most of the time! No… nothing else really. Just the ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vision changes, just the headache and some general fatigue. That’s helpful. Now, have you had headaches like this before?
PATIENT: No… not really like this. I get little pains sometimes, you know? Like when I’m working hard in the yard. But this… this is different. This feels… deeper. And it doesn't go away when I rest. Usually, a little rest fixes things. But not this one. I worked in the rail yard for… oh, sixty years, maybe more. Never had a headache that lasted this long before.
DOCTOR: Sixty years in the rail yard... that's a long time. Okay, so this headache is new and different from anything you’ve experienced before. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? Not that I know of. It just… starts. Sometimes I'm sitting in my chair, reading the paper, and it just begins. Other times, I'm walking to the store, and it starts then. Doesn’t seem to matter what I’m doing. And nothing makes it better, not really. A little bit of rest helps, maybe. But it always comes back. It's… strange. I don’t like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no identifiable triggers and minimal relief with rest. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your neck, feel your head, and do a brief neurological exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, Mr. Brum. Your neck muscles are a bit tight, and there's some tenderness when I press here at the base of your skull. Range of motion is limited due to stiffness, and your reflexes seem normal. Strength is good in your arms and legs. I didn’t hear anything concerning with your heart or lungs. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to muscle strain in your neck. However, given your age and the new onset of this headache, I want to be cautious. I’m going to order a simple blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. And I’d also like to get an X-ray of your neck just to make sure there’s nothing structural going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood test and… a picture of my neck? Yes, that sounds… good. If it will help find out what’s wrong, then yes. I don’t like feeling this ache. I just want it to go away. Will the tests take long? And will they hurt? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: The blood test is relatively quick – just a few vials of blood drawn from your arm. And yes, there will be a small needle prick, but it’s usually over very quickly. We can use a smaller needle if that helps. The X-ray is painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes a picture. It doesn’t involve any radiation exposure of concern. The results usually come back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild pain reliever to help manage the ache. It's an anti-inflammatory, which can also help with any muscle tension. I’ll also recommend some gentle neck stretches and a warm compress to help relax your muscles. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that… sounds alright. Gentle stretches… warm compress… I can try that. And the little pills… good. I hope they help. So… I just wait for the results and take the pills? And stretch my neck? Is there anything else I should do? Anything I shouldn’t do? I don't want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Wait for the results, take the pills as directed, and try the gentle stretches and warm compress. Avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the pain. Don't lift anything heavy, and be careful with any movements that cause you discomfort. If the pain suddenly worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, weakness, or numbness, please come back immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. No sudden worsening… no fever… okay. I will be careful. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. I hope these little pills work. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. That’s what I’m here for. We'll get to the bottom of this. And don’t worry, we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. Here’s the prescription and the instructions for the tests and stretches. If you have any questions at all, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, Mr. Brum, and please take care of yourself. .
