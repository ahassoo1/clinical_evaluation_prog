DOCTOR: Good morning, Candice. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Really, must we go through all of this? I just moved here, you see, and someone told me I had to come for a… a check-up. Medicare insisted, I believe. It's all rather tedious.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare does often require a welcome-to-Medicare visit, especially for new patients. It’s a good way to get a baseline of your health and make sure everything is alright. It doesn’t have to be tedious, we’ll just go through some standard questions. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Standard questions… honestly. Very well. But please, let's not dwell on things unnecessarily. My husband is waiting for me, and he doesn’t appreciate a delay. I suppose you must ask what you need to ask. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with a little about your current health. Are you experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? At my age? Doctor, one always has some aches and pains. It comes with the territory, you know. But nothing… debilitating. Just the usual stiffness. My knees, mostly. And a bit in my back. Honestly, it’s hardly worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: I understand. But even "usual" aches and pains are important for me to know about. Can you tell me a little more about the stiffness in your knees and back?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… age. I told you. It flares up when the weather is damp, or if I’ve been on my feet too long. Really, it's nothing a good rest doesn't fix. I don't need a whole examination for a little stiffness. My mother had it too, you know. It's hereditary, I suspect.
DOCTOR: Okay. And besides the stiffness, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, are you quite sure you need a detailed account of every little discomfort? I occasionally feel a little… tired. And sometimes my appetite isn't what it used to be. But those are hardly symptoms. Everyone gets tired. And one doesn’t always have a ravenous hunger, you know. Is this going somewhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. I'm just trying to get a complete picture of your overall health. Even seemingly small things can be important. When did you start noticing the fatigue and change in appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… months ago, I suppose. At least. Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. Perhaps after the winter? It was a particularly dreary one. Everything just… faded together. Really, Doctor, I don’t see what difference it makes. I’m an elderly woman. Things fade with age. It's quite natural.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, along with the change in appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Doctor, are you suggesting I’m wasting away? That’s rather impertinent! I may not be as… robust as I once was, but I assure you, I am not losing weight. Perhaps I've lost a pound or two, but that's hardly noticeable. And frankly, it's none of your business. I prefer not to discuss my weight. It’s a sensitive subject. Now, is there anything else? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candice. I apologize if I offended you. It's just part of the assessment, and it helps me understand your overall health. Let's move on to your medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Goodness. That was a long time ago. Let me see… I had a touch of bronchitis once, many years ago. And my gallbladder, I think. They removed it. And… oh, what was it? Something with my blood pressure, perhaps? Honestly, it's all so vague. My husband handles all the paperwork. I simply don't remember. It was all a long time ago. Really, Doctor, I don't have the energy to sift through ancient history. It’s all terribly tiresome. .
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can skip that for now. Do you take any medications regularly?
