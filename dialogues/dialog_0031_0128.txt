DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Lilliana. Um… well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get…stiff. Especially in the mornings. It’s just… annoying, really. I forget what else… it’s been a little while since I thought about it much.
DOCTOR: I see. Stiffness in your joints, particularly in the mornings. That is a common complaint, Lilliana. And you said it's been going on for a little while?
PATIENT: Yes, a little while. Not… not terrible, just… there. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Maybe a few months? Or longer? Everything feels a bit blurry these days, you know? It’s not like a sharp pain, more like… creaking. Like an old door. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Lilliana. A creaking sensation is a helpful way to describe it. And you're right, it's not always easy to pinpoint exactly when these things begin. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Um… yes, I think so. Or maybe it was after… after George… passed. Everything got a bit mixed up then, you see. I was just… busy. Not busy doing things, just… busy with… everything. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a constant thing, though. Some days are better than others.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. Grief can certainly make it difficult to focus on physical symptoms, and it can also affect how we perceive pain. It's perfectly normal for things to feel “mixed up” after a loss. So, to clarify, the stiffness seems to fluctuate – some days are better than others. Are there any particular times of day when it’s worse, besides the mornings?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… maybe after I’ve been sitting for a long time? Like, if I’m helping the little ones with their puzzles, and I get up… then it’s a bit harder to move. But it doesn’t last long. Just a little… wobble. And then it's okay again. I don’t really… go out much these days, so I don’t know about walking or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse after prolonged sitting, and it improves relatively quickly. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, are you experiencing any swelling or redness in any of your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, I don't think so. Redness… maybe a little sometimes? But I’m not sure if that’s just… my skin. I get… flushed easily. I’m not very good at noticing things like that, honestly. It just feels stiff. And a bit… achy. But not a bad ache. More like… old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you're able to describe it that way. And it's perfectly reasonable to wonder if it's simply a part of getting older. Now, have you noticed this stiffness in any particular joints specifically – hands, knees, hips, back – or is it all over?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly my hands, I think. And my knees a little. My back… well, my back always hurts a bit. I used to be a very active person, you see. Lots of dancing. But that was a long time ago. It’s hard to say if the back is… new, or just… always there. The little ones are very good at pulling on me, though. That doesn't help!
DOCTOR: Alright, so primarily in your hands and knees, with some ongoing back discomfort. And the grandchildren certainly keep you active! Now, Lilliana, have you tried anything to manage the stiffness—over-the-counter pain relievers, creams, heat or cold packs, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think I have some… pills somewhere. But I don’t really like taking them. They make me feel… funny. And I don’t remember what they’re for, exactly. I think they’re for headaches? Maybe? I used to put some cream on, but it didn’t seem to do much. Honestly, I just try to ignore it, mostly. And move slowly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've tried some over-the-counter pain relievers in the past, but didn't find them particularly helpful and prefer to manage it by moving slowly. And you haven’t taken anything recently. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you are aware of, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… let me think. The doctor… George’s doctor… said my blood pressure was a little high, once. But that was a long time ago. And I think… I think I had some trouble with my cholesterol? But I don’t really… go to the doctor much. I don’t like hospitals. And honestly, I forget what they tell me half the time. Everything just… blurs together.
DOCTOR: I understand, Lilliana. It can be overwhelming to keep track of everything. So, to clarify, you recall being told you had slightly elevated blood pressure and potentially some cholesterol concerns in the past, but haven't had regular check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Oh! Yes. When I was younger, I had my tonsils out. And… and George said something about a… a stitch, once? When I fell, a long time ago. But it wasn’t a big surgery, I don't think. Just a little cut. Nothing important. Mostly I just try to stay out of trouble now!
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy in the past and a minor stitch for a cut. Now, are you currently taking any medications regularly, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I think I have some vitamins. In the cupboard. But I don’t take them every day. Sometimes I remember, sometimes I don't. And… I think George left some pills, but I don't know what they're for, and I don’t like taking things I don’t understand. Mostly just a cup of tea, really. And maybe some honey when my throat is sore.
DOCTOR: Alright, so occasional vitamins, but nothing consistent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. And sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but I don’t know if that’s an allergy. Mostly, everything seems okay. I try to eat healthy, you see. Lots of fruit and vegetables.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of your situation, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yes, alright. That’s fine. I don’t really… mind. Just… be gentle, please? My joints are a little… sensitive, you know. And try not to talk too much, I get a bit confused easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. I will be as gentle as possible. And I’ll try to keep my explanations concise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your pulse is 76 and your temperature is normal. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to take a look at your hands and knees. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you and then bend your knees for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There. Is that alright? My arms feel a bit… stiff. Oh dear… that’s a little uncomfortable. They don’t bend as easily as they used to.
DOCTOR: I see. There is a little bit of swelling, and your range of motion is slightly limited. And I notice some crepitus – a grinding sensation – when you bend your knees. There is some tenderness on the inner side of your knees, but no significant warmth. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Oh dear… It’s a little… uncomfortable. And a bit wobbly. Is everything alright? It feels… different. Like something is… rubbing together.
DOCTOR: I see. There is a bit of a limp and your knees are moving with a slightly reduced range of motion. Now, please sit back down. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam, it sounds like you are likely experiencing osteoarthritis, which is a common condition that causes pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion in your joints. The crepitus I felt, the tenderness, and the reduced range of motion are all consistent with this. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some X-rays of your knees and hands. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… X-rays? Are they… are they safe? And will they hurt? I don’t really like hospitals, you see. And I forget things easily. Will I remember what to do? I just want my joints to stop hurting. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Lilliana. X-rays use a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. They won’t hurt at all – you’ll simply lie still while the technician takes some pictures. And the technician will guide you through everything step-by-step, so you don’t have to worry about remembering anything. We can also send the instructions home with you, if that would be helpful. The purpose of the X-rays is to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your joints and confirm whether it’s osteoarthritis or something else. Knowing the exact cause will help us determine the best treatment plan for you. If it turns out to be osteoarthritis, the good news is that there are several things we can do to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. We can discuss options like pain relievers, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications. Would you like me to go ahead and order the X-rays, and I can give you instructions on how to schedule them at the local imaging center?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you think it’s necessary. But please, make sure they’re gentle. And… and could you write down everything? I always forget things, you see. And… and if it’s a lot of trouble, we don’t have to do it. I can just… try to ignore it. I just… want to be able to play with the little ones without hurting. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Lilliana. And we will absolutely take things slowly and make sure you’re comfortable. I understand your concerns about forgetting things, and I will definitely write down everything for you. I’m ordering X-rays of both your hands and knees. I’ll also write a prescription for a mild pain reliever – naproxen – which you can take as needed for pain and inflammation. It's important to start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I’ll also write down clear instructions on how to schedule the X-rays at the imaging center, as well as instructions on how to take the naproxen safely. Here’s the paper with all the instructions. The imaging center is located at 123 Main Street, and their phone number is 555-1212. They will schedule an appointment for you when you call. We'll review the X-ray results together when they're available, and then we can discuss a more comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. 123 Main Street… and 555-1212… I think I can remember that. Um… yes, one question. Will the pain reliever… make me sleepy? Because I need to be able to look after the little ones, you see. And… and will it interact with anything? I don’t take much, but… I think George left some pills somewhere. I don't want to get confused again.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Lilliana. Naproxen can sometimes cause drowsiness in some people, but it’s not a common side effect. However, it’s very important to avoid combining it with other medications without first checking with me or your pharmacist. Since you mentioned George left some pills, could you bring those with you when you come back for your follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, alright. I can do that. I think they’re in the cupboard, with the vitamins. It's just… everything gets mixed up, you see. I forget what things are for. But I will try to remember to bring them. And… and thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think that’s everything for now. Is it alright if I just… go home and rest? My joints are a little tired. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Lilliana. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, take things slowly and rest. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
