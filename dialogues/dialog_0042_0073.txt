DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? I’ve got things to do. It's my stomach. It just...won't stop. Been going on for weeks, and nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore sells, and I'm just tired of being stuck inside.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration – dealing with a persistent issue like that can be very disruptive. “Won't stop” is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me a little more about what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Vague? Honestly. It means I'm running to the bathroom constantly! Multiple times a day, and even waking up at night. It's… watery. And it doesn’t feel right, you know? Like there’s something… pressing. I just need something to make it stop. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is much more specific, thank you. Frequent, watery bowel movements, even waking you at night, and a feeling of pressure… that definitely gives me a better picture. How long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, at least three weeks, maybe four? I honestly lost track. It started kinda slowly, just a little upset, then got worse and worse. I figured it would just…go away. But it hasn't. And frankly, I don't have time to be dealing with this. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand. Three to four weeks of progressively worsening symptoms is significant. And you're right to seek it checked out if it isn’t resolving on its own. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No. Look, I'm not one to… examine things too closely, if you know what I mean. I know it sounds bad, but I just… don’t want to look. And no, it’s not black or anything weird like that. Just… watery. And a lot of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No blood or dark stools is helpful. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside this?
PATIENT: No fever. I felt a little queasy a couple of times, but didn't actually throw up. And my stomach just feels… uncomfortable. Not like a sharp pain, more like a constant ache, especially after… well, after everything. It's not pleasant. Honestly, it's just really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. Inconvenient, and uncomfortable, with a constant ache after bowel movements. Have you experienced any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I probably haven’t been eating as much because of all this. It's hard to enjoy a meal when you're worried about running to the bathroom. I definitely haven’t been trying to lose weight. I just… want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no vomiting, no weight loss, just frequent watery stools, abdominal discomfort, and a feeling of urgency. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're talking about my diet? Honestly, what does that have to do with anything? I eat normal food. I mean, I try to. I paint houses, I don’t spend all day making fancy meals. Burgers, sandwiches, the usual. I had some fish last week… does that matter? Look, I don't have any special dietary restrictions or anything. It's not like I'm eating spoiled food or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring, I appreciate your patience. It’s good to know you don’t have any known dietary restrictions, and that you’re generally eating a normal diet. I ask about diet because it can be a factor in these types of symptoms, but I understand your frustration with these questions. Do you drink a lot of caffeine or alcohol?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Are you trying to accuse me of something? A little coffee, yeah. I need it to get through the day. And maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. It helps me relax. Not like I'm an alcoholic or anything. A couple of drinks isn't going to cause all this. Really, is this going somewhere or are you just going to keep asking me about my personal life?
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. I assure you, I am not trying to accuse you of anything. I am simply trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing your symptoms. A little coffee and occasional wine are unlikely to be the sole cause, but it’s important to consider all possibilities. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: Traveled? No. I haven't left the state in years. I work, I take care of things. I don’t have time for vacations. It's not like I went to some exotic country or anything. Really, I just want a solution. A pill, something… anything to make it stop. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. No recent travel. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Just… the usual. High blood pressure, I guess. The doctor put me on something for it a few years back. Other than that, nothing. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. I work hard. And my husband... he passed away last year. But that's not a medical condition.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Woodring. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult. And thank you for telling me about your high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications for that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes. Lisinopril, I think it's called. A small white pill. One every day. And that’s it. Just the blood pressure medicine. I haven't needed anything else, until… well, until this started. Is this finally getting somewhere? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lisinopril daily for high blood pressure. That's very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't had any reactions to anything. I’ve never had to go to the hospital for an allergic reaction or anything like that. I’m pretty tough. I can handle things. This stomach thing is just… irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Thank you for providing all of this information, Ms. Woodring. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Don't take all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your bowel sounds are a bit…hyperactive, which isn’t entirely unexpected given your symptoms. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels painful. There’s a little tenderness in your lower abdomen, but nothing acutely concerning. Based on what you’ve told me and this brief exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a bout of gastroenteritis – what people often call a “stomach bug.” However, given the duration of your symptoms – three to four weeks – and the fact that it’s not improving, I’d like to run a few tests to rule out other possibilities. Specifically, I’d like to check a stool sample for infection, and possibly do a blood test to check for inflammation and rule out other conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A…stool sample? Seriously? You want a sample of…that? Look, I barely agreed to let you poke around in my stomach, and now you want a… specimen? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with, and the sooner I can get out of here. But don't expect me to be happy about it. Just tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not the most pleasant task, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We’ll provide you with a sterile container and instructions on how to collect the sample. It’s a relatively simple process, and it will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure we provide you with the appropriate treatment. Here's what we'll do. I'll have the nurse bring you a collection kit, with detailed instructions. You’ll collect a small sample – about a tablespoon size – and bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. We will send it to the lab, and the results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend staying well-hydrated – drink plenty of fluids, like water or electrolyte solutions – and eating bland foods, like toast, rice, and bananas. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine. Do you have any questions about the collection process, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Just... where do I even get a tablespoon of that? And how long does this whole thing take? I can’t just sit around waiting for a lab result. I have work to do! This better be quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Woodring. The nurse will explain the collection process in detail, but essentially, you'll collect a small amount of stool in the provided container after a bowel movement. The instructions will guide you on how to do it properly to ensure an accurate result. The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return the results. I realize that's not ideal, and we'll do our best to expedite the process. Once we have the results, we’ll contact you to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool – please contact us immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions about what to look out for?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get the nurse. I want this over with. And honestly, if this doesn't help, I’m finding another doctor. .
