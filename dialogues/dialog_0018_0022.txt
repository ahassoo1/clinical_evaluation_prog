DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... what brings me? Well, my tummy... it feels big. Bigger than usual, I think. And I don't want to eat much lately. Not like I used to. Everything just... feels off. I don't really know what's going on. It's been a little while, maybe a few weeks? Hard to remember exactly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness, a change in appetite, and a general sense of feeling unwell for a few weeks. Thank you for sharing that. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this fullness?
PATIENT: Fullness… yes. It’s not painful, you know? Just… heavy. Like I ate a big dinner, but I didn’t. And it doesn’t go away. Even after… well, after a little something. Sometimes I feel a little… bloaty, I guess. Like I'm full of air. Is that… right? I don't know the words. It's just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: You are describing it perfectly, Ms. McConnon. “Bloaty” is a very good word, and “heavy” captures it well too. It sounds quite uncomfortable. And it’s good you differentiate that it isn’t painful, that’s important. Now, has this feeling of fullness or bloating been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh… constant, I think. Mostly constant. Some days are worse than others, yes? Like today it's… more noticeable. I try to ignore it, but it's hard. It's always there, a little bit. I used to be able to eat a good soup, you know? But now… even a little bit feels too much.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant, with some fluctuations in intensity. And it's affecting your appetite, making it difficult to enjoy even small meals. You mentioned soup. Are there any particular foods that seem to worsen the feeling, or any that you find easier to tolerate?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. Let me think… oh dear. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… the same, almost. But maybe… maybe the bread makes it worse? Yes, I think so. The heavy, yeasty bread. And… sometimes milk doesn’t sit well. But I used to love milk! It's all so confusing. I don't know what I can eat anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Ms. McConnon. It sounds like certain foods might be triggering more discomfort than others, even ones you used to enjoy. It is confusing when things change like that. Now, besides the fullness and changes in appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. Sometimes… I feel a little tired. Very tired. But I'm old, Doctor! Maybe that's just… old age? And… sometimes my tummy makes funny noises. Gurgling, you know? Like… water bubbling. Is that bad? I don't think so. But it's there.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some gurgling sounds in your abdomen. Those are good things to mention, Ms. McConnon. It's important to consider everything. Fatigue can be caused by many things, and it’s good to rule out any underlying medical reasons, regardless of age. And the gurgling sounds, while often harmless, can sometimes indicate changes in digestion. Now, I’d like to ask about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your usual pattern?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. That’s a… private question, isn't it? Well… um… I don’t go as often. Not like I used to. And… it's harder. Yes, much harder. I have to… push. It's not comfortable. And sometimes… sometimes there's a little blood. Just a little, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. McConnon. It is a private question, and I appreciate your honesty. Changes in bowel habits, difficulty with bowel movements, and the presence of blood are all important things to investigate. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's… yes. I think so. My clothes… they feel a little loose. But I haven’t weighed myself. Not for a long time. I don't really pay attention to that anymore. But… I do feel a little… smaller, maybe? It's hard to say, I don't really know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of some weight loss, and clothes feeling looser. That's helpful information. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if that's alright. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… let me think. My doctor… Dr. Volkov… he said I had a little bit of… what was it? Something with the pressure. High pressure, yes. But I took pills for it. For many years. I don’t take them anymore. He said it was okay. And… I had a bad fall a few years ago. Broke my hip. But it healed. I don’t know anything else. I'm an old woman, Doctor!
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, a history of high blood pressure managed with medication in the past, and a previous hip fracture. That’s good to know. Did Dr. Volkov mention any other conditions, or perform any regular screenings, such as for cholesterol or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, screenings… I don’t remember. He did blood work, yes, every year. But I never really paid attention to the results. He just said I was… okay. Old lady check-ups, you know? I think he checked my tummy sometimes. But not very carefully. I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Regular check-ups with blood work, but without specific details remembered. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as cancer, heart disease, or digestive problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that's… hard. My mama… she had something with her tummy. A long time ago. The doctors… they didn’t know what it was. She was very sick. And my papa… he had a bad heart. He died when I was young. But I don't know what kind of heart problem. It was a long time ago, Doctor. Everyone in my family… they all died long ago.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of an unspecified digestive issue in your mother, and heart problems in your father. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no. Never! I don’t smoke. My mama didn’t like smoking. And I don’t drink. Never liked the taste. And drugs… oh dear, no. I am a good Russian woman, Doctor! I have never touched those things. I drink tea, yes. Lots of tea.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. McConnon. Just tea, that's good. Now, one last question about your background. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not really. Just sometimes, when my hip bothers me, I take a little something for the pain. But it’s just… a little white pill. I got it from the drugstore. I don't know the name. And sometimes I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, because it’s dark. But that’s all. Very simple.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle, please. My tummy… it's a little tender.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. McConnon. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie back on the examination table, and we'll begin. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels particularly painful or uncomfortable. I’m noticing some tenderness in your lower abdomen. It's mild, but present. And I’m also feeling a mass here… about this size. It doesn’t feel acutely painful, but it is definitely there. I’m also noting some mild abdominal distension. Now, let’s check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… a mass? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? A distension? I don’t understand these words. Is something wrong with my tummy? It's been feeling so uncomfortable lately. The tenderness… yes, that's what I've been feeling. It's not a sharp pain, just… heavy and achy. What could it be, Doctor? Please tell me. I'm getting scared.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, Ms. McConnon. I want to assure you that finding a mass doesn’t automatically mean something is terribly wrong, but it does require further investigation to determine what it is. “Distension” simply means your abdomen is slightly swollen. And tenderness, as you’ve described, is the discomfort you’re feeling when I touch your abdomen. Based on my examination and what you’ve told me, there are a few possibilities. It could be something relatively benign, like a buildup of gas or a slow-growing cyst. However, given your symptoms – the change in appetite, the weight loss, the blood in your stool, the fatigue, and the presence of the mass – we need to rule out more serious conditions, such as a bowel obstruction or even a possible tumor. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to be thorough. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. Would you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. A CT scan? Blood work? It all sounds so… serious. A tumor? I don’t want to have a tumor, Doctor. I'm an old woman! I just want to feel better. But… if you think it’s necessary… yes, I suppose. I trust you, Doctor. You seem very kind. But… will it be painful? And… expensive? I don’t have much money. I live alone, you know. And who will take care of me?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. McConnon. I want to assure you that we will take things one step at a time. The CT scan itself is not painful. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will take images of your abdomen and pelvis. It’s similar to an X-ray, but more detailed. As for the cost, I understand your concerns. We can discuss options for financial assistance and work with the hospital to minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. There are programs available to help cover the cost of testing for patients with limited income. And we’ll arrange for appropriate follow-up care and support to ensure you’re comfortable and well-cared for throughout the process. I’ll also have my nurse, Anya, help you with the paperwork and connect you with resources that can provide financial assistance. I'm here to support you every step of the way. First, let’s get the lab work ordered. We’ll draw some blood to check your overall health and rule out any infections or other underlying conditions. Then, we'll schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, or any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… no, I don’t think so. Never had any trouble with anything. And kidney problems… I don’t know. Dr. Volkov never said anything about my kidneys. He just checked my pressure. But… I do get a little tired sometimes. And I have to go to the bathroom more often at night. Does that mean something? I just want to feel like myself again, Doctor. I miss eating my soup. I miss being able to walk without feeling tired. Is there anything I can do right now to feel better? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. McConnon. The frequent urination at night could be a sign of a few different things, and it’s something we’ll keep in mind. It's good we're gathering all this information. Right now, while we await the test results, there are a few things you can do to manage your symptoms. I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, rather than large ones. Avoid foods that seem to worsen your bloating or discomfort, and stay well-hydrated by drinking plenty of water. You can also try gentle exercise, such as walking, to help stimulate your digestion and improve your overall energy levels. However, please don’t overexert yourself. Listen to your body and rest when you need to. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help ease your bowel movements and prevent any straining. And I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the test results and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. Now, let’s get the lab work ordered. Anya, my nurse, will be in shortly to draw your blood and answer any questions you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. Smaller meals… I can try that. And the stool softener… that would be good. Anything to make things easier. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I'm still scared, but I feel a little bit better knowing that you’re here to help. I just hope… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Tell Anya… thank you too. And… maybe she can hold my hand while she draws the blood? I’m a little afraid of needles.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I understand your fear, and I will be sure to let Anya know about your anxiety with needles. She is very gentle and experienced, and she will be happy to hold your hand during the blood draw. We will take things slowly and make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. I will also speak with Anya about arranging for a follow-up call from me after the test results are available to discuss everything in more detail. For now, let’s focus on taking things one step at a time. Smaller meals, staying hydrated, and taking the stool softener. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Anya should be in shortly. I’ll let her know you’re ready. .
PATIENT: .
