DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uhm, good morning. The nails, yeah. They just… look funny. Not like they used to. I don’t really know what’s wrong with them, that's why I'm here. I just noticed them, you know? They’re… different.
DOCTOR: I see. “Different” how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. How to explain… They’re kinda… thick. And the color… not pretty. Not like a normal nail color. It’s… yellowish. Not bright yellow, more… dingy. I dunno. I don’t pay that much attention to my nails, honestly. I just noticed it when I was, uh, gardening last week, I think. Maybe? It was hot. Everything feels fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s helpful that you noticed a change. And it’s perfectly alright if you don't routinely examine your nails; that’s what I’m here for. So, the changes you’ve observed are increased thickness and a yellowish discoloration. Has this change been gradual, or did it seem to appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… gradual, I guess? I don’t remember when it started exactly. Everything kinda blurs together, you know? It wasn't like, boom, overnight. But I definitely didn't notice it a month ago, I can tell you that. Probably… a few months? Maybe longer. I really don’t keep track of that stuff. It's just nails, right? Not like a broken bone or somethin’.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask the questions, Ms. Thut. It's good to be mindful, even about seemingly minor changes. And no, we’re not immediately assuming anything serious. To help me understand the situation more completely, could you tell me if you’ve experienced any pain or discomfort in your nails or the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. A little… sensitive sometimes, when I'm clipping them. But nothing I’d complain about. It's not like a throbbing ache or anything. Just… a little tender. You know, like when you stub your toe, but, like, on your finger. Less bad, of course. I don't think it's hurtin’ me. It's probably just my imagination. Old lady problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, but some mild tenderness when clipping. That’s helpful to know. Now, Ms. Thut, have you noticed this change on all of your nails, or just specific ones?
PATIENT: Uhm… let me think… I think… mostly the big toes. And maybe… one or two of the others? They all look kinda… blah now that I'm lookin’ at ‘em. It's hard to say. They’re all just… not nice. The big ones are the worst, though. Definitely the big ones. And maybe a little on the pinky. Honestly, I don’t even wanna look at ‘em. They’re just… icky.
DOCTOR: Alright. Primarily the big toes, with possible involvement of some of the others, particularly the pinky toes. Now, Ms. Thut, do you have any medical conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, or a weakened immune system?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. I don't think so. The doctor always checks, and he'd tell me, wouldn't he? Pso… what was it? Psoriasis? Never been told I have that. And… immune system… I get a cold now and then, like everyone else. I'm not sick sick, you know? Just… old. That weakens your immune system, right? I don't take any special pills or nothin'. Medicare covers what I need. Mostly just… aches and pains. You know, normal stuff.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No known diabetes, psoriasis, or weakened immune system. Just typical age-related aches and pains. Now, Ms. Thut, have you ever had any injuries to your toes or nails – perhaps a trauma, or have you had any nail procedures done in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. I tripped in the garden last year, but I don't think I hurt my toes. Just bruised my knee. And nail… procedures? What's that even mean? I get ‘em trimmed at the salon sometimes. Does that count? Nothing fancy. Just a regular trim and polish. Never had nothin’ done to ‘em, like, fixed or somethin’. I don’t have time for that nonsense. Practical nails, that's what I need. Gotta be able to dig in the dirt!
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant toe injuries, and routine nail trims at a salon, but no nail procedures. Now, Ms. Thut, do you have any known allergies, particularly to medications or topical products?
PATIENT: Uhm… allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don’t like okra. But that’s a taste thing, not an allergy! And… topical… what did you say? Like, creams and stuff? I use some lotion sometimes, but nothin’ special. Just… regular lotion. I haven’t broken out in a rash or nothin’, so I guess I’m not allergic to anything. I don’t even bother with fancy stuff, really. Keep it simple, that's my motto. Now, are we gettin' anywhere with these nails? They're kinda embarrassin', you know? I just want ‘em to look normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Thut, we are making progress. No known allergies. It's perfectly understandable you'd like to get them back to normal. Now, I would like to take a closer look at your nails. Could you please sit back and let me examine your feet?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Go ahead, I guess. Don’t mind the socks, they're kinda holey. I need to buy some new ones. Honestly, it's just one thing after another these days. I hope you don't find nothin' too terrible. I don't want to have to get a special cream or somethin'. I just want my normal nails back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. I've had a look at your toenails. As you described, they are indeed thicker and have a yellowish discoloration. The texture is also a bit brittle. Based on what you've told me and my examination, the most likely cause is onychomycosis, which is a fungal infection of the nails. It’s quite common, especially with age. It’s not usually painful, which explains why you’ve only experienced mild tenderness, but it can be persistent. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Fun… gus? What’s that even mean? Is it… contagious? I don’t want to give it to my neighbor! She’s always borrowin’ my gardening tools. And is it serious? Do I need… shots? I really hate shots. And can it be fixed? I just wanna get rid of it, whatever it is. And I don’t want any fancy creams that smell bad. Honestly, it sounds awful already. Is it gonna spread to my hands? Now that would be a disaster! I use my hands for everything.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Thut. "Onychomycosis" is just the medical term for a fungal nail infection. It's caused by a fungus that gets under the nail and thrives in warm, moist environments. Regarding your concerns: it is contagious, but it's not highly contagious. It’s typically spread through direct contact or by sharing contaminated items like nail clippers or, potentially, gardening tools. So, being mindful of sharing those items is a good idea. It's usually not serious in the sense that it won't cause major health problems, but it can be stubborn to treat and can sometimes cause discomfort or difficulty walking if it becomes severe. As for treatment, there are several options. Topical medications are available, but they often have limited success, especially in more severe cases. Oral medications are more effective, but they do require monitoring by your doctor due to potential side effects. Shots are not typically used for onychomycosis. It can spread to other nails or even to the skin, but with proper hygiene and treatment, we can minimize that risk. We'll discuss the best treatment option for you based on the severity of the infection and your overall health. Would you like me to explain the available treatment options in more detail?
PATIENT: Uhm… okay. That's a lot. I don't want pills. I really don’t like takin’ pills. And I definitely don't want anything that makes me sick. I barely take my blood pressure medicine as it is. What about… can you just, like, file it off? Or something? I’ve seen those fancy salons, they do all sorts of things. I’m sure they have something. And is it expensive? Medicare barely covers anything these days. I don't wanna end up payin' a fortune to fix my nails. Honestly, I just wanna go back to gardening. I miss my tomatoes. They're probably all wilted by now. This is just a whole mess, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Thut. You’re right to be cautious about medications, and I respect your preference to avoid pills if possible. Filing the nail off can help to reduce the thickness, but unfortunately, it won’t eliminate the underlying fungal infection. The fungus lives under the nail, so it would simply grow back. Regarding costs, the price can vary depending on the treatment method. Topical medications are generally less expensive, but as we discussed, they may not be very effective. Oral medications are more expensive and require lab monitoring, which adds to the cost. Laser treatment is another option, but it's typically not covered by Medicare and can be quite expensive. Given your concerns about pills and costs, we could start with a topical antifungal medication. I’ll write you a prescription for one. It’s important to understand that it may take several months to see improvement, and it may not work completely. We would need to monitor your progress closely. If it doesn’t improve after a reasonable amount of time, we can discuss other options. Would you like me to write you that prescription?
PATIENT: Okay… fine. A cream… I guess that’s better than nothin’. But if it smells bad, I’m throwin’ it out! And if it doesn't work, don’t bother with the pills. I’m tellin’ you right now, no pills. And if I have to come back here every week for check-ups, I’m gonna be mad. I have things to do, you know? Tomatoes don’t grow themselves. Just write the prescription, and let's get this over with. And please, tell me how to use it. I don't wanna mess it up. I’m an old lady, I can’t see so good anymore. And is there anything else I need to do? Like, special socks or somethin'? Honestly, this is a whole lot of trouble for some nails.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Thut. I completely understand your concerns, and I assure you, I’ll take them into account. The cream I’m prescribing is generally well-tolerated and doesn't have a strong odor. If you find the smell bothersome, please let me know, and we can explore other options. Here’s the prescription. Instructions for use: 1. File your nails regularly to thin them as much as possible. 2. Clean and dry your feet thoroughly before applying the cream. 3. Apply a thin layer of the cream to the affected nails twice daily. 4. Continue treatment for the full course, even if your nails start to look better. It typically takes several months to see improvement. As for additional measures, keeping your feet clean and dry is crucial. Wear breathable socks, preferably cotton, and avoid tight-fitting shoes. Avoid sharing nail clippers or other personal hygiene items. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to assess your progress. If you experience any adverse effects, such as redness, itching, or irritation, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Uhm… no, I think that's it. Three months… that's a long time. But okay. Just… don't expect miracles, alright? And if my tomatoes die, I'm holdin’ you responsible. Now, I gotta go. I need to get to the store before they run out of fertilizer. Thank you… I guess. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Thut. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to help you achieve the best possible outcome. And I assure you, I'm not a tomato expert! Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I hope you have a bountiful tomato harvest. .
