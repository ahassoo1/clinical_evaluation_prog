DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… kinda wanted to check things out, you know? Been feelin' alright, mostly. Just thought it was a good idea to see how everything's doin'. I don't really have anything wrong, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: A general check-up, then. Preventative care is… sensible, I suppose. Though it's often a waste of both our time when nothing is actually wrong. But, alright. Let's start with a little history, shall we?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. History… okay. Well, I work on ships, mostly. Sailor and… oilin' stuff. It’s good work, keeps me movin’. I been doin' that for… maybe six years now? Before that… not much, really. Just tryin' to find my way, you know?
DOCTOR: Ships… right. And this work, does it involve a lot of… physical exertion?
PATIENT: Yeah, it does. Lots of liftin', climbin', workin' in tight spaces. It’s not sittin' at a desk, that’s for sure. Gets pretty hot sometimes too, down in the engine room. But I’m used to it, mostly. I try to stay in shape when I'm on land.
DOCTOR: And how often are you… on land, Mr. Heindel?
PATIENT: Hmm… that changes. Sometimes a few weeks, sometimes a couple months. Depends on the route. Last trip was… about three months at sea, then a week back home. It was nice to sleep in a real bed again, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And during these periods at sea, and even when you're ashore, have you noticed any… unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms… lemme think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but that's just from the work, I figure. I did have a cough a while back, but it went away after a bit. Nothing big. I don’t get sick often.
DOCTOR: A cough… when was this cough, precisely?
PATIENT: Hmm… that was… maybe in February? Around there. It wasn't a bad cough, just kinda… scratchy. Lasted a week or so, then went away on its own. I didn't really pay much attention to it, to be honest. I didn’t take nothin’ for it. Just drank some tea and rested when I could.
DOCTOR: And you say you haven't noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, my back gets a little sore sometimes from liftin' heavy stuff, but that’s just part of the job. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I’ve been a little more thirsty lately, maybe? Not like really thirsty, just… drinkin’ a little more water than usual. I just figured it was the heat. Is that… somethin' I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst… interesting. And has this thirst been accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… lemme think. No, not really. I haven't noticed anything else. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but like I said, that could just be the work. I don't get headaches or anything. I do feel like I gotta… pee a little more often, now that I think about it. But again, maybe that’s just from drinkin’ more water? I don't know. I'm not really good at payin' attention to stuff like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Increased thirst and increased urination… It’s… worth investigating, regardless of your assessment of the cause. We’ll need to do a quick physical exam, and I’ll order some routine blood work. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin' before. I don’t take any regular medicines, either. Just… occasionally some pain relievers if my back’s really botherin’ me, but that’s it. Blood work… okay, that sounds alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your vitals, and then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please step onto the scale, if you would.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go…
DOCTOR: 91 kilograms. And your height is recorded as 1.83 meters. Blood pressure is 130 over 85. Heart rate is regular, though slightly elevated… 88 beats per minute. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Now, just to confirm, you said no family history of any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mom passed away a few years ago, but she didn’t really talk about family history much. My dad… he’s still around, but we’re not really close. I don’t know anything about his side of the family, to be honest. Never really came up. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It can be. But we’ll proceed as we have. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never really been interested in any of it. I don't smoke, barely drink—maybe a beer with the guys sometimes when I'm back on land—and definitely no drugs. Always thought it was a waste of money, honestly. I gotta save my money for when I’m too old to work on a ship, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me, and the initial examination, I want to rule out a few possibilities. The increased thirst and urination, coupled with a slightly elevated heart rate… it's not necessarily anything alarming, but we need to investigate. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. The lab results should be back in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A few days… okay. Um… What are we lookin' for, exactly? Like, what kinda things could be wrong? I don’t wanna worry too much if it’s nothin’ serious, you know? And… will the lab work take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, I understand your concern, but speculating about potential diagnoses without concrete evidence is… unproductive. The tests will help us assess your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and overall hydration status. As for the duration, the lab typically processes results within 48-72 hours, though it can occasionally take longer. It’s likely nothing serious, but it's always best to be thorough. We're simply ruling out common possibilities. Now, do you require a written work note for your absence from work for the testing?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. No, no work note. I can take a few hours off, it's alright. I just… get worried easily, I guess. So, I just gotta wait a few days? And then we talk? That sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you checkin' me out.
DOCTOR: Very well. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. I'll see you then. You may get dressed now. Have a good day, Mr. Heindel.
