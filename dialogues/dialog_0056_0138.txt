DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain exactly. It’s about some… spells, almost. My grandson, bless his heart, he’s been having trouble with his arm, just… not working right sometimes. And my daughter, she gets terrible headaches. They reminded me… well, my husband’s mother, she used to get them too. Real bad. It’s… something in the family, I think. I just want to make sure everything’s alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re concerned about some symptoms your grandson and daughter are experiencing, and you’re wondering if it could be related to a family history. Let’s take things one at a time. First, let’s talk about your grandson. How old is he, and can you describe what you mean by “not working right”?
PATIENT: Oh, my grandson… let me think… he's… a young man. Just finished college, I think. Yes, just this year. And… it’s hard to say exactly. His arm… it just gets weak sometimes. Like he can’t lift things, or his hand… shakes. It doesn't happen all the time, and it comes and goes. He said it feels… heavy. And clumsy. It scares him, poor boy. He's a strong lad, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he's recently graduated college and is experiencing intermittent weakness, a heavy feeling, and clumsiness in his arm. Has this been happening long?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not long, not long at all. Maybe… a few months? It started… after a bad flu, I think. He had a really nasty one, kept him in bed for a week. It seemed to start around then. But it doesn’t happen every day, you see? That’s what’s so confusing. Sometimes he's perfectly fine, and then other times… well, that’s when he worries.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it started a few months ago following a bout of the flu. And it’s intermittent – some days he’s fine, others not. Does he notice anything that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not that he’s told me. He’s a busy boy, always on the go. He works… something with computers, I think. He doesn’t sit still much, that’s for sure. He's not one to complain, either. Just brushes it off. But I worry, you see? My husband… he used to get dizzy spells. And his mother… oh, her headaches were terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he's active and works with computers, and doesn't seem to notice any specific triggers for the arm weakness. It sounds like he’s minimizing it, which is common. And you're understandably concerned given the family history. Now, let's switch gears for a moment and talk about your daughter's headaches. Can you describe those?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. My daughter… she gets them pretty often, I think. Not every day, but… enough to be worrying. They're… bad ones. She says it feels like… a tight band around her head, squeezing. And sometimes she gets sick to her stomach, you know? Poor dear, she just has to lie down in a dark room. She says bright lights make it worse. And… she says she sees… little sparkles sometimes, before her eyes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so frequent headaches with a tight band sensation, nausea, sensitivity to light, and seeing sparkles before her eyes. Has she noticed anything that triggers those headaches specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… she said… stress, mostly. She works very hard, she’s a teacher, you know? Lots of responsibility. And sometimes… if she doesn’t eat regularly. She gets so busy with the children, she forgets to take care of herself. But… she tries. She really does. She said sometimes the weather changes bring them on, too. A big storm coming, she can feel it in her head.
DOCTOR: Alright, stress, skipping meals, and changes in weather seem to be triggers for her headaches. And she experiences sensitivity to light. Do you know if she’s tried anything to relieve the headaches?
PATIENT: Yes, she does. She takes… pills, I think. Over-the-counter ones. For the pain. And she tries to rest, lie down in a dark room like I said. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. She doesn’t like taking the pills, though. Says they make her feel… foggy. And she tries those cool cloths on her forehead. That sometimes helps a little. She just… wants to know what’s causing them, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so she's using over-the-counter pain relievers and cool cloths with limited relief. It sounds like she’s also concerned about the underlying cause. Given the family history you've mentioned, and the symptoms both your grandson and daughter are experiencing, it's important we investigate a bit further. I'd like to start by doing a brief physical exam. Can we check your grandson's reflexes and strength in his arm, and I'll do a basic neurological exam?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Yes, that would be good. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to make sure they're alright. Poor boy, he worries so much. And my daughter, she's always putting everyone else first. It's good you're looking into this. Yes, please, check them both. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, let’s start with your grandson. Can he come in for a quick assessment?
PATIENT: He’s… he’s waiting in the car, Doctor. He didn’t want to bother you, he said. He’s a good boy, always thinking of others. I can go get him? It won’t take a moment. He parked just around the corner.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do. That would be great. While you’re getting him, I’ll just quickly review his and your daughter’s EHR information to see if there are any relevant past records.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’ll be right back. He’s a bit shy, you know. Don't mind if he doesn't say much. He’s a good boy, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. It appears their medical history is relatively unremarkable so far. I'll need to get a more detailed history from both of them. It's good to have a baseline, though.
