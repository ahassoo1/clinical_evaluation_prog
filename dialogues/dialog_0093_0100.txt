DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's... nice to meet you as well. Um... let me see. Right, the reason I'm here... it's about a test, isn't it? A drug test, I think they said. Something about needing one... I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It's been a bit of a blur lately.
DOCTOR: I see. A drug test, yes. That’s perfectly alright that the details are blurry; we can certainly clarify everything. It sounds as though this test was requested by someone – perhaps an employer, or another medical professional?
PATIENT: Oh... well, now that you mention it... I think it might be for work. I operate some of the big paving machines, you know? Down on Elm Street mostly. But honestly, everything is a bit muddled. I’ve been…distracted, I guess you could say. Losing track of things. It wasn't a doctor who asked, I don’t think. More like... the company. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Hughston. It's quite common to feel a little confused when dealing with requests like these, especially when it involves work requirements. And it's perfectly fine to ramble – I'm here to listen and sort through everything with you. So, to be clear, the company requested this drug test as part of your employment requirements for operating the paving machines on Elm Street. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Elm Street… big machines… paperwork… ugh. Yes, the company. They… they just said I needed it done, for safety reasons, I think. Something about making sure I’m… capable. It’s all just a bit… unsettling, to be honest. I’ve been doing this job for years, you know? Never had a problem before.
DOCTOR: I understand your feeling unsettled, Ms. Hughston. It’s frustrating and concerning to have your capabilities questioned, especially after years of reliable service. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. To help me understand the situation better, and ensure we address any potential concerns, could you tell me a little more about when the company requested this test?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… that’s… hmm. It wasn’t too long ago, I don’t think. Maybe a week? Two weeks, at most? It was after… after a meeting with Mr. Henderson, the foreman. He just handed me the slip of paper. I remember something about a deadline… but the actual date… it’s gone. I truly apologize. My memory is just… awful these days.
DOCTOR: Please don't apologize, Ms. Hughston. These things happen. It's perfectly alright to have difficulty recalling specific details. Knowing it was after a meeting with Mr. Henderson is helpful. To move forward, and to ensure we’re approaching this test appropriately, let’s discuss your overall health. Have you experienced any recent changes in your memory, aside from this particular instance?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it… yes, I suppose I have. It’s not just forgetting dates, you know? It’s… little things. Leaving the stove on. Misplacing my keys. Repeating myself. Things like that. Nothing major, I thought, just… getting older, probably. But it’s been happening more and more lately. And… sometimes I feel a little… foggy, you know? Like I’m not quite all there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Hughston. Those are important details. It's good you’re recognizing these changes. “Foggy” is a helpful way to describe it. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me if this “fog” is constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Some days I feel perfectly fine, clear as a bell. Other days… well, other days it's like trying to think through mud. It's worse in the afternoons, I think. And… when I’m tired. If I don’t get enough sleep, forget about it. Total blank. It doesn’t happen all the time, thankfully. But when it does… it’s really unsettling. I worry about making mistakes at work, you know? Operating those machines… it requires focus.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Ms. Hughston. It sounds as though fatigue and the time of day play a significant role. The fact that it comes and goes is important as well. Now, to get a better understanding of your overall health picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My medical history… let me see. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. That was… must have been twenty years ago now. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my knees, which is why I walk with a slight limp. Other than that… not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I don’t take any regular medications, except for the occasional ibuprofen for the arthritis. My husband… well, he passed away a few years ago. He had… well, it was heart trouble.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Hughston. It sounds as though you've been through a difficult time. So, to summarize, you had your gallbladder removed about twenty years ago, you manage arthritis with occasional ibuprofen, and you experienced the loss of your husband a few years ago. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve always been able to take most medications without issue. Well… ibuprofen sometimes upsets my stomach a little, but nothing major. Just a bit of heartburn. Honestly, Doctor, I think that’s about it. I’ve always been a pretty simple case.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Hughston. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. Now, to get a better sense of the cognitive changes you've described, and to determine the best course of action, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It's a simple set of questions and tasks that will help us evaluate your memory, attention, and other mental functions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a test? Another test? I suppose… if you think it's necessary. I just… I'm not very good at tests, Doctor. Always have been terrible at remembering things under pressure. But… if it will help, then… yes, alright. Let’s get it over with. Just… be gentle, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Hughston. It’s a very simple assessment, and I will certainly be gentle. There is no pressure at all. It’s simply a way for me to gather some more information and determine the best course of action. We will take it at your pace, and I will explain everything as we go. Excellent. Let's start with something easy. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… let me see. It’s… it’s August, isn’t it? Yes, August… and… the second? Is it the second? I think it's the second. Yes, August 2nd. I think. Oh goodness, I hope I’m right.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. August 2nd is correct. It's very common to have difficulty recalling dates, and you were close. Now, could you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I… I always get confused about cities. Is it… is it New York? No… that can’t be right. It’s… is it Boston? Oh dear. I really can’t remember. It’s a big city, I know that much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. Don’t worry about it. It's okay if you don't remember. It seems we're having a bit of difficulty recalling some information, which is why we're doing this assessment. Now, let’s try something different. Can you repeat these three words for me after I say them?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. Three words… I think I can do that. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try my best. Please speak clearly, though, okay? My hearing isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. I will speak clearly. The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: Um… apple… table… and… um… oh dear. What was the last one? It started with a… a ‘p’? Apple, table… hmm. Was it… peach? No… penny? Is it penny? I’m so sorry. I just can’t seem to hold onto things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. You remembered apple and table correctly, and you were very close with penny. This is helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask a few more questions to assess your overall cognitive function. Please answer them to the best of your ability. The first question is: What year is it currently?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… the year… that’s… a tough one. Is it… is it 2023? No, that can't be right… It feels like it's been longer than that. Is it 2024? Oh, I'm so confused. I just… I can’t seem to keep track of time anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. You’re doing just fine. It sounds as though you're experiencing some challenges with short-term memory and orientation, which is why we're conducting this assessment. Based on the results of this brief cognitive assessment, I believe it would be prudent to order some further testing to investigate the cause of these cognitive changes. Specifically, I would like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid function test, and a vitamin B12 level. Additionally, I recommend a structural brain scan, such as an MRI, to rule out any underlying neurological issues. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… more tests? A brain scan? That sounds… rather serious. Is it… is it something bad? I just… I don't like tests, Doctor. They always make me anxious. But… if you think it’s necessary, then… yes, alright. But please… please explain everything to me afterwards, okay? I don’t want to be left in the dark.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Hughston, and I assure you, we are taking these steps as a precaution. While these tests are more involved, they will help us determine the underlying cause of these cognitive changes and develop an appropriate treatment plan, if necessary. It doesn't necessarily mean there is something serious wrong. Many factors can contribute to cognitive changes, and we want to rule out all possibilities. I will explain everything to you in detail after the tests are completed, and I will be here to answer any questions you may have. We will take it one step at a time. Now, let’s discuss the logistics of these tests. I’ll have my nurse schedule the bloodwork for you at the lab down the hall. As for the MRI, we can schedule that for next week at the imaging center across town. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Okay… next week for the MRI… that sounds alright. As long as it’s not too early in the morning. My brain doesn’t work very well early in the morning. And… the bloodwork… can I eat beforehand? I always feel faint if I don’t eat. And… will it hurt? I don't like needles, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Hughston. We will schedule the MRI for a time that’s comfortable for you – perhaps mid-morning. And yes, you can definitely eat something beforehand; in fact, I recommend it. As for the bloodwork, it will be a quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. You’ll feel a small pinch, but it’s usually over very quickly. My nurse will provide you with detailed instructions before the procedure to ensure your comfort. Now, as we await the results of these tests, I’d like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that may help improve your cognitive function. These include regular exercise, a healthy diet, and engaging in mentally stimulating activities, such as puzzles or reading. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. Exercise… I suppose I could try to walk more. And a healthy diet… I do try to eat my vegetables. And puzzles… I used to do crosswords with my husband. It’s just… sometimes I get so tired, you know? It’s hard to motivate myself. But… yes, I’ll try. Anything to help.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Hughston. That’s a wonderful attitude. Remember, small steps can make a big difference. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you’re feeling overwhelmed or need support. Now, before you leave, do you have any other questions or concerns that I can address?
PATIENT: Um… well, one thing… the drug test. Will I get the results of that test as well? I just… I need to know if I’m going to lose my job. And… will the results of these tests affect my driving? I take the bus mostly, but… sometimes I drive my niece to her appointments.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Hughston. Yes, you will absolutely receive the results of the drug test. We’ll have those available shortly, and I’ll be happy to discuss them with you. Regarding your driving, we’ll need to review the results of these cognitive assessments before making any recommendations. However, I want to assure you that we will prioritize your safety and the safety of others. If there are any concerns, we will discuss alternative transportation options. In the meantime, please don’t worry unnecessarily. We’re taking these steps to gather information and develop a comprehensive plan to address your concerns. Now, my nurse will come in shortly to schedule the bloodwork and provide you with written instructions. Do you have any further questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better, even though I’m still a bit anxious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. It’s my pleasure to help. Please remember that I’m here for you, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. It was a pleasure meeting you today. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results of the tests with you soon.
