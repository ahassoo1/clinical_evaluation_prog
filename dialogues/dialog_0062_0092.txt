DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Doctor… DeCosta, you say? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… the breathing. It’s been getting harder. And my mouth feels like the desert, you know? Like I haven’t had a drop of water all day. Eyes too. Dry as… well, you get it. It just… happened. I don't know why it happened.
DOCTOR: Okay, harder breathing and a very dry mouth and eyes... and it came on suddenly, you said?
PATIENT: Suddenly? Not… exactly suddenly. It’s been a few weeks, maybe? I lose track. Old man problems, you know? Everything blurs together. It's just… worse now. Definitely worse. I used to be able to… do things. Now, just walking to the mailbox… oof. It's a struggle.
DOCTOR: I understand, things can definitely blur together. A few weeks of gradually worsening breathing and dryness… and it’s impacting your daily activities, like walking to the mailbox. Okay. Let's try to get a better picture of what’s going on. First, tell me a little more about the breathing. Is it harder when you’re exerting yourself, like walking?
PATIENT: Yes! That's what I just said! When I do things. Walking, mostly. Even just… standing too long. Sitting is okay, usually. But… you know, things. It feels like… there's not enough air. Like I'm sucking through a tiny straw. And it makes me… tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exertion-related, and makes you feel very tired. Do you notice any wheezing or whistling sound when you breathe, even when you're not doing much?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Whistling? I don't… I don't know what that sounds like. I've never… listened to myself breathe, you know? I just… breathe. If it makes a noise, I haven’t noticed. I'm an old man, not a… a music machine!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright! No need to worry about knowing medical terms. Let me listen to your lungs then, that will help me figure things out. Could you sit up straight for me, please?
PATIENT: Sit up…? Oh. Yes. Straight. Like this? Be careful with that thing, now. Don’t poke me with it!
DOCTOR: Okay… deep breath in… and out… again… good. Alright. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished, a bit quieter than I’d expect. I also hear some slight crackling sounds, especially when you take a deep breath. Now, let’s check your oxygen levels with a quick pulse oximeter reading.
PATIENT: Crackling? What's crackling? Is something broken? And what’s that thing on my finger? Is it going to… shock me? I don't like things on my finger. It feels weird. Like a little… clip.
DOCTOR: No, nothing is broken! Crackling sounds can sometimes indicate fluid in the lungs, but we need to investigate further to know for sure. And this little clip on your finger—it’s a pulse oximeter—measures your oxygen level. It doesn’t shock you at all, it’s completely painless. Okay, your oxygen level is 90%. That's a little on the lower side. Normal is usually above 95%. Let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any past medical conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Never. I eat my Cuban food, it keeps me strong! Heart… I had a little… flutter, maybe thirty years ago. Doctor gave me some pills. Don't remember what they were. Stopped taking 'em after a while, felt fine. Lung… I smoked, you know. Back in the day. Everyone smoked. But I quit! A long time ago. Maybe forty years? I don’t… I just remember it was bad for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past history of a heart flutter, some pills you took for it a long time ago, and a history of smoking that you quit forty years ago. That’s helpful to know. Do you remember how much you smoked when you were smoking?
PATIENT: How much… oh, Lord. A pack a day. Maybe more. I don’t know! I was young, reckless. Didn't think about it. Cubans, you know? We live life! It's all blurry now. Lots of cigars, lots of cigarettes. Back then, everyone smoked. It wasn't a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a pack a day for many years. That's important information. And have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… cholesterol? What is that, some kind of food? Doctor always told me to watch my salt. Something about my pressure… being too high. I think. He gave me pills for that too. Little white ones, I think. I take a lot of pills, you know? I forget which ones are for what. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to keep track of everything. So, you've been on medication for high blood pressure at some point. Let's see… do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes with the dust, but that's just… dust! Everyone gets sniffly with dust. I ate some bad shrimp once, but that wasn't an allergy, just… bad shrimp. I don't think I'm allergic to anything important. I’m Cuban, we can eat anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, here it is. Lisinopril… something for my pressure. And… Metformin, the doctor said it was for… sugar? I think. And… a little blue pill for… well, you know. A man gets old, things stop working. I take those as needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're currently taking Lisinopril and Metformin, and a medication for erectile dysfunction as needed. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Do you have any family members, like parents or siblings, who have had heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family? Hmm… My mother, she died old. Very old. I think she had… something with her heart. A weakness, maybe. My father, he smoked too. Lots of cigars. He got… sick. Chest trouble, I think. My sister, she’s still alive. Healthy as a horse, that woman. Never smoked a day in her life! She always told me I was crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother, and smoking-related illness in your father. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social...? You mean... friends? I have a few old buddies, we play dominoes sometimes. Mostly, I keep to myself these days. Single, you know? Always been single. No kids. Just me and my memories. And my Cuban food!
DOCTOR: Okay, so you mostly keep to yourself, enjoy playing dominoes with friends, and you're single with no children. Alright Oreste, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Given your history of smoking, your current symptoms of shortness of breath, and the crackling sounds I heard in your lungs, I suspect you may have some chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, likely with an exacerbation. However, to confirm this, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test, which measures how well your lungs are working. Would you be able to get that done?
PATIENT: X-ray? Pulmonary… what? Look, I just want to be able to breathe again! All these tests… Do I have to? I don't like hospitals. They smell funny. And they poke you with things. Can’t you just give me some pills? Something to make it better?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Oreste. Hospitals aren’t pleasant, and I wouldn’t recommend tests if they weren’t important. But to know exactly what's causing your breathing problems and to make sure you get the right treatment, these tests are important. The chest X-ray will let us see if there’s any damage or fluid in your lungs, and the pulmonary function test will tell us how well your lungs are working. It will help me determine if it's COPD, or something else, and guide me on the best way to help you breathe easier. Without this information, I would be guessing, and I don’t want to do that. We can do the X-ray right here in the clinic, and the pulmonary function test can be done at the hospital, but it’s a quick, non-invasive procedure. We’ll schedule it for as soon as possible. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You win. I don’t like it, but… I want to breathe again. Fine. Do the tests. As soon as possible, you say? Get it over with. But if they poke me too much, I’m blaming you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I promise we’ll get it done as quickly as possible, and I’ll make sure they take good care of you and don’t poke you too much! I'll have my nurse schedule those tests for you right away. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler and a short course of steroids to help open up your airways and reduce any inflammation. These should give you some relief in the short term. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Inhaler...? Steroids...? Oh, Lord. Is that… those things athletes get in trouble for? I don't want to get in trouble! I just want to breathe, Doctor. Are those things safe? What do they do? And how do I use one of those… inhalers? I’ve never used one before.
DOCTOR: No, no, these are different steroids than what athletes use! These are given in a very small dose, and they help to reduce inflammation in your lungs, making it easier for you to breathe. They're very safe when used as prescribed. The inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs. It’s a little device that you puff into, and it opens up your airways. It can feel a little strange at first, but my nurse will show you exactly how to use it properly and make sure you're comfortable. She'll demonstrate the technique and let you practice. It’s very important you follow the instructions carefully and use it as prescribed. Do you have any concerns about using the inhaler or taking the steroids?
PATIENT: Well, I don't like taking pills. Or puffing things into my lungs. But… if it helps me breathe, I guess I’ll try it. Just… explain it slowly, okay? And make sure your nurse is patient. I’m an old man, I don’t learn things quickly anymore. What if it doesn't work? What then?
DOCTOR: Of course, I understand. We'll take it one step at a time. My nurse is very patient and will walk you through everything slowly and carefully. She'll make sure you feel comfortable using the inhaler before you leave. If the inhaler and steroids don't provide enough relief, or your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider other options, like pulmonary rehabilitation—which is a program of exercises and education to help improve your lung function—or even oxygen therapy, if your oxygen levels are consistently low. But let’s start with the inhaler and steroids and see how you respond. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oxygen therapy? That sounds… serious. Like I'm going to need a tank of air strapped to my back! No… I think that’s enough questions for now. Just… get me the inhaler. And send your patient nurse. I want to go home.
DOCTOR: Alright Oreste, I understand. We'll take it one step at a time, and we'll do everything we can to help you breathe easier. I'll send my nurse in right away with the inhaler and to go over everything with you. And just so you know, oxygen therapy is not necessarily a tank strapped to your back. It can be used in different ways, depending on your needs. But let’s not worry about that right now. I'll see you soon, and remember, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms—like severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever—please go to the emergency room immediately. .
PATIENT: .
