DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. My name is Dr. Andraca, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I hear you can... find out where people come from. Like, a long, long time ago? My family, we always from the islands, but... I wanna know more. My grandkids, they askin' questions, and... I don't know the answers. I want to know where we come from, before the islands. Is that what you do?
DOCTOR: That’s a wonderful question, Mr. Scobie, and a very important one. It sounds like you’re interested in learning about your ancestry – your family’s history before coming to the islands. While I am a medical doctor, and focus on your health now, I understand what you're asking. Unfortunately, I don’t personally specialize in genealogical research or ancestry tracing. That's a field all its own! However, I can certainly help point you in the right direction. It’s very common for people to want to know more about their roots. Before we discuss resources, though, could you tell me a little bit more about your health?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. I thought... well, I heard things. Sorry. My grandkids, they good with the computer and stuff, said you could do this with just a little bit of spit or something. Health... Hmm. I'm okay, I guess. Old, but okay. Medicare takes care of what I need. No big problems. Just... tired sometimes, you know? Like any old man. Is this... important? For the spit test? You need to know if I’m sick or something?
DOCTOR: No, please don't apologize at all! It's perfectly understandable to hear things, and there are genetic tests available now that can sometimes provide information about ancestry – those are the tests that use a saliva sample. Those are completely separate from the medical tests we do here to check your health. I apologize for the confusion. And yes, it's important to know a little about your overall health before considering any kind of testing, even those for ancestry. It helps us understand if the results would be meaningful and safe for you. You mentioned being tired sometimes. Could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I was worryin' I was botherin’ you. Tired... well, just... old tired, I think. Gets worse in the afternoons. I sit and carve my wood, and sometimes I just... doze off. Not sick tired, just… sleepy. I eat okay, sleep okay, but I wake up feelin' like I didn't sleep at all. Happens most days. No pain, no nothin'. Just... tired. Like a battery runnin' low. Does that make sense? I don't get out much, either. Mostly just stay home with my wood.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like you’re experiencing fatigue, and it's good you can describe it so clearly. The fact that it’s worse in the afternoons and doesn't seem to be related to pain is helpful. It’s also good to know you’re eating and sleeping reasonably well. We should do a quick physical exam and check some basic things to rule out any underlying medical causes for the fatigue. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. If you think it's a good idea. I don't mind. I trust you. I just... wanna know if I need to worry about somethin'. And if I'm good, then maybe we can talk about that spit test for the ancestors again? My grandkids would be real happy.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Scobie. I appreciate your trust. We'll definitely take a look. And yes, we can absolutely revisit the ancestry testing after we’ve had a chance to assess your overall health. Okay, let’s start with some basic vitals – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. After that, we can talk a little bit about your medical history – any past illnesses or surgeries you’ve had, medications you’re taking, and any allergies you have. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need. I don’t remember much about my old illnesses, to be honest. I was a boy a long time ago. But I’ll try my best to tell you. And I don’t take no pills, except for somethin’ for my bones, the doctor gave me a while back. And I ain't allergic to nothin' I know of. Just… old. Like I said. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could sit up on the table for me, that would be great. And don’t worry about not remembering everything – we’ll take our time. First, let’s just get your blood pressure. It’s a simple cuff around your arm. Alright, just relax your arm for me… that’s good. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so for your age. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6, which is normal. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. I’m going to use the stethoscope to listen to these areas. Just breathe normally for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm relaxin'. I used to climb coconuts when I was young, maybe that's why my blood pressure is high! Used to be real strong. Alright. Just tell me if you need me to do anything. I don’t feel no pain or nothin'. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, everything sounds clear in your lungs. I’m hearing a slight murmur in your heart, but that’s not uncommon at your age and doesn’t seem to be causing any problems. It’s something we’ll keep an eye on, though. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say “ahhh” for me. Everything looks clear in your ears and throat as well. No signs of infection or inflammation. Now, you mentioned taking something for your bones. Do you remember the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. The doctor, he gave it to me a couple of years ago. Small white pill. I think... I think it was… something with a 'B' in it? Boniva? Or something like that? I forget. I just take it every month. And the Medicare pays for it, so that’s good. I can bring the bottle next time if you want. I keep it in the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Boniva, excellent. That's a bisphosphonate, used to treat osteoporosis. That makes sense. It’s good you’re consistent with taking it. We'll want to keep track of that as well. Now, regarding your family history, have there been any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses... Hmm. My mama, she got real sick when I was young. But I don't know what it was. She just… faded away. And my papa, he had trouble breathin' when he got old, like he was coughin' all the time. Maybe his lungs? But that was a long time ago. We didn't have doctors like you back then. Just… old people gettin' old. I don't know nothin' about my grandparents or nothin'. They was on the islands. We didn't talk about things like that. Just… lived.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Scobie. It's common for family medical history to be limited, especially when people come from different places or didn’t have access to healthcare. You mentioned your mother getting sick. Do you recall anything about how she got sick, or how long she was ill?
PATIENT: Hmm... She just got weaker and weaker. Started with a cough, I think. And then she couldn't eat anymore. She was sick for... a long time. Maybe a year? Or more? I was just a little boy, so I don't remember much. She was a real good mama, though. Always smilin'. We lived on the beach, and she used to sing songs. That's what I remember most. It wasn't quick, like. She just… faded away. Like the sun settin'. That's the best way to describe it. Sorry, I ain't much help. I wish I could tell you more.
DOCTOR: You are helping me tremendously, Mr. Scobie. It sounds like your mother had a long illness. And it's perfectly alright that you don't remember all the details. You’ve shared what you do remember, and that’s very valuable. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I don't drink. Not for me. Always made me feel sick. I drink coconut water, though. That's good for you. And I eat fish. Lots of fish. We always eat fish on the islands. Best food in the world. And I carve my wood. That's my hobby. Keeps my hands busy. And my mind. Keeps me from gettin' too sleepy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Scobie. A healthy diet, regular activity, and a fulfilling hobby – those are all excellent for your well-being. Okay, let's recap everything. You're an 85-year-old male, generally healthy, experiencing fatigue, which seems to worsen in the afternoons. You have a slight murmur in your heart, which is not uncommon for your age. You take Boniva for osteoporosis and have a history of a mother who had a prolonged illness. You don’t smoke or drink alcohol, and you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Based on this information, and your physical exam, I don't think there is anything immediately concerning. However, fatigue can have many causes, even if they’re not serious. I’d like to order a few basic blood tests to rule out things like anemia, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. If you think it's a good idea, then I trust you. I don't want no surprises. And I want to get back to my wood carvin' soon. Maybe we can talk about that spit test after the blood tests? My grandkids will be real happy. They been askin' all week.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Scobie. I completely understand. We’ll get those blood tests ordered right away. They’re very straightforward – just a small sample of blood. The results should be back in a few days. We’ll give you a call as soon as they are. And yes, absolutely. Once we have the results of the blood tests, we can definitely discuss the ancestry testing options and see if that’s something that would be appropriate for you. I can even provide you with some resources for companies that offer those services. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or if your fatigue gets significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you covered everything. You been real patient with an old man like me. I appreciate it. Just... thank you. I guess I'll go home and carve some wood now. And wait for the phone to ring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take your time getting up. And please, enjoy your wood carving! My nurse will be in shortly to give you the lab requisition and instructions for the blood tests. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Scobie.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
