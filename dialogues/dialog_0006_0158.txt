DOCTOR: Right, Deloris Wrye… 44 years old. Hello there. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, it’s about a… a letter. For a pet, you see. I need a letter saying I’m allowed to have a pet. Some place needs it. Honestly, the whole thing is ridiculous, but here we are. It’s… for housing, I think? Or something like that. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet. Housing related, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Some… complex application. They require a letter from a doctor saying I’m… stable enough to care for an animal. It’s just… silly, isn’t it? I’ve had pets before, perfectly good pets. Never a problem. But they're being very particular this time. A very modern building, you understand. Lots of rules.
DOCTOR: Right… stability to care for an animal. I see. So, they're questioning your ability to… responsibly own a pet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not questioning exactly. More like… covering themselves. It’s a very… upscale place. I just need the letter to tick a box, that’s all. A formality, really. Though a rather insulting one, if you ask me. I've always been a responsible person. Perfectly capable. It’s just… paperwork, isn’t it? Dreadful paperwork. Do you need to examine me or something?
DOCTOR: No, no, nothing like that. It's just… to fulfill the request properly, I need to understand the context a little better. Have you experienced any changes recently – in your health, your living situation, anything like that – that might prompt them to ask for this letter?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. Well, I did get divorced, not too long ago. About… a year and a half, perhaps? Two years. It’s all a bit muddled. And I moved, yes. To this new apartment. That’s probably it. It's… smaller than my old place, but perfectly nice. Honestly, I think they just want to make sure I'm not going to fill the building with a whole zoo. Really, the audacity! They should be grateful I'm even considering adding some life to the place.
DOCTOR: A divorce and a move… both significant life changes. And you’re looking to adopt a pet now?
PATIENT: Adopt? No, no. Not adopt. I already have the pet. A cat. A lovely tabby. His name is… Clarence, I think. Or is it Cecil? Oh dear. It’s terribly embarrassing, but I’m dreadful with names. Anyway, they need the letter before they’ll let me officially register him as a resident. It's all rather… bureaucratic. Honestly, I feel like they’re treating me like a child.
DOCTOR: So, you already have Clarence – or Cecil – and they require a letter to register him as a resident. Okay. Just to be thorough, and to document everything properly… have you been feeling any increased stress or anxiety since the divorce and move?
PATIENT: Stress? Well, who hasn't? Divorce is… upsetting. Moving is a hassle. It's not like I'm falling apart, if that’s what you're asking. I manage. Perfectly well, actually. I have my routines, you see. And Clarence – or Cecil, whichever one he is – is very comforting. But I wouldn’t say no stress. It’s just… life. Really, I just want to get this letter and be done with it. Is this going to take long? I have a hair appointment later. A very important hair appointment.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Just routine questions. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Sometimes good, sometimes not. You know how it is. And appetite… I eat. I like food. I wouldn't say anything is drastically different. Perhaps I've been having a bit more tea lately. Calming, you see. Chamomile mostly. Look, is all this really necessary for a letter? I feel like I'm giving you my life story just so I can have a cat officially registered. It’s quite ridiculous, really. Clarence is a perfectly well-behaved cat! He doesn't bother anyone.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does seem a bit… excessive for a simple letter. Just one final question, and then we can wrap this up. Have you been experiencing any feelings of sadness or hopelessness lately?
PATIENT: Hopelessness? Heavens, no! I mean, divorce was difficult. But I'm perfectly fine now. A bit… lonely, perhaps. But hopeless? No. I have my routines, my hair appointments, and Clarence – or Cecil, honestly I'm starting to doubt everything I know. Look, can we just… write the letter? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of caring for a cat. It's a cat! A small, fluffy creature. Not a wild rhinoceros. Is there a form I need to fill out or something?
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like you’ve been through some adjustments, but are managing well. To cover everything, and for the record, I’ll document that you’ve experienced recent life changes – divorce and a move – and are now establishing a new routine. And that you are capable of providing adequate care for your feline companion. I'm happy to write the letter stating that you appear stable and capable of responsible pet ownership. Is there anything specific you'd like me to include?
PATIENT: Oh, good! Yes, please. Could you mention that Clarence - definitely Clarence, I'm quite sure now - is a very well-behaved cat. And that he's fully vaccinated. That might impress them. And perhaps say something about the emotional benefits of pet ownership? It’s very good for the soul, you know. Really, it's a testament to my stability that I even have a cat after everything. It shows resilience. Yes, resilience! Mention that. And please, please, just make it sound official. They’re very… particular people.
DOCTOR: Okay, I've got that. "Ms. Wrye presents as stable and capable of providing responsible care for her feline companion, Clarence, who is reported to be fully vaccinated. Ms. Wrye demonstrates resilience in establishing a new routine following recent life changes, and recognizes the emotional benefits of pet ownership…" Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s perfect! Absolutely perfect. Resilience… lovely word. Yes, that will do nicely. Thank you. Now, how long will it take to get the letter? I really need to get this sorted before my hair appointment. It's a very important appointment, you understand. And they don't take cancellations kindly. Is there a fee for this letter? I suppose there is. Everything has a fee these days.
DOCTOR: Here you go. It’s dated today, August 2nd, 2025. As for the fee, it will be $25. Standard office visit charge for documentation. It's a bit bureaucratic, I admit, but hopefully this will get everything sorted for you and Clarence. And enjoy your hair appointment! Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Twenty-five dollars… perfectly reasonable, I suppose. Thank you so much, Doctor. You've been very helpful, despite the… excessive questioning. Yes, this looks official enough. They should be happy with this. No, no other questions. Just… thank you. And yes, I will enjoy my hair appointment. It’s a much-needed treat. Good day to you, Doctor. And thank you again for the letter. And for tolerating my… vagueness. It's a blessing and a curse, you understand.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. Glad I could help. Enjoy your appointment, and give Clarence a pat for me. Have a good day.
