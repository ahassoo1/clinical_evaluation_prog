DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fogelstrom. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um, it's… the belching. I keep belching. It’s been happening for, I think, maybe a week now? Not all the time, but… a lot. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Belching, alright. A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. A week, maybe a little more. It doesn’t hurt, it just… happens. Especially after I eat. Or sometimes, even when I’m not eating. It's just… air, I guess? Like bubbles coming up. Do you… understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fogelstrom, I understand what belching is. It’s the expulsion of gas from the stomach. We need to determine why you’re experiencing excessive gas. Let's start with your diet. What have you been eating lately?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay, good. I was worried I was explaining it wrong. Um… let me think. Yesterday I had… chicken and rice for lunch. And a banana. Dinner was… pasta with some tomato sauce. And a salad. I usually eat pretty normal things, you know? Nothing fancy. I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: “Pretty normal.” That's… not very helpful, Ms. Fogelstrom. Be specific. What kind of pasta?
PATIENT: Oh! Sorry. Um… spaghetti. With… store-bought sauce. You know, the kind in a jar? Red sauce. And I had a little bit of cheese on top. Parmesan, I think. Is that… better? I don't usually cook a lot. It's easier to just… make something quick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you consume carbonated beverages at all?
PATIENT: Carbonated…? You mean like… soda? Sometimes. Not every day, maybe two or three times a week. I like… Sprite, sometimes. Or ginger ale if my stomach feels bad. But not a lot. Really. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's contributing, Ms. Fogelstrom. Those introduce gas into your system. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. My stomach sometimes feels a little… full, after I eat. But I usually just loosen my belt a little. And sometimes I feel a little tired, but I always feel a little tired. Is that… is that a symptom? I don't know. Nothing bad, really. Just… normal things.
DOCTOR: "Normal things" continue to be unhelpful, Ms. Fogelstrom. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – anything at all – in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I don’t really go to the doctor much. I usually just try to… feel better on my own. I don’t have insurance, so… it’s expensive.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. I… I don’t like hospitals. They make me nervous. Everything just… smells so bad. And people are sick. I prefer to stay home, if I can. Is that okay? I know you're asking questions, but it's just… a little stressful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fogelstrom, answering my questions is necessary for me to assess your condition. Now, family history. Are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh! Family… Hmm. My grandmother had… I think it was diabetes. And my uncle… he had problems with his stomach, I think. He was always complaining about it. But that’s it, really. Everyone else is pretty healthy, I think. Or at least, they don’t talk about being sick much. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: And your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? You mean like… what I do? I work at the factory, I make… parts for cars. It's… a lot of standing. And I come home and I cook, or I watch TV. I don’t really… go out much. Just quiet at home. Is that what you mean? It’s not very exciting, I know.
DOCTOR: Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No! No, I don’t smoke. Never have. It’s bad for you. My mother always said so. And it smells awful. I don’t even like being around people who smoke. It makes me cough. Does that… is that a good thing?
DOCTOR: Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A little bit of wine, with dinner. Maybe one or two glasses, a couple of times a week. Not very much. Just to relax. It helps me unwind after work. Is that… bad? I don't get drunk or anything. Really. Just a little sip.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, really. And I haven’t taken any medicine in a long time. Just… pain relievers sometimes, for a headache. But nothing special. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t get sick much. Except for this belching, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s do a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. Is it going to hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: No, it won’t hurt, Ms. Fogelstrom. Just a simple listen with the stethoscope. Normal bowel sounds, though slightly hyperactive. No bruits or murmurs detected. Soft, non-tender to palpation. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Tympanic throughout. No obvious masses or organomegaly. Overall, your abdomen is unremarkable. Now, if you could sit up for me?
PATIENT: Okay. It didn't hurt. That's good. So… what does that mean? Is something wrong? Is it serious? I get worried easily. Especially when I don’t know what's happening.
DOCTOR: Based on the limited information and the physical exam, it appears you're likely experiencing functional bloating and excessive gas, possibly related to your diet and lifestyle. The hyperactive bowel sounds suggest increased gastrointestinal motility. It's rarely serious, Ms. Fogelstrom. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver and kidney function. We will also check for Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial infection that can cause bloating.
PATIENT: Okay… blood tests. That sounds… expensive. I don’t have insurance, remember? Can we… can we do just one test? Maybe the cheapest one? I really don’t want to get into a lot of debt over this belching. It’s just… embarrassing, not life-threatening.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fogelstrom, I understand your financial concerns. However, it is irresponsible to diagnose and treat without appropriate workup. A complete blood count is relatively inexpensive and provides a baseline assessment. I can order that. We can discuss further testing if the CBC is abnormal. I will also provide you with a list of dietary modifications – avoiding carbonated beverages, limiting gas-producing foods like beans and broccoli, and eating smaller, more frequent meals. I strongly advise you to follow these recommendations. If your symptoms worsen or persist despite these changes, you must follow up with me or consider a referral to a gastroenterologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. A blood test, and… no soda, and… smaller meals. Can you… can you write down the foods I should avoid? I’m not very good at remembering things. And… how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: Here you are. This list details common gas-producing foods and dietary recommendations. The lab results typically take 3-5 business days. You can check the results online using this portal number. I will also send a copy of the results to your email address, if you have one. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Yes. What if… what if the results are bad? What if it’s something serious? Will you… will you tell me what it is? Even if it’s scary? I don't want to be surprised, you know? And… will it be expensive to fix?
DOCTOR: Ms. Fogelstrom, I understand your anxieties. If the results are abnormal, I will explain them to you in detail, and we will discuss the appropriate course of action. We will explore all available options, including referrals to specialists if necessary. Regarding cost, that depends entirely on the diagnosis. I can provide you with resources for financial assistance programs and help you navigate the costs. However, at this stage, it is premature to speculate. Let's focus on the blood test for now and address any further concerns after we have the results. Do you have any questions about the blood draw process itself?
PATIENT: No, I think I’m okay with the blood draw. It’s just… the waiting. And worrying. Okay. I’ll… I’ll go get the blood drawn. And I’ll try to avoid the soda. And eat smaller meals. Thank you, Doctor. .
