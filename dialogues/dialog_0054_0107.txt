DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It just…flutters. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing palpitations – that sensation of your heart racing or fluttering. That's a good reason to get it checked out. “Sometimes” is helpful, but can you tell me a little more about when these episodes happen?
PATIENT: Episodes? You mean when it happens? Okay. Um… not when I’m doing anything hard. Not running or lifting. Mostly… when I’m just sitting. Or maybe… after I eat? Sometimes after a big meal. Not every time, though. It's… random. Sorry, I don’t know if that makes sense. It just happens.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Puder. It’s helpful to know it’s not consistently linked to activity, and that it seems to occur sometimes after meals. “Random” is good information. About how long do these episodes last when they happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… not long. Maybe… a few seconds? Sometimes a minute, maybe? It’s hard to tell time when you’re worried. It starts, then… goes away. Not a long time, Doctor. It’s not like… all day, or anything. Just… little bursts. Is that… right, “bursts”?
DOCTOR: “Bursts” is a perfectly good way to describe it. And a few seconds to a minute is helpful. Do you notice anything else happening during these episodes?
PATIENT: Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little… dizzy? Not fall-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And maybe a little… short of breath? Like I can't get a full breath. But it goes away when the heart stops doing the funny thing. And… no pain, if that's what you’re asking. No chest pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – no chest pain is reassuring. Lightheadedness and shortness of breath alongside the palpitations are important things to note. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these episodes, besides eating?
PATIENT: Trigger? Like… something that makes it happen? Hmm… I don’t think so. I really haven't noticed. Maybe… if I’m really stressed? My wife and I… we have a shop, and sometimes it’s busy. Maybe when it's very busy. But even when it’s calm, it still happens sometimes. I don’t know. It's just… random. I keep saying that, sorry. It's very confusing.
DOCTOR: You're not repeating yourself, Mr. Puder, it's helpful for me to hear what you’re experiencing, even if it feels “random”. Stress can definitely be a factor, and it's good you mentioned that. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I’ve never been sick, really. Just… little colds sometimes. I’ve never seen a doctor much. My wife, she worries more than I do. I’m usually okay. Never been told I have pressure or… sugar problems. No, nothing like that. I hope that’s good.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And it's okay that you haven’t seen a doctor much – plenty of people are healthy and don’t require frequent visits. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been in the hospital. Never had surgery. I cut my finger once, bad, at the shop, but my wife fixed it. Just a bandage, that’s all. Nothing big. I’m a lucky man, I think. Not much trouble, usually. Just this… heart thing now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any heart conditions or sudden unexplained deaths at a young age?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had… problems with his legs. Like… they would swell up. But not heart problems, I don't think. He died old, in his sleep. My mother, she was healthy, I think. Never been sick. My brother… he’s fine, works at a bank. No heart problems that I know of. My grandparents… they died a long time ago. I don’t remember much about their health, sorry. Nothing that I can think of, Doctor. Not heart trouble, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't like smoking. My wife doesn’t like it either. Makes me cough just thinking about it. Never touched it, no. Clean living, I hope. Well, except for the heart thing, but that’s not my fault!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. With dinner, maybe? A little glass of wine, sometimes. Not every night. And not a lot. My wife likes wine, so I have some too. But I don't drink… to forget, or anything. Just with food, sometimes. Not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't like taking pills. My wife, she takes a vitamin for her bones, but I don't take anything. Just… healthy food, I try. And I drink water. That’s it. No pills, no powders, nothing. Just this heart… problem. I wish I knew what was causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Puder, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… tell me if you find anything wrong, okay? I'm a little worried, but I’m trying to be brave. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Puder. I'll do my best. I’ll explain everything as I go. Let's start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is a little elevated, but not critically high. Your heart rate is currently 78 beats per minute, and rhythm is regular. I’m listening to your lungs now… they sound clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. I'm palpating your pulse now, feels regular and strong. I’m listening very carefully and I do hear a very faint, occasional extra beat, but it's not consistent. I will document this as an "occasional premature atrial contraction.” Do you feel any pain or discomfort as I do this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. No discomfort. I don’t feel anything. You’re very gentle. What is… “occasional premature atrial contraction”? Is that… bad? Is that why my heart feels funny? Is that what’s causing the fluttering? Is it serious? Sorry, I'm getting worried now. I don’t like hearing words I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly okay to be worried, Mr. Puder, and it's good that you're asking questions. “Premature atrial contraction” is just a fancy term for an extra heartbeat that happens sometimes. It’s very common, and often harmless. Think of your heart like a well-coordinated team. Sometimes, one member jumps the gun a little early, that's a premature beat. It's not usually a serious problem, especially if it's occasional, like in your case. It could be contributing to the fluttering sensation you’re feeling, but we need to investigate further to rule out other potential causes. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order an EKG, or electrocardiogram. This is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless and non-invasive. We can also do a basic blood test to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: EKG… is that the thing with the stickers? My wife, she had one once. Is it… uncomfortable? And blood test… I don’t like needles. But… if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. I want to know what’s wrong, so I can stop worrying. Is it expensive? I don't have… insurance. My wife works hard, but… we don't have much extra money. Will it cost a lot?
DOCTOR: Yes, the EKG involves placing a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It’s completely painless, just a little cool to the touch. And you're right, it can be a bit uncomfortable for some people, but it’s very quick. As for the blood test, I understand your concern about needles. We can make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll also do our best to minimize the cost. Because you don’t have insurance, we can discuss options for reducing the expense, such as requesting the most basic tests first, or seeing if there are any local programs that can assist with the cost. Let me check the approximate cost for an EKG and basic blood work. Give me one moment. Okay, an EKG will be approximately $100, and the basic blood work we're discussing would be around $75. So, approximately $175 total. We can also explore options at a local lab that may have a lower cost. If these costs are a concern, we can prioritize the EKG first, as it gives us the most information about your heart’s rhythm. We can always add the blood work later if needed. What do you think?
PATIENT: $175… That’s… a lot. But… I want to know what’s wrong, so I guess I can do it. Let’s do the EKG first, like you said. And… if we have to, we can talk about the blood test later. Is it okay if my wife comes with me when I do the EKG? I get nervous when I’m alone. And… can you explain what the results mean, if it’s… bad news? I don't want to be surprised. I need to know everything, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Puder. Your wife is more than welcome to be with you during the EKG. Having support is a wonderful thing, and I encourage it. And of course, I will explain the results to you thoroughly, in plain language, regardless of what they may be. I won’t leave you wondering or surprised. I’ll walk you through everything, discuss any potential concerns, and outline a plan of action, if necessary. My goal is to make sure you understand everything completely and feel comfortable with any decisions we make together. Let’s go ahead and get the EKG scheduled. The technician is available now, if you’re ready. We'll go to the room down the hall. It will only take about 15 minutes, and then we can review the results together. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds good. Let’s do it. 15 minutes… I can handle 15 minutes. And… thank you. For explaining everything and… not making me feel stupid when I ask questions. My wife will be happy to hear we can do it today. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Puder. I'm glad I could help. And please, never hesitate to ask questions. That's what I'm here for. Let's go ahead and get you comfortable, and we'll take it from there.
