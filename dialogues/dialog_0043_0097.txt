DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here that you are 44 years of age. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though I must say, these waiting rooms are rarely…stimulating. I am here because my husband and I have been discussing…planning for the inevitable. He suggested I come and inquire about one of those forms – an Advance Directive, I believe he called it, or perhaps a POLST form. Something to ensure my wishes are known, should…circumstances arise. It's a rather morbid topic, but one must be practical, don’t you agree?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Chilla. It is a practical topic, and a very thoughtful one at that. It's much better to have these conversations before a crisis occurs, and I commend you both for addressing this now. An Advance Directive and a POLST form are both excellent options. Let me explain the difference, and then we can determine which might be the best fit for you. An Advance Directive – sometimes called a living will – outlines your wishes for medical care in general, should you become unable to speak for yourself. A POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific document, typically used for individuals with serious illness or frailty, and it translates your wishes into medical orders. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I assure you, my health is… satisfactory. I maintain a relatively active lifestyle, though city living does not always permit the exercise one desires. I’ve always been quite… robust, if you will. No chronic illnesses to speak of, thankfully. I do occasionally suffer from migraines, but those are easily managed. My husband tends to worry unduly, of course. He's the anxious type. But generally, I consider myself to be in good health. However, I must confess, I find this line of questioning rather… unnecessary. I am here for a form, not a medical examination. Surely, the details of my current well-being are hardly relevant. Unless, of course, you intend to delay this process with extraneous inquiries?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Ms. Chilla, and I apologize if my questions feel extraneous. It’s not my intention to delay the process or to imply that a full medical examination is required. However, even when completing an Advance Directive or POLST form, it’s important to have a basic understanding of your current health status. This ensures the document accurately reflects your wishes, and that there are no underlying conditions that might influence those wishes. For example, knowing about the frequency and severity of your migraines would be helpful. Are they debilitating, or more of a nuisance?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, are we truly to dissect the intricacies of my migraine history before addressing the matter at hand? They are… inconvenient, yes. Occasionally debilitating, but hardly a condition that warrants this level of scrutiny. I take medication, they subside. It’s a simple equation. I came seeking a document to ensure my preferences are respected, should I become… incapacitated. Not to recount a litany of minor ailments. I fail to see the correlation. Perhaps you could simply explain the forms in greater detail, and I can determine which is best suited to my needs? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of making an informed decision without a comprehensive medical assessment.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Chilla, and I sincerely apologize for pressing the issue. I was attempting to be thorough, but I should have been more sensitive to your preferences. Let me assure you, completing these forms is entirely your decision, and I want to ensure you feel comfortable and empowered throughout the process. Let’s focus on explaining the options. As I mentioned earlier, an Advance Directive outlines your wishes for medical care in general, should you be unable to communicate them yourself. This can include things like whether or not you want life-sustaining treatments, such as ventilation or feeding tubes. A POLST form, on the other hand, is a medical order that specifies which treatments you want or don’t want, and it’s typically used for individuals with a serious illness or frailty. It's more immediate and action-oriented. Do either of those descriptions resonate with you more than the other, or would you like me to elaborate further?
PATIENT: The Advance Directive sounds… less intrusive, shall we say? A broader statement of intent, rather than a specific list of prohibitions. I confess, the idea of outlining every conceivable medical scenario feels rather… morbid and unnecessarily detailed. My husband seems to favor the POLST form, naturally. He’s always been one for precise instructions. But I believe a general directive would be more suitable for my… temperament. However, I would like to understand the implications of choosing one over the other. What, precisely, are the legal ramifications? And what recourse do I have if my wishes are… disregarded? I trust my family, of course, but one can never be too cautious.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Ms. Chilla. It sounds like an Advance Directive would be a better fit for your preferences. Let’s discuss the legal ramifications and what recourse you have. An Advance Directive is legally binding in most states, including this one. However, it’s important to understand that it’s not a guarantee. Healthcare providers are legally obligated to follow your wishes as expressed in the document, but there can be situations where it’s difficult to interpret or apply. To minimize the risk of misinterpretation, it’s important to be as clear and specific as possible when outlining your wishes. You can also designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you are unable to do so yourself. That person will be responsible for ensuring your wishes are honored. As for recourse, if your wishes are disregarded, your healthcare proxy can advocate on your behalf. If that’s not sufficient, you may have legal options, such as filing a complaint with the state medical board or pursuing legal action. However, those options can be time-consuming and expensive. Do you have a healthcare proxy in mind, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My husband, of course. He is… exceedingly organized and detail-oriented, as I mentioned. Though, occasionally, his… enthusiasm can be overwhelming. But he is unwavering in his devotion, and he understands my preferences implicitly. However, I am somewhat hesitant to grant him absolute authority. He can be rather… insistent. Is it possible to include specific caveats within the directive? Perhaps outlining situations where his judgment might not align with my own wishes? I understand this may sound… unconventional, but I believe it’s prudent to anticipate potential disagreements. I wouldn't want him to… overstep, shall we say.
DOCTOR: That’s a very astute concern, Ms. Chilla, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to include specific caveats within the directive. It’s your document, and it’s important that it reflects your wishes accurately, even if that means anticipating potential disagreements with your healthcare proxy. Yes, it is absolutely possible to include limitations and specific caveats. For example, you can specify situations where you want a second opinion, or you can outline certain treatments that you absolutely do not want, regardless of your husband’s preferences. You can also specify a process for resolving disputes, such as mediation or arbitration. We can tailor the document to your specific needs and concerns. Would you like me to provide you with a sample form, or would you prefer to discuss your wishes in more detail and have me draft a customized version for you?
PATIENT: A customized version would be… preferable, I believe. A sample form may not adequately capture the… nuances of my preferences. I would appreciate your guidance in drafting a document that is both comprehensive and specific. I suppose we should begin with the treatments I would absolutely refuse. I have no desire to be kept alive artificially, should my condition be… irreversible. No ventilation, no feeding tubes, no resuscitation efforts. I believe in allowing nature to take its course, within reason. And I would like to explicitly state my aversion to any form of prolonged suffering. Is that sufficiently clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly clear, Ms. Chilla. We will document your wishes regarding ventilation, feeding tubes, and resuscitation efforts, as well as your aversion to prolonged suffering. That's an excellent starting point. To be precise, we'll use language such as "no mechanical ventilation," "no artificial nutrition or hydration," and "do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation." We can also add a clause about comfort care and pain management, ensuring that you receive appropriate palliative care. Now, are there any specific medical conditions that you would like to address in the directive?
PATIENT: Well… my husband mentioned something about… dementia. He's been increasingly concerned about it, given his mother's recent decline. He insists I include provisions regarding end-of-life care should I develop cognitive impairment. I confess, the thought is… unsettling. But I suppose it's prudent to address it. I would like to state unequivocally that I do not wish to be kept alive indefinitely in a vegetative state. And I would like to limit any invasive procedures should my cognitive abilities deteriorate significantly. Perhaps a clause specifying a threshold for cognitive function? A certain score on a standardized test, perhaps? I trust your judgment in determining the appropriate criteria. I simply want to ensure my dignity is preserved, even in the face of such a… tragic outcome.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. We can absolutely include provisions regarding end-of-life care should you develop cognitive impairment. It’s wise to address it proactively, and I understand your concern about preserving your dignity. We can specify a clause outlining your wishes regarding life support in the event of severe cognitive decline. We can also include a threshold for cognitive function, using a standardized test such as the Mini-Mental State Examination . A score below a certain level could trigger the implementation of your end-of-life care wishes. We can also address the issue of guardianship, specifying who you would like to be responsible for making healthcare decisions on your behalf if you are no longer able to do so yourself. Your husband, naturally, would be the primary candidate, but we can also designate an alternate. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, my husband would be the logical choice, of course. Though, as I mentioned earlier, perhaps it would be prudent to designate an alternate as well. My sister, Fatima, is a rather… level-headed individual. She resides in Marrakech, but she is capable and discerning. She would provide a… counterbalance, should my husband become overly… zealous. And while we are on the subject of specifics, I would like to explicitly state my preference for a natural burial. No embalming, no cremation, no elaborate funeral arrangements. Simply a return to the earth, with minimal disruption. Is that… feasible? I understand such requests can be… unconventional.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, that is absolutely feasible. We can include your preference for a natural burial, specifying no embalming, no cremation, and no elaborate funeral arrangements. Many people are choosing natural burials these days, and there are resources available to help you plan it. We can include information about green burial options in the directive, if you wish. And yes, designating your sister, Fatima, as an alternate healthcare proxy is an excellent idea. It’s always wise to have a backup plan. We will include her contact information in the document, along with instructions for contacting her in the event of an emergency. We are now covering quite a lot of ground. I will write up a draft of the Advance Directive incorporating everything we have discussed, and then we can review it together to ensure it accurately reflects your wishes. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly agreeable, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to accommodate my… particular preferences. It’s reassuring to know that my wishes will be documented and respected. Perhaps we should schedule a follow-up appointment to review the draft? I wouldn’t want to rush the process. And I may have additional questions once I’ve had time to consider it carefully. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You’ve been most… helpful.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Chilla. I’m glad I could assist you. It’s my pleasure. And absolutely, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment. How does next week sound?
PATIENT: Next week would be… ideal. Perhaps Tuesday afternoon? I have a rather busy schedule, you understand. But Tuesday would work quite nicely. Thank you again, Doctor. I feel considerably more… at ease now. I believe we’ve made excellent progress.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Tuesday afternoon it is. I’ll have my staff schedule that for you. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Chilla. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions before then. Have a pleasant day. And do try not to worry too much. You’ve taken a very important step in ensuring your wishes are respected.
