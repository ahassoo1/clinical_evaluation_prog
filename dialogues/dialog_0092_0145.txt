DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here, if I understand correctly, to… to have a discussion about whether my mother might be eligible for help at home? Or, perhaps, hospice care. Her name is Simone Bahta. She is… eighty-seven years old.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you're considering some important care options for your mother. We can certainly discuss that today. To get a better understanding of her situation, could you tell me a bit more about what's been going on with Simone?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well… she has not been well, Doctor. It started… perhaps six months ago? She began to become very tired, very quickly. Now… she spends most of the day in bed. She does not eat much, and she… she requires assistance with nearly everything. Bathing, dressing… even eating, as I mentioned. It is… difficult to watch. She used to be so… active. And she… she forgets things, often. Important things. Though… her memory is not completely gone. It is… patchy, if that makes sense. She recognizes me, thankfully. And she sometimes has… good moments. But they are becoming less frequent.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like your mother's condition has been gradually declining, and it's understandably distressing to witness. Six months is a significant timeframe. Could you elaborate on the fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It is… a very deep tiredness. Not the kind that a good night’s sleep can fix. She will attempt to do something simple – perhaps sit up in bed, or walk to the window – and become completely exhausted afterwards. She will need to lie down for a very long time to recover. And… it is not just physical. She seems… tired in her spirit, as well. She does not express much joy anymore. She mostly just… looks out the window. And… she has lost a great deal of weight, despite my efforts to encourage her to eat. It is concerning. Very concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bahta. That sounds quite debilitating. Has she seen a doctor recently for this?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She has. She sees Dr. Dubois. A general practitioner. He… he ran some tests, a few months ago. Blood tests, and… a scan, I believe. He said… he said her heart is not as strong as it once was. And… something about fluid in her lungs. He prescribed some medication, but it does not seem to be helping very much. That is… partly why I am here. To explore other options. If Dr. Dubois is unable to… improve her condition, I want to be prepared. To provide her with the best possible care.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It's good you've been working with Dr. Dubois. Knowing she’s already had some initial testing is helpful. Do you happen to know the specific results of those blood tests or what the scan showed?
PATIENT: I… I do not, Doctor. I was not present for all of the appointments. My sister, Isabelle, usually accompanies her. I have asked Isabelle for the results, but she has not yet had a chance to gather them. She works full-time, you see. She promised to bring them to our next meeting. Perhaps next week? I apologize for not having that information readily available. I can… ask her to send them to you directly, if you prefer. I simply want to ensure my mother receives the best care possible.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bahta. It’s understandable that you don't have all the details. Isabelle sending the results directly would be very helpful, if that's convenient. In the meantime, let's proceed with a brief examination of your mother, if she's willing. I’d like to listen to her heart and lungs, and just get a general sense of her current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be… very good. She is a bit… frail, so please be gentle. And… she can be… stubborn, sometimes. But she will likely cooperate, if you explain things clearly. I will assist in any way I can. She is in the bedroom, in the bed. I will… I will go and let her know you are here. And explain what you intend to do. Just a moment, please.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. I appreciate your assistance. Please take your time. I’ll just review some general information while we wait. I’ll be ready when you and your mother are.
