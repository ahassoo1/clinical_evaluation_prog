DOCTOR: Hi Nicoletta, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply, I’m hoping to get a little… boost. I feel like I need a reset, you know? I’m not sick, exactly, but I’m not feeling as… vibrant as I used to. I just want to feel more like myself again. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Nicoletta. It's good you're being proactive about this, and wanting to feel your best is a perfectly valid reason to come see a doctor. A “reset” – I understand. Can you tell me a little more about what “not feeling vibrant” looks like for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Well, I used to have so much more energy. I was always gardening, visiting with friends, baking… Now, I find myself resting a lot more. And not in a peaceful way, if that makes sense. It’s more like… I need to rest. And things just don’t feel as enjoyable as they used to. Even my baking! I used to love trying new recipes, but lately… it feels like a chore. And I’ve been a bit forgetful, too. Not terribly, but enough that it bothers me. I used to have a very sharp mind, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicoletta, thank you for sharing that. So, decreased energy, less enjoyment in activities you used to love, and some increased forgetfulness. That’s helpful. Just to get a better picture, has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Definitely gradual. It wasn’t like I woke up one morning and felt this way. It’s been… well, over the past year, I’d say. Maybe longer, even. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. Things just slowly… faded. It's a little unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, Nicoletta, that sounds frustrating. A slow change can be harder to notice right away. Okay. And aside from the energy, enjoyment, and forgetfulness, have you noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or weight?
PATIENT: Let me think… My sleep is… okay. I don’t sleep badly, but I don’t sleep as soundly as I used to. I wake up a few times during the night, you know? Nothing major. My appetite… that’s probably a little less, yes. I don’t feel as hungry as I used to. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, but not intentionally. I haven’t been trying to diet or anything. It's probably not much, though. I haven’t actually weighed myself recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nicoletta. So, some disrupted sleep, decreased appetite, and unintentional weight loss, alongside the decreased energy, less enjoyment, and increased forgetfulness. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, that was… oh, back in the eighties, I believe. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't bother me too much. Just a little stiffness sometimes. Otherwise… I’ve been generally healthy, thankfully. I always took good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the eighties and some arthritis in your hands. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I’ve been taking it for… oh, maybe ten years now? Something like that. And sometimes I take a little something for the arthritis when it flares up, but not very often. That’s it, really. I don’t like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a medication for blood pressure and occasionally something for arthritis. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, thankfully! My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. No allergies at all, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any problems with memory loss, like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Hmm… My mother, she… well, she got a little forgetful towards the end, yes. Not terribly, but she’d misplace things and repeat herself sometimes. But she lived a long life, thankfully, and we just thought it was part of getting old. My father… he was always very sharp, right up until the end. I don’t recall anyone else in the family having serious memory problems, no. It's hard to say for certain, though. It's been a long time, and we didn’t talk about those things much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, some forgetfulness in your mother towards the end of her life. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… well, as I said, I used to be very active. I loved gardening, visiting with friends, baking. I used to go to church every Sunday, but I haven't been as much lately, with feeling… not myself. I live alone, my husband passed away about ten years ago. I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Mostly, I just enjoy a quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet life, living alone after your husband's passing ten years ago, no smoking, occasional glass of wine, and used to be very active with gardening, baking, and church. Thank you for sharing all of that, Nicoletta, that’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Please, go right ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arms relaxed at your sides?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you are. All ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/85. That’s a little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance seems good. Now, I'd like to check your thyroid. It’s a small gland in your neck, and sometimes problems with it can cause these kinds of symptoms. Would you mind tilting your head back slightly?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible. Yes, of course. Here you are, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything else. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay, your thyroid feels normal in size and doesn’t seem to be enlarged. No nodules felt. Everything seems within normal limits physically, Nicoletta. However, based on your symptoms – the decreased energy, less enjoyment, increased forgetfulness, disrupted sleep, and decreased appetite – and your age, it’s important to rule out a few things. I think it would be beneficial to order some blood tests. We'll check your thyroid function more closely, a complete blood count to look for any vitamin deficiencies, and vitamin D levels. We should also check a B12 level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very thorough, Doctor. Blood tests seem sensible. Yes, please, go ahead and order them. I want to get to the bottom of this, and if that's what you recommend, then I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. You don’t need to fast for these tests, so you can eat and drink as usual. The results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to focus on getting good sleep, eating a balanced diet, and staying as active as you’re able. And if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Sleep, eat well, stay active... I can certainly try. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for being so thorough. I feel much better already, just knowing we're trying to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nicoletta. It was my pleasure. We'll get these results back to you as soon as possible and go from there. The nurse will be in to give you the lab order and directions in just a moment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, that will be all, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness and attention. I’ll see you again when the results are in, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. It was lovely meeting you, Nicoletta. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was lovely meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will, and you have a good day too.
