DOCTOR: Right. Louine Cannington, 89 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it’s not getting any better. Feels like a hole is opening up, right there on my heel. <points vaguely at her heel> It’s quite painful, you know. I've tried putting ointment on it, but it doesn't seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least a month now, I’d say. Maybe longer. It's hard to keep track when you get to be my age, but definitely a good while. I thought it was just a blister at first, you know, from my shoes, but it just…worsened. And it smells funny, now that I think about it. Not a good smell. <wrinkles nose>
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve been applying…what kind of ointment, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, you know, the usual. Whatever my daughter buys when I run out. Some sort of healing cream, I suppose. It comes in a little silver tube. Nothing fancy. She means well, bless her heart, but she’s not a doctor, is she? I don’t even know what’s in it, honestly. It's supposed to help with…skin things. <shrugs> Is that helpful? I don’t keep track of brands, dear.
DOCTOR: I see you’ve had some issues with peripheral vascular disease noted in the past. Do you have any diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, that old thing? Yes, yes, they told me years ago. The sugar thing. I try to watch it, you know? Not too many sweets. My daughter brings me those special cookies, the ones without sugar, but they don’t taste very good, so I usually just have a small bite. It’s hard, you know? A body needs a little treat now and then. And I take my pills. Most of the time. Is that what this is about? The sugar? <looks worried>
DOCTOR: Let’s have a look at the foot. Please remove your shoe and sock. I want to get a better understanding of what we’re dealing with here. Don’t worry, we'll figure it out.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, alright. It's not a pretty sight, I warn you. <struggles to untie her shoe, eventually succeeding and removing both shoe and sock, revealing a foot with a visible, draining ulcer on the heel> There. Be careful, it's a bit…tender. And please, don't make a face. I know it doesn’t look good. My daughter says I need to wear better shoes, but these are comfortable! <points to the worn slippers> They support my arches.
DOCTOR: Ulceration present on the posterior heel, approximately 2cm in diameter. Significant surrounding erythema and edema. Purulent drainage noted. Mild odor present. Pedal pulses are…weak, but palpable. Capillary refill is prolonged at greater than 3 seconds. Skin is warm to the touch. No signs of cellulitis extending beyond the immediate wound area...yet. <stops dictating, looks up briefly with a dismissive air> This is likely a diabetic foot ulcer, complicated by possible secondary infection. We need to get this cultured.
PATIENT: Cultured? Like…in a laboratory? <eyes widen with alarm> What does that mean? Are you saying I have something…growing on my foot? Something bad? My daughter told me about infections, and she said they can…spread. Is it going to spread? And what about my shoes? Are you going to make me wear those awful orthopedic ones now? <fidgets with the edge of her dress>
DOCTOR: A culture will identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, so we can choose the right antibiotic. It's standard procedure, Mrs. Cannington. As for spreading, it could if left untreated, which is why we are addressing it now. And frankly, those slippers are not doing you any favors. We'll discuss footwear options later. I’m going to order a wound culture, blood work to check your blood sugar and white blood cell count, and I'm going to need to get an X-ray of the foot to rule out any underlying bone infection. <pauses, already reaching for the phone> I'll have the nurse draw the blood and get the X-ray ordered immediately. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a rash once, when I was a little girl, from some sort of medicine. But I don't remember what it was. And I think my mother gave me something…penicillin, maybe? A long, long time ago. It might have made me feel a bit…nauseous. Honestly, dear, I have a terrible memory for these things. Everything blurs together after a while. Is it a big deal if I don’t remember? I’m sure whatever you give me will be fine. <waves hand dismissively> Just get it over with, please. This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed with caution. I’m going to order a broad-spectrum antibiotic for now, while we wait for the culture results. The nurse will explain everything. I'm also going to refer you to podiatry for wound care. They specialize in these types of issues and can provide more focused treatment. <leans forward slightly, speaking in a clipped tone> It is imperative you follow their recommendations and keep all follow-up appointments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Podiatry? Another doctor? <frowns deeply> Honestly, dear, I feel like I’m being passed around like a…a package. And follow-up appointments? I have my bingo night on Tuesdays, and my church group on Thursdays. <shakes head> This is just…too much. And what about my slippers? Will the podiatrist make me throw those away too? <eyes begin to well up> I just want my foot to feel better, and I want to be able to keep my routine. Is that too much to ask? <dabs at eyes with a tissue>
DOCTOR: The nurse will be in shortly to go over everything with you. I have other patients waiting, Mrs. Cannington. Please try to rest and keep the wound clean. <pauses at the door, glancing back briefly> And frankly, yes, you need to consider alternative footwear. It’s vital for healing. <exits quickly> .
PATIENT: .
