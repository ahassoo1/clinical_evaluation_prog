DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Knabenshue. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Thank you for having me. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue. I am here regarding a matter at my workplace. It concerns the masks, or the personal protective equipment they require us to wear. I’m hoping to discuss a possible exemption, or… understand what my options are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. Masks and PPE exemptions… I see. So, it sounds like you're having some difficulty or concern with the requirements at your workplace. Could you tell me a bit more about why you're hoping for an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It's not that I want an exemption, you understand. I take my work very seriously. I am a Protective Service Worker, and keeping people safe is paramount. However… the masks themselves cause me some difficulty. I find it hard to breathe properly when I have them on for extended periods. It makes me… anxious, to be frank, worrying about being able to do my job effectively if I can’t get enough air. And it’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. I've tried different kinds, but none seem to fit well, and they all feel… constricting.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Knabenshue. It's good that you’re taking this seriously, and it’s important to address these concerns. Difficulty breathing and anxiety are definitely things we need to look into. Just to clarify, you’ve tried different mask types – N95s, surgical masks, cloth masks – and none have been comfortable or alleviated the breathing difficulty?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is correct. I’ve used the N95s, the blue surgical ones, and… well, some of my coworkers wear cloth masks, so I tried one of those as well, just to see. Each one presents its own problem. The N95s are very tight, and make me feel… trapped, almost. The surgical masks slip, and I find myself constantly adjusting them, which isn’t ideal. And the cloth masks… they don’t seem to offer much in the way of protection, and they get quite warm. I’ve been working with people for a long time, and I need to be able to communicate clearly, and breathe properly, to do my job safely. It’s more than just my comfort, you understand. It’s about the people I serve.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you explaining that so thoroughly, Mr. Knabenshue. It sounds like you’ve put a lot of thought into this, and that you’re very conscientious about your role. Before we discuss potential exemptions, I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any history of asthma, COPD, or other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I’ve always been a healthy man. I spend a lot of time outdoors, when I can, and I’ve never had any trouble with my lungs. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma, or COPD, or anything of that nature. I have always been able to breathe easily. It's only recently, with the requirement to wear these masks, that I’ve encountered this difficulty. I’ve never had any issues with shortness of breath before. I can walk up several flights of stairs without a problem, and I don’t get winded easily. It’s… perplexing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s good to know. And have you had COVID-19 at any point?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I did. It was… last year, I believe. November, perhaps? It wasn’t severe, thankfully. I felt quite unwell for about a week – fever, cough, fatigue – but I recovered fully. I did isolate, of course, and followed all the recommended guidelines. I haven’t had any lingering symptoms since then. I am vaccinated and boosted, as well. I felt it was important to protect myself, and those around me. I was quite cautious, even before the masks became mandatory.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, thank you. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any regular medications. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I haven't needed any prescriptions in… well, I can’t recall ever needing a prescription, to be honest. I occasionally take over-the-counter pain relievers for a headache, but that’s about it. Nothing ongoing, nothing for a specific condition. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, when it can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Knabenshue. So, no history of lung conditions, no current medications… it sounds like this difficulty is indeed related to the masks themselves. To proceed, I'd like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and oxygen saturation – just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination. I want to be certain, as well, that there isn't something else going on. Listening to my lungs and checking my oxygen levels sounds… sensible. Please, proceed at your convenience. I will do my best to remain still and cooperate fully. I appreciate your diligence in this matter.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just sit up here for me… First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally, please. Okay… your heart sounds regular. Your lung sounds are… clear, but I do notice slightly increased effort with each breath. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within normal limits. And your heart rate is 72, also normal. Everything seems within normal ranges so far. However, the increased effort you're exhibiting even without a mask is something we need to consider. I want to be cautious, and I’m going to recommend a baseline EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac issues, just to be thorough. It’s a simple test, and can provide valuable information. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… prudent. If you feel an EKG is warranted, then I certainly agree. I understand the importance of ruling out any potential underlying issues, even if I feel perfectly healthy otherwise. I trust your judgment, and I am happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. It would certainly give me peace of mind, and allow us to address this mask issue with greater confidence. Please, let me know what is involved, and when we can schedule it. I am available most afternoons.
DOCTOR: Excellent. An EKG is quick and painless. It involves placing some small electrodes on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn't involve any electricity being sent through your body, just recording the electrical activity of your heart. The technician will explain everything in detail when you get there. We can schedule it for tomorrow afternoon, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, tomorrow afternoon would be perfectly acceptable. Thank you for arranging that. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your willingness to address my concerns. So, while we wait for the results of the EKG, is there anything else I should be doing? Any particular breathing exercises, or anything I should avoid? I want to be proactive in managing this situation, and ensure I am doing everything I can to protect my health, and the health of those around me.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Until we have the EKG results, I wouldn’t recommend any strenuous activity that significantly increases your breathing rate. And while it may seem counterintuitive, try to practice diaphragmatic breathing – slow, deep breaths from your belly – when you're not wearing a mask. This can help strengthen your diaphragm and improve your lung capacity. I'm also going to provide you with a note explaining your situation to your workplace, recommending a temporary accommodation while we investigate. That could include a different type of mask, or potentially a modified work assignment. We'll revisit the accommodation plan based on the EKG results. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. The diaphragmatic breathing exercise is something I can certainly incorporate into my routine. And the note for my workplace is… greatly appreciated. It’s reassuring to have something in writing, and it will hopefully alleviate some of the pressure I’ve been feeling. I suppose my only question is… what if the EKG does reveal something? What would be the next steps then? I understand we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it, but I’m always… prepared for all eventualities, you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Knabenshue. If the EKG reveals any abnormalities, we would likely refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. They would perform additional tests – perhaps an echocardiogram, or a stress test – to determine the underlying cause and the appropriate treatment. The treatment would depend on the specific diagnosis, but it could range from medication to lifestyle modifications, or in rare cases, a more interventional procedure. However, please try not to worry about that right now. It’s important to remember that the vast majority of people with healthy EKGs. We are simply being thorough and cautious. We'll address any issues as they arise. For now, let’s focus on getting the EKG done and taking things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very… informative, and reassuring. I appreciate your diligence, and your willingness to listen to my concerns. I feel much better equipped to address this situation, and I am grateful for your guidance. I will schedule the EKG as soon as possible, and I will contact you if I have any further questions. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. And remember, we'll revisit this after the EKG results are available. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
