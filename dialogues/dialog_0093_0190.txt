DOCTOR: Good morning, Lilyanna. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. I’ve been… unsteady, I suppose. Like I’m going to fall over. It’s been happening for a little while now, and it’s quite concerning. I don’t… I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. Just that it has.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Unsteady,” you say. And you’ve noticed this for some time now, though pinpointing exactly when it began is difficult. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll work through it. Could you describe what you mean by “unsteady”?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to put into words. It’s not a constant thing, you see. Sometimes I feel perfectly fine, and then… suddenly, it’s like the floor is tilting, or… or I’m rocking a little. It doesn't happen when I'm sitting, usually. More when I’m walking, or standing for a while. It’s not painful, not dizzy exactly, just… off balance. And it frightens me, to be quite frank. I work… I work with machinery, and being unsteady is… not ideal.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concern, Lilyanna, especially given your work. It’s good you’re addressing this. So, it’s primarily when walking or standing, not when seated. And you describe it as a feeling of tilting or rocking, rather than a spinning sensation, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Tilting and rocking is a good way to put it. Not spinning, no. And it’s… it’s intermittent, as well. Some days are worse than others. I don’t recall anything specific causing it, either. It just… happens. I wish I could be more helpful, but my memory… it isn't what it used to be. Is that alright? Will that make things difficult?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lilyanna. It’s perfectly alright. Memory lapses are common, and we will take our time and work through this together. It doesn’t hinder our process in the slightest. The fact that it’s intermittent is helpful information. Now, let's try to get a more comprehensive picture. Have you noticed anything accompanying this feeling of unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Accompanying it… hmm. Let me think. No… no nausea, no headaches. Sometimes, perhaps, a little bit of… fuzziness, in my head? Not a sharp pain, just… not quite as clear as usual. And, on occasion, a slight ringing in my ears. But that could be anything, really. I work around a lot of loud equipment. It's difficult to say what’s related and what isn’t. I really don’t want to bother you with irrelevant details…
DOCTOR: Please, don’t hesitate to share anything you think might be relevant, Lilyanna. That’s precisely what I’m here for. The “fuzziness” and the ringing in your ears are certainly worth noting, even if you suspect they’re work-related. They may still provide valuable clues. Could you rate the severity of this unsteadiness on a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being completely debilitating?
PATIENT: Oh. A scale… right. Hmm. Well, on a good day, it’s barely a two, I suppose. Just a little wobble. But on a bad day… when it feels like I’m truly going to fall… I’d say a six, maybe a seven. It’s frightening enough that I have to hold onto things to get around. I had a small… incident, actually, a few weeks ago. I nearly fell off a platform. Thankfully, a colleague caught me, but it’s shaken me up quite a bit. I haven’t told anyone at work about it, obviously.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation to share that with your colleagues, Lilyanna. That sounds quite frightening, and I’m glad your colleague was there to assist you. A six or seven is significant, and warrants further investigation. To help me build a clearer picture, let's briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Well… that’s a complicated question, Doctor. My husband… he handled all the medical things. He passed away a little over a year ago. I remember he said something about my blood pressure being a little high at one point, but I don’t recall any specific diagnosis. And I’ve never been particularly ill, if that makes sense. Just… the usual colds and flu. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I take a multivitamin, religiously, and… and that's about it, I think. It’s all rather hazy. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Lilyanna. Losing your husband is a significant loss, and it’s perfectly understandable that some details may be difficult to recall. We will proceed at your pace. High blood pressure is something we'll certainly want to investigate further. Now, to get a better understanding of the situation, and with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and assessing your balance and coordination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s best to get it checked properly. Please, go ahead. I'll do my best to cooperate. I just… I get a little anxious during medical examinations. It reminds me of… well, never mind. Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind?
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. I will absolutely be gentle. And please, don’t hesitate to tell me if you feel uncomfortable at any point. We can stop or adjust the examination as needed. First, let's check your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Your blood pressure is currently 145/90. That is slightly elevated. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I will assess your balance and coordination. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright. Standing… feet together… closing my eyes… Oh dear. That’s… not very good, is it? I feel quite unsteady already. I’m afraid I might fall. Perhaps… perhaps we should skip that part? I don’t want to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilyanna. Your safety is my priority. We will absolutely stop that part of the examination. It’s perfectly alright. Your reaction is valuable information in itself. Given your history and the results of this brief examination, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your unsteadiness. These tests will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a complete blood count. I would also like to schedule an appointment for you with an audiologist to assess your hearing and rule out any inner ear problems. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Blood tests and a hearing test… alright. That seems sensible. I’d prefer to get to the bottom of this, if possible. And… and thank you for being so patient with me. It’s… it’s difficult, explaining things when I can’t quite remember them. Will these tests require a fasting period? And… and how long will it take to get the results? I have to go back to work next week, you see, and I’m not sure I can afford to take too much time off.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lilyanna. It’s my pleasure to help. I understand your concerns about work. The blood tests do require an eight-hour fasting period – meaning no food or drinks other than water from midnight tonight. We’ll schedule the appointment for first thing in the morning. The results typically take about three to five business days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could put you at risk of falling, and please let someone know if you’re feeling particularly unsteady. I’m writing a prescription for the blood tests now, and I’ll also provide you with a referral to a reputable audiologist in the area. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything, Doctor. The fasting period, the blood tests, the hearing test… I’ll try to remember everything. You’ve been very helpful, and I appreciate your patience. Perhaps… perhaps one last thing. Is there anything I should be looking out for? Any specific symptoms that would warrant a call to your office immediately? I don’t want to waste your time, but… I just want to be prepared. .
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent question, Lilyanna. Absolutely. If you experience any sudden severe dizziness, a headache accompanied by vision changes, difficulty speaking or walking, or any weakness or numbness on one side of your body, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. These could be signs of a more serious condition. Also, if your unsteadiness worsens significantly, or if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath, please contact my office right away. It's always better to err on the side of caution. Here are the prescriptions and referral information. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Lilyanna, and I look forward to discussing the results with you next week. .
