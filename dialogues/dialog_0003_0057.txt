DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Luft. I'm Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It's... it's about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you about it.
DOCTOR: Right. Cancer. Yes. And you were… referred to me?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct. A doctor... Dr. Alvarez, I believe, sent me. She said you specialize in helping people… with things after, you know. With getting better. Or... managing. It’s all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Dr. Alvarez, hmm. Well, I suppose she deemed it necessary for me to review your case. Do you have any documentation from her?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. Everything she gave me, I think. It has some papers... and some pictures. It was a lot to take in, honestly.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's just… get through this. I'll need a complete history, regardless of what Dr. Alvarez has provided. To start, can you tell me specifically what type of cancer you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don’t remember the full name. It was… something to do with the blood? Leukemia, maybe? It was a long appointment, and I was very upset. They told me a lot of things, but it didn’t all stick. I’m sorry. It started with really bad tiredness, and then… bruising. Easy bruising. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Easy bruising.” Yes, that’s… vaguely helpful. Though, frankly, I expect a patient to retain some information regarding their diagnosis. Alright. Let’s move on. Any family history of… blood disorders, or cancer in general?
PATIENT: My grandmother… on my mother’s side, she had something. A long time ago. I think it was cancer, but… not blood cancer. Lung cancer, maybe? She smoked for a long time. And my uncle, he had diabetes. Does that count? I’m not sure if that’s related. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Diabetes is… not directly relevant, but noted. And your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Um… I work as an occupational therapist. I mostly help people recover from injuries, get back to doing things they enjoy. I… I used to be married, but my husband passed away a few years ago. It was… sudden. I don’t really… do much else these days. Mostly work, and… trying to take care of myself. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Sufficient. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I take some vitamins, sometimes, but that’s it. Just a multivitamin, and sometimes Vitamin D in the winter. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. Very well. Now, let’s get to the physical exam. If you’ll just lie down on the examination table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and… assess the bruising you mentioned.
PATIENT: Okay. If you just tell me what you need me to do, Doctor, that would be helpful. I get a little nervous with… medical things.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Just lie flat, arms at your sides. I will listen to your chest with the stethoscope. Breathe deeply. In… and out… Good. Hmm. Slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at this bruising. Please, expose your arms and legs.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… worse some days than others. It doesn’t really hurt, but it… it looks bad. I try to cover it up, but… it's hard.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. As you can see, there’s significant ecchymosis present on both extremities. No palpable masses. Capillary refill is… acceptable. Lymph nodes are… within normal limits, though slightly enlarged. Right. Well. I’ll need to order some blood work, of course. Complete blood count, differential, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. And a bone marrow biopsy. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: A bone marrow… biopsy? What… what does that involve? I’m not sure I understand. And… is it going to hurt? Dr. Alvarez didn’t mention anything about a biopsy. I thought… I thought blood work was all I needed.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Luft. Dr. Alvarez clearly didn't provide you with a comprehensive overview of the diagnostic process. A bone marrow biopsy is essential to determine the exact type of leukemia you have, and to formulate an appropriate treatment plan. It involves extracting a small sample of bone marrow from your hip bone. Yes, it will be… uncomfortable. A local anesthetic will be used, of course, but there will still be some pressure and… discomfort. It’s a necessary procedure. I'll send the orders to the lab immediately. And then we’ll schedule it for… next week. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Next week… I… I suppose so. If it’s really necessary. But… could you explain it to me a little more? What will happen during the biopsy? And… what are we looking for, exactly? I just… I get very anxious with medical things, and I like to know what's going to happen. I appreciate you taking the time to explain it.
DOCTOR: Very well. It’s a relatively straightforward procedure. You will lie on your stomach, and the area on your hip bone will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. Then, a needle will be inserted into the bone marrow to extract a small sample. It takes approximately 20-30 minutes. As for what we are looking for… we are examining the bone marrow cells for abnormal growth and to determine the specific type of leukemia you have. Different types of leukemia require different treatment approaches. Is that sufficient?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that helps, thank you. And… what kind of treatment are we talking about? If… if it is a bad type of leukemia? I’m sorry to ask so many questions. I just… I need to know what I’m facing. And… what are my chances?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Luft. It’s far too early to discuss treatment options or prognoses. We haven’t even confirmed the diagnosis yet. Treatment can range from chemotherapy and radiation to stem cell transplantation. And the prognosis… well, that depends entirely on the specific type of leukemia, your age, your overall health, and how well you respond to treatment. Frankly, getting ahead of ourselves is counterproductive. Let’s focus on getting the biopsy done first, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll see you next week then. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab will contact you to schedule the biopsy. Goodbye.
