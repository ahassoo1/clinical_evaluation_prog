DOCTOR: Hi Arlan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Yoshino, you say? Hmm. It’s this… needing to go to the bathroom. A lot. More than I used to, anyway. It’s a nuisance, really. Especially when I’m… out and about. It’s just… frequent. That’s the word, isn’t it? Frequent.
DOCTOR: Yes, frequent is a good word. Okay, so more frequent urination than usual. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: More than usual… honestly, I don't keep track of such things. My wife, bless her heart, she notices these things. She says I’m going every couple of hours, maybe even less. It's… disruptive. And at night, too. Have to get up. Used to sleep right through. Not anymore. It's probably just old age, though. Things wear out, don’t they?
DOCTOR: It’s good your wife notices, that’s helpful. And you’re right, changes can happen with age, but frequent urination definitely has a number of potential causes, so it’s good you came in to get it checked out. So, it's been happening gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It just… crept up on me. One day I noticed it a bit more, the next a bit more again. Not like I woke up one morning and bam, suddenly I was running to the bathroom every five minutes. It was… subtle. Like a slow leak, maybe? Is that a good way to put it? I manage the farm, you see. I’m used to things leaking… pipes and such.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good way to put it, actually – a slow leak. And it's helpful to know it was gradual. Okay, besides the frequency, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I don’t feel any pain, not when I go, anyway. And no fever, that I know of. Sometimes… sometimes it feels like I don’t completely empty my bladder, but that could just be my imagination. I get a little… preoccupied sometimes, if you know what I mean. Thinking about the crops, or the livestock, or… well, all sorts of things. Maybe I just don't sit long enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no fever, and sometimes a feeling of incomplete emptying. That’s good information. And it’s perfectly normal to get distracted, so I understand about not always focusing on emptying completely. Now, just to get a full picture, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… now that you mention it… maybe. It seems a little darker than usual, perhaps? I don’t pay much attention to it, truth be told. I just… go. My wife would be the one to notice such things. She's very observant, that woman. Always has been. I suppose if it was bright red or something, I’d notice. But no, nothing dramatic. Just… a shade or two darker, maybe. Or maybe I'm just imagining things again.
DOCTOR: Okay, a slightly darker color, that’s good to know. It’s helpful you mention your wife noticing things, that’s great. I see here you have a history of high blood pressure. Is that being managed with medication currently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the blood pressure. Pesky thing, that. Yes, I take a pill for it. Every morning. Can't remember the name of it, now… something blue, I think. My wife handles the refills, bless her. She keeps everything organized. I just take the pills she gives me. It seems to be working alright, though. Doctor keeps telling me it's under control.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good that it's being managed. And it’s perfectly fine that your wife handles the refills, that's very common. Now, just a few more questions. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… hmm. Not really. Had a bit of a sniffle a few months back, but nothing serious. Just a little cough, a little congestion. It went away on its own. Didn't bother the doctor with it. Old man’s cough, I figured. You get those things, you know. I’ve been mostly healthy, all things considered. I work on the farm, keep busy. Fresh air, sunshine... keeps me going.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Fresh air and sunshine are definitely helpful. Okay, Arlan, I think I have a pretty good idea of what's going on. Before I explain my thoughts, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just a quick listen to your abdomen, and a simple check of your prostate. It'll help me rule some things in or out. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A physical exam… hmm. Prostate, you say? Well, I suppose if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, if you know what I mean. But I trust your judgment. Do what you need to do. Just… be quick about it, alright? And… don't be too rough.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s a standard part of the exam for men your age, and it helps us check for any enlargement or tenderness. Okay, I'm just listening and feeling for any tenderness or masses. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I'm going to perform a quick digital rectal exam to check your prostate. I'll let you know what I'm doing as I go. Please just relax as much as possible. Alright, that's all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. There’s no obvious tenderness. It's a common finding in men your age. Everything felt within normal limits, but the enlargement, combined with your symptoms, makes me suspect Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. Essentially, it means your prostate is a little bigger than it used to be, which can cause the frequent urination, especially at night.
PATIENT: BPH… that’s a mouthful. And it’s… what exactly? You say it’s just… bigger? Like a swollen… something? And that causes me to run to the bathroom all the time? It doesn’t sound serious, but it’s awfully inconvenient, you know. And what do we do about it? Is there a pill for that? My wife’s going to want to know all about this, of course. She always does.
DOCTOR: You're right, it’s a mouthful! And you’re right to ask what it is. Essentially, the prostate gland naturally gets larger as men age. It’s very common – it happens to a lot of men. When it gets bigger, it can press on the urethra – that’s the tube that carries urine out of the bladder – making it harder to empty your bladder completely and causing you to feel like you need to go more often. See here?
PATIENT: Hmm. So that’s what it looks like. Little thing, isn’t it? And it can cause all this trouble? Remarkable. So, pressing on the tube… that makes sense, I suppose. Like a kink in a hose. And you say a lot of men have this… is it… painful? Aside from the running to the bathroom, I mean. And what’s the treatment? More pills? My wife’s always worried about me taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: It is a little thing, and it can cause a lot of trouble! And no, BPH itself isn’t usually painful, thankfully. The discomfort comes from the frequent urination, the urgency, and sometimes a weak stream. As for treatment, there are several options. Often, we start with lifestyle changes – things like limiting fluids before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing bladder training exercises. We also have medications that can help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. These medications are pills, yes, but they’re generally well-tolerated. There are also other options, like minimally invasive procedures, if medications aren't enough. We’ll start with the simplest options first, and see how you respond. I'd like to order a urine analysis to rule out any infection, and a PSA test to get a baseline measurement of your prostate-specific antigen. This test helps us monitor your prostate health over time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A urine analysis… and a what now? PSA test? More tests… Honestly, Doctor, it feels like I’m falling apart. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. I just want to get this sorted out. I don’t want to spend the rest of my days running to the bathroom. So, lifestyle changes… less water? No coffee? That’s going to be difficult. My wife makes a lovely coffee every morning. But alright, I’ll try. And pills… well, I suppose I can manage a few more pills. As long as they don’t have too many side effects. And what about my wife? Should she come to the next appointment? She’ll want to know all the details, and she’s always better at remembering things than I am.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Arlan. It feels like a lot, I know. But we're just trying to get a complete picture and rule out anything else that could be contributing to your symptoms. The PSA test is just a simple blood test. It measures a protein produced by the prostate, and it can help us monitor for changes over time. We're not necessarily looking for anything specific right now, just getting a baseline. And yes, absolutely, please bring your wife to the next appointment! It’s always helpful to have another set of ears and a second memory. She can ask questions and help you remember the details. Okay, I've ordered the tests. You can have them done at the lab just down the street. They’ll give you the instructions when you go. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a handout with some information about BPH and some tips for managing your symptoms. I’ll also write a note to your wife’s email address that details our plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. A handout… and an email to my wife. She’ll appreciate that. She always says I need to be better at taking notes. So, less water, no coffee, and a handout. And more tests. It’s a lot to remember. But alright, I’ll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for being patient with my… forgetfulness. I appreciate it. I suppose I should be going now. I have some chores to do on the farm. And I need to tell my wife about all this. She'll want to know. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Arlan. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. We're here to help. And don't worry about remembering everything - that’s what your wife is for! Take care, and I’ll see you both at the follow-up appointment. .
