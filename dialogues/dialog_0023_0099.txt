DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I received some results from a test… a test of my insides, I believe, and they weren’t quite what the nurse expected, so I’m here to discuss them. It was an… GI Endo Test, that’s what she called it.
DOCTOR: A GI Endoscopy, yes. I see it here. And the nurse felt it warranted a discussion with me, excellent. Could you tell me, in your own words, what prompted the endoscopy in the first place?
PATIENT: Well, for several months now, I’ve been having… discomfort. Not terrible pain, mind you, but a persistent… unsettled feeling in my stomach. And some… changes in my bowel movements. That’s probably a rather indelicate way to put it, but it’s the truth. It wasn’t constant, but frequent enough that my primary physician thought it best to investigate. She said it could be many things, and this test would help narrow it down.
DOCTOR: Unsettled feeling and changes in bowel movements. And how long ago did these changes begin, approximately?
PATIENT: Let me think… it began sometime in late February, I believe. Yes, February. It was shortly after the Fiesta de las Flores. A lovely celebration, but perhaps something I ate… although I didn't notice anything unusual at the time. It was gradual, at first. Just a bit different than usual. Then it became more… noticeable. I suppose that’s the best way to describe it.
DOCTOR: February. And can you describe those changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It’s… difficult to speak of, but I will try to be precise. They’ve become less… formed, shall we say? And… darker in color. Occasionally, there’s been a small amount of… blood. Not a great deal, but enough to cause me concern, and prompted the doctor to order the test. It hasn’t been every time, but several times now.
DOCTOR: Darker in color and some blood present. How often would you say you're experiencing these changes now?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not every day, thankfully. Perhaps three or four times a week, on average? It fluctuates, you understand. Some days are better than others. It's quite disruptive, really. It makes it difficult to plan anything, in case I need to… well, you understand. It’s not a comfortable situation.
DOCTOR: Three or four times a week. Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have been feeling… quite tired lately. More tired than usual, and it takes a long time to recover, even after a full night’s sleep. And I've had… a loss of appetite. I haven’t been eating as much, and when I do, it doesn’t always sit well. It’s a bit of a vicious cycle, really. The discomfort makes me not want to eat, and not eating makes me weaker, which then makes me feel even worse.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and loss of appetite... Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. I hadn't really thought about it… but now that you mention it, my clothes have been feeling a bit looser. I hadn't attributed it to anything specific, but… yes, I believe I have lost some weight. Not a significant amount, perhaps five or six pounds, but noticeable. I haven't been weighing myself regularly, you understand. It's not something I typically do.
DOCTOR: Five or six pounds... And have you noticed any abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, or vomiting?
PATIENT: Occasionally, I’ve had a bit of… bloating, particularly after eating. And sometimes, a mild nausea, but I wouldn't call it vomiting. Just a queasy feeling, and a loss of appetite, as I mentioned. The abdominal pain is… more of a discomfort, really. A dull ache, not sharp. It comes and goes, and isn’t constant. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… present. It’s difficult to explain. A general feeling of unwellness, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Many years ago, I was diagnosed with mild hypertension, high blood pressure, as you call it. It's been well-controlled with medication for quite some time, thankfully. And… I had a hysterectomy in 1985. Other than that, nothing significant. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, until recently. I do take a daily vitamin, and try to eat a balanced diet, although my appetite has been poor lately, as I said.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy in 1985. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down here. It’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And… a small dose of Hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 milligrams, also once a day. I’ve been on the same dosage for several years now, and it’s been very effective. My primary physician monitors my blood pressure regularly, and it’s always been within a normal range. I’m quite diligent about taking my medication, you understand. It’s very important to me to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg and Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg daily. Good. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can tolerate most foods, although I try to avoid overly processed foods, and things with a lot of sugar. But it’s not a medical allergy, just a personal preference. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. No allergies to penicillin, or any other common medications, thankfully.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And finally, do you have any family history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or any other gastrointestinal issues?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… we don’t often discuss medical matters. It’s not something that’s openly talked about. My mother… she had stomach problems later in life, but I don’t know the specifics. It was many years ago, and I wasn’t closely involved in her care. My father… he died of a heart attack. And my siblings… they are all quite healthy, as far as I know. I don't recall anyone specifically being diagnosed with colon cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease, but I cannot say with certainty. It’s possible, but I don’t have any concrete information. It’s a very good question, though. Perhaps I should inquire with my siblings.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's discuss the results of your GI Endoscopy. The report indicates some inflammation in the sigmoid colon, and several small polyps were identified. They were removed during the procedure and sent for biopsy. The biopsy results came back showing… dysplasia. Specifically, low-grade dysplasia. This means that there are some abnormal cells present, but they are not cancerous at this time. However, low-grade dysplasia can sometimes progress to more serious conditions, which is why further monitoring is necessary. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Dysplasia… you say? Abnormal cells… but not cancerous, you clarified. That’s… concerning, naturally. I confess, Doctor, I am not well-versed in medical terminology. Low-grade… does that mean it’s not serious right now? And what does “further monitoring” entail? Will I need more tests? And… what are the chances it could become… more serious, as you said? I apologize for all the questions, but I am a bit… overwhelmed. This is quite a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to be overwhelmed, Ms. Minatra. It’s my job to explain these things clearly. “Low-grade” means the abnormal cells are not aggressive at this time. They are not yet cancerous, and are unlikely to cause immediate harm. However, they can potentially develop into more serious conditions over time, which is why we need to monitor them closely. “Further monitoring” will involve a follow-up colonoscopy, typically in one year. This will allow us to assess whether the polyps have regrown, and to check for any new abnormalities. We will also discuss lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes and regular exercise, which can help reduce your risk. The chances of it becoming more serious depend on several factors, including your age, your overall health, and whether you adhere to the recommended follow-up schedule. It’s important to remember that the vast majority of polyps do not become cancerous. But it’s crucial to be vigilant, and to catch any potential problems early. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: One year… another colonoscopy. I confess, the procedure itself isn't pleasant. But I understand it’s necessary. And you said lifestyle changes… I already try to eat a healthy diet, although my appetite has been poor lately. And I walk regularly, when the weather permits. So, if I understand correctly, the goal is to catch any changes early, before they become… problematic. And the likelihood of that happening is relatively low, but we need to be cautious. Is that a fair summary? And… will this affect my medication? The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide? I don't want to stop taking those without consulting you, of course. This is… a lot to process. Perhaps it would be helpful to have something in writing, to refer to later?
DOCTOR: That is an excellent summary, Ms. Minatra. Precisely. The goal is early detection and prevention. And you are right to ask about your medication. The Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide are unrelated to this condition and should be continued as prescribed. There is no need to stop taking them. I will print out a summary of our discussion, including the results of your endoscopy, the plan for follow-up, and some information about low-grade dysplasia. It will also include information about lifestyle modifications you can make to reduce your risk. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: That would be most appreciated, Doctor. Having something in writing will certainly help me to feel more… in control. Yes, actually. You mentioned lifestyle modifications. Are there any specific foods I should avoid, or foods I should focus on eating? And… is there anything I should be aware of in terms of symptoms? Should I be looking for anything in particular? Anything that would warrant a call to the office before my scheduled follow-up? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I want to be prepared. And I want to do everything I can to stay healthy. This has been… unsettling, to say the least. Thank you for your patience.
DOCTOR: You are not asking too many questions, Ms. Minatra. It’s important to be informed. In terms of diet, there’s no specific food that causes dysplasia. However, a diet high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables is generally recommended. Reducing red and processed meats is also advisable. Staying well-hydrated is important as well. As for symptoms to watch for, you should contact the office if you experience any significant changes in your bowel habits, such as persistent diarrhea or constipation, or if you notice any new bleeding or abdominal pain. Unexplained weight loss is also a concern. Any fatigue that doesn't resolve with rest. I will include this information in the summary as well. Do you have any other questions before I print this out for you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that answers everything… for now. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly, and for your patience with my questions. Having the summary will be incredibly helpful. I feel… a bit more reassured, knowing what to expect. I appreciate your time, and your care. Perhaps I’ll see you in one year, then. Provided everything remains stable, of course. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I will have the nurse print out the summary for you before you leave. I'll schedule your follow-up colonoscopy for one year from today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you. I trust you will remain diligent with your health. Have a good day.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor. And thank you again for your kindness and thoroughness. I certainly will remain vigilant. Have a good day to you too.
