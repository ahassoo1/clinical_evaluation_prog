DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you are 44 years of age. Welcome to the clinic. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, forty-four. My back… it’s been really bad. Hurts a lot. Been hurting for… oh, maybe two weeks now? It just keeps getting worse, even with the pills the other doctor gave me.
DOCTOR: I see. And which doctor prescribed those pills, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramil. He’s… over by the hospital. He’s the one who found the… the thing. The cancer. He gave me the pills for the pain, but they don't seem to be working as good now. It's a different kind of hurt, I think. More… everywhere.
DOCTOR: Cancer, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. He told me… it was in my bones. A lot of bones. He said it was… stage four? I don't remember all the words, but it wasn’t good. He sent me here to… I think he said to see if you could help with the pain, mostly. It’s hard to do anything when it hurts this much. Even sleeping.
DOCTOR: Stage four… right. And you said Dr. Ramil is affiliated with the hospital?
PATIENT: Yes, he is. Big hospital, near the water. He's a nice man, but… he’s busy. I didn’t get a lot of time with him. Mostly just the nurse explaining things. She was good, but… it’s different talking to a doctor, you know? I just want the pain to be better. It’s like… a fire, all the time. And now it's spreading.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, Ms. Meigs, it appears Dr. Ramil did indeed refer you in for pain management. Let’s start with a thorough examination. I need to get a better understanding of where exactly the pain is located, and how it’s affecting your daily life. Could you point to the areas that are hurting the most?
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. Right here, in my back, is the worst. It started there. But now… it’s in my ribs, on both sides. And… my hip hurts too. It’s hard to bend over, or even sit for long. Just moving around is… bad. Everything hurts when I move. Even breathing sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s begin with your back. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not just one kind of hurt. Sometimes it’s sharp, like a stabbing. Other times it’s… a dull ache, like a heavy weight. And lately… it’s like burning. A deep, burning pain. It doesn't go away, even when I'm resting. And it feels… like it’s spreading, getting bigger. That's why I'm so worried.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned it’s affecting your breathing?
PATIENT: Yes. It hurts to take a deep breath. Not all the time, but when I try to… really fill my lungs, it’s like a sharp pain right here, under my ribs. It makes me scared to breathe too hard. I try to take small breaths, but then I feel… dizzy, you know? Like I’m not getting enough air. It’s… a bad feeling.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your lung sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally, but no obvious wheezing or crackles. There is tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine and ribs. Range of motion is significantly limited due to pain. I'm noting some muscle guarding as well. Now, have you noticed any weakness or numbness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. My legs feel… tired, sometimes. But not weak. And no numbness. It's more like… heavy. Like I’m dragging them around. It's hard to walk for a long time. But no numbness, no. And my feet are okay. They don't tingle or anything. Just… tired. Is that normal? I get so confused with everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue is not uncommon with chronic pain, Ms. Meigs. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Maybe twenty years? And… I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that healed fine. Nothing else, really. Just… the usual colds and flu. And now… this. This cancer. I don't even know what kind it is. Dr. Ramil didn't say much. He just said it was in my bones. And it's bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal twenty years ago, fractured arm in childhood. And the cancer diagnosis. Do you know what type of cancer it was diagnosed as, or where specifically in the bones it was located?
PATIENT: No, I don't. He said… multiple myeloma? I think that's what he said. But he said it fast, and I was… scared. He said it was in my spine and ribs, mostly. And… and some other places, but I don't remember. He had a lot of papers, and he was talking so fast. I asked the nurse, but she just said it was in my bones. I wish I knew more. It makes it hard to… understand what's happening. And to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Multiple myeloma… Yes, that aligns with what the nurse indicated. Unfortunately, Dr. Ramil’s notes are… remarkably sparse. He notes the diagnosis, some initial imaging, and the start of pain medication. Very little detail regarding staging or specific bone involvement. We will need to obtain those images for review. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pain medication prescribed by Dr. Ramil?
PATIENT: Just the pills he gave me. White ones. I take two, two times a day. Sometimes they help a little. But lately, like I said, they're not working as well. And I take a vitamin D pill, but I've been doing that for years. My sister told me to, for my bones. Irony, huh? Taking a pill for my bones, and… this. No other pills. Just the two white ones. And the vitamin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Two white pain pills twice daily, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. And I haven't ever been allergic to any medicine. My sister is allergic to bee stings, but I'm fine. Never been stung. So, no allergies. Just… this pain. It’s the only thing bothering me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I’m divorced. Been divorced for… oh, fifteen years now? No kids. I live alone, in a small house. I used to work at the fish cannery, but I had to stop when the pain got too bad. Now I mostly just stay home. Watch TV. Try to read. It’s hard to do much when you hurt all the time. I have a sister, she lives on the next island. We talk on the phone sometimes. And… that’s pretty much it. It's a quiet life. Too quiet now, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Divorced, no children, currently unemployed due to pain, living alone. I see. Now, Ms. Meigs, based on what you've told me, and my initial examination, it is clear you are experiencing significant pain. The multiple myeloma diagnosis, while unfortunately lacking detailed documentation from Dr. Ramil’s office, necessitates further investigation. I would like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a repeat series of imaging studies – including X-rays, CT scans, and potentially a bone marrow biopsy. These tests will help us determine the extent of the disease and guide our treatment plan. Until we have those results, we can focus on pain management. I can prescribe a stronger pain medication to help alleviate your discomfort. However, it's crucial to understand this is merely a temporary solution. We need to address the underlying cause of the pain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. More tests. And stronger pills. It sounds… a lot. But I guess it has to be done. I just want the pain to be better. I just want to be able to sleep through the night. And maybe… maybe walk to the store without hurting so much. So, yes. I understand. Whatever you think is best. Just… please help me with the pain. Is the stronger pill… will it make me sleepy? Or… confused? I don’t want to feel… out of it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Meigs. The medication I'm considering is an opioid, which does carry a risk of side effects such as drowsiness, constipation, and potentially confusion. We will start with a low dose and carefully monitor your response. We can also prescribe a stool softener to prevent constipation. I will also give you clear instructions on the potential side effects and what to do if you experience them. It’s important to take the medication exactly as prescribed and to avoid driving or operating machinery if you feel drowsy or impaired. In the meantime, I'm also going to order a referral to an oncologist. A specialist in multiple myeloma is best suited to manage your long-term care. I'll also have my nurse schedule you for those blood tests and imaging studies as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oncologist… that sounds… serious. Is it bad? And… the imaging, how long will that take? Will it hurt? I get nervous in those machines. And the pills… how long before they start to work? I’m just… a lot of things going on. I appreciate you helping, Doctor. I really do. But it’s a little overwhelming.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Meigs. It is a lot to process. A referral to an oncologist simply means we're seeking specialized care for your specific condition. It doesn't necessarily indicate a worsening of your situation, but rather a proactive step towards optimal treatment. The imaging studies shouldn't cause any pain, though you may feel claustrophobic in the machines. We can discuss strategies to manage that, such as medication or having a support person with you. And the pain medication usually begins to take effect within 30-60 minutes, though it may take a few days to reach its full therapeutic effect. We will adjust the dosage as needed to ensure you achieve adequate pain relief. To reiterate, the imaging will take approximately an hour, and the oncologist appointment will likely be in a week or two. In the meantime, I am prescribing a pain medication for you. I want to also make a note for my nurse to contact you to follow up on your anxiety, and potential resources. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that helps. Knowing it might take a few days for the pills to work… that’s good to know. And you'll help with the… the machine thing. Thank you. That really does help. I just… I don’t want to be alone with all of this. It's scary. What kind of oncologist are you sending me to? One that specializes in… bones? Or the… myeloma?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Meigs. I completely understand. It’s vital you don't feel alone during this process. I'm referring you to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a hematologist-oncologist specializing in multiple myeloma. She is highly regarded in the field and has extensive experience treating this specific condition. She will be able to assess your overall health, review the imaging studies, and develop a personalized treatment plan. I will also ensure her office is aware of your anxiety, so they can provide extra support during your appointment. I'm sending the referral now, and my nurse will contact you within 24 hours with scheduling information and pre-appointment instructions. Before you leave, are there any other questions or concerns I can address?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. You’ve been very helpful. And kind. Thank you. I really appreciate it. I’ll… I’ll wait for the nurse to call. And I’ll try not to worry too much. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. Please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, you are not alone in this. We will work together to ensure you receive the best possible care. Have a good day, and please take care.
