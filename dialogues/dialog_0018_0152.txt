DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I got a letter from the lab… something about my cholesterol being high. Hyper… something? It’s a bit of a worry, to be honest. I don't really understand all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite concerning to receive results you don’t fully comprehend. “Hyper…” likely refers to hyperlipidemia – that means you have high cholesterol. It’s very common, and thankfully, often manageable. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. I feel… normal, I guess. A bit tired sometimes, but I’m 54, so who doesn’t feel tired? I haven’t had any pain or anything like that. Does high cholesterol have symptoms? I thought it was something you just found out about, not something you felt.
DOCTOR: That’s a very astute observation, Ms. Geho. You are correct – high cholesterol often doesn’t present with noticeable symptoms in its early stages. That's why routine blood work is so important. However, sometimes it can contribute to other issues over time, which do have symptoms. To get a more complete picture, let's delve a little deeper into your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I had the flu once, bad as you’d expect, and I broke my wrist when I was a kid, but other than that… nothing serious. My doctor always said my blood pressure was good at my check-ups, and I haven't ever been told I have sugar problems. Oh! I did have a bit of trouble with acid reflux a few years back, but I changed my diet and it went away. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Geho. And yes, the history of acid reflux is helpful information. It suggests we should be mindful of potential dietary factors. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any, thankfully. I try to stay active, you see. Mostly walking and gardening. It keeps me busy, and I like being outdoors. Does that matter? I mean, does being active change things with this cholesterol business?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Geho! Staying active is very important for overall health, and it absolutely matters in relation to your cholesterol levels. Regular exercise can actually help to lower LDL cholesterol – the “bad” cholesterol – and raise HDL cholesterol – the “good” cholesterol. To continue building a comprehensive picture, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family history… that’s a bit tricky. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She was always a bit vague about it. She died when I was quite young, so I didn’t really get a chance to ask many questions. My father… he was healthy as a horse, smoked a pipe every day of his life and lived to be 85! So, not much help there, I’m afraid. It's either heart trouble or nothing at all, it seems. Does it matter if I don’t know exactly what my mother had?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Geho. It's not uncommon to have incomplete family medical history, and it's perfectly alright that you don't have all the details. Knowing anything about your mother’s health is helpful, but we can proceed even without a precise diagnosis. To round out the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone, mostly. I retired a few years back from working as an aerospace engineer - designing bits for satellites, mostly. Very interesting work! I cook for myself most nights, simple things. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, and I do like a little chocolate now and then. I don’t smoke, and I don’t really drink a lot of soda. I try to eat healthy, but I’m not fanatical about it, you see. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Ms. Geho. Thank you for sharing that information. It paints a clearer picture of your overall health habits. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I get a bit of aches and pains sometimes, you know, getting older. But I just try to rest and take it easy when I need to. I’ve got a friend who takes all sorts of things, and I just think it’s best to keep it simple if you can. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing. Just the occasional pain reliever if I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Geho. And I understand your preference for avoiding medication whenever possible. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and never had any problems. I sometimes get a bit of a runny nose in the spring, but I don’t think that’s an allergy, just… the pollen, I suppose. Oh! I did have a reaction to a bug bite once, when I was a child. It swelled up a bit, but it went away on its own. Nothing serious. So, no, nothing I’m actively allergic to, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Geho. That gives me a very complete picture of your medical background and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of your current health status. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Just tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm not used to being poked and prodded, but I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure does warrant some attention. Now, I do have your lab results here. Your total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol is 160 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol is 45 mg/dL, and triglycerides are 150 mg/dL. These results confirm that your cholesterol levels are elevated, particularly the LDL cholesterol.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Those numbers don’t sound very good, do they? 240… 160… I knew it was high, but those numbers sound quite alarming. What does it mean, exactly? Is it… serious? What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Geho. Those numbers are indeed higher than we would like to see, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's a crisis. Elevated cholesterol, particularly LDL cholesterol – that’s what we often call “bad” cholesterol – increases your risk of developing heart disease and stroke over time. Think of it like this: cholesterol can build up in the arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow. Your total cholesterol is above the optimal level of 200 mg/dL, and your LDL cholesterol is above the optimal level of 100 mg/dL. Your HDL cholesterol is adequate, but could be slightly higher. Your triglycerides are within the normal range. The good news is, we can take steps to manage your cholesterol and reduce your risk. We have several options. The first, and often most effective step, is lifestyle modifications. This includes dietary changes, increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. I’d like to discuss these in more detail. Would you be open to working with a registered dietician to create a personalized meal plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. A dietician would be good, I think. I could definitely do with some help in that department. I try to eat well, but I’m not very good at planning, and I do like my treats! What kind of things would I need to change? And what about exercise? I do enjoy my walks, but is that enough? I don’t really like going to the gym.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Geho. A dietician can provide personalized guidance and support. In terms of dietary changes, we would focus on reducing your intake of saturated and trans fats, which are found in foods like red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increasing your intake of soluble fiber, found in foods like oats, beans, and fruits, can also help lower cholesterol. We'd also discuss incorporating more healthy fats, such as those found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. As for exercise, your walks are a great starting point! Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. We can also explore other activities you enjoy, such as swimming, gardening, or cycling. The key is to find something you like and can sustain over the long term. Now, depending on your response to lifestyle modifications, we may also consider medication. However, I would like to try lifestyle changes first, and see how your cholesterol levels respond. Would you like me to write a referral to a registered dietician, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to reassess your cholesterol levels?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A referral to a dietician would be wonderful. Three months sounds good, too. Gives me time to try and get things under control, hopefully. So, less red meat, more oats… and keep walking. I can definitely do that. And I'll try to cut back on the chocolate. It's my weakness, you see. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any foods I should absolutely avoid? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Geho. It sounds like you have a good plan. And yes, besides reducing red meat and increasing oats, it's best to limit processed foods, fried foods, and sugary drinks. Trans fats are best avoided altogether, so check food labels for partially hydrogenated oils. I would also recommend limiting your alcohol intake to no more than one drink per day, if you drink at all. And while a small amount of dark chocolate can be beneficial, it's best to consume it in moderation. I’m going to write a prescription for a repeat lipid panel to be done in three months so we can track your progress. It is very important to follow up with these labs. I also want you to be aware of the signs and symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and weakness. If you experience any of these symptoms, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a handout with more detailed information on managing cholesterol, including dietary recommendations and exercise guidelines. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Less red meat, more walking, and keep an eye on those symptoms… I can do that. Thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. And for not making me feel too overwhelmed. It's a bit scary, finding out things like this, but I feel much better now knowing what to do. I'll schedule that follow-up appointment, and I'll see the dietician as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Geho. It’s understandable to feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but you're taking the right steps, and I’m confident you can manage your cholesterol effectively. Remember, I’m here to support you along the way. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day, Ms. Geho, and take care.
