DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? Seems like a lot for a little insurance.
DOCTOR: Yes, insurance companies often require a medical exam as part of the application process. That’s perfectly normal. So, to clarify, you don’t necessarily have any specific health concerns you're aware of, they're just requesting this as a standard procedure for the life insurance?
PATIENT: Right. No, nothing I know about, anyway. I feel… okay, I guess. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? It's just… getting older, I figure. I just want to get this over with so I can get my policy sorted.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It can be a bit of a hassle, but we'll try to make this as quick and straightforward as possible. "A little tired sometimes" is good information to start with. Could you tell me a bit more about that tiredness?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like I can't get out of bed or anything. It's just… at the end of the day, I'm pretty wiped. And sometimes in the afternoons, I just feel… slow, you know? Like I need a nap. Doesn't happen every day, but often enough to notice. I work at the hotel, lots of walking around. It could be that.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness at the end of the day and sometimes in the afternoons. And you mentioned you work at the hotel, which involves a lot of walking. That's helpful to know. Do you find anything specific makes it worse—certain activities, or is it just generally there?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think. Maybe if it’s really hot. That makes everything worse. But usually, it's just… there. Like I said, it's not a big deal. I've been doing this job for years, and I'm used to being on my feet. I just don't want this tiredness to stop me from getting insurance. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: It's good you've been doing this job for years, that gives us a baseline. And no, we're not at the point of worrying about it being a problem. I just want to get a full picture. Let's move onto some other things, just to be thorough. Have you noticed any other changes lately—anything at all—like with your appetite, your weight, or how often you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Appetite… pretty normal, I guess. I eat when I'm hungry. Weight… I think I’ve put on a few pounds, but who hasn’t? And… bathroom… regular. Nothing weird there. Look, Doctor, I'm a pretty simple guy. I work, I eat, I sleep. This is all a bit much, to be honest. I just need the insurance. Is there a form I can sign saying I'm basically healthy?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney. It does feel like a lot of questions when you're feeling well. However, it’s important to be thorough, even if everything seems normal. The insurance company requires specific information, and it's my responsibility to provide them with an accurate medical assessment. Before we discuss any forms, let’s just do a quick physical exam. It won’t take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. We can check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just take a general look. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… let's get it over with. Blood pressure, heart, lungs… you said it won't take long, right? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, it won’t take long at all. If you could just step over here and have a seat, we'll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and I'll take a reading. And just so you know, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope – completely normal procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… don't poke me too much. I'm not a fan of needles. I assume you're not going to need any blood, right? Because I really don’t like those.
DOCTOR: No needles at all today, Mr. Putney. We're just doing a basic exam – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a quick look in your ears and throat. Nothing invasive, I promise. Your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not significantly so. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Ears also appear clear. Everything sounds and looks good so far. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any. Just… normal. I'm really starting to think this is all a waste of time. Is there anything else? Can we wrap this up soon? I need to get back to work. My manager is going to be furious if I’m gone too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Putney. We are almost finished. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss next steps. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, that's about it. And… I broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was ages ago. Doesn't count, right? I mean, it healed perfectly fine. No problems since. Are we almost done yet? Seriously.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy in childhood and a broken arm, noted. No ongoing issues from either. That's good to know. And yes, we're almost finished. Just one last section - a few quick questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Has anyone in your family had heart problems, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. My dad… he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember exactly. And my aunt… she had cancer, a long time ago. She passed away, too. Look, it's not a happy subject, okay? I don’t like talking about this. Is this really necessary for the insurance? I just want to get a policy and move on with my life.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not a pleasant topic, Mr. Putney, and I apologize for bringing it up. It’s important information for the insurance company, and knowing about a family history of heart trouble or cancer can help them assess risk. It’s okay if you don’t remember all the details. Just knowing that your father had heart trouble and your aunt had cancer is sufficient for now. Okay, that’s everything. Based on our conversation and the exam, you're generally in good health, although your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and there's a family history of heart trouble and cancer. It's good to know. We can repeat the blood pressure check at a later date to see if it is consistent. Would you like me to explain what elevated blood pressure means?
PATIENT: No, no explanations. Just… can I go now? I really need to get back to work. And will this affect my insurance? Is it going to be more expensive? I just want a straight answer. This whole thing is stressing me out.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are free to go now. As for your insurance, it’s difficult to say definitively whether your blood pressure or family history will affect the cost. It depends on the specific insurance company's guidelines and underwriting process. I can provide them with a summary of our visit, including your vital signs and the information you’ve shared with me. They will then make a decision based on their assessment. Would you like me to send the summary to the insurance company directly, or would you prefer to take a copy with you?
PATIENT: Just give me the copy. I'd rather deal with it myself. I don’t trust anyone with my personal information these days. And… thanks, I guess. For not poking me with needles. Can I just get a note saying I was here, for my manager? He's really strict about paperwork.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. Here you are. The summary includes everything we discussed today, and the note confirms your visit with the time and date. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Putney. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to schedule another appointment. And I'm glad I didn't have to poke you with any needles!
