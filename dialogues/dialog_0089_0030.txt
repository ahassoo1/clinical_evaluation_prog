DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell, my body odor. It’s…different. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's not like my usual scent. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A change in body odor can be concerning, and it's good you're bringing it to my attention. It's helpful that you noticed a difference from your usual scent. First, let's try to get a bit more specific. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started, I’d say, maybe about three weeks ago? Around the 15th of July, give or take a few days. I remember because my niece, little Selam, was visiting, and she usually likes a big hug, but I didn't feel quite right letting her get too close that day. It wasn’t strong, exactly, just…different.
DOCTOR: Okay, around July 15th. And has it been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty consistent, yes. I haven't had any days where I didn't notice it at all. Some days it's a little stronger than others, maybe after I’ve been working, you know, laying floors. But it's always there, even when I've just showered.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned laying floors – is that your profession?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Floor layers, except carpet, wood, and hard tiles. It’s physical work, a lot of bending and sweating. I’ve been doing it for…oh, goodness, almost twenty years now. It keeps me busy, that's for sure. But it does mean I'm active throughout the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know about the physical work. That could certainly be a factor. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this altered body odor?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I haven't been feeling sick, no fever or anything. My energy levels are normal, I guess. Maybe… maybe I've been a little more tired after work, but that's to be expected, right? Twenty years of laying floors takes it out of you! My appetite is the same, and I haven’t lost any weight. I don’t think so, anyway. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, appetite is normal. And the extra tiredness is likely related to your work. Let's talk about your usual hygiene routine. How often do you shower, and what kind of soap do you typically use?
PATIENT: I usually shower every day, first thing in the morning. Sometimes twice if I’ve been really dirty at work. I use… let me see… it’s a Dove bar, usually. Just the regular moisturizing one. I've been using it for years, haven't changed it. And I always use deodorant, too, usually Secret. I switch scents sometimes, but always Secret. I don’t think it’s the deodorant, because I've tried different kinds, and it's still there.
DOCTOR: Okay, daily showers with Dove, deodorant use… that rules out a few things. Have you noticed any changes in your sweat itself?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Hmm… I don't know. It doesn’t feel different, if that makes sense. Not stickier or anything. It just… smells different. I hadn’t really paid attention to the sweat itself before, to be honest. I just notice the smell afterwards. It's… harder to describe. Not a stronger smell, but… off. Like something isn’t right.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. And occasionally ibuprofen for aches and pains after work, but not regularly. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I had a prescription for blood pressure a few years back, but I don’t take it anymore. The doctor said it was just stress, and it went down when I retired from that last job.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. No regular medications. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Well, I had a bit of trouble with my thyroid a long time ago, maybe ten years back? They said it was borderline, but it seemed to sort itself out, and I haven’t had any problems since. Other than that… no, not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. No diabetes, no kidney problems that I know of. I had a hysterectomy about fifteen years ago, but that’s it, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of borderline thyroid issues, a hysterectomy fifteen years ago, and otherwise generally healthy. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tricky one. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart trouble later in life. My sister has arthritis, but that's about all I can think of right now. It wasn't a very close family, to be honest. We didn’t talk about medical history much. They are both gone now, unfortunately. It's hard to remember details, even if I did know them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions that may seem a little personal, but it’s important to rule out everything. Have you noticed any new skin changes recently?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, actually. Now that you mention it. I’ve got a little patch of skin under my arm, on my left side, that’s gotten a little darker. And a bit itchy sometimes. It's not a rash, exactly, more like… discoloration. It's been there for maybe a couple of months, I think. I hadn’t really paid much attention to it, just thought it was from shaving. But it hasn’t gone away. It's not painful, just noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information. A darkened, itchy patch under your left arm for a couple of months. Now, before we proceed, let's just clarify – you said this started around July 15th, right around the time you noticed the change in body odor?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was around the same time. Maybe a week or so apart, but definitely around then. I remember because I was getting ready for my niece’s visit, and that's when I first noticed both things, the smell and the patch of skin. I wasn't thinking they were connected at first, just two separate things happening at the same time. Now that you ask, though, it does seem a bit strange that they both started around then.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Kerriann, I see here you had a routine check-up in 2023 with no significant findings. Given the timing and your symptoms—the change in body odor and the darkened patch of skin—I’m leaning towards a few possibilities. It could be related to a skin condition, or possibly a hormonal change, even after your hysterectomy. To be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a closer look at the area under your arm and check for anything else. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. I’d like to know what’s going on, and I trust your judgment. A physical exam sounds good. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable, and I'll let you know if I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Please have a seat on the examination table and lean forward slightly. I’m just going to take a look at your underarms and then listen to your heart and lungs to get a complete picture. I'll be gentle. Alright, Kerriann. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, your left armpit does indeed have a patch of discoloration, slightly darker than the surrounding skin. It doesn’t feel overly tender to the touch, but it’s definitely there. I also notice a subtle, slightly unusual odor in that area. It’s not overwhelming, but it's distinct. It could be something benign, like a mild skin irritation, but given your concerns and the change in body odor, I want to be cautious. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a simple blood test to check your thyroid levels and kidney function, just to be sure everything is working properly. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A blood test is fine. I'd rather be safe than sorry. It's good you're being thorough. I understand these things happen, and I trust your professional opinion. When would I be able to get that done? And where?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. We have a lab right downstairs, room 102. They’re open until 5 PM today. You don't need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Roseburrough ordered the tests for you, and they'll take care of it. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. Once they’re in, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you notice any changes—like increased pain, redness, swelling, or a fever—please don’t hesitate to call the office right away. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all sounds very clear. Room 102, no appointment, and wait for a call about the results. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. You've put my mind at ease a bit, even if we haven't got the answer yet. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a bit. We'll get to the bottom of this. If anything else comes to mind, please don’t hesitate to call. .
