DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… kinda embarrassing, to be honest. I’m havin’ a real hard time gettin’ out of chairs. Like, I sit down, no problem, but when I try to stand up… it’s just… tough. Feels like somethin’s stuck, or really tight.
DOCTOR: I see. It’s perfectly alright to be embarrassed, Mr. Fratoni, that’s why you came to see me. Many people experience difficulties like this. It takes courage to discuss these things. So, you’re finding it difficult to stand up from a seated position. Could you describe exactly where you’re feeling the tightness or stuck sensation?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my hips, I think. And kinda down the backs of my legs. Not like a pain, exactly, more like… a pull. And it feels worse after I’ve been sittin’ for a while. Like, the longer I stay put, the harder it gets. It's in both legs, but the left one feels a little worse than the right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Fratoni. So, the difficulty standing and the pulling sensation are primarily in your hips and down the backs of your legs, and it worsens with prolonged sitting. You also mentioned the left leg is a bit more affected than the right. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… lemme think. It started… probably about three months ago? At first it was just a little stiff, y’know? I figured I just slept wrong. But it’s gotten steadily worse since then. Now it’s… well, it’s gettin’ to the point where I gotta kinda brace myself with my hands to push myself up. It’s gettin’ to be a problem with work, too. A lot of sittin’ in trucks, or on equipment.
DOCTOR: Three months ago, starting as stiffness and gradually worsening to the point where you need to use your hands to stand. And it’s impacting your work, given the amount of sitting involved. Okay. Have you experienced any pain associated with this – sharp pain, dull ache, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Not really sharp pain, no. It’s more of a… dull ache sometimes, when I’ve been tryin’ to get up. And if I really push myself too hard, it’ll get kinda sore for a bit afterwards. Not like, can’t-walk sore, just… uncomfortable. And sometimes, it feels kinda… numb, in my legs, especially after I’ve been sittin’ a long time. Not totally numb, just… tingly and kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Dull aches with exertion, and tingling/weakness after prolonged sitting. Thank you for that detail. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as arthritis, back problems, or anything else that might be relevant?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ diagnosed, no. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Just the usual colds and flu, y’know? I busted my shoulder pretty bad when I was younger, workin’ on an oil rig, but that healed up okay. Other than that… nothin’ really. Never had any trouble with my hips or legs before this started. I stay pretty active when I can. A lot of walkin' at work and stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no prior medical diagnoses, a past shoulder injury that healed, and otherwise generally healthy. You mentioned staying active. Have you had any recent injuries to your hips or legs, even minor ones, that you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… Now that you mention it, I did kinda tweak my lower back a couple of weeks ago, liftin’ some heavy equipment. Didn’t think much of it at the time, just a little sore for a day or two. But maybe that's got somethin’ to do with this? It’s kinda hard to remember exactly when things started gettin’ worse… everything kinda blends together when you're workin’ long hours.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Mr. Fratoni. A recent lower back strain could certainly be related. Alright. And just to cover all bases, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, nothin’ at all. I don’t really believe in takin’ a bunch of pills if I can avoid it. I might take an ibuprofen now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. And even then, I don’t do it very often. I mostly just try to push through things, I guess. Not the smartest thing, probably, but… it’s what I’m used to.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Fratoni. Okay, no regular medications or supplements. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I ain’t afraid of a little discomfort, but… I’d like to know what’s comin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Great. If you wouldn't mind, please sit on the table facing me. I’m going to start by checking your range of motion in your hips, and then I'll do some gentle tests to assess your muscle strength and reflexes in your legs. We'll also check your back. I will explain each step as I go, and please let me know immediately if anything causes you pain. Alright, starting with your lower back… Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: Yeah, kinda. It’s not sharp, but it’s definitely tender right around here. Feels kinda tight, too. Like a knot. And it kinda aches when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some muscle spasm and tenderness there, as you described. Now, let’s check your hip range of motion. I’m going to ask you to bend your knee and try to bring it up towards your chest. Just as far as you comfortably can. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oof. That’s… tight. It’s not bad pain, but it definitely feels restricted. Like somethin’s pullin’. And it’s harder than it should be. My left leg feels kinda the same, but maybe a little worse. That one’s definitely tighter.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some restriction in your hip flexion bilaterally, with the left side being more limited. Now, let's try some external rotation. Can you lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Like this?
DOCTOR: Perfect. Now, I’m going to gently rotate your legs outward. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Whoa, that's… not great. My left hip really doesn't like that. It feels kinda… stuck. Not a sharp pain, but definitely uncomfortable. My right hip feels okay, a little stiff, but not like the left one. It’s like somethin’s blockin’ it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m noting some resistance and discomfort with external rotation of the left hip. That, combined with the other findings, is giving me some ideas. Now, does this area feel tender?
PATIENT: Yeah, that spot… right there… that’s tender. Not like a sharp pain, but definitely sensitive when you press on it. Kinda achy. It feels… bony, too. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Okay, Mr. Fratoni, based on the history and the physical exam findings – the difficulty standing, tightness in the hips and backs of your legs, lower back pain, restricted hip range of motion, and tenderness over the greater trochanter – it appears you are likely experiencing a combination of hip impingement – also known as femoroacetabular impingement, or FAI – and possibly some gluteal tendinopathy, which is inflammation of the tendons around your hip. It's also important to rule out other potential causes, however. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an X-ray of your hips to assess the joint structure. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: X-ray… yeah, that’s fine. If it’ll help figure out what’s goin’ on, sure. I ain’t afraid of a little radiation. So… hip impingement and… what was the other thing? Tendino-… somethin’? Is that serious? Is it gonna require surgery? I gotta work, y’know? Can’t be laid up for months.
DOCTOR: Tendinopathy – inflammation of the tendons. And no, it doesn’t necessarily mean surgery. Many cases of hip impingement and tendinopathy can be managed with conservative treatment – things like physical therapy, stretching, strengthening exercises, and pain management. The X-ray will help us confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other underlying issues. I'm going to write an order for an X-ray of both hips. The receptionist will schedule that for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms – things like prolonged sitting, heavy lifting, and deep squats. I will also prescribe an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medication, like ibuprofen, to help with the pain and inflammation. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan. If conservative measures aren't effective, we can consider other options, such as injections or, as a last resort, surgery. But let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. One step at a time is good. I’d really prefer to avoid surgery if I can. I’ll try to take it easy, avoid sittin’ too long, and I’ll take those pills. What about work? Should I talk to my boss about lighter duties, maybe? I don't wanna lose my job over this. Is there anything else I should be doin’ right now? Like, stretchin’ or somethin’? Or avoidin’ certain movements?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, talking to your boss about lighter duties is a good idea. Explain the situation and see if you can modify your tasks to reduce strain on your hips. That's very proactive. For now, avoid any movements that cause pain or discomfort. This means no deep squats, lunges, or twisting motions. Gentle stretching can be helpful, but listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain. Specifically, you can try some gentle hip flexor stretches and glute stretches, but don’t push yourself too hard. I’m going to print out a handout with some examples of appropriate exercises. I also recommend applying ice to your hips for 15-20 minutes at a time, several times a day, to help with the pain and inflammation. I will also give you a work note excusing you from strenuous activities. The receptionist can help you with that as well. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the X-ray results and create a more detailed treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You explained everything really well. I feel a little better knowin’ what’s goin’ on, even if it ain’t great news. I appreciate you not jumpin’ to surgery right away. I’ll try to take it easy, and I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Fratoni. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. Remember, we’ll take it one step at a time, and we’ll work together to get you back to feeling your best. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
