DOCTOR: Right. Sasha Queener, 59 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor... Batara, is it? Yes. It's… my leg. It's been swelling. After the… treatment. You know, for the bad stuff. It just keeps getting bigger, and it feels… tight. It's not painful painful, but… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Treatment for the bad stuff?
PATIENT: Cancer. I had cancer. A few years ago now. They did… things. Lots of appointments, pills, and then… the radiation. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. But the leg started swelling after that. It's my right leg, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right, radiation therapy to the right leg. And this swelling... when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… maybe six months ago? It started small, just a little puffiness around the ankle, really. I thought it was just from walking too much, you know? But it hasn’t gone down. It just… keeps getting worse.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed about the swelling recently?
PATIENT: Well… yes. It’s… warmer now. Not hot, exactly, but warmer than my other leg. And sometimes… it feels a little bit heavy. Like… I have a weight on it. It’s hard to explain. And… it’s a bit red, too. I hadn’t noticed that before today.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a closer look. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Yes, of course. It’s a bit high.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to feel around here. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender. And I'm noting some redness and warmth, as you mentioned. There is definitely some edema present… quite a bit, actually. Can you tell me if you've noticed any skin breakdown or open sores?
PATIENT: No, no sores. The skin feels… normal, I think. A little tight, but not broken or anything. Oh! That’s a bit sore. Right… there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pulses feel… diminished compared to your left leg. This is concerning. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? No, not that I know of. I’ve had… lots of tests over the years, because of the cancer, but nobody ever mentioned anything about clots. I had some… tiredness after the radiation. And some trouble with my appetite, but that’s it. Honestly, Doctor, it’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you've told me and my examination, this sounds like possible post-radiation lymphedema, potentially with a superimposed deep vein thrombosis – a blood clot. We need to rule that out immediately. I'm going to order a Doppler ultrasound of your right leg. That will show us if there's a clot present.
PATIENT: A… a Doppler what? A clot?! Oh dear. That sounds… bad. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: A Doppler ultrasound is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to look at the blood flow in your leg. And a blood clot can be serious, yes. It can lead to complications if left untreated. That’s why we need to find out for sure. I'm going to have the nurse draw some blood work as well – a D-dimer test, which can help indicate if a clot is present. It’s standard procedure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Tests are good. Knowing is good. So… blood tests and… a sound thing. Will it… hurt? And… how long will it take? I have a bridge game tomorrow…
DOCTOR: The blood draw will be a quick pinch, nothing more. The ultrasound will take about 30-45 minutes. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for it immediately. As for your bridge game… that will depend on the results of these tests. If it is a clot, you will need to be on blood thinners, and that might mean postponing it. Right now, we focus on getting answers. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or iodine?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Latex is fine, and… iodine, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. Thirty to forty-five minutes… I hope it doesn't take too long. It's Myrtle's birthday tomorrow, and she makes a lovely lemon cake.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll have the nurse come in to start the blood work, and we'll get the ultrasound scheduled as soon as possible. We’ll review the results as soon as they come in. Until then, try to elevate your leg as much as possible. And no, I cannot guarantee you will make it to your bridge game. Let's prioritize your health for now. I’ll be back to discuss the results with you as soon as I have them.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevate… yes, I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. .
