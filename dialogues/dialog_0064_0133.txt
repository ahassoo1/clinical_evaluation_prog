DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just need some papers signed and verified. Some health forms… for a program I’m trying to get into. I don't want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. We can definitely take care of those forms for you. Just to be thorough, even though you’re primarily here for paperwork, I do like to get a little bit of background information from all my patients. It helps me understand your overall health picture, even if it’s just for a quick check. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I suppose that's sensible. Just… try to keep it brief, if you wouldn’t mind? I’ve got a few things I need to get to after this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. I’ll be as quick as possible. Let's start with a little bit about why you're applying for this program, if you don’t mind sharing. And then we can go through a quick overview of your health history. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: It’s a senior assistance program, mostly for help with… well, everything, really. Getting older isn’t easy, you know? And yes, the health history is fine. Though, to be honest, I don't remember everything perfectly these days. I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling things. We’ll take it slow, and don’t worry about being precise with every detail. We can work through it together. First, let’s talk about any current health concerns you’re experiencing. Are you having any pain, discomfort, or other symptoms that have been bothering you lately?
PATIENT: Well, my knees ache something awful when it rains. And I get winded pretty easily, even just walking to the mailbox. Nothing serious, I don't think. Just…old age. I also have a little trouble sleeping sometimes. That's been happening more and more lately. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, Melvenia, that absolutely counts. Knee pain, shortness of breath, and trouble sleeping are all things we should be aware of. The knee pain, especially with the rain, could indicate some arthritis. The shortness of breath is something we’ll want to explore a little more, just to be sure everything is alright. And trouble sleeping can affect so many things. Now, regarding that shortness of breath – is it when you’re exerting yourself, or does it happen even when you're at rest?
PATIENT: Mostly when I’m doing something, like walking uphill or carrying groceries. If I just sit and rest, I’m usually okay. Though, sometimes when I lie flat in bed, it feels like I can’t get a full breath. It’s… unsettling. I don’t get it often, but it worries me when it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s exertional, and sometimes happens when lying flat. That gives us a little more to work with. It could be related to your heart, or your lungs, or even just a bit of fluid buildup. We'll need to do a quick examination to get a better idea. Before we do that, let’s briefly go over your past medical history, if you’re up for it. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had pneumonia a long time ago, when I was maybe in my fifties. And… oh! I had my gallbladder removed, probably twenty years ago. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I didn’t go to the doctor much, even when I was younger. I didn’t like doctors. Still don’t, really. But I need these forms signed…
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Melvenia. Pneumonia and gallbladder removal are important pieces of information. I understand your reluctance towards doctors, and I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll focus on getting those forms completed, but I want to make sure we cover the basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, pretty much. And I’ve taken a lot of different medicines over the years for little things… headaches, colds, that sort of thing. Never had a reaction. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn't I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely would. Good. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. I try not to take too many pills. I don't like how they make me feel.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Let’s quickly check your height and weight, and then I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I have an appointment I need to be at this afternoon. The sooner we finish, the better. I'm 5'11", if that matters. And I haven’t weighed myself in ages, but I’m… light. Always have been.
DOCTOR: Alright. Five eleven, and light. We’ll get a precise weight here in a moment. If you wouldn't mind stepping on the scale, please. And then we’ll just listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Hurry it up, please. I’m really not comfortable with all this poking and prodding. And don't tell me my weight. I'd rather not know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. I’m listening now. Take some nice, deep breaths for me, if you can. Your heart sounds regular, but I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs. It’s subtle, but it’s there. It could be due to a number of things – allergies, a previous cold, or even just some mild asthma. Your breathing sounds a little labored as well. I’m going to have you sit up now, and I’ll check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. It's reading 92%. That's a little low. Normally, we like to see that above 95%.
PATIENT: 92? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you I didn’t feel right. I knew something was off. Now you're telling me my oxygen is low? This is just great. I really wish I hadn’t come here. What’s going to happen now?
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia, please try to stay calm. 92% is a little low, and that's why I want to investigate further. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant some attention. It could be a number of things, even a temporary issue. Given your symptoms – shortness of breath, wheezing, and the low oxygen saturation – I think it’s best if we get a chest X-ray to take a look at your lungs. It'll help us rule out anything serious, like pneumonia or fluid buildup. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh, Lord. More poking and prodding. And radiation… I’ve heard about radiation. Is it absolutely necessary? I just need these forms signed, Doctor! Can’t you just sign them? I don't understand why this has turned into a whole ordeal. I feel perfectly fine, mostly. Just a little winded, that’s all. And my knees ache. Is there anything you can do without giving me an X-ray?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Melvenia, and I truly apologize for this turning into more than you expected. I wouldn't recommend an X-ray if it wasn't important. Given your symptoms and the low oxygen level, it's the safest way to get a clear picture of what’s going on in your lungs. However, if you are absolutely opposed to an X-ray at this time, we can proceed differently. I would strongly recommend a referral to a pulmonologist – a lung specialist. They could perform more detailed breathing tests and assess your condition further. But that will require an appointment, and it may take some time to get in to see one. Given your age and symptoms, I'm erring on the side of caution. But the decision is ultimately yours. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: A specialist… another doctor… more waiting… honestly, it’s just too much. Fine. Fine, do the X-ray. But make it quick. And tell me if it’s going to hurt. I don’t want any surprises. And then, please, just sign the forms. I've wasted enough time here already. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. We'll get the X-ray done as quickly as possible. It won’t hurt at all – you’ll just stand or sit still while the machine takes a picture. The technician will explain everything to you. I'll step out now to arrange it for you. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and I’ll get those forms signed for you. I’ll also make a note of the pulmonologist referral, just in case. Is there anyone you’d like me to call while you’re having the X-ray, just in case?
PATIENT: No. No one. Just… get it over with. And then those forms. I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. I’ll go ahead and get the ball rolling with the X-ray. The technician will be in shortly. Please let me know if you need anything at all. I’ll be right back to check on you as soon as I can. .
