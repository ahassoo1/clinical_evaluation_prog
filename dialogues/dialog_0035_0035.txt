DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Oh, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. Been going on for… well, a few days now, I reckon. It's a bit embarrassing, really, when you're trying to have a nice chat and hic… there it is again!
DOCTOR: Okay, a few days of hiccups. That is frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… let me think… Tuesday, I believe. I was having lunch with Elsie – lovely woman, Elsie, makes the best coconut cream pie – and just mid-sentence, hic… there one was! And they haven’t really gone away since. They come and go, mostly after I eat, but sometimes just… randomly. Not painful, just… annoying. And a bit tiring, to be honest, all that hic… you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Annoying is a good way to put it. Do they happen mostly when you're eating, or drinking?
PATIENT: Mostly eating, I think. Though I had a few this morning while I was watering my hibiscus. Didn't think that'd set them off! And it's not like I'm gulping down my food or anything. I take nice, small bites, always have. Elsie says I eat like a bird, which is sweet, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they're associated with eating, but also seem to happen spontaneously sometimes. Have you tried anything to get rid of them already?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Elsie swore by a spoonful of sugar. Didn't do a thing, except make me feel a bit sticky. Then I tried holding my breath – that just made me dizzy. And my grandson, David, told me to drink water upside down. Now that was a mess! Nothing's worked, Doctor. That's why I thought I’d best come see you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be sure, have you noticed anything else happening at the same time as the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, not really. My appetite’s been alright, maybe a little less than usual, but that could just be the heat, you know? It's been awfully warm lately. And my stomach hasn't been upset or anything. Oh! I did feel a little bit of heartburn yesterday afternoon, but I had a spicy curry for dinner. Probably that, I reckon. Nothing else, really. Just these pesky hic… hiccups!
DOCTOR: Okay, so no other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. And you had some mild heartburn, potentially related to the curry. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… forty years now, give or take. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my knees, makes walking a bit stiff sometimes. Other than that, not much, really. I’ve always been a pretty healthy woman, thankfully. Oh! And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's well-controlled with medication. Dr. Patel keeps a close eye on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, arthritis in the knees, and high blood pressure well-controlled with medication. Do you recall what medication you're taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I believe it’s Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril, ten milligrams, once a day. Dr. Patel switched me to that a few years back; said it was gentler on my kidneys. He's a good doctor, Dr. Patel. Very thorough.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril ten milligrams daily. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything, not even mosquito bites. My mother always said I had tough skin! I've been lucky that way, really. No, no allergies at all.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, just to finish up with the background questions, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my blood pressure medication, Doctor. Oh, and sometimes I take a little bit of Vitamin D in the winter, when it’s cloudy. But I haven’t taken any this year, we’ve had quite a bit of sunshine. And that’s it, really. Nothing else. Just a simple life, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, so just Lisinopril and occasional Vitamin D. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll just take a look in your throat and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I always trust you doctors to know what you're doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds clear in your lungs and your heart rate is regular. Your throat looks normal. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the upper region when I press here. Not anything to be overly concerned about, but good to note. Now, I'm going to order a basic blood test to rule out any electrolyte imbalances or other issues that could be contributing to the hiccups. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps to find out what's causing these pesky hic… well, you know. Electrolytes… is that like salts in your body? I always try to use a little less salt in my cooking, but Elsie says a pinch makes everything taste better. If it helps, yes, please go ahead with the blood test.
DOCTOR: Yes, electrolytes are like salts in your body. And it’s good you're mindful of your salt intake. We just want to make sure everything is balanced. The lab results usually take a couple of days. In the meantime, let’s try a medication called Baclofen. It's sometimes used to treat hiccups, and it doesn’t have a lot of side effects. We’ll start with a low dose and see if it helps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Baclofen, you say? Never heard of it before, but if you think it might help… yes, please. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Low dose sounds good too. I don't want to feel all… funny or anything. As long as I can still enjoy my Elsie's coconut cream pie!
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m prescribing Baclofen, ten milligrams, three times a day. If it doesn't help after three days, we'll adjust the dose. I'm also going to put in a note to rule out any potential cardiac causes, just as a precaution. It’s unlikely, but we want to be thorough. I'll give you a prescription to take to the pharmacy. Now, if the hiccups continue, or if you develop any new symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Yes, that's very clear, Doctor. Ten milligrams three times a day… and if anything new happens, emergency room. I will definitely remember that. Elsie would have a fit if I didn't take care of myself! I appreciate you being so thorough. It’s reassuring to know you're looking at everything.
DOCTOR: Good. I'm glad I could reassure you. And tell Elsie I said hello! Here’s the prescription, and this is a summary of our visit. If you have any questions after you leave, please don't hesitate to call the office. We’ll follow up with you in a few days to see how the medication is working. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of these hiccups. I'll definitely tell Elsie you said hello – she’ll be thrilled! Thank you so much for your time.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mirriam. Get some rest, and hopefully, the Baclofen will do the trick. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. Have a good day!
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. And thank you again.
