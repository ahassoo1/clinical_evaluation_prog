DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. My name is Dr. Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... well, it's this pain. When I take a deep breath, it hurts. It’s… hard to explain. It just does. Been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, things aren’t so clear in my head these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if it’s difficult to explain. We’ll take our time. So, the pain happens when you take a deep breath. Can you tell me where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It feels… here. Not like a sharp pain, more like a… ache. Deep inside. It’s hard to pinpoint, really. All feels kinda… bundled up in there. Sorry, I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ruocco. It’s helpful that you describe it as an ache, and that it’s deep inside your chest. Does the pain radiate anywhere – meaning, does it spread to your arm, back, neck, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Radiate… does that mean it goes somewhere else? I… think maybe a little bit to my back, sometimes. Not always. And… oh, my shoulder feels a bit tight on the same side. But I get tightness in my shoulder a lot, so I don't know if that’s related. It’s all a bit of a muddle, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be confusing to pinpoint. So, pain in your chest, sometimes radiating to your back, and tightness in your left shoulder. When did you first notice this pain starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. A while ago now. Maybe… a few months? It started slow, I think. Just a little discomfort. I didn’t pay much attention to it at first. Probably when the weather got warmer. Everything aches more when it’s humid, you know? It’s just gotten… more noticeable lately. I really can’t say for sure when it started. Time… it slips away, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. A few months ago, starting slowly and becoming more noticeable recently. Has anything specific made the pain worse – like coughing, exertion, or lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… Coughing, yes, that definitely makes it worse. A bad cough, especially. And… well, bending over. When I try to pick things up, sometimes. Exertion, you said? Yes, that too. Walking up the stairs… it’s not good. Lying down… no, I don't think so. Actually, lying down sometimes helps a little. It’s hard to say for sure though. Everything feels different from one day to the next.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coughing, bending, and walking up stairs seem to worsen the pain, and lying down offers some relief. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain – like shortness of breath, a cough, fever, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… yes. A little bit. But I’ve always been a bit… winded, you know? I get out of breath easily. I figured it was just my age. As for a cough… not really. No fever, either. Swelling… no, my legs seem okay. I do get tired easily, but that’s just… getting old, right? I don’t think any of that’s connected. Honestly, I just want to figure out what’s causing this pain. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ruocco. We want to get to the bottom of this. You mentioned the pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like heart problems, lung disease, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s another hard one. Let me think… I had something… when I was younger. With my heart, I think. But it was a long time ago. They gave me some pills. I don’t remember what it was called. And… arthritis, yes. My wife always said I had arthritis. In my hands, mostly. But I never really went to the doctor much. Just took some over-the-counter stuff. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I don’t have a good memory for things like that. I really don’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a heart condition treated with medication in the past, and arthritis. Do you happen to know what medication you were taking for your heart?
PATIENT: No, no, I really don’t. It was… a long time ago. A small white pill, maybe? Or blue? I honestly can’t remember. My wife always handled the pills, and the appointments. She’s… gone now. I just don’t keep track of those things. I wish I did. It's all a muddle. Is this important? Will knowing the pill help?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Ruocco. Don’t worry about it. It's understandable that it's difficult to remember details from the past, especially after losing your wife. We can still proceed without knowing the specific medication. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I was in the hospital once, when I fell and broke my hip. A few years back. That was… not pleasant. Other than that… I don't think so. I’ve always tried to stay out of the hospital if I could. It's not a nice place, you know? And like I said, my wife handled most of everything. This is all a bit… overwhelming. I’m getting tired.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be overwhelming. It's perfectly fine to take things slowly. So, you had your appendix removed as a child and were hospitalized for a broken hip a few years ago. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any heart problems, lung disease, or other serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… My father… he had something with his heart. I think. He died when I was young. And my mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. She lived to be a good age though. Most of my siblings… they were healthy, as far as I know. But we didn't see each other much, after we all grew up. It’s been a long time. I’m not very good at keeping track of family history, I’m afraid. Is this important, Doctor? I’m starting to feel a bit… confused.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Ruocco. You've given me a good overview. It's helpful to know about your father's heart condition and your mother's high blood pressure. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asked me if I was allergic to something before giving me a pill, and I always told her no. I really don’t think so. I eat anything, pretty much. No problems. I’m not a picky eater. Is that helpful? I really want to get this sorted out. This pain… it's just bothersome.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not a single one. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I just… don't. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. Nothing regular. I really try to stay away from those things. I'm a simple man, Doctor. I just want to feel better. This is… enough questions for now, isn't it? Can we figure out what’s wrong with me? I'm getting tired and a bit… flustered.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Ruocco, we can certainly proceed. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your chest for tenderness. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A physical exam… I suppose so. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't like being poked and prodded, if I’m honest. But… if you think it’s necessary. Go ahead, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. I’m an old man. And… hurry, if you could. I have things to do, you know? It's a nice day outside, and I don't want to waste it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Ruocco. I’ll be as gentle as possible and we’ll take our time. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… I’m hearing some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of your lungs, and I do notice some tenderness when I press on your chest wall here on the left side. Your heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. No murmurs detected. I don't feel any swelling in your legs or ankles. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing some discomfort related to your lungs or possibly even your heart. The diminished breath sounds and tenderness could indicate some inflammation or fluid buildup in your lungs. The history of a heart condition also needs to be investigated further. I want to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs and rule out any pneumonia or fluid buildup. I also recommend an EKG to check the electrical activity of your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray… and EKG… That sounds… serious. Is something really wrong? Pneumonia… that sounds awful. And my heart… I haven’t thought about that in years. I don’t want a lot of tests, Doctor. I just want to know what’s causing this pain. Can’t you just give me something for the pain? Maybe some pills? I really don’t want to spend the rest of the day in a hospital getting poked and prodded. Just tell me what’s wrong, and give me something to make it better. Please? I'm an old man, and I don’t have much energy for all this. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: .
