DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Head… back of head hurts. Been hurting… maybe three days now? Not real bad all the time, but… there. Like a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache at the back of your head for three days. Hmm. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. More when I… think too much, maybe? Or if I bend over. Not when I’m… resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems related to activity, particularly thinking and bending. Any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: No… not really. Maybe… a little tired. But I am old. <chuckles softly> Hard to tell what’s just old and what’s… something else.
DOCTOR: Right, well, fatigue can be common. Any nausea, vomiting, vision changes, weakness, or numbness?
PATIENT: No, no to all of that. Vision… same as always. A little blurry without my glasses, but always has been. No… sick to my stomach. And arms and legs… work okay. A little slow, maybe, but… okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just to get a better idea of things, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a neurological exam. Just simple things, nothing to worry about. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I trust you, doctor.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 86. Pulse is steady at 78. Now, let’s just do a few quick checks with your reflexes and strength. Could you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes. <follows the doctor's finger slowly, carefully> Like this? Good?
DOCTOR: Good, good. And now I’m going to gently press on a few spots on your arms and legs, just to check your reflexes. Tell me if that feels different on either side. <tests reflexes and observes any asymmetry> Okay, a little diminished on the left side, but not dramatically so. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: <squeezes the doctor’s hands with moderate strength> Like this? Strong enough? It’s a little hard, you know. Hands aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. A little weaker on the left hand, but nothing alarming. Now, I’m just going to lightly touch your face and arms with this, and you tell me if you feel the same sensation on both sides. <tests sensation on both sides of the face and arms> Okay. Everything seems relatively equal there. <pauses, thinking> It's subtle, but there is some mild weakness and diminished reflexes on the left side. Given your age and the nature of the headache, I think we should order a CT scan of your head just to rule out anything serious. It's better to be safe. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… a scan? Is it… dangerous? I don’t like… being scanned. And… how much does it cost? I don’t have much money.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. A CT scan uses X-rays, so there is a small amount of radiation, but it’s a very low dose. And it's the best way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. As for the cost… that's a good question. Because you’re uninsured, it can be expensive. We can discuss options with the hospital billing department and see if there are any financial assistance programs available. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, help you with that. It's important to figure this out because it will help us determine the cause of your headache and ensure you get the right treatment. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever. It won’t fix the problem, but it might help with the discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… a pain reliever sounds good. And yes, please… talk to Maria. She’s a nice woman. I trust you, doctor. Just… I worry about the money.
DOCTOR: I understand. Maria will explain everything clearly, and we'll do our best to find a solution. I'll write you a prescription for acetaminophen. Take two tablets every four to six hours as needed for the headache, but don’t exceed eight tablets in 24 hours. We’ll get the CT scan scheduled as soon as possible. And please, if the headache gets significantly worse, or you experience any weakness, numbness, vision changes, or fever, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, doctor. <shifts uncomfortably in the chair> I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. We're here to help. Maria will be in shortly to assist you with the prescription and the scan scheduling. And again, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you. Goodbye. <slowly rises from the chair, adjusting his hat>
