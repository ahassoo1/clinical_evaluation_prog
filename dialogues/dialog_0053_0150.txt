DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. Doyle Pitmon, doctor here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day. I want to have a baby, a healthy baby, and I’m… proactive. I’m 51, yes, but I take care of myself. I don’t want any… complications. I want to know what I need to do to make sure everything goes smoothly. No time wasting, please.
DOCTOR: Right. “Proactive.” I appreciate that, Ms. Shteynberg. Though, at 51, conceiving is considered a higher-risk pregnancy. We’ll need to be… thorough. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes, once. A long time ago. It was… fine. Normal delivery, healthy boy. Divorced his father when he was five, and frankly, that’s all that needs to be said about that. I don’t see what that has to do with this pregnancy though. Are you going to ask me about every single detail of my life? I really don't have the patience for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your… impatience, Ms. Shteynberg. And no, I won’t delve into personal matters unnecessarily. However, a previous pregnancy is relevant. Were there any complications during that one?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely none. I told you, it was fine. I had him naturally, I recovered quickly, everything was… textbook. Honestly, you’re making me feel like I’m falling apart just by asking these questions. Are you implying something?
DOCTOR: No implication intended, Ms. Shteynberg. I simply want a complete picture. Now, let’s move on. Any significant medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No! Look, I cycle every day. Do you know how good that is for your heart? I repair bicycles for a living, it keeps me active. I eat reasonably well, I don’t smoke, I rarely drink. I’m in better shape than half the women half my age, I assure you. Is this a standard interrogation?
DOCTOR: I see here you’ve had a lipid panel done six months ago. Cholesterol was… slightly elevated. And a blood glucose test a year ago showed a pre-diabetic reading. These are things we need to address when considering pregnancy, Ms. Shteynberg. It's not simply about being "in shape." Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Elevated cholesterol? Pre-diabetic? That was one test! Doctors always try to scare you into taking pills. I didn’t bother with follow-ups. I adjusted my diet for a week, then went back to normal. Honestly, I don’t need a lecture. And no, I don't take medications. I prefer to handle things myself.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "handling things yourself" isn’t always sufficient, particularly when introducing the complexities of pregnancy at your age. Ms. Shteynberg, your BMI is 24.9, which is borderline overweight. And these previous lab results suggest an increased risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Before we even consider trying to conceive, we need to get these things under control. Have you had a recent Pap smear or gynecological exam?
PATIENT: Look, are you trying to tell me I’m unhealthy? I’m perfectly capable of carrying a child. My weight fluctuates, yes, but it’s mostly muscle! I'm a bicycle repairer, remember? And I assure you, I’ve kept up with… female matters. I went to a doctor years ago, it was all… normal. Honestly, this is ridiculous. What do you actually need from me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I’m not implying anything, but "years ago" is not sufficient. A thorough gynecological exam, including a Pap smear and assessment of your uterine health, is necessary. We also need to repeat those blood tests – lipid panel, glucose levels, and potentially a thyroid panel. Furthermore, given your age, an EKG and echocardiogram to assess your heart health would be prudent. We need a baseline assessment before conception, to minimize risk to both you and the potential baby. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to it. A whole battery of tests! Just to prove I’m too old, too unhealthy, too… something. Fine. Do them. Get it over with. But don't expect me to sit around waiting for weeks for results. I have a life to live, a bicycle shop to run. And I’m not promising I’ll follow any ridiculous diet or exercise plan you come up with. Just… do the tests. And quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood and take your vitals. She'll also schedule you for an EKG and echocardiogram. We’ll need a pelvic exam as well, which I’ll perform shortly. It will take some time to get all the results back, Ms. Shteynberg, approximately one to two weeks. In the meantime, I’d strongly advise you to start taking a prenatal vitamin with folic acid. It's a simple precaution that can be beneficial. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’m allergic to incompetence, perhaps, but that’s hardly a medical condition. And don't bother telling me about "healthy eating" or "exercise". I know my body. Just… get on with it. I have customers waiting. And please, make sure whoever draws my blood is competent. I don’t have time for bruised arms and lengthy recovery times.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. She has been instructed to be… careful. While we wait, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want my entire family tree? Fine. My mother had… high blood pressure, I think. And her sister had some kind of cancer, a long time ago. My father was healthy as an ox until he tripped over a rug. Is that enough family history for you? Honestly, you're like a detective, not a doctor. Can we please get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright. And did either of your parents have any history of gestational diabetes during pregnancy?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea! They never discussed their… intimate details with me. I was a child! I doubt they even knew what gestational diabetes was. Are you seriously expecting me to remember medical details about my parents' pregnancies from decades ago? This is preposterous.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good to know. Okay, Ms. Shteynberg, let's proceed with a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick abdominal exam. It will just take a few minutes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But no unnecessary poking and prodding, please. And be quick about it. I have a shop to run, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90… a little on the high side. Any history of shortness of breath, chest pain, or swelling in your ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling in my ankles? From cycling! And no, I don't have chest pain. What do you think I am, a frail old woman? I cycle uphill every day! I'm a bicycle repairer, remember? I have to be strong. And please, stop looking at me like I’m about to collapse. It’s insulting.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, no masses palpated. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, now you're poking! It's a little sore, yes. From… lifting heavy bicycles! What did you expect? I don't sit around eating bonbons all day. Are you intentionally trying to cause me pain?
DOCTOR: Just assessing for any tenderness, Ms. Shteynberg. It’s a standard part of the exam. Alright. That concludes the physical exam for now. We’ll need the results of the blood tests, EKG, and echocardiogram before we can proceed further. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule those appointments. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, I have a question. When can I expect to get these results? And more importantly, when can I start trying to conceive? I'm not getting any younger, you know. I don't have time for endless testing and delays. And frankly, I expect a clear plan of action. No vague "we'll see" answers. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: The results should be back within one to two weeks, Ms. Shteynberg. However, I cannot give you the green light to start trying to conceive until we have a full assessment of your health. Based on preliminary findings, it would be irresponsible to do so at this time. We need to ensure you are medically stable and minimize any risks to both you and the potential baby. The plan of action is to complete these tests, review the results, and then discuss a tailored plan for conception – which may involve lifestyle modifications, medication, or further consultation with a specialist. It's a step-by-step process, Ms. Shteynberg, and your health is our priority. Do you understand?
PATIENT: “Step-by-step process.” That’s what everyone says. Frankly, it sounds like you’re already making up excuses. I’m perfectly healthy, and I’m not going to sit around waiting for weeks while you poke and prod and tell me what I already know. Fine. Do your tests. But don’t expect me to blindly follow your advice. I’ll make my own decisions. Is there anything else? Or can I finally leave?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shteynberg, that is all for now. The nurse will escort you to schedule the necessary tests. She's just outside. I wish you well, and I hope we can work together to achieve a safe and healthy pregnancy. Please feel free to contact the office if you have any concerns. And Ms. Shteynberg… please consider the importance of these tests, not just for you, but for the potential baby.
