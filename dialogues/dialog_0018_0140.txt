DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s rather… unpleasant. I have something going on in my mouth. It’s white, and it’s not… right. Honestly, I haven’t much time to spend on this, so if we could be quick, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I understand your time is valuable, and I will do my best to be efficient. “Something in your mouth… white and not right.” Could you describe the location of this… issue?
PATIENT: It’s… on my tongue, mostly. And the inside of my cheeks, a bit. It looks like… cottage cheese, but it doesn’t feel like cottage cheese. It’s… I don’t know, a bit sore, especially when I eat anything acidic. Look, is this contagious? My wife would be furious if I gave her something. She’s very particular about her health.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about potentially contagious conditions, Mr. Schieber. That is a very reasonable question. We will certainly address that as we work through this. So, the white patches are primarily on your tongue and the insides of your cheeks, and they are somewhat sore, particularly with acidic foods. Has this been developing over a specific period of time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It started… maybe a week ago? It wasn’t terribly noticeable at first, just a bit of a strange coating. But it’s gotten worse over the last few days. I haven’t been doing anything differently, I assure you. I maintain a very… disciplined lifestyle. This is rather inconvenient, honestly. I don't usually have problems.
DOCTOR: A week ago, starting as a mild coating and progressing over the last few days. And you haven’t noticed any changes in your routine, diet, or oral hygiene?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Same breakfast, same dinner. I brush twice a day, as one should. I even use mouthwash, though frankly, it doesn’t seem to be doing much good. I don’t… indulge. I don’t smoke, I rarely drink. It’s just… there. It’s probably nothing, honestly. A minor irritation. But my wife insisted I come. Women… they always worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that your wife encouraged you to come in, even if you feel it's likely a minor issue. Let’s proceed with a quick examination of your mouth. Could you please open wide for me?
PATIENT: Just get it over with quickly, Doctor. I have appointments this afternoon. And please, be gentle. I have a very sensitive gag reflex. Honestly, I don't understand why I have to do this. It's just a bit of white stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. I see the white patches you are referring to. They appear to be somewhat diffuse, covering portions of your tongue and the inner cheeks. They are not sharply demarcated and do not easily scrape off. Your gums appear healthy, and I don’t see any other concerning lesions. Based on this initial examination, it appears to be oral thrush, also known as candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection caused by an overgrowth of Candida yeast. It is not typically serious, but can be uncomfortable. Do you have any history of using inhaled corticosteroids, such as for asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Asthma? COPD? Absolutely not. I am a very healthy man. I haven’t been sick in years. I don't take any medication, unless you count the occasional aspirin. I told you, I maintain a disciplined lifestyle. This is… perplexing. Perhaps it's something I ate? Although, I can’t imagine what. I am very careful about what I consume. This is a waste of my time, honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. It is perplexing given your healthy lifestyle and lack of medication use. While medication use is a common cause, it’s not the only one. Sometimes, it can occur after a course of antibiotics, or even with a weakened immune system, though that would generally present with other symptoms as well. To confirm the diagnosis, I would like to take a small swab of the affected area and send it to the lab for a quick culture. It’s a simple, painless procedure. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Must we? I suppose if it gets this over with faster… Fine. But be quick about it. And please, don’t poke me too hard. I have a very sensitive mouth, as you’ve already gathered. And what exactly does this “culture” entail? How long will it take? I have a golf game tomorrow, and I can’t afford to be inconvenienced.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I will be as gentle as possible. The swab simply involves lightly touching a sterile cotton swab to the affected area. It will take only a moment. The culture involves sending the sample to the lab where they will identify if Candida is present. It typically takes 24-48 hours to get the results back. While we are waiting for the results, I will prescribe an oral antifungal medication, a rinse called Nystatin. It’s a very common and effective treatment for oral thrush. Even if the culture comes back negative, the rinse is generally harmless and may provide some relief if it is a fungal infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But I want you to understand, if this doesn't work, I'm not wasting any more of my time on this. And Nystatin? Is that… safe? I don't want any side effects. I have important meetings to attend. And frankly, I don't have time to be ill. What are the side effects, Doctor? Be specific. I demand to know everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. All done. That was very quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Barely tolerable. Now, about this Nystatin… Get on with it, Doctor. I haven’t got all day. What are the side effects, and how long will I need to use it? I want a precise timeline, and I want to know if it interacts with anything, even something as simple as antacids. And what if it doesn’t work? What then? Don’t tell me to come back; I’m already regretting this whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. Here is a detailed information sheet about Nystatin. As for side effects, the most common are mild and include nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Some people may experience a temporary burning or stinging sensation in the mouth. These usually resolve on their own within a few days. Rarely, allergic reactions can occur, so please contact me immediately if you experience any rash, itching, swelling, or difficulty breathing. It does have a low potential for interactions. It’s always best to avoid taking it with foods and drinks for at least 30 minutes before and after administration, to allow for optimal absorption. As for interactions with antacids, there isn't a significant documented interaction, but it’s always best to inform me of any medications or supplements you are taking. The standard course of treatment is four times a day for 7 to 14 days, depending on the severity of the infection. If you don’t see improvement within a few days, or if your symptoms worsen, please contact me. If Nystatin isn’t effective, we may consider a different antifungal medication, such as fluconazole, which is an oral tablet. We would also need to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. Do you have any other questions at this time, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Seventeen days? Really? This is an outrage! I have a very busy schedule. Fine, fine. I’ll try this Nystatin, but I’m not optimistic. And don’t expect me to be happy if it doesn't work. No, I don’t have any other questions. Just get me out of here. I need to get back to my life. And if this causes any sort of… disruption, I will be expecting a full refund. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. I have written a prescription for the Nystatin. Please follow the instructions carefully, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. I understand your busy schedule and will document your concerns regarding potential disruptions. I wish you a speedy recovery. Have a good day as well.
