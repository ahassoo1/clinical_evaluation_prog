DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Decosta, is it? Yes. I need a… a permission, I guess you’d call it. For somethin’ I wanna get done. Don’t have all day, so if we could just… get to it? It’s about my face.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're looking for a referral or permission for something related to your face. No problem, we can definitely discuss that. To help me understand what you need, could you tell me a little more about why you'd like to get something done?
PATIENT: Look, I don't exactly want to get somethin’ done. It’s just… things are droopin’. Everything’s droopin’. And it’s… unprofessional, you understand? I work with towers, and people gotta see a strong face. Not… this. It just… happened. Don’t ask me why. I ain’t a doctor. Just want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some facial drooping that's concerning you, and it’s impacting how you feel about your appearance at work. It’s good you’re addressing it. When did you first notice this drooping?
PATIENT: Honestly? I… I don’t rightly remember. A while ago. Months, maybe? Time… it just kinda blurs together, you know? It wasn't sudden. Just… gradual. One day I looked in the mirror, and… well, you see it. I assume you see it. Don’t need to go into a lot of detail about when. Just need to know if I can get it… tightened. Is that what they call it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradual over several months. And you’re concerned about getting it “tightened,” which sounds like you're interested in a cosmetic procedure to address the drooping. Before we talk about procedures, I'd like to get a better understanding of what's causing the drooping. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Just… the face. I don't get sick often. Always been strong. No headaches, no… feelin’ weak. Just… lookin’ older than I am, that’s all. I don’t believe in makin’ a fuss over nothin’. It’s droopin’, and I want it fixed. Is that so hard to understand? Honestly, Doctor, I got things to do. Towers don’t fix themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand you're frustrated and want a straightforward solution. It's good you're generally healthy, and I appreciate you telling me that. To rule out anything else that could be causing this, and to make sure we’re considering the safest approach, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Really? I told you, it’s just droopin’. What’s an exam gonna do? Look at my face, you’ll see! But… fine. Just get it over with. Quickly, please. I got a schedule to keep. And don’t poke around too much. I don’t have time for all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll keep it brief. Okay, Armando. I'm noting some mild asymmetry in your face – the left side appears slightly lower than the right. Your muscle strength seems generally good, but there's a bit of weakness on the left side when you smile. I don’t feel any major lumps or bumps. Your reflexes are intact. I'm a little concerned about the weakness I'm seeing. While it might be something cosmetic, facial weakness can sometimes be a sign of a neurological issue. Have you experienced any changes in your vision, speech, or swallowing recently?
PATIENT: Neurological issue? Now you're tellin' me I got somethin’ serious? All I want is a little tightenin’! Vision? No. Speech? I’m talkin’ perfectly clear, aren’t I? Swallowing? I eat just fine! I told you, I’m a strong man. Towers… they require focus. I can’t be dealin’ with… brain problems! This is ridiculous. You’re tryin’ to complicate somethin’ simple. I need a referral, and I need it now. Are you gonna give me one, or am I wastin’ my time?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Armando, and I apologize if I’m causing you concern. I’m not trying to complicate things, but it's my responsibility to rule out any potential underlying medical causes before recommending a cosmetic procedure. Facial weakness can sometimes be an early sign of something more serious, and it’s important to be cautious. Given your concerns and the mild weakness I observed, I'm going to recommend a consultation with a neurologist. They can perform further testing to determine the cause of the weakness and ensure we're proceeding with the safest course of action. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Seriously? This is… preposterous. More doctors, more tests… I ain’t got time for this! Look, I've been climbin’ those towers for thirty years. Thirty years! Ain't nothin' wrong with me. But… fine. If you insist. Just… give me a name. A good neurologist. And make it quick. I need this over with. Towers… they won't wait. I just want my face fixed, and I’m tired of jumpin’ through hoops. Don’t expect me to be happy about this. And I expect a quick turnaround.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. I'm going to refer you to Dr. Evelyn Reed. She’s a very experienced neurologist with a good reputation. Her office is located at 123 Main Street, and her number is 555-123-4567. I'll have my assistant send over the referral paperwork right away, along with a summary of our conversation today. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – like changes in your vision, speech, swallowing, or any numbness or weakness in other parts of your body – please contact me or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… send the paperwork. And tell Dr. Reed I don't have time for a lot of tests. I need a quick answer. Towers… you understand. And if she starts askin’ about my childhood or somethin’, I'm walkin’ out. Just fix the face. That's all. I've wasted enough time here today.
