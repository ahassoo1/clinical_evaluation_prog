DOCTOR: Hi Liza, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor Georgiou. Well, I’ve been thinking… I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation. I hear it can be helpful for… well, just generally feeling calmer, you know? I’ve never really tried it before, but I thought I’d ask if it’s something you think might be useful.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Liza. It's excellent you're proactively thinking about ways to improve your well-being. Mindfulness and meditation can be incredibly helpful for a lot of things – stress, anxiety, even just improving focus. It sounds like you're looking for tools to manage stress and feel more centered, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! Centered is a good word. Work can be… demanding. I repair signals and track switches for the railway, and it’s not always a quiet job, let me tell you. It’s very precise work, and sometimes the pressure gets to me. I don't want to let it build up, if you understand. I just want to feel a bit more… grounded, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Liza. That does sound demanding – precise work with a lot of responsibility. It’s very common for people in high-pressure jobs to benefit from mindfulness techniques. It’s great that you’re recognizing that now, before it becomes overwhelming. To get a better sense of how mindfulness might best help you, could you tell me a little more about what that pressure feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not so much fear of making a mistake, though that’s always in the back of my mind, of course. It’s more… a constant sort of buzzing in my head. Like I need to be thinking ten steps ahead, checking everything, anticipating problems. And then when something does go wrong – which it inevitably does – I get very… focused on it. I replay it over and over, thinking about what I should have done differently. It makes it hard to switch off, even when I’m not at work. Does that make sense? I can be a bit of a worrywart, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Liza. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of mental activation – constantly scanning for potential issues, and then getting caught in a loop of rumination when things don’t go as planned. That’s a very common pattern. It’s not about being a ‘worrywart’ at all; it's how your brain is processing stress in a high-stakes environment. Before we talk about specific mindfulness techniques, I’d like to get a little broader picture of your health. Have you been feeling this stress physically at all – things like headaches, muscle tension, trouble sleeping, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. The sleep is the biggest thing, I think. I don’t have trouble falling asleep, but I wake up a lot during the night. And then my mind just… starts going again. I’ll be thinking about a problem from work, or something I need to do tomorrow. Muscle tension too, I suppose. My shoulders get very stiff. Headaches, not constantly, but maybe a couple of times a week. Appetite is… normal, I think. I eat when I’m hungry. I don’t really comfort eat or anything. I try to eat healthy, you know? Fruits and vegetables and so on. I’m not a big drinker or smoker, either. I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Liza, that you're generally taking good care of yourself. The disrupted sleep and muscle tension are very common responses to chronic stress, and it’s helpful to know that you’re not experiencing significant changes in your appetite or any unhealthy coping mechanisms. Just to be thorough, have you been experiencing any feelings of sadness or hopelessness lately, or a loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I get… frustrated, certainly. Annoyed with myself, or with a situation. But not sad, or hopeless. I enjoy my work, actually, even though it’s stressful. And I have hobbies. I like to garden, and I volunteer at the animal shelter on weekends. I enjoy seeing my friends, too. I’m not isolated, if you understand. I’m quite happy, generally. Just… a little bit wired, perhaps. Is that alright? Should I be seeing someone else, a therapist, maybe? I don’t want to overreact.
DOCTOR: No, Liza, that sounds perfectly alright – and actually, very good! It’s important to distinguish between normal stress and something more serious, and it sounds like you’re experiencing the former. You’re actively engaged in enjoyable activities, maintaining social connections, and generally content with your life. That’s fantastic. It's not necessary to see a therapist at this time, if you don’t want to. It sounds like mindfulness techniques could be a really helpful tool to help you manage that “wired” feeling, and improve your sleep. Would you be open to me walking you through a simple breathing exercise now, and then discussing some resources you could use to practice on your own?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be wonderful! A breathing exercise sounds… calming, actually. And resources would be great, so I can practice when I’m not here. I’m a quick learner, if you need me to take notes. I have a very good memory, you know. I can remember details from years ago. Just in case you were wondering!
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Liza. Perfect recall is a wonderful thing! Don't worry, I was wondering! It’s helpful for me to know that you’ll be able to easily remember the techniques we discuss. Okay, let's start with a simple diaphragmatic breathing exercise. It's often called “belly breathing.” It can help activate your parasympathetic nervous system, which is your body's "rest and digest" system. Place one hand on your chest, and the other on your belly, just below your ribcage. Now, breathe in slowly through your nose, allowing your belly to rise as you fill your lungs with air. Keep your chest relatively still. And then, exhale slowly through your mouth, gently contracting your abdominal muscles to push the air out. We'll do this together for a few breaths. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I’m ready. It’s… harder than it looks! I think I’m breathing too high up. I’m trying to keep my chest still, but it keeps moving. It’s like I’ve forgotten how to breathe properly. This is… interesting. I feel a little dizzy, actually. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly normal, Liza. It is harder than it looks! Many people have forgotten how to breathe deeply into their diaphragm. It takes practice. And feeling a little dizzy is actually a sign that you're reducing your carbon dioxide levels, which is what we’re aiming for. It’s a mild sensation and should pass quickly. Let's try slowing it down even more. Instead of focusing on keeping your chest still, just focus on gently expanding your belly with each inhale. Think of filling your abdomen with air, like a balloon. And then exhale slowly and completely, letting all the air out. We don't need to get it perfect right away. Even a few shallow breaths focusing on your abdomen is a good start. Shall we try five more together?
PATIENT: Yes, let’s try. That’s… a little better, I think. I can feel my belly rising and falling more easily now. It’s still a bit awkward, but… less forced. I’m noticing my shoulders aren’t as tense, actually. I didn't realize they were so tight. It’s… surprisingly calming. Just focusing on the breath.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Liza! You're doing wonderfully. It's fantastic that you're noticing the tension releasing in your shoulders. That's a very common response to diaphragmatic breathing. It's a good sign that you’re activating your parasympathetic nervous system. Now, let's talk about how to incorporate this into your daily life. It's best to practice this for at least five to ten minutes each day. You can do it anywhere – sitting on your couch, waiting in line, even at your desk. There are also some great apps that can guide you through mindfulness meditations. Headspace and Calm are two popular options. They have a variety of guided meditations, ranging from a few minutes to longer sessions. Would you be interested in me printing out a handout with some resources and links to those apps?
PATIENT: Yes, please! A handout would be wonderful. And those app names… Headspace and Calm… I’ll write those down just in case. I think I could definitely fit ten minutes into my day. Maybe before bed, or first thing in the morning. It’s… nice to have something concrete to work with. Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. This has been… very helpful. I feel a bit more equipped, you know? Less… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. I’m so glad to hear that you’re feeling more equipped. You’ve taken a wonderful first step, and I have no doubt you’ll see positive results with consistent practice. Here’s the handout with the app links and some tips on incorporating mindfulness into your daily routine. It also includes information on progressive muscle relaxation, another technique you might find helpful. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you again for the handouts. I’ll definitely give those apps a try. I think… I think I’m good. Unless… is there anything I should be doing to prepare for a follow-up appointment, if we were to schedule one?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Liza. It was a pleasure meeting you. No, there’s nothing you need to do to prepare for a follow-up appointment. If you find that the mindfulness techniques are helpful, or if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to schedule another appointment at your convenience. Otherwise, just continue practicing and focus on maintaining your well-being. I'm confident you'll do great. Have a wonderful day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
