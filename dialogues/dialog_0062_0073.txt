DOCTOR: Hi Triana, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’m not sure why I even had to come here. It’s…it’s just my stomach. Been going on for weeks now. They sent me from the urgent care, but frankly, I’ve dealt with worse on fishing trips.
DOCTOR: Okay, well, even if it’s something you've managed before, it’s good to get it checked out, especially since the urgent care sent you over. “Weeks now,” you said… Can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with your stomach?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture. It's…diarrhea. Okay? Severe diarrhea. I’ve tried everything they sell at Fred Meyer. Pepto, Imodium, the charcoal stuff…nothing works. It just…keeps happening. Several times a day. It’s embarrassing even talking about it. And it's exhausting, if you can believe that. I just want it stopped.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Triana. It is exhausting, and it’s definitely not something anyone enjoys talking about. No lecture, I promise. It’s good you've tried over-the-counter things, that gives us a starting point. "Several times a day” – could you give me a rough estimate of how many times?
PATIENT: Ugh, at least…six, maybe eight times. Some days it's more. It's not…normal. And it's watery. Really watery. I feel like I'm losing weight, even though I'm eating. Honestly, I just want to know why this is happening and what you can do about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight times a day with watery stools... that’s definitely concerning, and I understand your frustration. It's good you've noticed the weight loss despite eating – that's important information. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any fever, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No blood, thankfully. I haven't had a fever. A little nauseous sometimes, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Just…really weak. And tired. And frankly, irritated that this is taking up my whole day. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your irritation – being sick takes up valuable time and energy. Okay, no blood or fever, some nausea, and feeling weak and tired. That helps. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or anything different about what you’ve been eating lately?
PATIENT: My appetite's been all over the place. Some days I'm starving, other days I can barely look at food. I haven't changed what I eat really. I mean, it's summer, so I've been having more salmon, but I always eat salmon. It's…normal food. I don't eat anything weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appetite changes, but no significant change in what you're eating, even with the increased salmon intake. That's good to know. Now, thinking back a bit, have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: No. I haven’t left the state in years. And no, nobody I've been around has been sick. I mostly keep to myself, honestly. It's…a lot of people getting sick these days, you know? I try to avoid it.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to avoid illness. Okay, no recent travel or contact with sick people. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the usual. High blood pressure, but it's controlled with medication. And…I lost my husband a few years back. That’s…it. I don't really go to the doctor unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband. Thank you for sharing that with me. And good to know about the high blood pressure being controlled with medication. Do you remember the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh. Honestly? No. My daughter handles all that now. She keeps track of everything. I think…it’s a little white pill? Seriously, I don't pay attention to those things. I just take it every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, we can look it up in the system. Just one moment… Okay, it looks like you're on Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. Any allergies to medications or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't have allergies. And I really don't have time for this. Is this going to take much longer? I have a boat to paint before the weather turns.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and need to get back to your boat. I’m getting a good picture of things now. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don’t poke around too much. I don't like being touched.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then gently feel around. Just let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. Okay, your bowel sounds are a little hyperactive, which can sometimes happen with diarrhea. Any tenderness here on your left side?
PATIENT: Ugh. Yes. There. It’s…not sharp, but it feels…full. And kind of achy. Like I’ve been poked. Don’t push so hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That’s helpful. And no tenderness anywhere else?
PATIENT: No. Just there. Look, I'm telling you, I just need something to stop it. I've been dealing with this for weeks. Are you going to give me something or what?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, given your symptoms – the prolonged diarrhea, the weakness, the weight loss, and the tenderness in your left side – I think we need to run a few tests to figure out what’s going on. It could be a number of things, from an infection to something a bit more chronic. I want to rule out anything serious. Would you be okay with a stool sample, and a blood test?
PATIENT: Ugh, more tests? Seriously? Fine. Whatever it takes to make it stop. But I want results fast. I don't have time for this. I have a life. And a boat.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand your frustration. We’ll get those tests ordered right away, and I’ll have the lab expedite them as much as possible. The stool sample will check for any infections or parasites, and the blood test will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help us rule out other possibilities. I'm also going to order a CMP, a complete metabolic panel, and a CBC, a complete blood count. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a medication called loperamide, which is a stronger anti-diarrheal medication than what you’ve been trying. It should help to slow things down and give you some relief. Let’s start with 4mg after the first loose stool, then 2mg after each subsequent loose stool, not to exceed 16mg in a 24-hour period. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Ugh. Finally. Some actual medicine. 4 milligrams… after the first… I guess. And then 2 milligrams… Look, just write it down for me. I’m not good at remembering things. And make sure the lab calls me as soon as they have anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. Here's the prescription for the loperamide, and here's a written summary of the dosage. I've also noted on the lab requisition to call you directly with the results. They should be able to get those back to you within 24-48 hours. I also want you to monitor your hydration. Drink plenty of fluids – water, broth, electrolyte drinks – to replace what you're losing. If you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No. Just…get the tests done. And call me when you have something. I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, Triana. I understand. We've ordered the tests, and I’ll have the lab contact you directly with the results. Please don't hesitate to call us if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Get well soon, and enjoy your boat painting. .
