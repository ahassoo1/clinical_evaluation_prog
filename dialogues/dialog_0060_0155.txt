DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Tremor, you said? Yes… that’s right. My hands. Been… well, it comes and goes, you know? Hard to say when it started, exactly. A while now, I guess. I just… want to get it checked, if that makes sense. Don’t want it getting worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tremor in your hands that comes and goes. “A while now” isn’t terribly specific, unfortunately. Can you tell me roughly when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Roughly… … Oh dear. See, that's the trouble. It wasn't a sudden thing. It just… crept up. Maybe… a couple of years? Three? Honestly, I'm not good with dates. Everything kind of blends together these days. I was still working then, though. At the plant. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It helps a little, thank you. So, roughly three years ago, while you were still working at the plant. And was it noticeable then, or has it gotten progressively worse over that time?
PATIENT: Worse, I think. Definitely worse. At first, I just thought it was… tiredness. Long hours, you know? Lifting things… But it didn’t go away. It’s… harder to hold things now. A cup of coffee, mostly. And… well, sometimes I spill things. Not often, but it's happening more. It's a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it worse with activity, or does it happen even when you’re resting?
PATIENT: Hmm… Both, I think. It’s… definitely worse when I’m doing something. Like, if I try to write, it’s shaky. But even when I’m sitting… sometimes it just… happens. Not all the time, but yeah. Resting or doing something. It’s… unpredictable. Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And does anything specifically make it better, or worse besides activity?
PATIENT: …Now that you mention it… Caffeine seems to make it worse. Definitely worse. I used to drink a lot of coffee, at the plant, you know? Kept me going. But… if I skip a day, or have less… it’s… slightly better, maybe. I haven’t really paid attention, though. I like my coffee. Stress, too, maybe. When I get worked up… it's worse then. But I’m retired now, so… less stress, I suppose. Although… sometimes I worry. It's a habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, caffeine and stress appear to be exacerbating factors. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any stiffness in your joints?
PATIENT: Stiffness… …My knees sometimes ache, in the mornings. But I just figured that was… getting old. And the weather, you know? Cold weather always makes them worse. I wouldn't say it's stiffness, exactly… just… sore. Like they need to be oiled. Does that make sense? I haven't really told anyone about it. It's just… old age. I’ve never been one to complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some knee pain, particularly in the mornings. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness… … I used to be able to lift heavy things at the plant, no problem. Now… … I drop things more often, like I said. I don't know if it's weakness, exactly… maybe clumsiness? It's hard to say. I haven't been doing much physical work since I retired. Everything just feels… smaller, if that makes sense. I’m not as strong as I used to be, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… … I haven’t fallen, if that’s what you mean. But sometimes… I feel a little unsteady. Especially when I turn quickly. Or when it’s dark. My wife… my ex-wife… used to say I was always clumsy. It’s probably just getting old. Everything’s a little off these days. I try not to think about it too much. It’s… unsettling, you know? Losing your balance.
DOCTOR: Okay. And, just to cover all bases, have you noticed any changes in your speech or swallowing?
PATIENT: Speech… No, I don't think so. Nobody’s told me I sound different. And swallowing… no trouble with that either. I enjoy my food. Still have a good appetite, thankfully. Can't complain about that. Is that… everything? I’d like to get this over with, if you don’t mind. It’s a long day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: … Oh dear. That's a tricky one. I went to the doctor when I needed to, but… I don’t remember all the details. High blood pressure, maybe? Years ago. And… my wife used to take me when I had bronchitis. Lots of coughs, you know? But… I’m not sure what else. I haven't really been to a doctor regularly since I retired. It’s… hard to keep track. Everything gets… blurry. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: …Let me see… I think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long time ago. And… I had a hernia operation, maybe ten years ago? Or fifteen? Something like that. It was… routine, I think. Nothing serious. They fixed it, and I went home. That’s all I really remember. My ex-wife handled all the arrangements. I wasn't very good with the details, even then.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Now that’s a mess. My mother… she had arthritis, I think. Badly. Spent a lot of time in bed. My father… he worked in the factory, you know? Died young. Heart trouble, I think. But… nobody really talked about it. It was… a long time ago. I have a sister, somewhere. Haven’t seen her in years. She probably has all the details, but I don’t have her number. It's all… a bit of a blur, really. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Haven’t taken any in years. I don't like taking pills. Never have. I prefer to… deal with things myself, if I can. A little rest, a cup of tea… that usually does the trick. I don’t see much point in filling myself with chemicals.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: … No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I used to be stung by bees when I was a boy, but that was just… a sting. A little painful, but nothing serious. And I eat everything. I like my food. I’m a pretty simple man. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. Just want to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My hands are a little shaky, you know. And… I get dizzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your strength is a little diminished on your left side, as I suspected. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Your reflexes are… normal, but a little brisk. Now I’m going to assess your coordination. “Touch your nose with your finger. Now, run your heel up your shin.” Okay. And finally, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds clear. Okay, Mr. Jezik. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright. Good. Glad that's over with. It wasn’t too bad, I suppose. So… what does it mean? What’s wrong with me? I’ve been having these tremors for a while now, and I just want to know what’s going on. I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Jezik, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, it appears you are experiencing a tremor, primarily in your left hand. We've ruled out some obvious causes, and your reflexes are normal. However, the asymmetry in strength and the tremor suggest there may be something going on. Now, it's difficult to say definitively what is causing it without further investigation. It could be essential tremor, which is a common condition that causes trembling, often in the hands, and can worsen with age. However, given your age and the asymmetry in your symptoms, we need to consider other possibilities. There’s a possibility it could be related to a neurological condition, such as Parkinson’s disease, although that’s less likely given the current presentation. The best course of action at this point is to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the tremor. I also want to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look at your neurological structures. I understand this might sound concerning, but it’s important to be thorough and get a definitive diagnosis. I want to assure you that we'll work through this together. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… and blood work… Goodness. That sounds… serious. Parkinson’s… I’ve heard of that. Terrible thing. Will it… will it get worse? Will I… lose control of my hands completely? I like to garden, you know. And… I still enjoy a good cup of coffee, when I can. What’s the first step? Should I… should I see a specialist? I don’t want to run all over the place, if I can avoid it. Just want to know what’s going on. Is it something I can… manage? With pills, or… something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Jezik, it's understandable to feel overwhelmed right now. Let's take things one step at a time. We're not at a definitive diagnosis yet, and it's important not to jump to conclusions. The MRI and blood work are just to rule things out and get a clearer picture of what's going on. Regarding your question about managing it… it's too early to say what the best course of action will be. Depending on the results of the tests, we may be able to manage the symptoms with medication, physical therapy, or other interventions. And yes, I do think a referral to a neurologist would be a good idea. They are the specialists in these types of conditions and can provide a more comprehensive evaluation and treatment plan. I’m going to order the blood work and an MRI. It will take a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to do the things you enjoy, as long as they don’t exacerbate your symptoms. If you notice any significant changes in your tremor, coordination, or overall health, please let me know immediately. I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results of the tests and determine the next steps. Would you like me to write you a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist I work with?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… yes, that would be good. A referral would be… helpful. I don’t want to have to figure all that out myself. And… how long will the tests take? And will they… will they be painful? I’m not good with… procedures. Just want to know what to expect. Don't want any surprises. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… a lot to take in. But knowing what’s coming… that helps. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It's perfectly understandable to feel anxious about the tests. Let me explain what to expect. The blood work is fairly straightforward – just a simple blood draw. It should only take about 10-15 minutes. My nurse will give you the necessary paperwork and instructions. The MRI is a little more involved, but it's not painful. You'll lie inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It’s important to remain still during the scan, which usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll be given earplugs to reduce the noise. The technician will be able to communicate with you throughout the scan. There are no needles or incisions involved. However, if you have any metal implants, such as a pacemaker or cochlear implant, you’ll need to inform the technician beforehand, as it may not be safe to undergo an MRI. My nurse will provide you with detailed instructions about both tests and answer any questions you may have. We’ll schedule the tests as soon as possible, and I’ll have my nurse contact you with the dates and times. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Metal… no, I don’t have any metal. Just… old age. And a few aches and pains. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. You’ve been very… patient with me. And explaining everything so clearly… that’s a big help. It’s… a lot to process, but I feel… a little better, knowing what to expect. I appreciate you taking the time. I know you’re busy. I guess I’ll… see you when the test results are back. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Jezik. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon.
