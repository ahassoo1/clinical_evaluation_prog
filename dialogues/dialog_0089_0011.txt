DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's just get this over with. I need somethin’ signed. A paper, somethin' about... fixin' myself up a little. I don't recall the specifics, to be honest. It's about lookin’ presentable. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you’re short on time, and we'll try to be efficient. “Fixing yourself up a little” is a bit vague though, and I need to understand why you need something signed to ensure I’m providing appropriate medical care. Is this related to a recent injury?
PATIENT: Injury? Heavens no. I been climbin' towers since before you were born, girl. No, no injury. It’s… cosmetic. You know, make a fella look younger. Is that what you need to know? I just want to… brighten things up. I ain't lookin' for a full overhaul, just a touch-up. And honestly, I don't remember what kinda touch-up it is. A friend suggested I come here. He said you sign papers. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: Alright, cosmetic… so potentially a procedure like Botox, fillers, or something similar?
PATIENT: Botox? Fillers? Sounds like somethin’ for fancy ladies. Look, I work with antennas and wires, not… potions. I just want the paper signed so I can get this done. A fella told me about a place downtown. Said they needed this form from a doctor. That’s it. I don't know nothin’ about “Botox” and “fillers.” Is that somethin' you do? Because if you don’t, I’m wastin’ my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your frustration. I do occasionally provide medical oversight for cosmetic procedures, but I need to know specifically what procedure you’re planning to have done before I can sign anything. It’s a matter of ensuring your safety and that the procedure is appropriate for you. Do you recall the name of the place downtown?
PATIENT: Downtown… hmm. Let me think. It was… bright lights, kinda flashy. “Eternal Youth” or somethin’ like that? Or maybe “Forever Young”? Somethin' boastful, that’s for sure. A young man recommended it. He had… a very smooth face. Look, I ain’t good with names and places, alright? All I know is they need a doctor’s signature. This is gettin’ ridiculous. You a doctor or a detective?
DOCTOR: Okay, “Eternal Youth” it is. Let me pull up some information on them… They offer a variety of treatments, including dermal fillers and Botox, as you mentioned, but also some more involved procedures. Did the young man tell you which procedure you discussed with them?
PATIENT: Discussed? I barely spoke to the fella! He just said they could "turn back the clock" and I needed a doctor to sign somethin'. That’s all! He showed me pictures… smoothin’ out wrinkles and… liftin’ things. It was all very quick. I ain’t a man who spends hours lookin’ at his face. I gotta get back to work. Towers don't climb themselves, you know. I just want the signature, Doctor. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re pressed for time, but I have a responsibility to ensure any medical procedure you undergo is safe. “Smoothin’ out wrinkles and liftin’ things” could be anything from a simple injection to a surgical facelift. Knowing the specific treatment is critical. Do you have any paperwork from "Eternal Youth" at all?
PATIENT: Paperwork? Hmm… now that you mention it… I think I had somethin’. A flyer maybe? With pictures. But… I probably left it in the truck. It’s a mess in there. Wires, tools, coffee cups… you wouldn’t believe it. Look, honestly, Doctor, I just wanna get this done. I need to look presentable for some… business dealings. Is that enough information? Can you just sign somethin’ general? A form sayin’ I'm healthy enough for… somethin'?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate your candor, but signing a form without knowing the specific procedure would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. It’s like signing a blank check. I simply can’t do that. However, I can offer to do a basic health screening to ensure you’re generally fit for some types of cosmetic procedures. We can check your blood pressure, heart rate, and do a quick visual assessment. That wouldn't commit me to signing anything specific, but it would at least give us a starting point. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A… screenin’? You mean like poke and prod? Look, I been climbin’ towers for forty years. I’m tougher than I look. I don’t need no “poking and proddin’”. But… if it gets you to sign the paper, I guess. Just keep it quick. I got a schedule to keep. And don't tell nobody I let you poke and prod. It’ll ruin my reputation. Just… get it over with. Is that alright? Blood pressure, heart rate… fine. But that's it. No needles, no nothin’. Just a quick check.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Blood pressure and heart rate it is. No needles, I promise. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. And I'll need to listen to your heartbeat.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just hurry it up. This cuff is tighter than my work boots. And don’t judge my heartbeat, I been climbin’ stairs all mornin’. Get it over with, Doctor. Towers ain't gonna climb themselves, you know. And I got a very important meetin’ later. Very important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 88. That's slightly elevated, but within a range where we can proceed with caution. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and your description of a "very important meeting," I recommend you discuss this with your primary care physician before undergoing any cosmetic procedure. Stress can significantly impact blood pressure and overall health. I am willing to provide a brief note stating that I performed a basic health screening, and your vitals were within acceptable limits for initial consideration of a low-risk procedure, but I strongly advise a full medical evaluation first. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A full evaluation? You kiddin’ me? Look, I ain’t got time for doctors and tests. I just wanted a simple signature! This is ridiculous. A brief note? Fine. A brief note sayin’ I didn’t keel over while you poked me. That's all I need. And don't mention the stress. That’s private. Just write the note and let me go. This whole thing is a waste of time. Just… get it done. And quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. Here you go. It states: “Armando Honcoop underwent a basic health screening on August 2, 2025. Vitals were within acceptable limits for initial consideration of a low-risk cosmetic procedure. Further medical evaluation recommended.” I’ve clearly stated the recommendation for a full evaluation. I cannot and will not sign a form without that assurance. I am concerned about your slightly elevated blood pressure and the potential stress you mentioned. I strongly urge you to prioritize your health and discuss this with your primary care physician. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: "Further medical evaluation"... Fine. Whatever. This is a mess. A complete and utter mess. Look, I ain't got a primary care physician. Never had one. Towers are my physician. No. That's it. I'm done. I’m wastin’ my time here. I guess I’ll just… find another doctor. A doctor who understands that a man's gotta look presentable. .
