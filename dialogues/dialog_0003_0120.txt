DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t really do long stories. Just… I want to have a baby. And I want it to be… easy. My first one, it was… complicated. I don’t want a repeat of that. Is that enough for a start?
DOCTOR: “Easy” is… a relative term when it comes to childbirth, Ms. Villarreal. But I understand your concern, given a previous complicated pregnancy. To give you the best advice, I’ll need some details. Perhaps starting with your past medical history would be most efficient. Were there any complications during or after your first pregnancy that you recall?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was a mess. Lots of… swelling. And then… something about the blood pressure. I was in and out of the hospital. It was years ago, okay? I don't remember exactly what they said. They just kept poking and prodding. And then… a C-section. Is that helpful? Look, I just want to know what I can do to make sure this one doesn’t end up like that.
DOCTOR: “Lots of swelling” and “something about the blood pressure” are… not particularly precise, Ms. Villarreal. It sounds as though you may have experienced preeclampsia, though I’d need to confirm that with your records. Did you receive a specific diagnosis at the time?
PATIENT: Pree-what-now? Look, doctors use a lot of fancy words. They told me I was sick, very sick, and I needed to rest. And then they cut me open. That’s what I remember. I don’t need a lecture on medical terms, I just want to avoid it happening again! Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: It’s not about a lecture, Ms. Villarreal; it’s about accurate information. Preeclampsia is a serious condition involving high blood pressure and potential organ damage during pregnancy. Knowing if you had it is vital. Let me pull up your previous records... Ah, yes. Confirmed: Severe preeclampsia, requiring early delivery via C-section at 34 weeks. You were also diagnosed with gestational hypertension. Do you have any known allergies or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Thirty-four weeks?! Goodness, I’d forgotten it was that early. See? That’s why I don't want a repeat! Allergies… hmm. No, not really. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that’s it. And medications… just a multivitamin, the regular kind. And sometimes something for my nerves, when things get… stressful. It’s a small blue pill. I think.
DOCTOR: “Something for your nerves” is… again, not terribly helpful, Ms. Villarreal. Do you recall the name of this medication?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Are you trying to interrogate me? Honestly, I just ask my husband for it when I need it, and he gives it to me. He handles all that stuff. He… handled all that stuff. He’s… gone now. It was a long time ago. I don't remember the name. It comes in a little blue bottle.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand you’re… distressed. However, knowing what medications you’re taking is crucial. A “little blue pill” could be anything. We need to determine if it’s safe for pregnancy. Is there any way to locate this medication?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, my husband handled it. He… he threw everything away when he… passed. Everything. I cleaned out the house, got rid of all the old medicine bottles. It was too painful to keep. I don't have the bottle. Is this really necessary? I just want to know what I can do to have a healthy baby, not be cross-examined about old pills!
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I assure you, this is not a cross-examination. It’s due diligence. Many medications can cause severe birth defects. Without knowing what you were taking, we cannot assess the risk. Very well. In the absence of that information, we will proceed with caution. Let's focus on what we can control. Given your history of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, we need to monitor your blood pressure very closely throughout your pregnancy. We will also need to perform regular blood tests to assess your kidney and liver function. Do you have any family history of hypertension or preeclampsia?
PATIENT: My mother… she had high blood pressure. Towards the end of her life, anyway. She was always a bit… dramatic. Complaining about everything. And her sister, my aunt… she had swelling, really bad swelling, when she was pregnant. They said it was something like… water retention? Is that pre-whatsit? Look, everyone on my mother’s side was always a bit sickly, if that's what you want to know.
DOCTOR: A family history of hypertension and edema is… pertinent. It suggests a possible genetic predisposition. Ms. Villarreal, given your history and family background, I recommend you begin taking a low-dose aspirin daily. This can help prevent preeclampsia. We will also need to schedule frequent prenatal appointments, starting as soon as possible. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Aspirin? Like, the kind you take for headaches? Seriously? I don’t know… I mean, I’m… it’s complicated. I’m widowed, okay? It’s been a while. And honestly, the thought of… everything… is just exhausting. I suppose I’m not completely ruling it out. But let’s focus on the baby, shall we?
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with preconception counseling, focusing on optimizing your health for pregnancy. The low-dose aspirin is a preventative measure, and we will monitor you closely. Given your weight and height, your BMI is approximately 24, which is within a healthy range. However, it's essential to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise. I recommend a consultation with a registered dietitian. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A dietitian? Honestly, is this really necessary? Look, I eat normal food. I don’t stuff myself with junk. And I walk sometimes. It's all a bit much, isn't it? I think that’s all I can handle for today. Is there anything else, or can I go? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, I understand your frustration. However, optimal health is paramount for a successful pregnancy, especially given your history. I will provide you with a referral to a registered dietitian and schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss your plan. We will also order baseline blood work. If you experience any spotting, severe headaches, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No, I think I’m good. Just… the blood work. And the appointment. Next week, you said? Fine. Thank you. I suppose. All this fuss…
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Villarreal. .
