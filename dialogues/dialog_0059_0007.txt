DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. Why don't we start by you telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... painful. My back. Been painful for a while now. I want to get this over with as quickly as possible, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I understand you’re in pain and want to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. We’ll do our best to get you answers. When you say “a while now”, could you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: About… three months, I think. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say exactly. It started gradual, just a little ache after work. I do fence work, you know. It's physical. Now it's… constant, mostly. Even when I'm sitting.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That helps. Fence work – is that building and repairing fences, or do you participate in the sport of fencing?
PATIENT: Building and repairing. Real fences. With posts and wire. Not… the sword things. Though that probably sounds silly of me to have to explain that. I just… put up fences for a living. Mostly barbed wire. It's honest work.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all. It's good to clarify! That gives me a much better understanding of the type of physical activity involved. So, you've been doing this work for some time, and the pain developed gradually over about three months while doing it. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It's a dull ache, mostly. But sometimes… when I move wrong, it's a sharp pain. Right across my lower back. Feels like something is… pulled. And it goes down my leg sometimes, a little. Not all the way to my foot, but… down the back of my thigh. Is that making sense? I don’t really know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache with occasional sharp pains, and some pain radiating down your thigh… That helps me narrow things down. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the average pain level throughout the day?
PATIENT: Hmm. Most days, I'd say a four. But when I bend over or lift something heavy… it can go up to an eight, easily. Then it takes a while to come back down. It doesn't stay at an eight long, thankfully. But getting it to an eight is the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, a baseline of four, with peaks of eight with exertion. And it takes a while to subside. Do you notice anything specifically that makes the pain worse besides bending and lifting?
PATIENT: Sitting for too long. That makes it worse. And… if the weather is bad. Cold, damp weather. Seems to tighten everything up. It's hard to explain. Just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense? I’m not good with describing things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Ms. Reihner. Sitting and cold, damp weather are both common triggers. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you had any previous back injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing like that. I’ve had the usual bumps and bruises from work, of course. But never anything broken. Never had surgery. My husband… well, he did, a long time ago, but that was him. Nothing for me. I just try to keep working. Widow’s got to eat, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. So, no previous back injuries or surgeries. Thank you for clarifying that. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just Medicare covers what they give me, Doctor. I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And… sometimes ibuprofen, when the pain is really bad. Just the regular kind, over the counter. Not much else.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a medication for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing I've ever noticed. I can eat anything. I can take any pill they give me. I've never had a reaction to anything. Lucky, I suppose. A lot of folks I know have allergies these days.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Reihner. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had arthritis. Badly. In her hands, mostly. And her back, toward the end. That’s about all I know, really. My father… he worked on a ranch his whole life. Strong as an ox. Never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. And my husband… he had heart trouble. That’s what took him. Not much for back problems in either family, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your husband, but not much back trouble. Now, Ms. Reihner, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your back and legs to help determine the source of your pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. As long as it doesn't take too long. I got a fence to fix. But… alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, if you don’t mind. I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Reihner. I will be as gentle as possible. Could you please stand up for me, if you're able?
PATIENT: Alright. Here I am. A little stiff, I warn you. Been sitting for a bit. Just try not to… pull too hard.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your spine, feeling for tenderness or muscle spasms. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Okay, Ms. Reihner, does this feel tender anywhere in particular?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right… there. Yes. That’s… very tender. Just above my belt line, on the right side. Right there, Doctor. Please be careful. That hurts pretty good.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. Could you please sit back down?
PATIENT: Alright. There. It’s… throbbing a little now. But… go ahead. Let's just get this over with. I got work to do, remember?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Reihner, could you please extend your right leg straight out in front of you?
PATIENT: Like this? It's a little uncomfortable, Doctor. I don't move that leg much when I’m workin’. It feels… tight. It’s not a strong leg to begin with. Mostly I push with my arms when I’m puttin’ up fences.
DOCTOR: Alright, and how about your left leg?
PATIENT: This one feels… better. I can move this one alright. Still not strong, but… better. I lean on my left side more when I lift things. It’s just habit, I guess. I should probably switch it up, but… old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Reihner. Now, I'm going to ask you to stand up and lean forward, bending at the waist. Please do this slowly and only as far as is comfortable. Stop if you feel any sharp pain.
PATIENT: Ouch! No, I can't go much further than this, Doctor. It’s… pinching in my back. A sharp pain. Like something’s caught. See? I told you. I don’t like bending. Makes everything worse. I can feel it now, throbbing… please, let’s just figure out what’s wrong and get me back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, you’re right. That’s enough. Thank you. Based on the physical exam and your history, it sounds like you’re experiencing a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by the physical demands of your work. The tenderness in your lower back, the pain radiating down your thigh, and the limited range of motion all point in that direction. However, given the radiating pain, we should rule out any nerve impingement. To do that, I recommend an X-ray of your lower back to assess the alignment of your vertebrae and rule out any fractures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray? I suppose that's alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. And… won’t make the pain worse. I just need to get back to work. Is it covered by Medicare? I don’t want any surprises. Fences don’t build themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, an X-ray should be covered by Medicare. We will verify that before proceeding, of course. And it shouldn't worsen your pain, it's a quick and relatively painless procedure. I’ll have my assistant schedule you for an X-ray right away. While you’re waiting, I’m going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help ease the spasm and some stronger ibuprofen to help with the pain. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright. Muscle relaxant and… better ibuprofen. That sounds good, Doctor. As long as it’ll help me get back to work quicker. I don’t want to be laid up for too long. My customers are expectin’. And, honestly, I need the money. So, yes, please. Anything that gets me back to buildin’ fences.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll write the prescription now. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting, bending, or twisting as much as possible. Gentle stretching and walking are okay, but stop if you feel any pain. I'm also going to provide you with some instructions on proper lifting techniques to help prevent this from happening again. We’ll go over those after I print the prescription. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, proper lifting… that’s a good idea. I always just… lift, you know? Never really thought about it. I suppose I should. Anything to keep workin’. Okay, proper lifting instructions. That sounds good, Doctor. And… how long until I get the X-ray? I got fences waitin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The X-ray room is right down the hall. My assistant will escort you shortly. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Here are some instructions on proper lifting techniques in the meantime. They include keeping your back straight, bending your knees, and keeping the load close to your body. While we wait for the X-ray results, we can discuss some at-home care like applying ice or heat to your lower back. Would you like to discuss that now?
PATIENT: Ice or heat… yes, tell me. I got both at home. Which one? And for how long? I like to be prepared. Just tell me what to do. I’ll write it down. Fences are callin' my name, Doctor. I’m ready to get back to work. Just lay it on me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. For the first 24-48 hours, I recommend applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours. After that, you can switch to heat packs, or alternate between ice and heat, depending on what feels better. Again, 20 minutes at a time, every 2-3 hours. It’s important not to apply ice or heat directly to the skin – always use a towel as a barrier. And if either makes your pain worse, stop immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that’s… alright. Ice for two days, then heat. Towel in between. Don’t overdo it. I got it. Is there anything else, Doctor? I’m gettin’ anxious. I'm startin’ to feel like I’m takin’ up too much of your time. I know you got other patients. I’m ready for the X-ray. Just tell me when. I just want to get this over with and get back to work. Fences are waitin’.
DOCTOR: You’re not taking up too much of my time, Ms. Reihner, and I want to make sure you feel comfortable and confident in your care. My assistant is just coming to escort you to the X-ray room now. After the X-ray, we’ll review the results together and discuss a longer-term plan for managing your back pain. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to let me or my assistant know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Is there anything at all I can address before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… alright. I think I got it. Ice, heat, careful liftin’. Just… get me back to my fences. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Reihner. We’ll get you taken care of. My assistant will be right with you. And please, take it easy. .
