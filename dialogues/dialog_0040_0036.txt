DOCTOR: Right. Kiwane Barban, 28 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: The… paper said something about a check-up. Before the insurance starts, yes? I need to do this to have the… the help from Medicare, yes? It is important to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the pre-authorization paperwork. Look, I have a very full schedule, so let’s try to be… concise. You feel fine, generally?
PATIENT: Concise? I am here because you need me to be. And… yes, generally. I work. I eat. I sleep. What kind of question is that? No problems… that I come here for if that is what you mean.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even people who feel fine need a baseline, alright?
PATIENT: A… baseline? Like starting line for a race? I do not run races. I work at the… the factory. Is this necessary? It feels like a waste of my time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Look, it’s standard procedure. Let’s just get through this. Have you had any… unusual aches or pains recently?
PATIENT: Aches? Everyone has aches after work. It is a… factory. Heavy things, long hours. My back sometimes feels… tired. But that is normal. I don't think this is what you are looking for, no? I do not have… strange pains.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any other complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? About what? The chair is… acceptable. The room is… a room. I am not here to complain about the decorations. I came for the insurance, remember? Is this some sort of test?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not a test. It’s a medical history! Have you been sick recently?
PATIENT: Sick? A small… cold, maybe, last winter. Nothing serious. Just a little… sniffle. I continued working. Yemeni men do not stay home for a sniffle. It's not… how we are. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Like… to what? Dust? I work in a factory. There is… always dust. I do not know if that is an allergy. I have never had… reactions, really. No, I don't think so. This is… very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any medications you take regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I drink tea. Sometimes. For… comfort. I do not… need pills. My grandfather had… herbs. He knew what was good for you. Not these… modern things. Are you going to ask about everything now?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture here. Alright. Family history then. Any serious illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Serious illnesses… My grandfather, he… passed when I was young. Old age, mostly. My mother, she has… the pressures of life. A woman’s problems, yes? Nothing that… pills can fix. My father… he works very hard. Everyone works hard. I do not know what you want me to say. We are a healthy people. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let’s just… do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: If you must. But do not take too long. I have things to do, yes? And do not… poke too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, just lie down on the table, please. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. Breathe deeply… in and out… alright. Heart sounds regular. Lungs clear… mostly. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. It is… normal. The factory is… hard work, you know. Everything feels a little… tired. Stop pushing so much. It is not comfortable. Do you need to find something else to push? That is… enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Blood pressure… 130 over 80. Pulse 72. Weight, you said 90 kilograms?
PATIENT: Yes. Ninety. I told you already. Is everything always a question? I am not here to play games, Doctor. Just… finish. I need the paper for the insurance, remember? What is the point of all this?
DOCTOR: Look, everything seems… within normal limits. You're a relatively healthy young man. I’m going to write a note stating you’ve had a basic physical exam. That should be enough for the pre-authorization. Here. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. That is all. Thank you. I hope this is enough. I do not want any… problems with the insurance. Now, if you'll excuse me…
