DOCTOR: Hi Bianca, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, is just… I been drinkin' a lot of water lately. More than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat. Is worryin' me a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Increased thirst and hunger... that's definitely something we should look into. How long have you been noticing this – the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe about a month now? It start slow, but it gettin' worse each week. I thought it was the heat at first, you know? But it still bad even when it cooler.
DOCTOR: Okay, a month. And it’s progressive, meaning it’s getting worse over time. Have you noticed any other changes along with the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Let me see… I does feel tired more often, yes. And I have to… go to the bathroom more. Especially at night. I wake up sometimes just to pee. Is botherin' my sleep. Is that… is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Increased urination, especially at night – that’s called nocturia – and fatigue… those are definitely things we need to consider. Okay, Bianca, have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not that I notice, Doctor. Everything look the same to me. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always had trouble seein' far away. I need glasses, you know? But I never get around to makin' the appointment. Is that what you askin'?
DOCTOR: No, that's helpful to know. Just checking for any new changes in your vision. Okay. And what about any weight changes – have you lost or gained any weight recently?
PATIENT: Well… I think I lose a little weight. Not much, but my clothes feel a little looser. I haven't weigh myself in a while, to be honest. My husband does the weighin', and he been busy with the garden lately. Is not somethin' I think about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss. Got it. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never been sick with anythin' serious. Just the usual colds and flu. My husband always say I have a strong constitution. I try to eat healthy, mostly. We grow a lot of our own food, you know? But I does like a sweet treat now and then. Is my only weakness, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… when I was a young girl, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, though. And I spent a night in the hospital when I had my first baby, but that was normal, you know? No other surgeries or nothin’ like that, Doctor. Just the usual bumps and bruises over the years.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child and a normal postpartum stay. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother, she had… problems with her sugar, yes. She always tired and thirsty, like me. The doctor say is diabetes, but that was years ago, when she was an old woman. My father, he was strong as an ox, never sick a day in his life. And my sister, she alright, just a little arthritis in her hands. Is that what you want to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Bianca. A family history of diabetes is important. And finally, do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter – or have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take nothin'. I believe in lettin' my body heal itself, you know? I does take a little vitamin C sometimes when I feel a cold comin' on, but that is all. And no allergies, thank goodness. Never been sick to any medicine. I always careful with what I put in my body.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or allergies. Good. Alright, Bianca, based on what you’ve told me – the increased thirst and hunger, frequent urination, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, and family history of diabetes – I'd like to do a quick blood sugar check right here in the office. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think is best. I trust your judgement. Is just… I don't like needles, you know? But I do what I have to do. Is my health, after all. Just… be quick, please?
DOCTOR: Of course, Bianca. I'll be as quick as I can. It will just be a tiny prick. We’ll get a reading quickly and then we can discuss the results. Just relax your hand for me…
