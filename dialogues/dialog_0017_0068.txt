DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my leg. It’s been swelling. After… after the cancer stuff, you know? It just… puffs up. It’s annoying, really. I just want it to go down.
DOCTOR: "Cancer stuff," you say. Could you be more specific, Ms. Queener?
PATIENT: Oh! Um… sorry. Yes. Breast cancer. I had… treatments. Chemo, and… the other thing. Radiation, I think it was? It was a while ago, maybe five years now? And the leg started swelling after that. It’s not painful, exactly, just… big.
DOCTOR: Five years. Right. And is this swelling constant, Ms. Queener, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It… goes up and down, yes. Worse when I stand for a long time, I think. Or… if it’s hot. But it’s always a little bit bigger than my other leg. It’s just… noticeable now, you know? I wore sandals yesterday and… well, it looked silly.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in the skin itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me think. It’s maybe a little… harder feeling? Not like a bruise, just… not as soft. And sometimes it feels… warm. But mostly just big and… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said this is in one leg only?
PATIENT: Yes, just the left one. My right leg is… normal. I wish the left one was too! It’s not hurting, Doctor, I just want it to go back to normal, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical examination of both legs to assess the situation. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to check for any signs of deep vein thrombosis, and assess the extent of the swelling. It’s standard procedure, Ms. Queener. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, please? I have a… a thing later.
DOCTOR: Alright. Right leg circumference is 38 centimeters. Now, the left… 43 centimeters. Yes, as you stated, a significant difference. I’m also noting some mild warmth to the touch on the left leg, and slight firmness upon palpation. No visible signs of ulceration or skin breakdown, thankfully. Now, I'm going to auscultate the pulses in both legs. Please remain still. Pulses are present bilaterally, though slightly diminished on the left. This is… concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning? What do you mean, concerning? Is it bad? I don't understand… is it the cancer coming back? Oh dear.
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, please. Let's not jump to conclusions. It is possible this is related to your previous cancer treatment, specifically lymphedema, which is a common side effect. However, the diminished pulse warrants further investigation to rule out a more serious condition. We need to determine if this is simply fluid buildup, or a potential blood clot. I’m going to order a Doppler ultrasound of both legs to assess blood flow. And I’ll also need a complete blood count and a D-dimer test. This is standard protocol.
PATIENT: Ultrasound… and blood tests? Oh. That sounds… complicated. How long will that take? And will it hurt? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive, Ms. Queener, it simply uses sound waves. As for the blood test, it will be a standard venipuncture, a small prick. It will be uncomfortable for a moment, but hardly debilitating. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible and wearing compression stockings. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Compression stockings… okay. I think so. So, wait for the tests… elevate the leg… and wear funny socks. Yes. But… 24 to 48 hours? That’s a long time to worry!
DOCTOR: Worrying will not expedite the results, Ms. Queener. I’ve already placed the orders, and the lab will prioritize them given your history. If you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, or shortness of breath, you are to go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand that?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, emergency room if it gets bad. Pain, redness… shortness of breath. I remember. But… honestly, Doctor, is this something I should be really worried about? You said lymphedema, but then you sounded… serious about the blood clot. It’s confusing!
DOCTOR: Ms. Queener, it is my professional responsibility to consider all possibilities. Lymphedema is a likely cause, given your history of breast cancer treatment. However, a deep vein thrombosis, or blood clot, can be a life-threatening condition if left untreated. We must rule it out. The tests will provide us with the necessary information to make an accurate diagnosis and formulate a treatment plan. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write the orders?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Just… a dislike of hospitals, really. And needles, as I said. But no allergies. So… I just wait for the tests, and if it hurts a lot, go to the hospital. Is that right? And… will someone call me with the results?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Queener. You have summarized the situation accurately. The lab will contact my office with the results, and my staff will then contact you. It is imperative you answer their call. Here is the form for the lab. Take this to the lab immediately, and please be sure to schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible. I believe I've covered everything. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I… I hope it’s nothing too bad. I just want to go back to wearing sandals.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Queener. I suggest you schedule that ultrasound without delay. And please, follow the instructions I have given you. Good day. .
