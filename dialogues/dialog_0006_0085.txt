DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. I'm Dr. Gorga. So, Gabbrielle, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin. There are patches. Discoloration. It’s quite bothersome, really. Not at all what one expects, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, skin patches. Discoloration… Okay. And how long have you noticed these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It started… sometime in March, I believe. Yes, March. Around the time my husband and I returned from our trip to Poland. Though, I doubt it’s from Poland. We were very careful. It just… appeared shortly after. Perhaps a bit before, actually. But March is a good estimate. I keep a very organized calendar, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, March. So, a few months now. And where are these patches located?
PATIENT: Mostly on my arms, Doctor. The insides, primarily. And a small one just starting on my… well, on my chest. Not terribly noticeable, thankfully. It’s just… it’s the principle of the thing. One expects one’s skin to be… uniform, wouldn’t you agree? Not speckled like an old egg.
DOCTOR: Right, insides of the arms, and a small patch on the chest. And are they… itchy?
PATIENT: Itchy? Goodness, no. Not at all. They’re… just there. A bit… dull, perhaps? The color isn’t quite right. A sort of… grayish-brown. Not a pleasant shade, I assure you. It’s not painful or anything, thankfully. Just… aesthetically displeasing. I do take pride in my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no itching, grayish-brown discoloration. Have you noticed any changes in these patches since they first appeared?
PATIENT: Well, they've… spread. Very gradually, of course. I wouldn’t say dramatically. But if I look closely, they are a bit larger now than they were in March. And the one on my chest… that wasn’t there in March. It appeared just last month, I believe. It’s terribly subtle, but I do notice these things. My husband doesn’t, naturally. Men rarely do.
DOCTOR: Okay, spreading gradually, new patch on the chest last month. Have you tried anything to treat them already?
PATIENT: Treat them? Heavens, no. What would one treat them with? I tried a particularly lovely hand cream, a lavender scent, but that did nothing, naturally. It’s not a dryness issue, Doctor. It’s… a color issue. I’m not sure hand cream would resolve that, would you agree? I did mention it to my pharmacist, and she just suggested a moisturizer, which was… unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Right, moisturizer wasn’t effective. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been quite robust, actually. I eat everything. My husband is terribly fussy, always checking labels, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, I did once have a slight… discomfort after eating a particularly ripe mango, but that was years ago. I wouldn’t call that a true allergy. Just… a tropical sensitivity, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just my usual vitamin D supplement. Doctor recommended it, you see. With the winters being so… bleak. And a small dose of something for my blood pressure, but that's been the same for years. Nothing new, I assure you. I'm very careful about what I put into my body. I wouldn't simply take anything without consulting a professional.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D and blood pressure medication. Let's take a look at your skin. Could you please roll up your sleeves?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There. You can see quite clearly now. It’s rather… prominent on the insides, isn’t it? I do hope it’s nothing serious. It’s terribly inconvenient, to be perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see. These are slightly raised, a bit scaly… and the color is as you described, grayish-brown. No active inflammation, no open sores. Let me check your chest now. Similar appearance there, smaller in size. It could be a number of things. Do you recall any family history of skin conditions?
PATIENT: Skin conditions? Let me think… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… eczema, I believe. As a child. But that was decades ago, and it cleared up completely. My mother herself has always had very sensitive skin, prone to redness, but nothing like this. My husband’s family… they’re quite… ordinary, really. No unusual health concerns. Though his uncle did have a rather nasty bout of indigestion last year. But that hardly seems relevant, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright, grandmother with eczema. And you mentioned you traveled to Poland in March?
PATIENT: Yes, to visit my cousin. We went to Kraków, and a small village outside of Warsaw. It was… pleasant. Though the weather was rather damp. We were mostly indoors, visiting museums and such. I don’t recall any particular incidents that might have caused this. We were very careful about what we ate and drank. Bottled water only, you understand. And we avoided street food entirely. Is Poland somehow… known for skin ailments? I wouldn’t have thought so.
DOCTOR: It’s not known for skin ailments, no. But sometimes travel can expose you to things you’re not used to. It could be a mild fungal infection, or a form of dermatitis. It's difficult to say without further investigation. I'm going to order a skin scraping to rule out a fungal cause. And a patch test to check for any allergic reactions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A scraping? A test? Oh, dear. Is it… painful? And will it leave a mark? I have a garden party next week, you see. I simply must look presentable. And what if it’s something… contagious? My cousin’s children are visiting soon. I wouldn’t want to… transmit anything.
DOCTOR: The scraping is very quick, just a gentle collection of cells from the skin surface. It shouldn’t be painful, maybe a slight scratch. And the patch test involves applying small amounts of different substances to your skin, under bandages. It can be a bit uncomfortable, like a mild rash, but it’s temporary. As for contagiousness, it’s unlikely, but we need to rule things out. We'll take precautions. The lab will let us know the results in about a week. In the meantime, I'll prescribe a mild topical steroid cream to help with any potential itching or inflammation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A week? A week with this… uncertainty? And a rash? Oh, dear. Very well. A topical… what was it? A steroid cream. If it will help, I suppose. But please, Doctor, do be gentle. And make absolutely certain it won't interfere with my garden party. I’ve promised to bring my famous poppy seed cake. It simply must not be compromised. Is there anything else? Any other tests? I do hope this won't be a lengthy ordeal.
DOCTOR: Alright. The steroid cream should help with any discomfort. No, I don't think further testing is necessary at this point. We'll start with these results and see how you respond. If the cream doesn’t improve things, or the scraping comes back positive for something, we can discuss other options. I’ll also give you a handout with instructions on how to apply the cream and what to watch out for. And, just to be safe, avoid close contact with anyone with weakened immune systems until we have the results. Now, do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Avoid close contact… Oh, dear. My cousin’s youngest does have allergies. Very well. No, I suppose not at the moment. Just… please, Doctor, be thorough. And if it turns out to be something… unpleasant, do let me know quickly. I simply can’t abide surprises. And thank you, I suppose. Though I wish we hadn’t needed to have this conversation at all. I do hope the cake isn’t affected.
