DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants... a baby. And she thinks... I should come talk to someone first? Something about making sure everything is okay, before... you know. It’s for before she gets pregnant, I think. I don’t really understand all of it. I just want to help her.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter is being very thoughtful, wanting to ensure everything is optimal before starting a family. That's very responsible of both of you. So, you're here today for a preconception evaluation – to assess your overall health and identify any potential factors that might affect future pregnancy. That’s an excellent idea. To begin, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the past few years?
PATIENT: Um... not really, no. I mean, if something was bad I went, you know? But just for check-ups... not so much. I work a lot, selling things... engineering stuff. Travels a lot. Hard to find the time. I think the last time was… maybe five years ago? Something like that. I don’t remember exactly. It was just a quick thing. Blood pressure, maybe? I can’t be sure. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Life gets busy, and it’s easy for those appointments to slip. No need to worry, we'll get a good picture of your current health today. Since it’s been some time since your last visit, we'll do a comprehensive assessment. To start, could you tell me a bit about any major medical issues you have been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… something with my stomach, a long time ago. When I was younger. They said ulcers, I think? I took some pills for it. It’s been okay for years though, doesn’t bother me anymore. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But that healed fine. Other than that… I don't think so. Nothing serious that I remember. I do get a little tired sometimes, but that's probably just the work. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. Yes, I want to know about anything significant. The ulcers are good to know, we'll ask a few more questions about that later. And fatigue is certainly something we should explore. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think… Oh! Yes! When I was… maybe thirty? I had my appendix out. It was an emergency, very painful. I was in the hospital for a few days. That's the only surgery I've ever had, as far as I know. I remember it being… unpleasant. Not a good experience. But it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family – your parents, siblings, any children – do you know of any major medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family… My father, he had… heart trouble. He had a bad heart, and he died when I was young, maybe ten years old. My mother, she lived a long time, but she had… something with her bones. Arthritis, I think. Her hands were always sore. I don't really know about my grandparents, I didn't know them very well. My sister… she's healthy as far as I know. We don’t talk much anymore. Does that help? I’m not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother are important things to know. We'll keep those in mind. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements… anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I take… a vitamin D, sometimes. The doctor told me I was low on it a few years ago. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach, if it bothers me. It's just something I buy at the shop. Not a prescription. And… I think that’s it. I don’t really like taking pills, so I don't take much. Sometimes a painkiller for a headache, but that's not very often.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes with pollen, in the spring. But that’s just a cold, I think. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. Never been stung by a bee or anything like that. I don't think I have any real allergies. No.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked. Never liked it. My father used to smoke, but I always thought it was a bad habit. No, never. I drink… sometimes, a glass of wine with dinner. But not very often. Maybe once a week? Nothing much. It’s not a habit. I try to stay healthy. Work keeps me busy enough.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And, finally, do you have any regular exercise or physical activity?
PATIENT: Exercise… well, not really. I walk a lot, when I'm working. Traveling to meetings, going to see clients... that's exercise, isn't it? But I don't go to a gym or anything. I used to play football when I was young, but that was a long time ago. Just walking, mostly. And lifting things at work, sometimes. That's my exercise, I guess. It's not very glamorous.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. Walking is excellent exercise. Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Verrall. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick examination of your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have a meeting later this afternoon. But I want to help my daughter, so I’ll do whatever I need to. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, I'll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. Okay, everything sounds reasonably clear, although I do detect a slightly rapid heart rate. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Nothing concerning at this moment, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Pulse is 88 and regular. Alright, Mr. Verrall. Based on the initial exam, your heart rate and blood pressure are slightly elevated. The tenderness in your upper abdomen warrants some further investigation. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function, and liver enzymes, as well as a complete blood count. We’ll also run a urine analysis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests, urine… yes, okay. I don't mind. Just… how long will it take? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. I can pay, but I need to know. I'm just trying to be prepared.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Verrall. We'll try to keep costs as reasonable as possible. The blood tests and urine analysis should take about an hour to complete. As for the cost, I estimate it will be around $200-$300, but the exact amount will depend on the specific tests the lab runs. I can have the lab give you a more precise estimate before they begin. We can also discuss potential financial assistance programs available through the clinic. I don't want your financial situation to be a barrier to getting the care you need. Once the results are back – usually within a day or two – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: $200-$300… okay. That's… manageable. I appreciate you telling me the cost upfront, Doctor. And the financial assistance… that's very kind of you. Yes, please, if there's anything available, let me know. I just want to make sure everything is okay for my daughter. Yes, a follow-up appointment sounds good. After the tests, you can call me. My number is… …Here it is. 555-123-4567. So, what do I do now? Do I go to the lab? Do I need to fill out any forms? Just tell me what I need to do. I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verrall. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The nurse at the front desk, Sarah, will be expecting you. She'll have you fill out a brief consent form and then take a sample of your blood and urine. It shouldn't take too long. I'll also have Sarah send the results directly to me. Once I’ve had a chance to review them, I'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about the process before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just fill out the forms, give them some blood and… water. Yes. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your patience with me. I'm not used to all of this medical stuff. Right, well, I'll go do that now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And please, take your time. .
