DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I'm Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today. Please, tell me what brings you in. Try to be concise, if you would. My schedule is rather…full.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. And please, call me Alroy. “Mr. Mombrun” feels a bit…distant, don’t you think? I requested a general wellness panel, simply to have a look at how things are functioning, you see. Preventative, as they say. My wife, Eloisa, insists on it annually, and well…a happy wife… I believe you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Preventative care is…acceptable, I suppose. Though, at your age, Mr. Mombrun – Alroy – a general panel is rather… broad. We could be more targeted, don’t you think?
PATIENT: Targeted? I confess, I hadn’t considered specifics, Doctor. I leave such decisions to the professionals. I simply wished to ensure all is in order, a comprehensive view, if you will. Perhaps you could suggest what you consider most pertinent given… my age, as you say? I trust your judgment entirely. What areas do you typically focus on for someone of my…vintage?
DOCTOR: Very well. At your age, we prioritize cardiovascular health, naturally. And given your… heritage, I will also be looking closely for any predisposition to diabetes. We'll also assess renal function, and… a basic cognitive screening is standard. Now, have you experienced any changes recently?
PATIENT: Cardiovascular, diabetes, and kidneys… a sensible approach, I believe. And a cognitive screening… Eloisa would be pleased to hear you are thorough! As for changes… Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, Doctor. My memory remains quite sharp, thankfully. I recall dates and events with remarkable clarity, even from my youth in Venezuela. Perhaps a little stiffness in the mornings, but nothing debilitating. Appetite is good, sleep is regular… truly, I feel remarkably well for seventy-four years. Though, I do sometimes misplace my reading glasses. But I attribute that to Eloisa moving them, naturally.
DOCTOR: Misplaced items… a common complaint. Still, it's good to rule things out. Do you have a family history of any significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, thankfully, my family has been…blessed with good health, for the most part. My father lived to eighty-nine, a strong man despite working the land his entire life. He did develop some arthritis in his later years, and my mother suffered from high blood pressure, but nothing truly debilitating. On Eloisa’s side…her mother had a touch of glaucoma, I believe, and her father…well, he passed rather suddenly from a heart ailment, though he was a heavy smoker, I must add. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? Perhaps knowing what you are focusing on would assist my recollection. My mind works best when prompted, you see.
DOCTOR: The heart ailment is…relevant. And the arthritis, though less so. We'll need to do a full lipid panel, naturally, and an EKG. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations…no, not at all, Doctor. Chest pain… a little discomfort occasionally, particularly after strenuous activity, but nothing that would cause me concern. I attribute it to simply being… out of practice, you see. I used to be quite the swimmer in my youth, very active. Now, mostly I enjoy tending to my garden. Shortness of breath… sometimes when climbing the stairs, perhaps, but nothing alarming. It passes quickly. I confess, I am not one to dwell on physical sensations. I've always prided myself on my resilience. But I will, of course, be honest about anything that truly troubles me. Please, do not hesitate to ask.
DOCTOR: “Occasional discomfort after activity.” We'll need to clarify that. When, exactly, does this discomfort occur?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… it typically arises after prolonged effort in the garden, Doctor. Weeding, digging… tasks that require a fair amount of bending and exertion. It’s not a sharp pain, not at all. More of a…tightness in the chest, a slight pressure. It usually subsides within a few minutes of resting. And it doesn’t radiate, if that is the correct term. It remains localized, right here… It hasn’t interfered with my daily activities, thankfully. I simply take a moment to catch my breath, and then continue. Eloisa does nag me about overdoing it, of course. She insists I pace myself. A very sensible woman, my Eloisa.
DOCTOR: "Localized chest tightness with exertion." We will proceed with a physical exam, then. Please, if you would, lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. Lead the way. I trust your professional judgment entirely. Though I must confess, I’ve always disliked examinations. A bit… intrusive, don’t you think? But I understand it’s all in the name of good health. Please, do not hesitate to tell me if I need to adjust myself in any way. I wish to make this as…efficient as possible.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, but not drastically so. I detect a slight murmur… not particularly concerning, given your history, but we'll need to document it. Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90… a little high, but likely stress-related. Reflexes are normal. Overall, your physical exam is… unremarkable. Now, let’s order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. And an EKG, of course. The nurse will take your blood. It will take approximately fifteen minutes.
PATIENT: A murmur… I see. And elevated blood pressure… perhaps it is simply the anticipation of the examination. I confess, I do dislike being prodded and poked. As for the tests… whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. A complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, thyroid… yes, you are quite thorough. Fifteen minutes, you say? That is perfectly acceptable. I have no pressing engagements. I shall simply relax and contemplate the intricacies of garden design. The nurse will find me, I presume? I trust she has a steady hand. I dislike needles immensely.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will be with you momentarily. And try to relax, Mr. Mombrun. It will be over before you know it. I'll review the results as soon as they are available and we can discuss a plan. Do not hesitate to inform the staff if you experience any discomfort. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavor to remain calm. And I appreciate your thoroughness, despite your… busy schedule. I will inform the staff immediately should I experience any discomfort. Now, to contemplate garden design… and attempt to ignore the impending needle.
