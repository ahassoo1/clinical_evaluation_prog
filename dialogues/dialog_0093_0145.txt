DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. I am here because… well, my daughter, she thinks I should look into getting some help at home. She is very concerned. It is about… eligibility, I believe, for assistance. Home health, or… hospice, perhaps? She made the appointment. I am Lonell Bahta, by the way.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Bahta. And thank you for coming in today. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful to be proactive about your well-being. It's perfectly alright that she initiated the appointment; we can certainly discuss what options might be appropriate for you. To best understand your needs, could you tell me a little more about what’s been going on that prompted her concern?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, I am a surgeon, you see. Pediatric. Always have been. Very precise work. But… my hands, they are not as steady as they once were. Small things, really. Dropping instruments. A slight tremor when I am… concentrating. It doesn’t affect my judgment, not at all, but it… worries my daughter. She says it’s becoming dangerous. And… I tire easily now. Used to work all day, no problem. Now, I need a nap in the afternoon. It is… frustrating, to be honest. I do not feel sick, not exactly. Just… older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bahta. It’s certainly understandable to feel frustrated when experiencing changes like that, especially given your profession and the precision it requires. It’s good that your daughter is observant and concerned, and it’s wise of you to address this. So, to clarify, the primary concerns are the tremor in your hands and increased fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct, Doctor. The hands and the tiredness. And… sometimes, I have trouble remembering names. Not important things, you understand. Just… the names of people I have met recently. It is not a big problem, but my daughter… she keeps a list now. She says it is getting worse. She worries about everything, that girl. But I appreciate it, of course.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're experiencing a constellation of changes, and it’s good that your daughter is keeping track of things. Memory changes, even minor ones, are worth noting. We'll take everything into consideration. Now, Mr. Bahta, have you noticed if these changes – the tremor, fatigue, and memory issues – have come on gradually, or were they more sudden in onset?
PATIENT: Gradually, Doctor. Very gradually. It began, I think, about six months ago. A little tiredness, then a dropped instrument here and there. The memory… that started a bit later, perhaps three months ago. It was so slow, I barely noticed at first. It was my daughter who pointed it out. She has a very good memory, that girl. Always has. She says I am… less focused. But I am still the same surgeon, I assure you. Still capable. Just… slower, perhaps. And needing a nap.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Mr. Bahta. A gradual onset is important to note. And it’s reassuring to hear you still feel capable in your work. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside these changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. No pain, no dizziness, no… changes in my appetite. I sleep well enough, though I do wake up a few times during the night. Just… old age, I suppose. My daughter asked if I had trouble with my balance, but no. I walk perfectly well. I still enjoy my garden, you see. Lots of bending and digging. No problems there. She also asked about headaches, but I rarely get headaches. No, I think that is all. Just the hands, the tiredness, and the… occasional forgotten name.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. No pain, dizziness, appetite changes, or balance issues is helpful. And the fact that you’re still able to enjoy gardening is positive. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. And I broke my arm once, playing football. Nothing serious. As an adult… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it is under control now with medication. Just a small pill each morning. And… I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, I have been quite healthy, actually. Considering my age, of course. I try to eat well, and I walk every day. My daughter says I am too stubborn to stay still.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. So, high blood pressure, currently controlled with medication, and a history of pneumonia. And you've otherwise been quite healthy. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one pill for the blood pressure. And… a vitamin D supplement, my daughter insisted. She says everyone needs vitamin D. I do not know if it makes any difference, but I take it. She buys it for me, so I take it. She is very… thorough, that girl. Always looking after me. I do not think I need a vitamin, but she worries.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Bahta. Just the blood pressure medication and the vitamin D supplement your daughter provides. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I am aware of. I have eaten everything, traveled everywhere. Never had a reaction to anything. My daughter asked if I had trouble breathing, but no. Never had any trouble breathing. I used to smoke, years ago, but I stopped twenty years ago. No allergies at all, as far as I know. I am a very… robust individual, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bahta. No known allergies is good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father… he had heart trouble in his later years. Had to have a… a pacemaker, I believe. And my mother… she had arthritis, very bad arthritis in her hands. Could barely move them in the end. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had… well, my daughter calls it “memory problems.” She needed a lot of care in her old age. That is about it, I think. Nothing else that I am aware of. My family… they lived long lives, mostly. But they all… slowed down eventually.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bahta. So, a history of heart trouble in your father, arthritis in your mother, and some memory problems in your aunt. That’s helpful information. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I am divorced, have been for many years. No children besides my daughter, Camille. She lives nearby, thankfully. Very supportive. I live alone, but I do not feel lonely. I have a small garden, as I mentioned, and I enjoy reading. I used to play golf, but my hands… they are not steady enough anymore. I do not drink alcohol, never have. And I do not smoke. A quiet life, mostly. But a good life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Bahta. It sounds like you have a supportive daughter and enjoy a peaceful life. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, I'd like to clarify a few things. You mentioned your daughter initiated this appointment because of concerns about your hands, fatigue, and memory. Is it fair to say these changes are impacting your daily life, even in small ways?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fair to say. The hands, they make simple things… difficult. Buttoning my shirt, for example. Or… opening a jar. And the tiredness… it means I cannot do everything I used to. I used to walk for hours, but now I need to rest. And the memory… it is embarrassing, sometimes. Forgetting names, or… misplacing things. It does not stop me from doing things, but it is… frustrating. And my daughter… she worries constantly. So, yes, it impacts my life, in small ways. But I am still myself, I assure you. Still a surgeon, still capable. Just… older.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Bahta. I understand. It's completely understandable to feel frustrated when experiencing these changes, and it's good that you're aware of them. Now, with your permission, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – as well as a neurological assessment to evaluate your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and a general assessment of your overall health. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly agreeable. Please, proceed. I understand it is necessary. And… I trust your judgment. Do as you need to do. I will cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bahta. Please have a seat on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please extend your arms and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I will remain still. Just tell me what to do. I am used to following instructions, you see. A surgeon must be precise.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. Is that satisfactory? I can walk further if you require. Though I do tire easily, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Your gait is steady, but slightly slower than expected. No noticeable unsteadiness. Now, could you please try touching your nose with your index finger, alternating hands?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Like this? Is this fast enough? I am a surgeon, you see. Precise movements are my specialty.
DOCTOR: There is a slight tremor in your hands, particularly when extending your arms. And there is a small degree of slowness in your movements. Now, I’m going to check your cranial nerves – just a quick assessment of your vision, facial muscles, and speech. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I can see it perfectly clearly. I have good eyesight, for my age.
DOCTOR: Eye movements are intact. Now, could you please smile for me?
PATIENT: Is that satisfactory, Doctor? I try to be pleasant. It is important to reassure patients, you see.
DOCTOR: Facial symmetry is intact. Now, could you please say "one, two, three"?
PATIENT: "One, two, three." Is my speech clear enough, Doctor? I have never had any trouble with my voice.
DOCTOR: Your speech is clear and articulate. Alright, Mr. Bahta. Thank you for cooperating with the examination. That completes the physical assessment. Based on your history and the examination findings – the tremor, fatigue, memory changes, slightly diminished reflexes, and slower gait – it appears you are experiencing some neurological changes. Now, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 levels, and a test to rule out any underlying infection. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly acceptable. If it will help to determine what is happening, I am happy to comply. An MRI… is that a lengthy procedure? And will it be uncomfortable? I do not like being confined in small spaces, if I am honest. But if it is necessary… I will do it. Please, tell me everything I need to know. And… will my daughter need to accompany me?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Mr. Bahta. The MRI scan itself takes about 30-45 minutes. It involves lying on a table inside a large magnet. It is a bit noisy, and you will need to remain very still during the scan. Regarding your concern about confined spaces, many people feel a bit anxious inside the MRI machine. We can certainly discuss options to help manage that anxiety, such as mild sedation or an open MRI, if that's available. An open MRI has a wider opening and may be more comfortable for you. Your daughter is welcome to accompany you to the appointment for support, and she can remain with you during the procedure, if the facility allows. In the meantime, while we await the results of the tests, I recommend continuing your regular routine as much as possible. I would also like to discuss some strategies to help manage your fatigue and memory changes, such as keeping a daily calendar, writing down important information, and getting regular exercise. Does that all sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very reasonable. The open MRI… that would be preferable, if possible. I do not think I would cope well in a confined space. And having my daughter with me… that would be a great comfort. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. And the suggestions for managing the fatigue and memory… I will certainly try them. A calendar… that is a good idea. My daughter already has one for me, actually. So… what happens next? Do I need to schedule an appointment for the MRI? And when will I receive the results of the blood tests? I would like to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Bahta. I'll write a referral for an open MRI and I’ll include a note requesting they accommodate your anxiety. My office will schedule the appointment for you and contact you with the date and time. As for the blood tests, the results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. My office will contact you as soon as they are available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as dizziness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I feel… reassured, knowing that we are taking this seriously. Please, let my daughter know about the open MRI. She will be relieved. And thank you again for explaining everything so clearly. I will await the results of the tests. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bahta. I’m glad I could reassure you. It was a pleasure meeting you. We’ll be in touch soon to schedule your follow-up appointment. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day.
