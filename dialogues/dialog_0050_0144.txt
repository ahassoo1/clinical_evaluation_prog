DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, well. Honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My daughter kept saying I should get “checked out.” She worries too much, that one. Nothing wrong, you understand. Just… seeing what all the fuss is about, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. While preventative care is always admirable, even in the absence of specific complaints, it’s important to have a reason for a medical visit. “Curiosity” isn’t quite a medical indication, Ms. Calvery. However, we can certainly perform a general assessment. To clarify, have you experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Oh, goodness. Let me think. Everything feels… old, I guess? Like it should. I mean, I am 64. Is that a change? My knees creak a bit more, maybe. But they always creaked. And I forget things… terribly. But that’s just getting older, right? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t really notice changes. My daughter tells me things, and then I shrug. It's all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to perceive gradual changes. “Creaking knees” and “forgetfulness” are, unfortunately, not particularly specific symptoms. Ms. Calvery, while aging is a natural process, these could be indicators of underlying issues. To get a clearer picture, let’s begin with a more detailed review of your medical history. Do you have any significant past medical problems – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot to remember. Let me see. My husband… he had the heart trouble. A bad one. I took him to all the appointments, though. I mostly just worried. As for me… I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, really. I had my tonsils out when I was little, and a bad flu a few years back, but that’s it. The doctor always said I had a strong heart. He was a nice man. I can’t recall his name, though… it’s just gone. It’s all gone. You see? This is what my daughter is talking about. Dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Calvery. It’s not uncommon for memory to become less reliable with age. However, we must differentiate between normal age-related changes and something more concerning. You mentioned your tonsillectomy and a recent influenza infection. Have you ever been hospitalized for any other reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh dear. Let me think… Not that I recall. Maybe for the birth of my daughter? But that was… a long time ago. And honestly, I don’t remember much about it. It was all very… blurry. I did have a bad fall a few years back, but I just bruised my arm. My daughter insisted on taking me to urgent care, but they didn’t keep me overnight. It was a silly fuss, really. Just a clumsy moment. I tend to trip over things. You know, rugs and such. Is that what you mean? Being in the hospital? No, not really. Just the urgent care visit.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – such as heart disease, cancer, or dementia?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... That's a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she wasn't very forthcoming about things. Always very private. My father… he passed away when I was young. I don’t recall him being sick, but that was a long time ago. My husband’s side… his mother had… something with her stomach, I think? But again, I wasn’t really paying attention to these things. We mostly talked about the grandchildren. My daughter keeps telling me I should have asked more questions, but honestly, Doctor, at family gatherings, you talk about life, not illnesses! It feels… rude. Is that what you want to know? About bad things that happened to people? It’s all a bit depressing, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is often difficult to obtain a comprehensive family history, Ms. Calvery. However, even limited information is helpful. We will proceed with what you’ve provided. Now, I must ask about your social habits. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Those are… personal questions, aren’t they? Well. My husband… he enjoyed a glass of wine with dinner. Every night. A small one. I didn't really care for it myself. Too bitter. And smoking? No, never. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit. Ruined your lungs, she said. I’ve always been a very… sensible woman. I drink tea, mostly. Lots and lots of tea. And sometimes, a small piece of chocolate. Is that what you want to know? About bad habits? I don’t have any. Really. I’m very good about taking care of myself. Mostly. Except for tripping, of course. But that's just clumsiness. Not a habit.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Ms. Calvery. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… No, not really. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. And medications… Well, the doctor gave me something for my blood pressure a few years back. But it made me feel so… dizzy. So I stopped taking it. My daughter was furious, but honestly, Doctor, what’s the point of being healthy if you can’t even stand up straight? I take a vitamin D supplement now. My daughter suggested it. For the bones, she said. And sometimes, an aspirin if I have a headache. But that’s it. Mostly tea. And a small piece of chocolate. Is that enough information? I’m trying to remember everything, but it's all a bit… muddled, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Calvery. Now, I think it would be prudent to perform a brief physical examination. This will help me assess your overall health and determine if any further investigation is necessary. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical… Well, I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. I haven't been to a doctor in… goodness, I can’t even remember. But I’m not afraid. Just… don’t poke too much, alright? And please, be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be. Just a quick look, alright? No need to spend too much time. I have a bridge club meeting later, and I wouldn't want to be late. Is that alright, Doctor? A quick look?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. A quick examination it will be. Please, have a seat on the examination table and we will begin. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure. 148 over 89. Slightly elevated, but not critically so. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, but there is some mild fullness. Reflexes are diminished, but present bilaterally. Sensation is intact bilaterally. Overall, your examination reveals some findings that warrant further investigation. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, your heart sounds are muffled, and your reflexes are diminished. However, these findings are not immediately alarming. We will proceed with some blood work to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying conditions.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood work? Is it going to hurt? And what do you mean, “serious”? My daughter is going to be furious if I come home with a list of problems. She’ll say I should have gone to the doctor sooner. But honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine! A little creaky, a little forgetful, but perfectly fine. Is it really necessary? Can’t we just… have tea instead? Perhaps that would lower my blood pressure? I always feel better with a nice cup of tea. And a small piece of chocolate.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, while a cup of tea may be soothing, it is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. The blood work is a routine procedure and will provide valuable information about your overall health. It will not be painful, simply a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. The purpose of the blood work is to rule out any serious underlying conditions. It is a preventative measure, not an indication of a current problem. We will be checking your cholesterol levels, kidney function, liver function, and blood sugar levels. It's a standard procedure for someone your age. I’m also going to order a basic cognitive assessment to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Your daughter's concerns, while perhaps overstated, warrant further investigation. It is important to address these concerns proactively to ensure your long-term health and well-being. Would you prefer I have the nurse draw the blood now, or would you like a few minutes to collect yourself?
PATIENT: Oh. A cognitive assessment? That sounds… awful. Like a test in school. I never was very good at tests. And blood work and a test? Honestly, Doctor, I think I’m starting to feel a little faint. It’s all so… overwhelming. My daughter will be so pleased. She always said I needed to be “looked at.” But I feel perfectly capable. I manage my bridge club, I cook dinner, I… well, I forget things, but everyone forgets things, don't they? Perhaps… perhaps we could just skip the test? I’ll try to remember things better, I promise. And I’ll drink more tea. Lots and lots of tea. And maybe a small piece of chocolate. Please, Doctor? Is that possible? Just the blood work? No test?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, while I appreciate your concerns, I must reiterate that a comprehensive evaluation is necessary. The cognitive assessment is a simple, non-invasive procedure that will provide valuable information about your mental function. It is not a test, but rather a tool to assess your overall cognitive health. Furthermore, dismissing your daughter’s concerns would be imprudent. Her observations may be indicative of an underlying issue that requires attention. While I am willing to compromise on the extent of the blood work—we can start with a basic panel—I cannot, in good conscience, forgo the cognitive assessment entirely. It is a standard part of a geriatric evaluation and is essential for ensuring your long-term well-being. Would you like me to explain the cognitive assessment procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A geriatric evaluation? That sounds… old. And scary. I don't feel old. Just… a little tired sometimes. And forgetful. But everyone gets tired, don't they? And forgetful. Is it going to be difficult? Will I have to… remember complicated things? I struggle with dates, you know. And names. And sometimes, where I put my glasses. Perhaps… perhaps my daughter could do the test for me? She has a very good memory. She remembers everything. Dates, names, where I put my glasses… everything. Would that be acceptable? She could tell you what I'm like. It would be much easier. Much less stressful. Please, Doctor? Just let my daughter do the test?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, with all due respect, your daughter’s observations are valuable, but they are not a substitute for a professional assessment. The cognitive assessment is designed to evaluate your mental function, not to rely on someone else’s interpretation of your abilities. It is essential for me to assess your cognitive abilities directly in order to accurately diagnose any potential underlying issues. Furthermore, relying on your daughter’s assessment would introduce bias and may not provide an accurate representation of your mental function. The assessment is not difficult, and I will be there to guide you through each step of the process. It will involve a series of simple questions and tasks designed to evaluate your memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It is not a test, but rather an opportunity for me to assess your overall cognitive health. I understand your concerns, but I must emphasize that this assessment is in your best interest. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is all so… upsetting. I just wanted a quick check-up, and now I’m being… assessed? Like a child in school? I feel so… humiliated. My daughter always said I should be more… proactive about my health. But I didn’t realize it would involve all this. I just wanted to know if I was still… me. If my memory was still… okay. Please, Doctor. I’m an old woman. Can’t you just… tell me if I’m still okay? Without all the tests and assessments? Just a quick look, a quick listen, and tell me if I’m still… me? Is that too much to ask? Please?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your distress. It is not my intention to make you feel humiliated or upset. I apologize if my insistence on the assessment has caused you any undue stress. However, I must reiterate that a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to accurately assess your overall health and ensure your long-term well-being. Simply "looking and listening" is not sufficient to rule out any potential underlying issues. Very well. I am willing to compromise. We will proceed with the basic blood work, as previously discussed. I will also perform a brief cognitive screening – a shorter, less comprehensive version of the full assessment – to get a preliminary understanding of your mental function. This screening will involve a few simple questions and tasks and should not be overly stressful. If the results of the screening are concerning, we can discuss further evaluation options at that time. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a shorter one? Just a few simple questions? That… that sounds much better. Not a long, complicated test? Just a quick… check? And you’ll explain everything? Every question? And you won't… make me feel silly if I forget something? Very well. A shorter one. Just a few simple questions. I… I suppose I can manage that. But please, be gentle. And explain everything. And don’t make me feel… old. Please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. A shorter screening it will be. I will explain each question carefully and will be there to guide you through the process. There is no need to feel pressured or concerned. The purpose of this screening is simply to get a preliminary understanding of your mental function and to identify any potential areas of concern. It is not a test, but rather an opportunity for me to assess your overall cognitive health. Please, have a seat. We can begin whenever you are ready. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. And Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: There is no need to be anxious, Ms. Calvery. We will take our time, and I will be here to guide you through every step of the process. And remember, a little tea and a small piece of chocolate never hurt anyone. Now, let's begin with a few simple questions, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, let's begin. But please, be gentle. And explain everything. I… I'm ready, I think. But please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Calvery. We will proceed at your pace. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date…? Oh dear. That’s… a difficult one. Is it… July? No, that was last month. August…? Oh, goodness. I always get the months mixed up. Is it the 2nd? Or the 3rd? I… I’m not quite sure. My daughter always remembers. But I… I can’t seem to recall. It's the second, isn’t it? Or is it the third? Oh dear…
DOCTOR: That is alright, Ms. Calvery. It's perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling dates. Let's move on to the next question. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: What city…? Oh dear. Is this… is this New York? No, that’s too big. Is it… Chicago? No, that's much colder. Oh dear, I always get the cities mixed up. Is this… is this the city where my daughter lives? No, that’s… that’s further south. Oh dear. I always get them mixed up. Is this... a suburb? Is that what you mean? A nice, quiet suburb? I always forget the names. It's a nice place, though. A very nice place. But I can't recall the name. Oh dear...
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Ms. Calvery. It seems you’re experiencing some difficulty with recall. Let’s try a simpler question. Can you tell me your own name?
PATIENT: My name…? Oh dear. That’s… a difficult one. My husband always called me… darling. But that’s not my name, is it? My daughter calls me… Mom. But that’s not my name, either. Oh dear. It’s… it’s a Korean name, I think. It's… it’s a nice name. My mother chose it. It starts with… a letter. I always forget. Oh dear. It’s… Lilly? Is that it? Lilly… Calvery? Is that right? I think so. Yes, Lilly Calvery. But I'm not quite sure. Oh dear... It’s been so long.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, do you know what year it is currently?
PATIENT: The year…? Oh dear. That’s… a very difficult question. Is it… the year my daughter graduated? No, that was… many years ago. Is it the year my husband… passed away? No, that was… a long, long time ago. Oh dear. I always forget the years. Is it… 2023? No, that feels… wrong. Is it… 2024? No, that doesn't sound right either. Oh dear. Is it… 2025? I… I think it might be 2025? But I’m not quite sure. Oh dear… It’s all so confusing. I always forget. Oh dear…
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, it seems you are experiencing significant difficulty with your memory. Based on these initial questions, I believe it is important to conduct a more comprehensive evaluation to determine the underlying cause of these cognitive difficulties. I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more thorough assessment. This assessment will involve a series of tests and imaging studies to evaluate your brain function and identify any potential underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A neurologist…? Tests…? Imaging studies…? Oh dear. What’s… what’s wrong with me? Am I… am I sick? Is it… is it serious? I just wanted a quick check-up, and now you’re talking about tests and doctors and… and… Oh dear. I just want to go home. I just want my daughter. Oh dear… What’s wrong with me? Am I losing my mind?
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, please, try to remain calm. It is important to remember that a referral does not necessarily mean you are seriously ill. It simply means that I want to ensure you receive the best possible care and that we identify the underlying cause of your memory difficulties. Memory difficulties can have many causes, some of which are easily treatable. A neurologist will be able to conduct a thorough assessment and determine the best course of action. I will arrange for a referral to a highly reputable neurologist in the area. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I will provide you with some resources on cognitive health and support groups for individuals experiencing memory difficulties. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. Resources… support groups… anything… anything to help me remember. I just want to be… me again. I just want my daughter to know I’m okay. Will I… will I lose my memory completely? Will I forget my daughter? Will I forget everything? Oh dear… please… please tell me I won’t forget everything.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, I understand your fears, and it is natural to be concerned about the possibility of losing your memory. However, it is important to remember that complete memory loss is rare. The vast majority of individuals experiencing memory difficulties do not experience complete memory loss. A neurologist will be able to conduct a thorough assessment and determine the underlying cause of your memory difficulties. They will then develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. Treatment options may include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. I will also provide you with some resources on cognitive health and support groups for individuals experiencing memory difficulties. These resources can provide you with valuable information and support. In the meantime, I would like to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss your progress and answer any questions you may have. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, a follow-up appointment. Two weeks… that sounds… okay. Anything… anything to help me remember. And… and to help my daughter not worry so much. Thank you… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. I… I just want to go home now. And… and maybe have a cup of tea. And… and a small piece of chocolate. Is that… is that okay?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. A cup of tea and a small piece of chocolate sounds perfectly acceptable. In fact, it sounds like a very good idea. I will have the nurse escort you to the reception desk to schedule your follow-up appointment and provide you with the resources we discussed. Please, don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. And Ms. Calvery?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Try not to worry too much. We will do everything we can to help you. And remember, you are not alone. Now, let's get you home so you can enjoy that cup of tea and a small piece of chocolate. Take care, Ms. Calvery.
