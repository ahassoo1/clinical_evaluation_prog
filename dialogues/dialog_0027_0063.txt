DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. My back… it’s been really bad lately. Worse than usual, and it’s… well, you know why I’m here. About the cancer. It hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I see here… previous diagnosis of cancer. And the back pain is new, or… worse than usual, you said?
PATIENT: Worse. Definitely worse. It used to be just a dull ache, you know? I could still do things. Now… now it’s hard to even get out of bed. And sitting is… ouch. It shoots pain down my leg sometimes too. Not all the time, but when it does… it’s bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. Shooting pain down the leg… that’s important information. Can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s mostly right here, at the small of my back. And it goes… it feels like it goes all the way around, kinda. Like a belt, tight around my waist. But the worst is right in the middle here. And then down my left leg, like you said. Not my right leg, just the left one. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. All right. And… how long has this increased pain been going on?
PATIENT: About… maybe a week and a half, I think? It started slowly, just a little bit worse each day. I thought it was just a bad day, you know? But then it just kept getting worse. Now, it’s… like somebody is stabbing me. Not all the time, but a lot of the time. It’s keeping me awake at night, too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specifically made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… Lifting things, definitely. Even just bending over to put on my shoes. Sitting for too long, like when I try to watch TV. But honestly? Sometimes it just hurts for no reason at all. It's… frustrating. I try to be careful, but it still hurts. It feels like everything makes it worse now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit sometimes, in my left foot, but it’s not… constant. Just a little “pins and needles” feeling, maybe once or twice a day. It goes away pretty quick. Nothing bad. I thought it was just my shoes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And… do you have any trouble controlling your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no trouble with that, thank goodness. Everything is… normal there. That hasn't changed. I was worried you were going to ask that! That's a good question, though. Is that… is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s always good to ask. No, no, it's just something we check. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to see what's going on. Could you lie down on your back for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, yes. That sounds good. Let me know if I need to move a certain way. It’s a little hard, you know? But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as you can. Does this hurt?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes. Right there. That spot. It's very tender. And… and when you push like that, it shoots that pain down my leg again. Not as bad as before, but… yeah. That's definitely the spot.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about if I have you bend forward, towards your toes?
PATIENT: Oh… Doctor, I don’t know if I can. It hurts a lot to bend over. I tried it this morning, and… it wasn’t good. I don't want to make it worse. Can we… can we maybe try something else?
DOCTOR: You're right. That's a good idea. Okay. Let's skip that for now. I’m looking at your chart here, and it mentions previous cancer treatment. Do you mind telling me a little about that?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. It was… it was a long time ago. About five years ago, I had surgery for it. They took out a… a piece of it, you know? And then I had some medicine, too. It was hard, but… they said it was all gone. That’s what they told me, anyway. I’ve been getting check-ups ever since, and everything was always okay. Until now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of cancer was it, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… It was… something with the stomach. Or maybe… the intestines? I always forget. It was a long time ago, and they used a lot of big words. The doctor told me what it was, of course, but… it’s hard to remember. They said it started in my… my belly. Does that help? I'm sorry I can't remember the name. It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. It's understandable. And do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not really. I used to have a little bit of high blood pressure, but the doctor gave me some pills, and it went away. Now I'm okay. Just this back pain, and… and the worry. That’s about it. I try to eat healthy and walk when I can, but it’s hard with the pain, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Given your history of cancer, the location of the pain, and the fact that it's worsening, I’m concerned about the possibility of the cancer spreading to your spine. It's important to rule that out. I want to order an MRI of your lower back. It will give us a much clearer picture of what's going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? Is that… is that serious? I thought… I thought everything was okay. What does that mean? Does that mean it’s back? Is it bad? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: It's okay to be scared, Ms. Meigs. An MRI is a very good test to help us understand what’s causing the pain. It doesn't necessarily mean the cancer is back, but given your history, it's the best way to be sure. We need to rule things out, and the MRI will help us do that. It's a precaution. We’ll get the results as quickly as possible, and then we’ll talk about a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… A precaution… okay. Yes. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. Let’s do the MRI. But… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt? I don’t like being in tight spaces, you know? I get a little… claustrophobic.
DOCTOR: The MRI itself shouldn't hurt at all. You’ll be lying very still, and it can be a little loud, but it’s not painful. And we can give you something to help with the claustrophobia if you're feeling anxious. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, but we’ll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some pain medication to help manage the discomfort. It's not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief while we wait for the MRI. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay. Pain medicine… that sounds good. Anything to help with the pain. And something for the… claustrophobia? That’s good to know. Yes. That sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. I’m still scared, but… I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something. What kind of pain medicine is it? And will it make me… sleepy? I need to be able to… you know, take care of myself.
DOCTOR: It’s a mild opioid, something to take the edge off. It can cause a little drowsiness, but not usually enough to interfere with your daily activities. We’ll start with a low dose, and you can let us know if it’s not effective. I’ll also write down the instructions very clearly. And I’m going to order the MRI and get the referral sent to the imaging center. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. I want to see you again as soon as we have the results back, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll try to be brave. And I will call if the medicine doesn’t work, or if I have any problems. I appreciate you explaining everything. And… thank you for listening. I think that’s all I need for now, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all for now. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help you through this. My nurse will come in to give you the prescriptions and the referral information. Take care of yourself, Ms. Meigs. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this. .
