DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… my pressure's been up. Feels kinda funny sometimes, you know? Not good funny. My daughter, bless her heart, she kept on me to come get it checked.
DOCTOR: Right. “Pressure’s been up.” And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while now. Maybe… a couple months, I reckon? Hard to say exactly. I don't pay attention to dates like I used to. It ain’t been sudden, that's for sure. Just… gradually gettin' worse, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Gradually getting worse.” Okay. And when you say “funny,” can you describe that sensation?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a laughin' kinda funny. It's more like… a thumpin' in my head, sometimes. And a kinda… whooshin’ feeling. Makes me a little dizzy, now and then. Mostly just feel tired, though. Real tired. Like I been walkin' uphill all day.
DOCTOR: Thumpin’ and whooshin’. Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this – chest pain, shortness of breath, vision changes, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain. Breathin's alright. My eyesight ain't what it used to be, but that's just old age, I figure. Haven’t noticed nothin' new with it. Just the head feelin’ and the tired. And maybe a little more forgetful than usual, but at my age… well, what isn’t forgetful?
DOCTOR: Forgetfulness. Right. Do you have any known medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Just the high blood pressure, I suppose. That's what Doc Miller told me years ago, before he… well, before he retired. He put me on some pills for a long time, but I stopped takin' 'em a while back. Didn't seem to be doin' much good, and I didn't like how they made me feel.
DOCTOR: Stopped medication… Of course. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. Musta been… forty years ago, maybe more. And I was in the hospital when I broke my hip a few years back. Fell in the garden. Nasty tumble. But that’s about it, I think. Small things. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… My mama, she had a weak heart, I think. She was always tired. And my brother, he had a stroke, a long time ago. Didn't last long after that. But other than that… nothin' I can rightly recall. It was a big family, and I wasn't close to everyone. Things get lost over time, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Like I said, I stopped takin' them pills. And I don’t go much for vitamins and such. I try to eat healthy – mostly – but that’s about it. Baked goods don’t count as healthy, I reckon, but a body needs a little treat now and then, don't it? Especially when you're ninety years old.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s take your blood pressure now. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Just sit here quietly. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'll try to be quiet. It's hard sometimes, my mind wanders. But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95. Not ideal. Heart sounds are a bit… irregular. Lungs are clear. I’m going to order some blood work and an EKG. We need to get a better picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh. That don’t sound good, does it? Blood work and… what was that other thing? E… K… G? I just want to feel better, Doctor. I ain't askin' for much. Is it somethin’ serious? I've lived a long life, but… I still got my daughter to see, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s routine, Ms. Steines. We need data. The EKG – that's an electrocardiogram. It checks your heart’s electrical activity. The blood work will give us information about your kidneys, cholesterol, and other important things. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. We'll get the results back in a few days. In the meantime, I'm going to start you on a low dose of a blood pressure medication. Do not stop taking this medication without talking to me first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Don’t stop the pills. I remember. It’s just… all this feels a little overwhelming, you know? A lot to take in. But I'll do what you say. I promise. What kinda pills are they? And… will they make me feel awful? Like the last ones did? I just wanna be able to bake a pie for my granddaughter, that’s all.
DOCTOR: It's a low-dose ACE inhibitor. Lisinopril. It shouldn't have the same side effects as whatever you were on before, but everyone reacts differently. Common side effects are a dry cough, dizziness, and fatigue. If you experience anything bothersome, call the office. Here's your prescription. And I'll have the lab order sent over to the front desk. Follow up with me in two weeks to review the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I guess that’s all. Just… thank you. I hope these pills work. .
