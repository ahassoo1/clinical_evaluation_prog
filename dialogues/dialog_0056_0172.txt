DOCTOR: Hi Candice, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, it’s rather simple, really. I just moved here, you see, and I’m required to… establish care. Something about my insurance. Medicare, it is. Honestly, all this paperwork… it’s quite a bother. I suppose you need to know… something about my health? I haven't been feeling poorly, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Right, establishing care is perfectly normal when you move, and Medicare does have its requirements. Don’t worry, we’ll get through the paperwork. And it’s good to hear you’re not feeling poorly! Still, it’s helpful for me to have a little background, just in case. I see you recently moved here… and that your insurance is Medicare, as you mentioned. Let’s start with a quick overview. Have you had any major medical issues in the past – anything you've been regularly treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Regularly treated… that's a difficult question. So many years… I suppose I've had the usual aches and pains that come with age. My husband, bless his heart, always handled the details. He kept track of everything. I… honestly can't recall specifics. A touch of arthritis, perhaps? It flares up now and then. But nothing serious, if that’s what you’re getting at.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's very common for things to get a little fuzzy with time. “A touch of arthritis” is good to know. And has anything been done about the arthritis – any surgeries or treatments specifically for it?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Heavens, no. Never any surgeries. Just… creams, I think. And pills, occasionally. My husband got them for me. He always knew what was best. Honestly, it wasn’t bothersome enough to warrant… fussing over. I just wanted to get this visit over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, just creams and pills as needed. I understand wanting to keep things simple. Do you happen to know what kind of pills they were, or at least what they were for besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you’re asking something I truly cannot recall. Little white pills, perhaps? Or maybe they were pink? It was quite some time ago, you see. I really didn't pay attention to such things. My husband handled the pharmacy. He always knew the names… and the dosages, of course. This is all rather… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s okay. We can try to piece things together. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I take a vitamin, I believe. A daily one. For… old people. It has all sorts of things in it. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly bad, I'll take an ibuprofen. The orange kind. But that’s very infrequent. Honestly, I don't like relying on pills. They never seem to do much good, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been quite robust, you see. My husband always said I had a strong constitution. I eat just about anything. Though I'm not particularly fond of beets, if you must know. But that's a matter of taste, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Good to know you have a strong constitution, and I understand about the beets! No known allergies then. Now, just to get a little more of a complete picture… have you ever been hospitalized for anything, or had any major surgeries in the past, even if it wasn’t related to arthritis?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… oh, goodness. Let me think. When I was a young woman, I had my tonsils removed. A very long time ago. And… I believe I was briefly in the hospital when I gave birth to my son. But that was… well, a very long time ago. Beyond that, nothing comes to mind. I’ve been quite fortunate, really. A healthy life, all things considered. I really wish this interview would be over soon.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalization for childbirth. That’s helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Oh, my husband, bless his heart, passed away three years ago. A very good man. And my son… he lives out west, California, I believe. Doesn't call often, if I'm being honest. Beyond that… I had a sister, but she passed away many years ago. A childhood illness, I believe. Really, there isn't much family left to speak of. And honestly, none of them were particularly… healthy. It's probably for the best.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband and sister. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam if you’re agreeable. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! My husband was adamantly opposed to smoking. Said it was a dreadful habit. I never touched a cigarette in my life. A perfectly respectable woman doesn't smoke, you see. It's simply… unseemly.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally, a glass of sherry with dinner. My husband and I, on special occasions. Nothing excessive, you understand. Just a small glass to… settle the stomach. But it's been quite some time since I've had any. Really, I haven't been feeling much like celebrating lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional sherry in the past. And finally, do you work, or do you have any hobbies or activities that keep you active?
PATIENT: Work? Oh, I used to. Dispatching, it was. For… well, it was a long time ago. Now, I mostly just… keep house. And try to avoid upsetting my son. He's a very… particular man. Hobbies? I enjoy a good crossword puzzle, occasionally. And I used to garden, but my knees… well, you know. Really, I don’t do much anymore. I mostly just… exist. Can we be finished now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice, that's a good overview. Thank you for your patience. Now, if you’re agreeable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your knees. It shouldn’t take long, and it will give me a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Really, I haven't been feeling particularly… inclined towards examinations. My knees are just… knees. Old and creaky. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. Just… be gentle, please. And don't take too long. I have… things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I'll be as gentle as possible, and we won’t take long. Alright, if you could just sit back in the chair and relax. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Knees exhibit mild crepitus with range of motion, some tenderness to palpation on the medial joint lines. No evidence of acute swelling or warmth. Alright, that’s all. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, Candice. The knee tenderness is likely related to arthritis, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that wasn't too dreadful. Arthritis, you say? I suppose that’s what I figured. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting any grand revelations. Is there… anything I need to do? Any pills I need to take? I really don’t care for all this fuss. And I'd like to know when I can leave, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Given your history and the exam findings, I don’t think any further testing is needed at this time. We can manage your arthritis with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen as you’ve been doing, but long-term, relying on those isn't ideal. I can write you a prescription for a topical cream – a mild anti-inflammatory – which might provide some relief. I also recommend some gentle exercise – things like walking or water aerobics – to help keep your joints mobile. And maintaining a healthy weight is important. I’m going to document establishing care, and I'll send you home with a prescription for the cream and some information on arthritis management. You're free to leave whenever you're ready. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: A prescription? Oh, dear. Honestly, I prefer to avoid such things if possible. But… very well. A cream is less intrusive than pills, I suppose. And exercise… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be. Information? Yes, I suppose that would be helpful. Though I doubt it will tell me anything I don't already know. Very well then. Is there anything else you need from me? I'm ready to be on my way.
DOCTOR: No, Candice, that’s all I need from you today. Here's the prescription for the cream, and this handout has some information about managing your arthritis – exercises, pain relief strategies, and things to watch out for. If you experience any worsening of your knee pain, or develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. And you're welcome to schedule a follow-up appointment in six months, or sooner if you have any concerns. I'm glad we were able to establish care today. Have a good day, Candice. And please, try not to overdo it.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you, I suppose. Though I doubt any of this will make much difference. Good day to you as well. And please, don't expect me to be a frequent visitor. .
