DOCTOR: Hello Keoni, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I've been… going to the bathroom a lot more recently. It’s quite disruptive, actually. I don’t quite recall when it started, but it feels like it’s been… some time now. Perhaps a few weeks? It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent urination. A few weeks, you said. Can you tell me a little more about how frequent is “frequent”?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It’s… well, I used to be able to go several hours without needing to go. Now… it feels like almost every couple of hours. Sometimes even less. It’s hard to say precisely. I don't really… keep track of those things. It's just… noticeable. And bothersome, of course. I apologize for not being more specific.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Keoni. It’s helpful just to get a sense of it. So, several times an hour now, is that right?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Several times an hour? I… I don’t think so. Not quite that often. More like… several times in a couple of hours, perhaps? It's… it varies. Some times it feels more pressing than others. It really isn’t consistent, I’m afraid. My apologies, Doctor. I truly am not very good at remembering these details. Is that… is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Keoni. It is tricky to remember these things. So, several times in a couple of hours, varying in how urgent it feels. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of. No pain, no burning… nothing like that. I’ve just been going… more often. I haven't noticed any fever, or… anything else unusual. I sleep alright, eat normally… I suppose I just feel a little… tired, if I’m being honest. But that’s likely just from being… disturbed during the night, you know? Having to get up. Though, I wouldn't say it's debilitating. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, burning, fever, sleeping and eating normally, just increased frequency and some tiredness related to getting up at night. Have you noticed any change in your thirst?
PATIENT: Thirst… that’s an interesting question. I don’t think so, not really. I mean, I drink water regularly, as one should. But I haven’t felt particularly thirsty, or less thirsty, if that makes sense. It’s just… normal. I suppose. I haven’t been actively measuring my water intake or anything, Doctor. I apologize for my lack of precision. It’s… difficult to recall and quantify these things.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Keoni. It sounds like you're being very thorough in trying to recall everything. Okay, so no change in thirst. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a bit difficult. I was divorced some years ago, and… well, things were not always organized then, shall we say? I believe I had… the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. And I had a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that's all I can readily recall. I don't believe I’ve ever been diagnosed with anything specific. No, I’m fairly certain. Though, I suppose it’s possible. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it once was. I apologize for the vagueness. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? Perhaps if you mentioned something, it would… trigger a recollection?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Keoni. It’s common for details to be fuzzy. No need to apologize. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I’ve been quite fortunate in that regard, thankfully. No surgeries at all. I’m… quite averse to them, truthfully. I’ve always tried to avoid them if at all possible. I've always preferred… natural remedies, when appropriate. Though, I understand they aren't always sufficient. But no, definitely no surgeries. I can assure you of that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… that’s a bit complicated. My mother… she passed away some years ago. And my father… we’re not particularly close. I don’t have any siblings. As for… family medical history… that’s difficult to say. I wasn’t particularly close to my mother, and she wasn’t one to… discuss such things openly. I believe my father had… high blood pressure, perhaps? But I’m not certain. It’s all very vague, I’m afraid. I apologize for my inability to provide more concrete information. It’s… frustrating, even to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother passed away, father not close, possible high blood pressure in father. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle… well, I work as a concierge, so I’m on my feet quite a bit during the day. It involves a fair amount of walking, assisting guests, that sort of thing. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to eat a reasonably healthy diet, although I admit I have a fondness for pastries. And I don’t… get a great deal of exercise beyond what my job requires. I live alone, so I’m fairly independent. It’s… a quiet life, mostly. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, concierge, on your feet a lot, non-smoker, occasional wine, healthy diet with a fondness for pastries, lives alone. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a severe allergic reaction to anything, thankfully. No food allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve taken antibiotics in the past, without issue. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, as far as I can recall. No, I don't think I have any allergies. But… I suppose it’s always possible. Is there a specific medication you’re thinking of? Perhaps that would… jog my memory? It’s just… I rarely take anything at all, so I don’t have much experience in that area. I apologize for the uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s helpful. Now, Keoni, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I suppose it’s necessary. Though, I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of… medical examinations. But if you believe it’s best, then please proceed. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? I apologize for being… anxious. It’s just… not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Keoni. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs, and finally a quick abdominal exam. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is a little elevated but not significantly concerning. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. However, I do note a slight fullness in your lower abdomen. It’s not painful, but it’s worth noting. Everything else appears normal. To rule out a urinary tract infection or other possible causes, I’d like to order a urine sample. We can do that here in the clinic. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn’t… too bad. A slight fullness, you say? I hadn't noticed. Though, to be honest, I don't often pay much attention to such things. A urine sample… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that's what you think is best, Doctor, then please proceed. I’m happy to cooperate. Just… tell me what I need to do. I apologize if I seem… clueless. I'm not accustomed to these procedures.
DOCTOR: You're not clueless at all, Keoni. It's perfectly normal to be unfamiliar with these things. I'll give you a sterile cup, and I’d like you to collect a mid-stream urine sample. That means you start urinating into the toilet, then collect a sample mid-way through. Try to avoid getting any menstrual blood in the sample, if that's possible. Here's the cup, and there's a private bathroom just down the hall. Take your time. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Let me know if you have any questions.
PATIENT: Mid-stream… yes, I think I understand. Start and then… collect mid-way through. Avoid any… menstrual blood. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll do my best. And I will let you know when I’m finished. If you’ll excuse me…
DOCTOR: Of course, Keoni. Take your time. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I… I believe I’ve managed it correctly. It wasn't as… straightforward as I anticipated, if I'm being honest. But I did my best to follow your instructions. Is this… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Keoni. Yes, this looks perfect. We’ll send this off to the lab, and it should be back within a couple of days. While we’re waiting for the results, I’d like to discuss some possible causes for your symptoms. Frequent urination can be caused by a number of things, including urinary tract infections, diabetes, overactive bladder, or even certain medications. Given your age and the absence of pain or fever, a UTI is less likely, but we need to rule it out. I also want to mention that stress and anxiety can sometimes contribute to urinary frequency. Is there anything particularly stressful happening in your life right now?
PATIENT: Stress… hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. I suppose… life is always a little stressful, isn't it? I work quite hard, and I live alone, so I have a great deal of responsibility. But nothing… particularly out of the ordinary, no. My divorce was some time ago, and I’ve… mostly moved on from that. Though, it does occasionally resurface in my thoughts. Perhaps a little loneliness, if I’m being honest. But I wouldn’t say it’s… overwhelming. Just… a quiet life. Is that… relevant? I apologize for being so vague. It’s difficult to articulate these feelings.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Keoni. It’s very common for stress and loneliness to contribute to physical symptoms, even if you don’t consciously realize it. However, we still need to rule out any medical causes first. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and trying to relax as much as possible. We'll get the lab results back as soon as we can. Once we have those, we can discuss a more specific treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Drinking water, avoiding caffeine… those seem… manageable. I appreciate your thoroughness, and your… kindness. It’s… comforting to know that you’re taking this seriously. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the results then. And try to… relax. Thank you again, Doctor Kimm.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. That’s what I’m here for. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen while we’re waiting for the results. I'll have the nurse give you a call in a couple of days with the results. Take care, and please try not to worry too much. It was lovely meeting you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your reassurance. I will try not to worry. And I will… await the nurse’s call. It was lovely meeting you as well, Doctor Kimm. Goodbye.
