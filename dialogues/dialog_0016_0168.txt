DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s…adequate to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m seeking…guidance. I’ve begun seeing someone, and I want to ensure everything is…properly vetted before things proceed too far. It’s rather important to me that we establish a…sound foundation, you understand.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Esthela. That’s very responsible of you. It’s smart to think ahead and ensure everything is sound before things become more serious. “Properly vetted” is a good way to put it! So, to clarify, you're looking for a general health check-up and discussion related to starting a new relationship?
PATIENT: Precisely. Though, it's not simply a "check-up," Doctor. I require a thorough assessment. One doesn't simply leap into a partnership without knowing the…state of affairs, shall we say? It’s a matter of…due diligence. And I'd prefer to know everything relevant. I have standards, you see.
DOCTOR: Standards are excellent, Esthela. And you’re right to want a thorough assessment. "Due diligence" is a perfect way to describe it. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly? Well, that depends on your definition of “regularly,” Doctor. I’ve attended to my health when necessary. I do have Medicare, of course. My husband handles most of those arrangements. I haven’t had a comprehensive examination in…some time, I suppose. Perhaps five years? I recall a visit for a knee issue, but that was hardly a full assessment. And truthfully, I don't recall the details. My husband keeps those records.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. Five years is a bit of a gap, so we’ll definitely do a comprehensive exam today. And no worries at all about the details – we can work through everything. Since your husband typically handles things, do you know if he’s aware you’re coming in today?
PATIENT: Oh, he is perfectly aware, Doctor. He insisted, actually. He’s…rather meticulous about these things. He believes in preventative measures, you see, and he was the one who scheduled the appointment. He said I needed a…“baseline,” whatever that means. Honestly, I mostly just agreed to avoid a lecture. He has…opinions.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know he's supportive! A "baseline" simply means getting a good understanding of your current health – things like your blood pressure, cholesterol, and a general check-up. It's a good starting point, especially with a new relationship. Alright, let’s start with some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I wouldn't say allergies precisely. I have…sensitivities. Certain foods simply don't agree with me. Shellfish, for one. And I find that red wine gives me a…discomfort. It's not a true allergy, though. More of a…disinclination. And as for medications, I try to avoid them whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies. Though, I did take something for my knee a few years back…I believe it was an anti-inflammatory. But I can't recall the name, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, shellfish and red wine sensitivities, and a preference for natural remedies. We can certainly work with that. It's good to know what you’re comfortable with. And it sounds like you’ve had an anti-inflammatory in the past for your knee. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see…I believe I have a Vitamin D supplement somewhere. My husband insists on it, you see. He reads those articles online about deficiencies and…well, you know how it is. And I occasionally take something for my joints. It's a…glucosamine-chondroitin blend, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I'm not terribly consistent. It depends on whether my knee is acting up. My husband purchases them; I simply take them when he reminds me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D and glucosamine-chondroitin, taken occasionally and managed by your husband. That's helpful. Now, Esthela, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… hmm. Let me think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Measles, mumps… nothing terribly serious. And I did have a rather unpleasant bout of bronchitis a few years back. That required a visit to the doctor, of course. I also had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. That was…necessary. Beyond that, I haven't had any major illnesses or surgeries, to my knowledge. My husband keeps better track of these things, you understand. He has a filing system. It’s quite impressive, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood illnesses, bronchitis, hysterectomy ten years ago. And I understand your husband keeps meticulous records – that’s very helpful. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history…that is a rather…complicated subject, Doctor. My mother had…high blood pressure, I believe. And my aunt, on my father’s side, had something with her heart. But truthfully, Doctor, we weren’t terribly close as a family. We didn't discuss medical matters openly. And my husband’s family is…quite healthy, as far as I know. He prides himself on good genes. He is quite particular about his lineage, you see. So, I’m afraid I can’t provide you with much detail. It’s not something I’ve ever kept track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history – hypertension in your mother and a cardiac condition in an aunt. That’s a good starting point, and we can certainly try to obtain more information if needed. Now, Esthela, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I wouldn’t describe it as…rigorous, Doctor. I enjoy reading, mostly. And I do some light gardening when the weather permits. I'm not one for strenuous activity. My husband, of course, believes I should exercise more. He is quite insistent on maintaining a healthy regimen. He walks every morning, you see. But I prefer a more…sedate pace. As for diet…I try to eat reasonably well, although I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. It’s a…comfort, you understand. And I confess I have a fondness for sweets. It’s one of my…vices.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Esthela. It's important to have things you enjoy! Now, just a couple more quick questions before we move on to a physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I find the habit…repugnant. My mother smoked for a time, and it was…most unpleasant. The smell, the cough…no, I've never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband wouldn't allow it, of course. He’s very particular about health matters, you see. He is quite adamant about avoiding all unhealthy habits. He is very…protective.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And one final question before we proceed to a physical exam. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I find that question…rather intrusive. I came to you seeking guidance regarding a potential relationship, and I’ve answered your questions regarding my general health with complete honesty. I believe that is sufficient. I’m not inclined to delve into such…personal matters. Is that acceptable?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Esthela. I apologize profusely. That was inappropriate and insensitive of me, and I should have phrased things differently – or not asked at all. It was a lapse in judgment on my part, and I sincerely regret making you uncomfortable. We will absolutely skip that question and move forward without discussing it. It was a breach of professional courtesy, and I apologize again. Now, let’s proceed with the physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: That is…acceptable, Doctor. I appreciate your apology. It is… reassuring to know you understand boundaries. Yes, let us proceed with the examination. I suppose it is best to get it over with. Though I must warn you, I am not particularly fond of…prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. I'll explain everything as I go. I'll start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please sit up and extend your arm?
PATIENT: Very well. Do try to be quick, Doctor. And please, refrain from unnecessary…conversation. I find it distracting when I’m attempting to remain…composed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I understand. Blood pressure is 132/86, pulse is 78 and regular. That's within a normal range. Now, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? I find it… taxing, breathing on command. One usually doesn’t think about such things consciously. Though my husband insists it’s beneficial. He reads about diaphragmatic breathing, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Esthela. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’ll just check your reflexes. Could you please sit with your feet dangling?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must warn you, I have never been particularly coordinated. My husband says I lack…spatial awareness. It's rather embarrassing, actually. He always has to guide me when parallel parking. Please, proceed before I divulge any further…personal shortcomings.
DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m just going to do a quick visual acuity test. Could you please cover your right eye?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I doubt this will be particularly illuminating. My vision isn't what it used to be, I must confess. I require reading glasses, you see. And I have never been able to identify colours accurately. My husband says it’s a…genetic predisposition. He’s always quick to attribute everything to genetics. Do proceed. I suppose it’s best to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela. Your vision is slightly diminished, as you suspected, but nothing of major concern. It appears you have mild age-related changes. Now, I'll just check your ears, nose and throat. Open wide and say "Ah…"
PATIENT: Ah… There. Is that adequate? I find medical examinations… profoundly undignified. It's rather intrusive, poking and prodding. My husband believes in preventative measures, of course, but I do find it… distressing. Please, do be quick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Esthela. Ears are clear. Nose and throat appear normal. Everything looks healthy. Now, just one final step - I'll take your temperature and check your pulse oximetry. Temperature is 98.6, pulse oximetry is 98%, which is excellent. Okay, Esthela, that concludes the physical examination. Overall, you appear to be in good health. I'll review your chart and provide you with a more detailed assessment in a moment. Do you have any immediate questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that concludes everything. I trust your assessment will be… thorough. I’m primarily concerned with ensuring I’m in optimal condition, you understand. A sound foundation, as I mentioned before. I simply wish to avoid any…unforeseen complications. And I appreciate your efficiency, Doctor. You didn’t linger unnecessarily. That is… commendable. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve endured enough medical prodding for one day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I completely understand. Let me just review your chart one last time… Based on the physical examination and the information you’ve provided, you're in generally good health for your age. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but nothing of immediate concern. We can monitor that during future visits. Your reflexes and vital signs are normal, and your examination was unremarkable. I recommend you continue with a healthy diet, regular light exercise, and routine check-ups. We can also discuss strategies for managing your slightly elevated blood pressure, such as reducing sodium intake. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Reducing sodium intake…yes, my husband has been advocating for that as well. He prepares all my meals, you see, and he is quite meticulous about portion control. He’s very particular about my well-being, you understand. And he’s always researching the latest dietary guidelines. No, I don't believe I have any immediate questions, Doctor. I trust your assessment. And I appreciate your…concise explanation. It’s refreshing to encounter a physician who doesn’t overwhelm patients with unnecessary jargon. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m ready to depart. I have a luncheon engagement, you see. And I wouldn’t want to be late. Thank you for your time, Doctor. It has been… adequate.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Esthela. I'm glad I could provide you with some reassurance. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in six months for a routine check-up. And feel free to mention any concerns to your husband, and we can discuss them during your next visit. Have a lovely luncheon!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That will be… adequate. Good day.
