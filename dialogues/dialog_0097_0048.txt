DOCTOR: “Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s…well, it’s these little spells, I suppose. Not magic, mind you. Just…forgetting things. Or being…mixed up. My wife, Srey, she’s the one who really pushed me to come in. She says I’ve been repeating myself lately, asking where I am, things like that. It’s bothersome, mostly to her, I think. I feel alright, mostly.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Mr. Lason, that’s helpful to know. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some memory difficulties, and your wife has noticed some changes too. That’s very good of Srey to bring it to your attention, and it's wise to get it checked out. It's not uncommon to have some forgetfulness as we get older, but it’s good we’re looking into it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about these ‘spells’ or moments of confusion?
PATIENT: Well, they don’t feel like spells. It’s just…a blank. Like someone switched off a light for a moment. Then it comes back. Usually it’s just simple things. Like…yesterday, I went to get the mail and completely forgot why I was going. Had to walk back inside and ask Srey. And sometimes I ask her what day it is, even though I know what day it is. It’s…irritating. And I don't like feeling like I’m losing it, if you know what I mean. I still do my tiling work, though. Best in the county, I’ll have you know. Never messed up a job in my life.
DOCTOR: “I completely understand, Mr. Lason. It’s unsettling to experience those moments of confusion, even if they’re brief, and it’s good that you’re still able to do your work – that’s a great sign. It’s good to hear you’re still feeling capable with your tiling. So, these moments of confusion – are they happening more frequently lately?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. It's hard to say exactly. Srey keeps track of these things. She says it’s been…worse in the last month or so. Before that, it was just now and then. A little slip of the mind. But lately…it feels like it’s happening a couple of times a week, maybe more. She also says I’ve been…more quiet. Just…sitting and staring off into space. I don’t feel like I’m staring, but she insists. Women notice things, you know. Always have.
DOCTOR: “They certainly do, Mr. Lason! It's good Srey is being so observant and keeping track of things. And it's helpful to know this is a more recent change, happening over the last month. A gradual increase in frequency is important to note. Now, aside from the memory issues and quietness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No…not really. I still eat the same. Still sleep alright, although I get up a couple of times to…you know. Old man things. No trouble with my vision, I don’t think. Still see well enough to do my work. No headaches or dizziness. And I haven’t fallen or anything like that. Srey worries about that, naturally. She's always asking if I feel steady on my feet. I tell her I'm as steady as a rock. Always have been. I suppose…maybe I'm a little more tired than usual? But I do hard work, all day. That’ll tire a man out.
DOCTOR: “Okay, that’s good to know, Mr. Lason. No changes in vision, no dizziness or falls, and just some increased fatigue, which could be from your work. That’s all very helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor gave it to me a few years back. I take a pill for it, every morning. Keeps it under control, mostly. Never had any trouble with sugar, or my heart. No surgeries, no broken bones, nothing like that. Always been a healthy man, all things considered. Worked outside my whole life. Built strong. Srey makes me take vitamins, too. Says it’s good for the brain. I don’t know about that, but it keeps her happy.
DOCTOR: “Good. It’s good that your blood pressure is managed with medication. And that you’re taking vitamins – Srey sounds like a very caring wife! It's also helpful to know you haven’t had any major surgeries or broken bones. Now, have any close family members – your parents, siblings – had any memory problems or conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or dementia?
PATIENT: Now that…that’s a hard question. My father…he was a quiet man. Always was. He got…strange, towards the end. Just…wouldn’t recognize people sometimes. Srey’s mother, she had something, yes. They took her to a home, a long time ago. Srey doesn’t like to talk about it. Said it was…a wasting disease. I don't know exactly what it was, but it was bad. Very bad. It worried me, naturally. But I figured…well, everyone gets something eventually. It doesn’t mean I will, does it?
DOCTOR: “That's understandable, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re thinking about family history, and it’s not uncommon for those conditions to run in families. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will develop something similar, but it does help us be more aware and thorough. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill. Lisinopril, I think it's called. Small white one. Take it every morning with my coffee. And the vitamins Srey gives me. Multivitamin, I think. She buys them at the market. Sometimes she gets me some extra ones for my joints, says my work is hard on them. But that’s it. Nothing else. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel…weak. Prefer to just get on with things, you know?
DOCTOR: “I understand, Mr. Lason. You prefer to stay active and avoid medication whenever possible. That's perfectly reasonable. Okay, so just the Lisinopril and the vitamins. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never had any trouble with allergies. Eat anything, go anywhere. Work in the dirt all day, breathe in the dust, never bothered me none. Srey keeps offering me something for my sinuses, says the dust is bad for them. I tell her I’ve been breathing dust for sixty years, I think I’m alright. She rolls her eyes, but she’s a good woman. Always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: “She sounds wonderful, Mr. Lason. It's good to know you have no known allergies. Okay, I’d like to do a brief physical exam now, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to assess your memory and reflexes. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just don't poke too much. I don't like doctors poking. But I suppose a quick look won't hurt. Just get it over with, eh? I got work to do this afternoon. Best tile in the county ain’t gonna set itself.
DOCTOR: “I promise to be quick and gentle, Mr. Lason. And I understand about the tile – a craftsman’s work is never done! Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions and do a few simple tests to check your memory and reflexes. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Alright. Ask away. Just don’t make me spell anything. I never was good at spelling. Words just…didn’t stick. But I can build you something beautiful. That’s what matters. Go on, then. Get it over with. The sooner I get back to work, the better.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, no spelling involved! Let's start with something simple. Could you please tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today? Uh…let me think. Srey told me…it’s…the 2nd. August the 2nd. Yes, that’s right. August the 2nd, 2025. I think. Unless it’s the 3rd. No, wait…she said the 2nd. Yes. August the 2nd. I’m sure of it. Now, can we be done?
DOCTOR: “Okay, August the 2nd. Good. And could you tell me what city we’re in?
PATIENT: What city…? Well, it’s…this is a small town. Rural, that’s what Dr. Georgiou said. Not a big city like Phnom Penh. I don’t know the name. Never had much reason to know the name of the city. I come here for work, and I go home. Srey handles all the…city stuff. She knows all the names. I just know it’s a small, quiet place. Peaceful. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: "That's alright, Mr. Lason. No problem at all. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words for me, and I'll ask you to recall them later. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat those for me?
PATIENT: Apple…table…penny. Yes. Apple, table, penny. Easy. I remember things. I gotta remember prices for my work, gotta remember what Srey tells me…simple words like that ain’t gonna be a problem. Now, can we please…I really got work to do. Best tile setter in the county, remember? Can’t spend all day in here.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand. Okay, now I'm going to ask you a few simple questions. First, who is the current president of the United States?
PATIENT: Ugh. Presidents…I don't follow politics. Never had much time for all that. Srey watches the news, but I tune it out. It's all just…noise. Uh… Biden, I think? Is that right? Something like that. It changes all the time, doesn't it? Now, can we move on? Really, Doctor, I appreciate you looking at me, but…work. I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: “Okay, Mr. Lason. Thank you. Now, one last thing. I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, showing all twelve numbers, and set the time to ten past eleven. I’ll provide a piece of paper and a pen.”
PATIENT: There. Done. Not much of an artist, you know. Never had a head for drawing. Hands just…don’t listen to me. Can we be finished now? I really need to go. This is taking up a whole afternoon!
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Mr. Lason. Alright. I appreciate you taking the time to do those tests. Based on our conversation and the results of these quick assessments, I have some concerns. You’re experiencing some memory difficulties, and have some trouble recalling recent information and with orientation. The clock drawing also shows some areas of concern. While it’s not a definitive diagnosis, these findings suggest you may be experiencing some early signs of cognitive impairment. It’s important to rule out any other possible causes for these symptoms. I recommend we order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other conditions that can affect memory. I also suggest a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation.” “I understand this may be concerning news, Mr. Lason. But early detection and diagnosis are crucial for managing these conditions. We can explore various treatment options and strategies to help maintain your quality of life.”
PATIENT: Cognitive…what? Look, I told you, I'm fine. A little forgetful, maybe. Old age, that's all. I still do my work. Best tile setter in the county, remember? I don't need blood tests, I don't need to see a…a nerve doctor. This is a waste of time. Srey…Srey worries too much. She always has. She thinks every little ache and pain is something serious. I just want to go home. Is that too much to ask? No. I don't want any blood tests. I don't want to see any doctors. I’m going home. Now.
DOCTOR: "I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason, and I respect your wishes. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and hesitant about further testing. However, I strongly recommend reconsidering the neurology referral. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it allows us to get a clearer picture of what's going on and explore all possible options. If you're not comfortable with the neurology referral right now, we can start with the blood tests. They're relatively simple and can help rule out other potential causes for your memory difficulties. Regardless of your decision, I want to ensure you're safe and supported. Srey seems very concerned, and it’s important to address her concerns as well. Perhaps we could schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss this further with both of you present?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. Just…get it over with. But no nerve doctor. No. I don't want anyone poking around in my brain. Srey…Srey can come with me if she wants. But I’m telling you, it’s nothing. Just a little forgetfulness. Old age. That's all. And don't expect me to come back for a bunch of…talking. I got work to do. The best tile in the county ain’t gonna set itself, you know. Just…get the blood tests done, and let me go home. Please.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Mr. Lason. We can certainly do the blood tests. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for me. It will just take a few minutes. We'll send the results to the lab, and I'll contact you as soon as they’re available. I understand your reluctance to see a neurologist, and I won't push you further at this time. However, I encourage you to keep an open mind. I’ll write up the orders for the blood tests now. And I’ll document our conversation today. I’ll also include a note for Srey, encouraging her to reach out if she has any concerns. And just so we’re both clear, I want you to know that if you experience any sudden changes in your memory or behavior, such as confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness, you should seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just…get it over with. And please, don't tell Srey anything scary. She worries enough as it is. Just tell her it's a routine check-up. Please. Now, can I go? I really need to get home. And back to work. That's all I want. Just…to get back to work.
DOCTOR: “Certainly, Mr. Lason. I’ll make sure to tell Srey it's just a routine check-up. I understand your desire to get back to work. It’s important to stay active and engaged. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw the blood. It will just take a few minutes. It was nice meeting you, Mr. Lason. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And I truly hope it's just a little forgetfulness. And that you continue to enjoy your work. The nurse’s station is just down the hall. They'll take good care of you.
PATIENT: .
