DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Yackey. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Honestly? I’ve been bruising like crazy lately. It’s… worrying me a bit. I’m on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out. It just seems worse than usual, that's all.
DOCTOR: A blood thinner, you say. Right. And how long have you been on this medication, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: About… six months now, I think. Maybe a little longer. The doctor after my… well, never mind. Six months sounds right. It was prescribed after a fall, broke my wrist pretty bad.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what was the reason for the fall, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… it was just clumsy, honestly. Tripped over my dog. He’s a little terror, always underfoot. Nothing… dramatic. Just a silly accident. But it led to the wrist, and then the blood thinner. Is that important? I mean, if it was just a fall…
DOCTOR: Everything is potentially important, Ms. Hainley. We need a complete picture. Now, you mentioned bruising “lately.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Let me think. It started… probably a month ago? Small things at first. Bumping into furniture, little marks. But the last couple of weeks it’s been… bigger. Like, really noticeable. I got one on my arm just yesterday from… honestly, I don’t even remember how. And my legs have a few, too. It's not painful, just… concerning. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Concerning, yes. Vague, also. Are these bruises occurring spontaneously, or only with trauma?
PATIENT: Spontaneously, sometimes. That's what's scaring me. Like, I'll wake up and there's one. Or I’ll be sitting, not doing anything, and feel a little ache, then look down and there it is. Most of them are from bumping into something, but not always hard enough to cause this much bruising, you know? It's like my skin is paper thin or something.
DOCTOR: Paper thin. Right. And what, precisely, is your current dosage of the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Ugh. That's… a good question. I honestly don't remember off the top of my head. It's… a little orange pill. I take one every day, first thing in the morning. I can look it up when I get home, I guess? I usually just refill the prescription when it’s time. I don’t really pay attention to the number on the bottle. Sorry. Is it important to know the exact number right now?
DOCTOR: It is always important to know the dosage of a medication you are taking, Ms. Hainley. However, we can proceed for now. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the bruising?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, I get it. Sorry. No… not really. I mean, I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just… life. And work's been stressful. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds, no… anything else weird. Just the bruising and the tiredness. And the worrying, obviously. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: And what line of work are you in, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: Information security. It's… a lot of sitting and staring at a computer. Which, I guess, explains some of the tiredness. But it doesn’t explain the bruising. Honestly, it's a bit of a desk job. Stressful, but not… physical. Does that make sense? I spend my days trying to prevent things, not… fall apart.
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. Let’s perform a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with a visual inspection of the bruising, then I’ll palpate your abdomen and check your vital signs.
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let’s just get it over with. I hope this doesn’t take too long. I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is within normal limits. Pulse is also acceptable. I observe multiple ecchymoses on your arms, consistent with your report. No abdominal tenderness noted. Now, have you noticed any other unusual bleeding – from your gums, your nose, any cuts that are slow to stop?
PATIENT: No. Honestly, nothing like that. My gums are fine. I haven't had a nosebleed in years. And cuts… well, I'm careful. I don't go around cutting myself. Everything stops normally, as far as I can tell. It really is just the bruises. And the tiredness, but I'm starting to think that's just me. Is this going to require blood tests? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hainley, blood tests are necessary. We need to assess your coagulation factors, complete blood count, and rule out other potential causes for the bruising. I understand your apprehension regarding needles, but this is a standard procedure to determine the underlying cause. I will order a CBC, PT, PTT, and a peripheral blood smear. We'll also need to do a basic metabolic panel. It's quite a comprehensive set, I'm afraid. Do you have any known allergies to latex, or any other sensitivities we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. A whole bunch of tests. Latex… I don’t think so. I’ve never really paid attention. I might have a mild sensitivity to… perfumes, sometimes. They give me a headache. But no serious allergies, no. Is this going to hurt a lot? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if I can work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: A mild perfume sensitivity is noted. The blood draw itself should be relatively quick. Minimal discomfort, typically. As for the results, the lab usually takes 24-48 hours. I can have the results faxed directly to your place of employment if you require documentation. However, I must advise against self-treating or altering your work schedule until we have a definitive diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, 24-48 hours. That's… manageable. Fax to work is fine, if necessary. And yeah, I understand. I won't go changing everything until I know what's going on. Just… stressful, you know? I like to be prepared. So, where do I go for the blood tests? And do I need to fast or anything?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall, room 203. You will need to provide your insurance information, though you indicated you are uninsured, so we will need to discuss that. And yes, you do need to fast for eight hours prior to the blood draw. No food or drink, except water. Here is a requisition form. Take this to the lab technician, and they will take care of everything. I'll review the results as soon as they are available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Fasting… eight hours. Got it. And the requisition form. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you… getting this sorted. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I’ll go get the tests done now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the lab technician know if you have any concerns. We will be in touch. .
