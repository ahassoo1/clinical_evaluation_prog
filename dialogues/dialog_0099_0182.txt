DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Orwin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Orwin. Werner Orwin. Look, I haven't got all day, you know. Just need this signed off so I can get on with things.
DOCTOR: “Signed off”?
PATIENT: Well, for the… the face thing. The doctor said I need clearance before I can schedule it. I’m a practical man, Doctor. Don't need to waste time with unnecessary… fuss.
DOCTOR: Let’s see… Ah, yes. Dr. Eldridge. He sent a referral for a facial lesion removal. And you want me to simply "sign off" on it?
PATIENT: That’s right. He said a general check-up was all that was needed. I’m perfectly healthy for my age, you know. Terrazzo work keeps a man fit. Strenuous, it is.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly healthy,” you say. And when was this check-up with Dr. Eldridge?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… must have been… last spring, I suppose. Around May, maybe? It was before the heat really got bad. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. I just go when something needs fixin’.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, according to his notes, it wasn’t exactly a comprehensive check-up. More of a quick look after you cut your cheek with a trowel. Now, about this… "face thing". Where exactly is this lesion?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just a little bump. On my chin. Been there for… well, a long time. Doesn't hurt or anything. My wife always said it was unsightly, but… she's gone now, so it doesn't really matter, does it? Honestly, it's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” requires a proper assessment, Mr. Orwin. Just because something seems insignificant doesn’t mean it is. Let's have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't go poking and prodding too much. I've got things to do, you know. Terrazzo doesn’t lay itself. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is raised, approximately 8 millimeters in diameter. Somewhat firm to the touch… and the borders aren't entirely smooth. I notice some telangiectasias present... What about any changes in size or shape recently, Mr. Orwin?
PATIENT: Telangie-what-nows? Look, I’m a craftsman, not a doctor. It's been there a while, like I said. Maybe a little bigger? Maybe not? I honestly can't recall. It doesn't feel different, if that’s what you’re asking. And frankly, I don’t spend my days staring at my chin.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m also palpating your lymph nodes... slightly enlarged on the left side, but not significantly. It's important to rule out any spread. Given the size, the irregular borders, and the history—or lack thereof—I'm not comfortable simply signing off on this for cosmetic removal. It requires a biopsy to determine exactly what we’re dealing with.
PATIENT: A biopsy?! Now hold on just a minute. A biopsy sounds… serious. I just want a little bump taken off my chin! Dr. Eldridge didn’t say anything about a biopsy! This is ridiculous! Is this necessary? Can't you just… cut it off and be done with it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, removing it without knowing what it is would be irresponsible. It could be something entirely benign, or it could be… something else. A biopsy is a standard procedure. It allows us to identify the cells and determine the appropriate course of action. "Just cutting it off" could lead to complications, recurrence, or… worse. I understand you’re a practical man, but this isn't a matter of simply fixing a cracked tile. It’s your health. I'm recommending a referral to a dermatologist for a proper assessment and biopsy.
PATIENT: A dermatologist… more waiting, more appointments… Honestly, the whole medical system is a waste of time. Fine. Fine! Send me to your… dermatologist. But I’m telling you right now, if it turns out to be nothing, I’m sending Dr. Eldridge a strongly worded letter. And you, Doctor, are wasting my valuable time. Just get the referral over with, please. I haven’t got all day. .
DOCTOR: Here’s the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's an excellent dermatologist, just outside of town. The form includes my recommendations for a biopsy. She’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I've also included a note detailing my concerns. Please follow up with her promptly. And Mr. Orwin… I strongly advise you to keep this appointment. It’s better to be safe than sorry. .
