DOCTOR: Hi Devin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, hi. It’s… my cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there’s some stuff, red stuff, when I cough. It ain't good. I smoke, you know? Been smokin’ a long time. I just want to get it checked, if that’s alright. Don’t really like talkin’ about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some red stuff when you cough… and you smoke. Right. We definitely want to get that checked out. No worries about not liking to talk about it, we’ll go at your pace. Just to clarify, when did the cough start?
PATIENT: Um… when did it start? Gosh. That's… hard to say exactly. A while ago. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little tickle, sometimes it's… worse. I don't really keep track of dates too good. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly okay, Devin. A few months is helpful. And it's good you're noticing it comes and goes, and varies in intensity. Is it worse at any particular time of day, or with any specific activities?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. I think… maybe when I first wake up? Yeah, that's it. And if I’m… doin’ stuff. Like, movin’ boxes or somethin’. Get short of breath then, too. Not real bad, but… noticeable. I mostly just try to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the mornings and with exertion, and you’ve noticed some shortness of breath. Do you have any other symptoms – like fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes, but it’s not like a sharp pain. Fever… I don’t think so. I haven’t been checkin’ my temperature or nothin’. Weight loss… I don’t know. Hard to say, I eat pretty much the same. Night sweats… no, I don’t think so. I mostly just sleep pretty sound. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No fever, chills, sharp chest pain, or significant weight loss. Just the tightness occasionally, and no night sweats. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never really had a bad reaction to anythin’. Medical conditions… I had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago. That's… about it, I think. Medicare is my insurance. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, gallbladder removed previously, and you’re covered by Medicare. Good to know. And just to finish up the history, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Ain’t takin’ nothin’. Never really been one for pills, if I can help it. Just… try to stay healthy. Eat okay. That's it. Can we… get to the lookin’ part now? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Alright, let’s do a quick exam then. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll also take your temperature and blood pressure. Then we can talk about what might be going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, sounds good. Let’s get it over with. I ain’t a fan of doctors, but… I understand it gotta be done. Just… try to be quick, if you could. Thanks.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. We can talk about that later. Now I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out. Okay. I'm hearing some wheezing and some crackles in your lungs, mostly on the lower sides. Heart sounds are a bit muffled, but regular. Now I’m going to check your temperature… 98.9 Fahrenheit. And finally, I'll just feel your lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are normal. Everything feels okay there.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it bad? I knew I shoulda quit smokin’ years ago. Just tell me straight, Doc. No need for fancy words.
DOCTOR: Okay, Devin. I’m not going to sugarcoat things, but I’m also not going to jump to conclusions. The wheezing and crackles I heard in your lungs, along with your history of smoking and the red stuff you’re coughing up, are concerning. It could be a number of things, but it's pointing towards a problem with your lungs. It could be bronchitis, or it could be something more serious like COPD or even, we need to rule this out, something like lung cancer. I want to be clear, I’m not saying you have cancer, but with your smoking history, we need to investigate it. We need to get some further testing done. First, I'd like to order a chest X-ray. That'll give us a better look at your lungs. We can also do a sputum test to look for any infection. And I would recommend a pulmonary function test to see how well your lungs are working. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Alright, alright. Do what you gotta do. X-ray, sput-um… whatever you said. I just want this over with. When can I get these done? And will Medicare cover all this? I don’t want no surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay. The X-ray and sputum test can be done right here at the clinic today. I’ll write you the orders now. The pulmonary function test will require a separate appointment – we can schedule that for early next week. And yes, Medicare should cover all of this. We’ll double-check everything with them before proceeding, but those tests are generally covered for patients with your history. I’ll have the receptionist confirm all your coverage details. In the meantime, and this is important, try to avoid smoking as much as possible. It’s going to make the testing more accurate, and it’s the best thing you can do for your lungs right now. Also, if you start feeling short of breath or develop a fever, come back immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. No smokin’… try to. And come back if I get… breathless or hot. Got it. So… I just go to the X-ray place now? And then… what about the sput-um? Where do I do that? Don’t wanna go to the wrong place. And can I still smoke a little? Just… one or two?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you'll go to the radiology department right down the hall, and they'll take the chest X-ray. After that, the technician will give you a cup and instructions on how to collect a sputum sample. It's basically a deep cough into the cup. The receptionist will give you the specific instructions. And I understand it’s hard, but to get the most accurate results, I really need you to avoid smoking entirely until we get these tests done and can discuss the results. Even one or two cigarettes can affect the reading. It's a small sacrifice for your health. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… gotta cough in a cup and don’t smoke. Alright. I'll go do it. Thanks, Doc. Hopefully it ain’t nothin’ too bad. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Take your time, Devin. And remember, if you feel any worsening of your symptoms, come back immediately. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
