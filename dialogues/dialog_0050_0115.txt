DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos, and I am your physician today. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos. Yes, well, it’s about my… a friend, actually. She’s been feeling quite unwell. Her skin… it’s turned a rather unpleasant yellow color. And she has… some trouble with her liver, I believe. A doctor mentioned hepatitis, a long time ago. I just… I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: I see. And you are consulting on behalf of this… friend?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. She… prefers I speak for her. She isn’t feeling up to it, you understand. It's… a delicate matter. And truthfully, my memory isn’t what it once was, so I’m afraid I can’t recall all the details. It was some time ago when she was first diagnosed.
DOCTOR: Very well. While I understand wanting to respect your friend’s privacy, a precise medical history is crucial for accurate assessment. To begin, can you recall approximately when this hepatitis diagnosis was made?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s difficult. It was… quite some time ago. Perhaps… the early 2000s? Or maybe late 90s? I really couldn’t say with certainty. It was before… before all the trouble with the economy, certainly. Does that help? I apologize for my… lack of precision. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: It provides some context, Ms. Durig, though, as you acknowledge, it is rather imprecise. Do you know what type of hepatitis was suspected, if any?
PATIENT: No, I’m afraid not. The doctor… it was a younger man, I believe… he mentioned a few things, but it all went over my head, truthfully. Something about A, B, and C… I just remember him saying it was a liver issue. She was quite ill, of course, but she recovered… or so we thought. It’s all a bit of a blur now. I’m terribly sorry.
DOCTOR: Understandable, Ms. Durig, though a precise history is always preferable. Has your… friend experienced any recent changes in her condition?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, recently… meaning in the last few weeks, she’s become… very fatigued. And the yellowing of her skin has become much more pronounced. She also complains of… discomfort in her abdomen. Not pain, exactly… just a general feeling of unwellness. And her appetite… she’s barely eating anything at all. It's worrying. Very worrying. She used to be so… vibrant.
DOCTOR: And is there any nausea or vomiting accompanying this decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe she did mention feeling a bit nauseous, yes. Not constantly, but… on and off. And… I seem to recall her saying something about… occasional vomiting. But it wasn’t frequent. It was more… a retching feeling, I think. Honestly, it’s difficult to say for certain. She doesn't like to burden me with details. It’s just… everything seems worse now. Much worse.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, has your friend had any recent travel?
PATIENT: No, no travel at all. She hasn't left the state in… oh, goodness, decades, I believe. She prefers to stay close to home. And she’s very careful about… everything, really. Cleanliness, diet… everything is very regimented. That’s why this is so baffling. She’s always been so… cautious. I can't imagine where she could have picked something up.
DOCTOR: And does your friend consume alcohol?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Never. She wouldn't touch a drop. She considers it… unhealthy. A vice. No, Doctor, she is very strict about her habits. That is certainly not the cause of this. I assure you. It's... quite the opposite, actually. She prides herself on her healthy lifestyle. This is… perplexing. Terribly perplexing.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ms. Durig, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination to assess your friend’s condition. I understand you are acting as her proxy, but a hands-on examination is essential. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a physical examination? Well… I suppose so. If it’s absolutely necessary. But please be gentle. She’s… rather frail, you see. And she dislikes being touched. It’s… a long story. But please, be as quick and discreet as possible. And… explain everything you’re doing beforehand. She doesn’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. I will explain each step before I proceed. If you would please have your friend lie down on the examination table, we can begin. We will start with auscultation of the heart and lungs, then palpation of the abdomen, and finally a visual inspection of the sclera for jaundice. It will be relatively quick.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But… perhaps you could explain what "auscultation" means, just to be certain. She… she gets easily flustered. And please, do be careful. She's very sensitive. It's... a delicate situation. And I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I may need you to repeat things. I apologize in advance.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. Auscultation simply means listening to the sounds within the body using a stethoscope. I will listen to your… friend’s heart and lungs to assess their rhythm and detect any abnormalities. It is a non-invasive procedure. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though respirations are shallow. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or enlargement. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Abdomen is soft, but with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No palpable masses. Liver margin is difficult to assess due to patient discomfort. And as you’ve already observed, the sclera – the whites of the eyes – are markedly jaundiced. This suggests a build-up of bilirubin in the bloodstream. Based on this initial examination, the jaundice, RUQ tenderness, and fatigue are concerning. However, a definitive diagnosis requires further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, that's... uncomfortable. Yes, quite uncomfortable. She's always been sensitive to pressure there. It's… a delicate area. And the… the yellowing is quite noticeable, isn’t it? It’s been worsening steadily. It’s… frightening, really. Further investigation? What does that entail, Doctor? More… poking and prodding? I must confess, I’m becoming rather anxious. She… she doesn’t like hospitals. Or doctors, for that matter. Is there… anything we can do to avoid extensive testing? Perhaps some sort of medication? I just… I want her to be comfortable. And I want to understand what’s happening. It’s… terribly unsettling. .
DOCTOR: Understandable, Ms. Durig. Unfortunately, determining the cause of the jaundice, and therefore the appropriate treatment, requires blood work. We’ll need to assess liver function, bilirubin levels, and rule out other potential causes of jaundice, such as gallstones or bile duct obstruction. It's also important to assess for any signs of infection. A complete blood count will also be necessary. I understand your concerns about further testing. However, without this information, I cannot provide an accurate diagnosis or recommend appropriate treatment. The blood draw itself is a relatively quick and minimally invasive procedure. It will allow us to rule out several serious conditions. It’s the most crucial next step. Do you consent to the blood work?
