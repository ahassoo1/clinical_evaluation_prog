DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. Now, you're 90 years young… quite a milestone. Let’s get right down to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, ninety years… feels like yesterday and a long time ago, both. My tummy… it’s getting big. And I don't feel like eating much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… sits. It’s not painful, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “Big,” you say?
PATIENT: Well… bigger than usual. I always been… small, you know? And now… it feels full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It's hard to explain. Like a balloon, maybe? A little bit. Not a big balloon, but… you understand.
DOCTOR: Right. A “balloon.” And how long has this been going on, this… fullness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Time… it goes so fast, doesn’t it? I think… maybe a few weeks? Or was it longer? I started noticing it after… after my friend, Elina, went to live with her daughter. Yes, that was… some time ago now. I’m not good with dates, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: A few weeks… alright. And has anything changed with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel… what now? Oh! You mean… going to the bathroom? Well… it's not as regular as it used to be. Sometimes it's okay, sometimes… not so much. Harder, maybe? And less… frequent. I drink plenty of tea, though! Does that help?
DOCTOR: Tea… well, it's liquid, yes. Let's not get carried away. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh my goodness! No! No, I don’t think so. I… I haven't looked, if that makes sense. I don't usually look. That sounds… unpleasant. Is that… is that something bad?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. Alright. And have you had any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite besides just not feeling hungry?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thank goodness! I haven't thrown up in… well, I can't remember the last time. Nausea… sometimes I feel a little queasy, but that could just be my old stomach. And like I said, not hungry. Food doesn’t seem as… appealing anymore. Everything tastes a bit… bland.
DOCTOR: And you said you’ve lost weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My daughter, Irina, she keeps telling me I'm too skinny. She worries. I think I have lost some weight. My clothes are… looser. Not that I go out much anymore. But yes, Irina says I need to eat more. She’s a good girl, Irina.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, given your age and these symptoms… it could be a number of things. We need to do a quick exam. And I'm going to order some blood work. It’s routine, just to see what's going on. Can you undress down to your underwear, and I'll listen to your abdomen and feel for anything unusual?
PATIENT: Oh… undress? In front of… you? I… I don’t know, Doctor. Is that really necessary? Couldn’t we… talk more first? Or maybe Irina could be here? I just… I’m not very comfortable with that.
DOCTOR: Madam McConnon, I am a physician. A physical examination is necessary to properly assess your condition. I assure you, this is a completely professional setting. If you are uncomfortable, we can reschedule and Irina can be present, but that will delay getting you the answers you need. However, I need to listen to your abdomen to understand what's happening. It's rather difficult to diagnose a balloon from a conversation, you see.
PATIENT: Oh… A balloon… yes. You are right, of course. It's just… I haven’t been to a doctor in a very long time. And it’s been a while since anyone… touched me like that. Alright, Doctor. You are right. Let’s… let’s get it over with. But… could you explain what you’re doing as you go along? Just… so I know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll explain as I go. Please lie back on the examination table. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this. It helps me hear the sounds inside – the gurgling, the movement. It'll be cold, just for a moment. Breathe normally. Now, I'm going to gently palpate – that means feel – your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Tell me if anything feels particularly painful. I’m just checking for size, shape and any masses. Alright. Your abdomen is slightly distended, as you described. It’s not particularly tender to the touch, but there is some fullness in the lower quadrants. I don’t feel any obvious masses, but it’s difficult to tell without further investigation. I’m also noting some mild guarding, which means your muscles are tightening slightly when I press on certain areas. It’s not alarming, but it’s something we need to consider.
PATIENT: Oh… that feels… strange. Not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. Like someone poking a water balloon. Distended? Guarding? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? I don't want to… end up in the hospital. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: “Distended” means swollen, larger than normal. “Guarding” means your muscles are tensing up, protecting your abdomen. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, Madam McConnon, but it does mean we need to figure out what’s causing this discomfort. It could be something simple – constipation, gas – or it could be something more… complex. To be thorough, I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count to check for infection, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. I’m also going to order a stool sample to rule out any bleeding or parasites. And, I’m going to order an abdominal ultrasound. That’s a non-invasive scan that will allow us to see your organs and identify any abnormalities. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… so many tests! Blood… stool… ultrasound… It all sounds… frightening. Ultrasound… is that… safe? And what about the results? How long will it take? I don’t want to be waiting forever. And what if… what if it is something serious? I'm an old woman, Doctor. I don’t know if I have the strength for… all this.
DOCTOR: Madam McConnon, I understand your anxiety, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your discomfort. The ultrasound is perfectly safe – it uses sound waves, not radiation. It's like… listening to music, but inside your abdomen. The results will take a few days, usually 2-3 business days, depending on the lab. As for what if it is something serious… we will cross that bridge when we come to it. We will discuss all your options and ensure you receive the best possible care. But right now, we need to gather information. I'll give you the requisitions for the blood work and stool sample. You can get those done at the lab across the street. The ultrasound will be scheduled for you by the receptionist on your way out. Do you have any questions about where to go or how to prepare for the tests?
PATIENT: Requisitions… across the street… I don’t… I don’t think I understand. Do I need to… make an appointment? And what do I do with the stool? It's all very… complicated. And I live alone, Doctor. I don’t have anyone to… help me.
DOCTOR: Look, here. This pamphlet has all the information you need about the lab. No appointment necessary, you just walk in and tell them you have a requisition from Dr. Nooruddin. As for the stool sample… it explains everything in detail. There's a special kit you'll need to collect it. It’s not pleasant, admittedly, but it’s crucial for accurate results. The receptionist will help you understand everything. She's very efficient. And look, if you absolutely cannot manage, I can see if Irina's number is on file and give her a call, but I need you to at least try to do this yourself first. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Irina… yes, that would be… kind. But… would that bother her? She's very busy, with her children and everything. I don't want to be a burden. Alright, Doctor. I'll… I'll try. I'll go to the lab, and I'll… attempt the stool sample. But if I get really confused, or… scared, could you please… could you please call Irina? Just… as a last resort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the number. I’ll make a note on your chart that Irina can be contacted if necessary. I'm going to print out the requisitions now. The receptionist will explain the process when you go to schedule the ultrasound. She’s very good at what she does. Now, do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you… for trying to help. It’s just… a lot to take in. I'll go see the receptionist now.
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead. They'll take care of you. Ninety years old… honestly.
