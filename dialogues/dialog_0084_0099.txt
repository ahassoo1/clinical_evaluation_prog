DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I'm Dr. Voytek. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Voytek. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… an examination of my insides, I believe it was called, and they indicated something wasn’t quite right with my stomach and… well, the whole digestive system, really. I was hoping you could explain them to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can definitely help with that. Let me pull up those results now… So, you had an examination of your insides – was that a CT scan, an endoscopy, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I confess, Doctor, I don’t recall the specific name. It involved a long, thin tube with a camera, I believe. They… inserted it. It wasn’t terribly pleasant, but the nurses were very kind. An endoscopy, you say? Yes, that sounds right. That must be it. I was a bit… distracted, I suppose, during the explanation. Is that what showed something abnormal?
DOCTOR: Yes, an endoscopy. That explains it. Okay, I’m looking at the report now. It does indicate some abnormalities. It looks like there’s some inflammation and a couple of small polyps were found in your stomach and duodenum – that's the first part of your small intestine. Now, polyps aren’t always a cause for concern – many are benign – but we do need to investigate further to be sure. Before we get too far, could you tell me a little bit about what symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Inflammation… and polyps. That doesn’t sound very promising, does it? I appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Doctor. Symptoms… well, for the past few months, I’ve had a rather persistent discomfort in my stomach. Not exactly pain, more of a… burning sensation, really. And I’ve been feeling quite full after even small meals. Sometimes nauseous, too, though I haven’t actually been sick. And… this is perhaps a bit embarrassing… my… bowel movements haven’t been regular. They’ve been… a little loose, more often than not. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all very relevant, Ms. Minatra. Thank you for sharing. So, persistent burning discomfort, feeling full quickly, some nausea, and loose stools for the past few months. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: That’s good to know I wasn't remiss in mentioning things, Doctor. Blood… no, I haven’t seen any blood. Not that I recall, at least. And as for weight loss… now that you mention it, my clothes have been feeling a bit looser lately. I hadn’t thought much of it, to be honest. I attributed it to the heat, perhaps. But you're right, I haven't been eating as much. It's just… hard to enjoy a meal when my stomach feels so unsettled. It’s not a significant amount of weight, though, if that makes sense. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, noticeable weight loss alongside the other symptoms is definitely something we need to address. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. I’ll tell you anything I can. Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, when I was in my early fifties. Apart from that… nothing significant, really. I’ve always been a fairly healthy person, all things considered. I do take medication for high blood pressure, a small dose, prescribed by my previous physician. He retired a few years back, and I haven't really found a replacement I trusted until now, it seems. And… I lost my husband, Roberto, last year. It’s been… difficult. But I’m managing. Is that sort of thing relevant, Doctor? I know it's not a medical condition, but stress can affect everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It absolutely is relevant, Ms. Minatra. Grief and stress absolutely can impact your health. Thank you for sharing that. So, gallbladder removal years ago, high blood pressure medication, and recent loss of your husband. Do you know the name of the medication you take for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe so. It's… Lisinopril. Yes, that's it. Lisinopril. I take 10 milligrams each morning. I've been on it for… oh, goodness, probably eight or nine years now. It keeps things stable, thankfully. My previous doctor monitored it regularly. I suppose I should have been more diligent about finding a new physician sooner. But I’ve always been a bit… hesitant to change doctors. I get so accustomed to their way of doing things, you see. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not silly at all, Ms. Minatra. Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And you said no allergies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies that I am aware of. I’ve been fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully – I adore cooking, and I wouldn't want to be limited in my recipes! I've never had a reaction to any food or medication, as far as I can remember. It’s one of the few things I can truly be thankful for these days. Although, I do tend to get a bit of heartburn from spicy foods, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it? More of a… personal limitation.
DOCTOR: No, heartburn isn’t an allergy. Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of stomach cancer, colon cancer, or any other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. My mother… she had stomach ulcers when I was a child, but they were treated successfully. She lived a long life, thankfully. My father… he had no known health problems, as far as I’m aware. He was a very stoic man, didn’t much care for doctors. As for my siblings… my sister, Elena, had some issues with irritable bowel syndrome, but nothing serious. No cancer, as far as I know. But my maternal grandmother… now that I think about it… she did pass away from some sort of abdominal illness when I was quite young. I don’t recall the specifics, I’m afraid. It was a long time ago, and my parents didn't discuss it much. It wasn't sudden, but it was… lingering. Does that help at all, Doctor? I apologize for my vagueness. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Ms. Minatra. Thank you. History of stomach ulcers in mother, IBS in sister, and lingering abdominal illness in maternal grandmother. We'll keep that in mind. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, feel for any tenderness, and check your vital signs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment implicitly. I understand it's necessary. Although… if you could be gentle, perhaps? My stomach is rather sensitive at the moment. But please, don’t hesitate to do whatever you need to do to get a proper assessment. I want to get to the bottom of this as much as you do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Minatra. I'll be as gentle as possible. Okay, if you could lie back on the examination table, please. Okay. I'm listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are a bit… active, but that’s not necessarily concerning given your symptoms. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any tenderness anywhere. Okay… a little discomfort here, on your left side, but no sharp pain. And here… a bit of tenderness in your upper abdomen. No masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is soft overall, but slightly distended. Blood pressure is 135/85, pulse is 78, and temperature is normal. Okay. Everything seems relatively stable, but the tenderness and distention are worth noting.
PATIENT: That's good to know, Doctor. I did notice the distention myself, but I assumed it was just… gas, perhaps. The tenderness on the left side… that's where I tend to feel the most discomfort, so that doesn't surprise me. I appreciate you confirming it. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? What are our next steps? I confess, I’m a bit anxious about it all. I don't like the thought of anything serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Minatra. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. Based on your symptoms, physical exam, and the endoscopy results, we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your discomfort and rule out anything serious. The polyps found during the endoscopy need to be biopsied, if they haven't been already. That means taking a small sample of the tissue to examine under a microscope. That will tell us if they are benign or malignant. I also recommend a complete blood count to check for any signs of anemia, and a fecal occult blood test to check for hidden blood in your stool. Finally, given your weight loss and family history, I think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be prudent to get a more detailed look at your organs. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds quite thorough, Doctor. A lot of tests, but I suppose that’s what’s necessary. Biopsies… that sounds a bit unpleasant, but I understand it’s important. The blood tests and CT scan… yes, those sound reasonable as well. I suppose my main concern is… what if it is something serious? I’ve always been a healthy person, and the thought of… well, you know. But I understand you need to get a clear picture, and I trust your judgment. Can you explain a bit more about the CT scan? What does it involve? And how long will it take to get the results back? And… what happens if the polyps are malignant? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions, Ms. Minatra, not at all. It's good to be informed and prepared. Okay, let's talk about the CT scan. It's a non-invasive imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of your abdomen and pelvis. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It's painless, but you'll need to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help highlight your organs. It takes about 30-45 minutes. Results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Now, regarding the possibility of malignancy… if the polyps are malignant, it doesn't necessarily mean a death sentence. Early detection is key. Treatment options depend on the size and location of the polyps, and can include endoscopic removal, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. We would discuss all of your options thoroughly, and I would refer you to an oncologist – a cancer specialist – for further evaluation and treatment. It's important to remember that we haven't diagnosed anything yet. We are simply gathering information. Let's focus on getting the tests done first, and then we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Scheduling them would put my mind at ease, even if it's just a little. I understand you need to gather information, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I suppose… the endoscopy facility is convenient. Can all the tests be done there? And what about the contrast dye for the CT scan? Will I need to take anything beforehand? Or avoid anything? I just want to make sure I’m prepared and don’t inadvertently interfere with the results. I feel like a bit of a bother, but you've been so patient with all my questions.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Minatra. I’m happy to answer any questions you have. Yes, we can schedule the blood tests and CT scan at the endoscopy facility – they have a radiology department as well. The contrast dye for the CT scan is usually administered orally about an hour before the scan. You'll need to drink a certain amount of liquid, and it's important to stay hydrated beforehand. You’ll need to fast for 4-6 hours before the scan, and we’ll give you detailed instructions when you schedule it. If you’re taking any medications, let the radiology technician know. We may need to adjust the dosage or temporarily stop certain medications. Let me see… I can schedule the blood tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 am, and the CT scan for Friday afternoon at 2:00 pm. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that works perfectly. Tomorrow morning and Friday afternoon are both good. Thank you so much for arranging everything so quickly. I feel much better knowing that we have a plan in place. Is there anything else I should be aware of before these tests? Any specific preparations I should make besides fasting and staying hydrated? And… what is the best way to contact you if I have any questions or concerns that arise before the tests? I truly appreciate your patience and kindness. You’ve put my mind at ease considerably.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help. Here are the instructions for the blood tests and CT scan. It includes everything we discussed, as well as some additional information about the contrast dye and potential side effects. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do anything special – just eat and drink normally beforehand. For the CT scan, it's important to wear comfortable clothing, as you'll be lying on a table for about 30-45 minutes. Avoid caffeine and sugary drinks the day before the scan, as they can interfere with the results. If you experience any allergic reaction to the contrast dye – such as hives, itching, or difficulty breathing – seek immediate medical attention. You can reach my office at 555-1234 if you have any questions or concerns. If it's an emergency, please go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Thank you again for your patience and thoroughness. You’ve been incredibly helpful, and I truly appreciate your kindness. I will follow the instructions carefully, and I will contact your office if I have any concerns. I suppose… all that’s left to do now is wait for the results. I will try to remain positive and hopeful. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. You’ve given me a great deal of peace of mind. Have a wonderful day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. I’m glad I could help. Try not to worry too much, and remember that we’re here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. You have a wonderful day as well. And please, take care. .
