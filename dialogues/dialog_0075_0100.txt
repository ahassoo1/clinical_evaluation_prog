DOCTOR: Bonjour, Madame Hughston. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, 2025. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something about… checking for things. My, uh, someone told me I needed to come in for it. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. Is this about work? I drive… the big machines, you know, for the roads.
DOCTOR: Alright, Madame Hughston. It's perfectly alright if it's a bit fuzzy. We can sort it out. It could be related to your work, yes, especially considering you operate heavy machinery. Just to be clear, were you given any specific name for the test, or did someone just say you needed a check-up for work purposes?
PATIENT: Hmm… a check-up… I think that’s right. No, no name, not that I recall. Just that it was… important. And that it had to do with… being safe on the job, I suppose. I do drive those big rollers all day, so… safety makes sense. My memory isn't what it used to be, I’m afraid. It’s a… substance thing, isn't it? That’s what I gathered.
DOCTOR: A substance thing… you mean a drug screening, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That sounds right. A drug… screening. That’s the word. Yes, that’s it exactly. Is that… bad? I don't… I don't do anything, if that makes sense. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, you know? But nothing more.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Madame Hughston. It's a fairly standard procedure for positions with safety concerns, like operating heavy machinery. It’s simply to ensure everyone’s well-being on the job. And a little wine with dinner shouldn't be a concern, as long as it doesn't interfere with your ability to operate the machines safely. To clarify, do you have any other medical conditions or take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Medical conditions… well, my knees ache a bit, getting old, you know? And I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off it a while back. Said it was making me… dizzy. Other than that… no, not really. Nothing major. I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. It’s just the knees, really. And the memory, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees and a history of blood pressure medication, but currently off it due to dizziness. Thank you for letting me know. And we’ll take our time, no need to rush with the memory. Before we proceed with the drug screening, I’d like to quickly review your current medications, allergies, and family medical history. Do you have any known allergies to any medications or substances?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I know of, no. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. I might be a little sensitive to bee stings, but that’s just swelling, you know? Nothing serious. And family history… oh dear. That’s a long story. My grandmother had something with her heart, I think, and my uncle had… diabetes? I’m not very good with remembering those things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies, mild sensitivity to bee stings, and a family history of heart issues and diabetes. That’s helpful. Just to confirm, you mentioned being off blood pressure medication due to dizziness. Has that dizziness resolved completely, or do you still experience it occasionally?
PATIENT: Oh, it's mostly gone now, yes. It comes and goes, you know? Not as bad as it was. It's usually just when I stand up too quickly, or if I’m really tired. Nothing that stops me from doing my work, thankfully. I just… I try to take things slow, that’s all. And drink plenty of water. Old age, I suppose. It comes with a few little… inconveniences.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Madame Hughston. It sounds like you've adapted well. Before we proceed with the drug screening, I'd like to do a quick physical exam—just a basic check of your vital signs and a brief assessment of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Vital signs… is that the blood pressure and things? I haven’t had that checked in a while, I don’t think. I hope it’s not too bad. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Madame Hughston. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your knees. It's a very straightforward exam, nothing to worry about. Just relax, and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. This is… very high, isn’t it? I haven’t been on one of these in ages. Just tell me what to do, Doctor, and I’ll try my best. My knees are usually the worst part. They make a terrible creaking noise. Please try to ignore the noise, if you can.
DOCTOR: Alright, Madame Hughston. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Knees show some mild crepitus with range of motion, consistent with age-related wear and tear. There is mild tenderness to palpation on the medial joint line of both knees, but no significant swelling or instability noted. Range of motion is slightly limited, but within functional limits. Do you experience any pain or stiffness in your knees at rest, or only with activity?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… good, doesn’t it? No murmurs. I’m glad to hear that. The crepitus… is that the noise? Yes, that’s it exactly. It’s mostly when I get up from sitting for a while. And after I’ve been driving all day. It stiffens up, you know? Not terrible pain, just… uncomfortable. A little ache. And sometimes a bit of a wobble when I first stand. But it usually goes away after a few minutes. Old age, I tell you. It’s a terrible thing. But what can you do?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have some typical osteoarthritis in your knees, Madame Hughston. It's very common with age and activity. The good news is that it doesn't sound severe. The fact that the symptoms improve with movement is a positive sign. Now, let’s proceed with the drug screening. We'll need a urine sample. The nurse will provide you with a cup and instructions. It's a simple procedure, and it shouldn't take long. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample. Right. I can do that. I think. Is there… anything special I need to do? Like, drink a lot of water beforehand? I had a cup of tea this morning, does that matter? I’m just trying to remember… I never do these things, you know?
DOCTOR: No, no special preparation is needed, Madame Hughston. You don't need to drink extra water, and a cup of tea won't affect the results. Just a normal urine sample will do. The nurse will guide you to the restroom, and it's a private and confidential process. She'll also explain the process in detail. Do you have any concerns about providing the sample?
PATIENT: No, no concerns. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, I suppose. Old age does funny things to a person. But if it’s necessary for the job, then I’ll do it. Tell me where to find the nurse, Doctor, and I'll get it over with. I’m ready, I think. As ready as I’ll ever be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Madame Hughston. The nurse, Marie, is just down the hall, in room three. She’s expecting you. She will provide you with the cup and instructions. Take your time, and don't hesitate to ask her if you have any questions at all. After you've provided the sample, we can discuss the results and formulate a plan. Don't worry, everything will be alright. Let me know if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go find Marie now. And… thank you again.
