DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Tkac, good afternoon. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lennie Tkac, as you know. I’m here… well, my niece thinks it’s time I look at one of those senior living places. She’s a good girl, very thoughtful. But they want me to get a check-up first, to make sure I’m… suitable. That’s what she called it. Suitable. I bake, you know. Been baking my whole life. That’s what I do. But she worries.
DOCTOR: Baking, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Pies mostly. Apple, cherry, blueberry… sometimes peach if I can get good peaches. And breads. Sourdough is my specialty, takes three days to make it right. I used to sell them at the market, back when I could. It keeps my hands busy, you see. And folks seemed to enjoy them. Though, I haven’t been to the market in… well, quite a while now. Do you… enjoy pie, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tkac, with all due respect, we’re here to discuss your medical suitability for a senior living facility, not your baking prowess, however admirable. While it’s good to keep busy, we need to assess your overall health. Now, let’s start with the basics. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course, Doctor. I understand. Forgive me. It just… it’s a big part of my life. Yes, I have been… generally well. No aches or pains that bother me too much. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, getting up and all, but nothing a good stretch doesn't fix. And my eyesight isn't what it used to be, but I have glasses. I suppose that’s what you mean by “overall health”? Are we checking for… things I don’t feel? My niece worries about those, too.
DOCTOR: We are checking for everything, Mr. Tkac. Stiffness in the mornings… is that in your joints, or more muscle-related?
PATIENT: Mostly in the joints, I think. My knees and my hips, mostly. Gets a bit creaky, like an old door, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… a reminder that I’ve lived a long life. It usually loosens up after I’ve been moving around for a bit. Like greasing the wheels, almost. I do a little walking, when the weather’s good, but it’s not as easy as it used to be. And I used to chop wood for the stove, but… well, that’s someone else’s job now. Does that make sense, Doctor? Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Any pain when you walk?
PATIENT: Not really pain, Doctor. More of a…discomfort. Like a dull ache. It doesn’t stop me from walking, but I don’t go running any marathons, if you know what I mean. And I have to sit down more often than I used to. I used to be able to walk all day at the market, but now… a few blocks and I need to rest. It comes and goes, mostly depending on the weather. Damp days are the worst. Makes everything feel… heavier.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes, yes. Mostly my knees, after a long walk. Not a lot, just… a little puffiness. You have to look closely to see it. It goes down again after I put my feet up for a bit. My niece keeps telling me I should wear those compression socks, but they’re so… uncomfortable. I haven’t tried them yet. Do you think I should, Doctor? It feels like they’d cut off the circulation. Is swelling something bad? I worry about everything, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tkac, let’s focus. We need to gather information to determine what’s going on, not debate compression socks. Yes, swelling can be a sign of something we need to investigate. Now, have you had any injuries to your knees or hips in the past?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. Sorry, Doctor. I do tend to wander. Injuries… hmm. Let me see. When I was a young man, I fell off a horse. Broke my collarbone, but that healed up fine. And I twisted my knee playing football in high school, a long time ago. It was just a sprain, I think. Nothing serious. The doctor at the time wrapped it up and told me to stay off it for a bit. And I’ve had a few bumps and bruises over the years, falling down here and there, but nothing that required a trip to the hospital. Does any of that sound important, Doctor? I try to remember everything, but sometimes… well, time plays tricks on you.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Let me think. The doctor told me, about ten years ago, that my blood pressure was a little high. He put me on a little pill for it. I take it every day, same time. And I have a touch of arthritis, he said. That explains the stiffness, I suppose. Nothing else, not that I recall. I used to go to the doctor regularly, but after my wife passed… well, I haven't been as diligent, I suppose. I should probably be better about that. Does arthritis run in my family, Doctor? I can’t recall. My niece would know more about that. She keeps all the records.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll look at your records. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the one. A little white pill, once a day, every morning with my breakfast. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take some of that over-the-counter ibuprofen. But not every day, just when I need it. And a little vitamin D in the winter, the nurse at the pharmacy suggested it. But that’s it, I promise. I’m not one for taking a lot of pills. I prefer a good cup of tea, if you know what I mean. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I’m trying to be as helpful as I can, but sometimes I forget things.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Certainly. Just give me a moment. There. Not as spry as I used to be, I’m afraid. My knees creak a bit, you’ll hear them. Don’t mind them. They’ve carried me a long way. What would you like me to do, Doctor? Just let me know. I’m happy to cooperate. Is this going to be uncomfortable? My niece always tells me to ask questions, if I’m worried. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just stand still. Alright, now walk a few steps forward, and then a few steps back. Hmm. And can you bend over and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. This is about as far as I can go, Doctor. My back isn’t what it used to be, and my knees protest a bit. Feels like they’re going to pop. I used to be very flexible, you know. Played a lot of sports when I was younger. But time takes its toll, I suppose. Is that bad, Doctor? Should I push myself further? I don’t want to cause myself any trouble. My niece always says I shouldn’t overdo it. She worries about me, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s enough. Now, let's check your reflexes. Hmm. And finally, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me. And another one. Alright. That’s all for now.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That wasn't too bad. Is everything alright, Doctor? What did you find? I do tend to worry, you see. My niece always tells me I’m a hypochondriac, but I just like to be prepared. Are my knees really that bad? And what about my lungs? I used to smoke a pipe, years ago, but I quit a long time ago. Is that still causing trouble? I’m happy to cooperate, Doctor, just let me know what’s going on. And what does all this mean for the senior living place? Will they even take me? I do enjoy my baking, you see, and I’d like to keep busy. Is there anything I can do to improve things?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tkac, let's not jump to conclusions. Your knees show some expected wear and tear for your age, consistent with arthritis. Your lung sounds are slightly diminished, which could be related to your previous smoking history, but nothing alarming at this point. We’ll need some X-rays to get a better look at your knees and a possible chest X-ray to assess your lungs, just to be thorough. I’m going to order those now. As for the senior living facility, that’s ultimately their decision. But we need to have a clear picture of your overall health before they can make an informed one. I also recommend a physical therapy evaluation to help manage your knee pain and improve your strength and mobility. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. X-rays and physical therapy… I can do that. I suppose I should have seen the doctor more often, but… well, life gets in the way, you know? I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. My niece will be pleased to hear that you’re being thorough. She’s very particular about these things. Physical therapy… will that be painful? I don’t like pain, you see. And will the X-rays take long? I have a batch of apple pies in the oven that needs tending to. I’m happy to cooperate, Doctor, just let me know what I need to do. And… when can I expect to get the results of the X-rays? My niece will want to know as soon as possible. She’s very anxious. Is there anything else I should be doing, Doctor? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: The X-rays won’t take long, maybe 15 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. Physical therapy might be a little uncomfortable at first, but it’s designed to help you, not hurt you. They’ll start slowly and gradually increase the intensity. I’m going to write you a referral for physical therapy and a requisition for the X-rays. The receptionist will schedule those for you before you leave. And frankly, Mr. Tkac, while your apple pies are undoubtedly delicious, right now we need to focus on your health. I’ll need you to follow up with me after you’ve had the X-rays and started physical therapy so we can discuss a plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand perfectly. X-rays, physical therapy, follow-up appointment… and focus on my health. You’re right, of course. It’s just… hard to think about anything but my pies sometimes. They’re very good pies, you know. But I’ll try to focus on my health. I promise. And I appreciate your patience, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. The receptionist will schedule everything? That’s good. I don’t like to bother people. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Should I fill out any forms? And… will the physical therapy be covered by my insurance? My niece handles all the insurance stuff, but I like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Yes, the receptionist will handle the scheduling and can answer your questions about insurance. I’ll have her give you some paperwork regarding your rights as a patient. Here. As for now, just try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. And please, Mr. Tkac, focus on your health. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Thank you. You've been very thorough. And… well, thank you for listening to me ramble on about my pies. It's just… it's what I do. I suppose I should be going. My niece will be wondering where I am. She worries, you see. I’ll try to focus on my health, Doctor. I promise. And… perhaps, if I get better, I’ll bake you a pie. An apple pie. They're my specialty. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. .
