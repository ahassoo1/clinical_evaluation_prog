DOCTOR: Right. Hedy Cantoran, 57 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's… this tiredness. Just always tired. And… well, it's embarrassing, but I been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. Sounds crazy, I know.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt… Yes, that is unusual. And how long has this… tiredness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, probably. It comes and goes, but mostly it's there. Hard to say exactly. I just figured it was… getting old, you know? Everyone gets tired. The dirt thing is newer, though. A few months, maybe? Don't make a big deal out of it.
DOCTOR: A few months… and the tiredness for years. Alright. And are there any other symptoms along with the tiredness?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I dunno. I just feel…blah. Everything's harder. Walking, thinking… even talking, sometimes. My stomach's been a little off, now that you mention it. But I eat a lot of strange things, so who knows what that's from.
DOCTOR: “Fatigue, reports difficulty with ambulation, cognition, verbal fluency. GI upset reported.” Alright. And when you say "strange things," could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Ugh, why do you need to know everything? It's just… things. I like… chalk. And sometimes…paper. Not eating it, exactly, more like… chewing on it. And now the dirt. It's not like I'm going around hunting for it, it just… tastes good sometimes. Okay?
DOCTOR: Right. “Pica – reports consumption of chalk, paper, and dirt.” This is…concerning. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite generally?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I'm hungry, don't eat when I'm not. It's not like I'm losing weight or anything. Just… tired. And craving weird stuff. Honestly, I just want to know why I'm so tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Let's see… height 164, weight 84… BMI is a bit elevated. Any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Elevated what-now? Look, I don't know all that doctor stuff. Past medical problems… not really. Had the usual stuff when I was a kid, chickenpox, broke an arm once. Nothing serious. My husband… he had problems, but he's… gone now.
DOCTOR: "No significant PMH reported. Husband deceased." Alright. And any family history of… anything unusual?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean? My mom was always… energetic. Always busy. My dad… he liked to garden. I don't know. We didn't talk about health stuff much. It wasn't something we did.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had allergies. I don't take any pills. Don't like them. Make me feel sick. Just want to get to the bottom of this tiredness, you know? It's ruining my life.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies, no medications. Let's do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a neurological assessment. Please lie down on the exam table.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. It's just a waste of my time, honestly.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. No masses palpated. Reflexes are normal. Motor strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Alright. I'm going to order some bloodwork. Complete blood count, iron studies, vitamin D level, and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also need to check your thyroid function.
PATIENT: Thyroid? What's wrong with my thyroid? Look, are you going to tell me what's going on or just keep poking and prodding and ordering tests? I don't understand all this doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Look, I'm trying to figure out why you're tired. The bloodwork will help rule out several possibilities – anemia, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems. The dirt eating… that suggests a possible iron deficiency. We need objective data before I can tell you anything definitive. It will take a few days to get the results. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? So, I'm… sick? Look, can't you just give me something for the tiredness? A pill or something? I don't want to wait days. I have things to do. And honestly, I don't trust all this bloodwork stuff. It always seems like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: We need to determine the cause of the tiredness, not just mask the symptom. Giving you a pill without knowing the underlying problem could be dangerous. And frankly, your symptoms – the fatigue, the pica – are concerning enough that we need to investigate thoroughly. The nurse will be in shortly to draw blood. I strongly advise you to follow through with the testing. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No! Look, I told you, nothing. I'm perfectly fine, mostly. Just tired. And craving dirt, okay? Is that so hard to understand? I don't want any more tests. This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: I understand you're frustrated, but I am concerned about your health. The pica is a red flag, and dismissing it is not a responsible course of action. While I can't force you to get testing, I strongly advise against it. I'm documenting your refusal. Perhaps a second opinion is warranted. I will have the nurse provide you with a list of local Internal Medicine specialists. .
PATIENT: Fine! Whatever. I don't need your judgment. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Just give me the list and let me go. .
