DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, is just… I does be feeling real thirsty lately. And hungry too. All the time hungry! Is not normal, you know? I eat, and then a little while after, I want more food. And I drinking water like a fish!
DOCTOR: I see. Thirsty and hungry… and this has been happening for how long, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Is start maybe… two, three months now? I not really keep track of days good, but is long time. Is getting worse, though. Before, is just a little extra water. Now… now I have to carry a bottle with me everywhere. And I does be eating things I don’t even like, just because my belly feel empty.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Well, I does be going to the bathroom more often. To pee, you know? And sometimes… sometimes I does feel a little tired. Not all the time, but… yes. A little weak sometimes. Is hard to explain. Is just… not feeling myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination and fatigue… Those are important details. Now, have you experienced any changes in your vision, perhaps blurry vision?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. My sight is not so good anyway, you know? I have glasses. But is not get worse, I think. Is always the same blurry. I does just put them on. Is the thirst and hunger bother me the most, Doctor. Is really strange. I never feel like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any pills. Never had to. Is just… little aches and pains sometimes, you know? Old age. But I don't take nothing for it. I try to rest. And drink lots of water… which is the problem, I suppose!
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like foods or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband, he does get a little rash from mangoes, but I am fine. I never had a problem with anything. Dust bother me a little sometimes, when I cleaning, but is just a little sneeze. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Is not much, Doctor. I born and raise in Trinidad, healthy baby. Had the usual childhood things, you know? Measles, chickenpox. But nothing serious. When I get older, is just the normal things. A little flu sometimes. I never been in the hospital. Never had any big sickness. My husband, he has high blood pressure, but I don’t. I always been strong, usually. Until now.
DOCTOR: Very well. I would like to perform a quick physical examination, Ms. Zicarelli, if you don't mind. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a few other basic checks. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. Is just… I want to know what is happening to me. I does be worrying, you know? I never feel like this before. So, yes. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. Just breathe normally for me. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit… distant. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are normal. And finally, I’m going to quickly check your skin for any signs of dehydration. Skin turgor is a little diminished, which suggests mild dehydration.
PATIENT: Diminished skin… what does that mean, Doctor? Is that bad? And the elevated blood pressure… is that from worrying so much? My husband, he always tell me I worry too much. He say I need to relax more.
DOCTOR: Diminished skin turgor simply means your skin is a little less elastic than it should be, which can be a sign of dehydration. And yes, blood pressure can certainly be affected by stress and anxiety, but it's also important to investigate further. Based on what you've told me and the initial examination, I’m concerned about the possibility of diabetes. The increased thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and mild dehydration are all common symptoms. However, it’s important to remember this is just a preliminary assessment. To confirm this, we need to run some blood tests. Would you be willing to allow me to draw a sample for a glucose level and a complete blood panel?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear… My auntie, she had that. Is a bad thing, right? Is… is it serious? And blood tests… yes, Doctor. If you think is necessary, yes. I want to know what is happening to me. I trust you. But… will it hurt much? I never had much blood taken before.
DOCTOR: Diabetes can be a serious condition, Ms. Zicarelli, but it is also very manageable with proper treatment and lifestyle changes. It's important to catch it early, and that’s why I want to run these tests. The blood draw itself is usually quite quick and doesn’t hurt much. You might feel a small pinch, but it’s over very quickly. We'll take a small sample from your arm. And then we'll send it to the lab, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I would recommend drinking plenty of water, but not excessive amounts, and trying to eat balanced meals. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or diabetes itself?
PATIENT: Balanced meals… yes, I try to. My husband, he does the cooking, mostly. He likes his salt, though! Maybe too much salt. And water… I does drink so much water, Doctor. Is that not good? I thought is good to drink water. And… what happens if is diabetes? Will I have to take pills? Will it hurt? Will I have to change everything?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Ms. Zicarelli. It's good you're thinking ahead. Too much salt can contribute to high blood pressure, so it's something to be mindful of. And drinking water is good, but excessive amounts can sometimes dilute electrolytes, which isn't ideal. If the tests confirm a diagnosis of diabetes, the treatment will depend on the severity of the condition. Sometimes, lifestyle changes—like diet and exercise—are enough. Other times, medication—often in pill form—is necessary to help regulate blood sugar levels. The goal of treatment is to manage your blood sugar and prevent complications. It might require some adjustments to your lifestyle, but it’s very possible to live a full and healthy life with diabetes. Before we proceed, would you like me to explain some of the lifestyle modifications, like a diabetic-friendly diet?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. Tell me about the diet. My husband, he cooks everything. I don’t really know how to cook much. But I can tell him what to buy at the market, if you tell me. What things is good for diabetes? And what things I should stay away from? Is sugar bad? I love a little sweet treat sometimes…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Zicarelli. A diabetic-friendly diet focuses on foods that help keep your blood sugar levels stable. The key is to choose complex carbohydrates over simple sugars. So, things like whole grains—brown rice, whole-wheat bread—are good. Plenty of non-starchy vegetables—broccoli, spinach, lettuce—are excellent. Lean proteins—fish, chicken, beans—are also important. Fruits are okay in moderation, but choose lower-sugar options like berries. Now, foods to limit or avoid include sugary drinks—soda, juice—processed foods—like cakes and cookies—white bread and rice—and foods high in saturated and trans fats. As for sugar… it's best to limit it, but you don’t have to completely eliminate it. A small sweet treat occasionally is okay, but try to choose options with lower sugar content and consider pairing it with a protein or fiber source to slow down absorption. Do you have any questions about these foods?
PATIENT: So, no more cakes and cookies, mostly? That is sad. My husband, he makes a lovely rum cake for Christmas. And I does like a little biscuit with my tea. But brown rice is okay? And chicken? That is good. We eat chicken a lot. And berries… I does see them at the market sometimes. And what about roti? Is roti okay? My husband, he makes lovely roti. We eat that with curried chicken sometimes. Is the curry okay too? It has spices in it. And what about mangoes? I love mangoes… but I heard mangoes is sweet.
DOCTOR: You’re asking all the right questions, Ms. Zicarelli. That’s excellent. Roti, in moderation, is okay. It’s a carbohydrate, so portion control is important. White flour roti should be limited, but whole wheat is a better option. Curry itself is generally fine, as long as it’s not loaded with sugar or oil. Spices are actually beneficial! Now, mangoes… they are delicious, but they’re high in natural sugars. A small slice occasionally is okay, but you’d want to be mindful of the portion size and avoid eating them frequently. Think of it as an occasional treat. It's all about balance and moderation. Instead of completely eliminating foods, focus on making healthier choices and controlling your portion sizes. Would you like me to provide you with a handout that lists diabetic-friendly food choices and portion sizes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, please. A handout would be very helpful. My husband, he does not read very well, but I can look at it and tell him what to buy. And what about drinks? Is tea okay? I drink a lot of tea. And what about water? I does drink so much water, like I told you. Is that alright? And… when will I get the results from the blood tests? I am a little worried, Doctor. But I am trying to be strong.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you go. This handout lists diabetic-friendly food choices, portion sizes, and some helpful tips. Tea is perfectly fine, as long as it’s unsweetened. Water is excellent – continue drinking plenty of water, it’s very important. Avoid sugary drinks like soda and juice. The blood test results should be back within three to five business days. We’ll give you a call as soon as they’re available. I understand you’re worried, but try not to stress too much until we have the results. We’ll go over everything together and discuss a plan, if necessary. For now, focus on making some small changes to your diet and continuing to drink plenty of water. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all for now. Thank you very much for your help. You explained everything very well. And the handout is very useful. I will show it to my husband. I hope I did not bother you too much with all my questions. I just want to know what is happening to me. Thank you again, Doctor Pirl. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Zicarelli. You asked excellent questions, and it’s important to be informed. I’m happy to help in any way I can. Remember, we’ll call you as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to call us if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day as well, Ms. Zicarelli. And please, try not to worry too much.
