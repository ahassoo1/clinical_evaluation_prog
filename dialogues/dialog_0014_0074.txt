DOCTOR: Good morning. Venna Steines, is it?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, that’s me. Just Venna is fine, dear. Can we get this over with? My biscuits won’t bake themselves, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. I understand. We’ll try to be quick. But I need to ask a few questions to understand why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse took my blood pressure and said it was… high. Something about numbers being too big. I mostly just feel tired, I guess. Tired and a little achy, but I’m ninety years old! Achin’ comes with the territory. Doc said I needed to see you about it. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. The nurse alerted me to your blood pressure reading. “Numbers being too big,” as you say, is… a fairly accurate way to put it. We need to investigate that. And while tiredness can be part of aging, it's good we’re checking it out. Now, this high blood pressure...has anyone ever mentioned it to you before?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I recall. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but nobody ever said anything about numbers. Just the usual, “Eat less salt,” and “Get more rest.” Which is hard when you’re bakin’ all day! I mostly just figured I was gettin’ old.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when did you first notice this tiredness, Venna?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a hard one. It’s been creepin’ up on me, I suppose. Maybe… six months ago? Around the time my arthritis started actin’ up real bad. Hard to say what came first, the achin’ or the tired. They kinda go together, now.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s mostly there all the time, a dull kinda feelin’. But it gets worse when I’m standin’ a lot, like when I’m at the counter sellin’ biscuits. Or when it’s real hot. This summer heat ain't helpin' none.
DOCTOR: Okay. And aside from the tiredness and the achiness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Just for a second. And I’ve been havin’ headaches… not real bad ones, just a kinda pressure behind my eyes. That's about it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking anything for the arthritis?
PATIENT: Just some over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, mostly. And sometimes a cream. Nothing the doctor ever gave me, just what I buy at the store. Doesn’t seem to help much anymore, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to take a penicillin when I was a girl, but that was a long time ago. Didn't bother me none.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to take your blood pressure again just to get a baseline. Then maybe we’ll do a quick check of your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds… thorough. Fine, go ahead. Just try to be quick, dear. Those biscuits are callin’ my name.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me. Heart sounds are a bit distant, but regular rhythm. Lungs are clear, but diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, let's check that blood pressure. 160 over 90. As expected. And a little elevated pulse at 88. Okay. Those numbers aren’t ideal, Venna. We need to figure out why your blood pressure is consistently high.
PATIENT: Well, that don’t surprise me none. Like I said, I’m old! What does “consistently” mean? Is it really bad? You’re makin’ me nervous, dear.
DOCTOR: It means the nurse’s reading wasn’t a fluke, and my reading confirms it. And it’s not necessarily immediately dangerous, but uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to more serious problems down the road—heart problems, stroke…that's why we’re addressing it now. To get a better picture of what's going on, I want to run a few basic blood tests. Just to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels…things like that. And I think an EKG would be a good idea to check your heart rhythm. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. I suppose. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles, but… I reckon I can handle it. As long as it don’t take all day. And what about my biscuits? Will this mess up my bakin' schedule?
DOCTOR: It shouldn't mess up your schedule too much. The blood draw and EKG shouldn't take more than half an hour. The results will take a few days to come back, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a few lifestyle changes. Start with reducing your salt intake—easier said than done, I know. And try to get some gentle exercise—even just a short walk each day. And…try not to stress. I know, another easier-said-than-done. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Less salt… that’s gonna be hard. My biscuits need salt! And walkin’… well, I walk around the kitchen all day. Does that count? What about those pills? Do I gotta start takin’ pills now? I don’t like takin’ pills.
DOCTOR: Walking around the kitchen is a good start, Venna, but we're talking about a sustained increase in activity—something that gets your heart rate up a little. As for pills… let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We need to see the results of the tests first. We might be able to manage this with lifestyle changes alone. But depending on the results, medication might be necessary. It’s a possibility, not a certainty. Now, do you have a list of any other medications you’ve taken recently, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just that ibuprofen for my arthritis. And sometimes I take something for a headache, like acetaminophen. Nothing regular, just when I need it. And… oh, sometimes a little something to help me sleep, but only if I’m really restless. It’s an old remedy my grandmother used to give me. It’s got chamomile in it, I think. I don’t even know the name of it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chamomile is fairly benign, but it’s good to know. And ibuprofen and acetaminophen… both of those can actually raise your blood pressure slightly, so it's good we’re keeping track of everything you’re taking. We’ll get these tests done and figure out a plan. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment with my office as soon as possible once you get the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Tests, pills, no salt… It’s a lot to take in. Fine. I'll let the nurse poke me. And I'll schedule the appointment. Just… please, hurry it up. My biscuits are dependin' on me. .
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll do our best. The nurse will be right with you.
