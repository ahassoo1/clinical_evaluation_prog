DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Pfennig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s been…well, I can recall the exact date it started – July 18th, at approximately 2:17 PM, while I was adjusting some rigging for a miniature set. It’s mostly in my left leg.
DOCTOR: That’s very specific – good you’ve been keeping track! July 18th at 2:17 PM, while adjusting rigging… alright. So, the numbness is primarily in your left leg. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I do have a rather detailed memory. It’s…difficult to explain precisely. It isn’t a complete loss of feeling, more of a…dimming. Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn't quite go away completely. And it's not constant. It comes and goes, and seems to be worse after I've been standing for a long time, or, strangely enough, when I’m very focused on my work. It doesn't radiate, it's localized to the front of my left shin, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, a “dimming” sensation, like a foot falling asleep but not complete, localized to the front of your left shin, and it’s worse with standing or intense focus. That's helpful. Does anything relieve the numbness, or make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I believe…yes. When I sit down and elevate my leg, it does seem to lessen. And if I consciously move my toes and ankle – flex and extend them – that helps a little too. Though it doesn't remove it completely, just…reduces the intensity. I hadn’t really thought about what makes it better, to be honest, just what makes it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, sitting and elevating, and ankle/toe exercises help to some degree. That's good to know. Now, just to get a better picture, can you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing along with the numbness?
PATIENT: Let me see… No pain, thankfully. No tingling, like pins and needles. I haven't noticed any weakness in my leg, or any changes in the skin's color or temperature. I did have a bit of cramping in my calf a few days ago, on the same leg, but I attributed that to being dehydrated – I was working outside on a shoot, and it was quite warm. And…well, this is perhaps irrelevant, but I've been feeling a bit more fatigued lately. I thought that was just due to the long hours I’ve been putting in at work.
DOCTOR: No pain, no tingling, no skin changes, some calf cramping potentially related to dehydration, and some fatigue. Okay. Let’s talk about your work a little bit. You mentioned long hours. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I'm a special effects artist and animator, primarily working with miniatures and practical effects. It involves a lot of…detailed work, precise movements, and quite a bit of standing, or being in awkward positions to set up shots. I also do quite a bit of work on a computer, for compositing and rendering. It’s… physically demanding, in a peculiar way. A lot of repetition and holding still for long periods, followed by bursts of activity. It’s rewarding, but I suppose it's not without its toll.
DOCTOR: That does sound physically demanding, in a peculiar way – you’re right. A lot of repetitive movements and static positions. Okay. Let's go over some general health questions, and then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Have you had any previous medical issues?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. No, nothing significant. I broke my wrist when I was a child – skiing accident – but it healed completely. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no allergies. I’m generally quite healthy, I believe. I maintain a fairly active lifestyle outside of work, hiking and fishing when I have the time. And, I have private insurance, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No chronic conditions, no allergies, a history of a childhood wrist fracture that healed completely, and an active lifestyle. Insurance is always relevant. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No medications, no. And no regular supplements either. I occasionally take a multivitamin when I feel I’m not getting enough nutrients from my diet, but it's infrequent. I believe the last time I took one was approximately…March 14th, this year. Just a standard over-the-counter brand. Nothing prescribed, nothing ongoing.
DOCTOR: Okay, infrequent multivitamin use only. Good. Let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a bit trickier. My mother's side…my grandmother had arthritis, quite severe, in her hands. My father's side…he had high blood pressure, as did his father. And…my aunt on my mother's side was diagnosed with diabetes a few years ago, type 2, I believe. Beyond that, not that I'm aware of. My family isn't particularly forthcoming about medical history, to be honest. It's…not a common topic of conversation. But those are the major things I recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis on your mother's side, high blood pressure on your father's side, and type 2 diabetes in an aunt. That's helpful to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I do not smoke. I occasionally drink a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month, but I wouldn’t consider myself a drinker. And I have never used any recreational drugs. I maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned. I find I function best when I’m well-rested and avoid substances that could impair my focus.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's all very helpful information, Tarin. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and sensation in your legs, and take a look at your feet. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Dr. Pfennig. Please proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I trust your assessment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Your reflexes are normal, 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Could you please resist as I try to push your leg down, and then pull it up?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. I'm trying my best to resist. Just let me know if you need me to exert more force. I can apply a significant amount of pressure, if necessary.
DOCTOR: Your strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups bilaterally. That’s good. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes, and tell me when I touch your leg. You have intact sensation to light touch bilaterally. Now, I’m just going to palpate your legs and feet, feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. I don’t feel any significant tenderness or swelling. Your pulses are strong and equal bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your feet. I’m just looking for any signs of skin changes or deformities. Your feet appear normal, no deformities or skin changes noted. Alright, everything seems normal on the physical exam, which is reassuring. Given your specific symptoms – the localized numbness in your left shin, triggered by standing and focus, relieved by elevation and movement – and the normal physical exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible nerve compression issue. It could be related to your work, and the prolonged positions you maintain.
PATIENT: A nerve compression issue… That aligns with my own suspicions, actually. I had considered the possibility myself, given the nature of my work and the specific circumstances under which the numbness occurs. The positions I maintain can be…rather contorted, at times, and prolonged. Is there anything specific I should be looking for, or any particular tests that would confirm that diagnosis? And, what are the typical treatment options for such a condition?
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve been thinking about it. To confirm a nerve compression, the most helpful test would be an EMG and nerve conduction study. It’s a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles and can pinpoint the location and severity of any compression. I'm going to order that test for you today. In the meantime, we can start with some conservative management. That includes avoiding prolonged positions that trigger the numbness, taking frequent breaks to stretch and move around, and wearing supportive footwear. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with any discomfort. We can also discuss some simple stretches you can do at home to relieve pressure on the nerves. Do you have any questions about the EMG, or the conservative treatment options?
PATIENT: An EMG…I believe I’ve heard of that test before. Is there any preparation required beforehand? And, what is the typical recovery time, should a compression be identified? As for the conservative management, that all sounds quite reasonable. I am accustomed to maintaining a certain level of self-discipline, so adhering to those recommendations shouldn’t prove difficult. And, what would be the next steps, should the conservative measures prove ineffective? Would further imaging be required, or would more invasive procedures be considered? I apologize for the barrage of questions, but I prefer to be fully informed.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all. It's excellent you’re so proactive and want to be fully informed. For the EMG, no specific preparation is required. Just be sure to avoid caffeine on the day of the test, and you may want to wear comfortable clothing that allows easy access to your legs. The test itself typically takes about 30-60 minutes. As for recovery, that depends on the severity of the compression. Mild compression often resolves with conservative management within a few weeks to a few months. More severe compression may require physical therapy, or, in rare cases, surgery. If the conservative measures prove ineffective after about 6-8 weeks, we would consider further imaging, such as an MRI, to get a better look at the nerves and surrounding tissues. We would also discuss referral to a physical therapist, who can develop a customized exercise program to strengthen your muscles and improve your range of motion. Surgery is typically reserved for cases where other treatments have failed and there is significant nerve damage. I'm going to order the EMG today, and I'll also provide you with some handouts on stretches you can do at home. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment in 6 weeks to assess your progress. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Dr. Pfennig. Scheduling a follow-up appointment in six weeks is a sensible approach. And providing me with handouts on the stretches is greatly appreciated. I am confident we can manage this effectively. I trust your professional judgment implicitly. Would there be any particular warning signs I should be aware of, that would necessitate seeking immediate medical attention? Perhaps a sudden increase in pain, or a loss of function? I merely wish to be fully prepared.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Yes, definitely. You should seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of the following: a sudden increase in pain, significant weakness in your leg, loss of bowel or bladder control, or numbness that spreads beyond your shin. Those could indicate a more serious condition that requires prompt treatment. Here are the handouts with the stretches. And I'm sending the order for the EMG to the lab now. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Pfennig, I believe you have addressed all of my concerns comprehensively. I am most appreciative of your thoroughness and your willingness to answer my questions patiently. Thank you for your time and your professional guidance. I shall await the lab's contact regarding the EMG appointment. I trust you have a pleasant day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You have a pleasant day as well.
